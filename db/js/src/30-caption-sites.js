  // Caption capture module
  //
  // Three capture paths, all running together:
  //   1) Read existing video.textTracks. If any has cues populated (or we
  //      can force mode='hidden' to populate them), we get the full
  //      transcript with accurate timing — best case.
  //   2) XHR/fetch hook: any response body starting with `WEBVTT` is a
  //      subtitle file. Parse it and push every cue.
  //   3) DOM observer fallback: mirror the on-screen cue container if the
  //      first two miss. This is the only path that needs per-site knowledge.
  //
  // CAPTION_SITES is the configuration surface. This file is served from
  // gh-pages and fetched at runtime, so adding a player or repairing a
  // changed layout is an edit here — no app release.

  //   host          match the site by domain
  //   domProbe      match the site by the presence of this element, whatever
  //                 the domain (players identifiable by their own markup)
  //   domSelector   where the on-screen cue text lives, once matched
  //   cueSelector   optional inner element inside domSelector holding the cue
  //   shrinkSelectors  player frame(s) to shrink for split view
  //   isWatchPage   optional — restrict the sidebar to real video pages
  //   timeParam     optional — the query parameter this player reads a start
  //                 offset from, in whole seconds. Set it and a block sent to
  //                 the webapp links back to the moment the passage starts
  //                 instead of to the top of the video. Leave it out for a
  //                 player with no deep link: a parameter the player ignores
  //                 is worse than none, because the link still looks like it
  //                 should work.
  //   timeLinkOn    optional — a predicate (or a plain false) for pages where
  //                 that link is worth making, for a site whose player is
  //                 timed on some and live on others. It decides the link
  //                 only: `timeParam` is still sent, because naming the
  //                 parameter is what keeps the offset out of the page's
  //                 identity, and an identity that moved with playback would
  //                 de-duplicate against nothing.
  //
  // An entry needs `host` or `domProbe` to match. `domSelector` is only
  // needed for path 3; entries without one still get paths 1 and 2.
