1
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.560
Art - or weirdness.

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.560
Sweden's art history is part of the huge story of our country.

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.120
We will with some impacts show art-

4
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.640
- As depicts changes and creation power.

5
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.680
This is in many ways an outstanding painting.

6
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.720
It is linked to a court party -

7
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.680
–As which took place in 1747–

8
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.640
–In a small social words created in the court circles:

9
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.640
The academia of the small champions.

10
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.640
They devoted themselves to different types of tables, ie.
 Living paintings.

11
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.400
They had readings and poetic performances.

12
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.360
And probably the chicken board has been part of such a table.

13
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.800
Perhaps it could not have been done other than during the time of freedom -

14
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.160
-At the middle of the 18th century.

15
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.800
It is a litigant a period in Sweden.

16
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.360
Crown Prince Adolf Fredrik has married Princess Lovisa Ulrika.

17
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.600
And you put strong confidence in this young couple.

18
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.240
They are culturally interested.

19
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.880
Many cultural projects are gaining momentum in connection with their marriage.

20
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.960
You are working intensively to get the new castle in Stockholm.

21
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.440
One would have been involved at that time.
 Science and culture take great steps.

22
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.120
Freedom and healthy winds blow.

23
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.920
In the construction team at the castle, the first artistic drawer academy starts.

24
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.160
Johan Pasch, who painted the chicken board, is one of the first students.

25
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.360
It's an exciting theme here.

26
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.480
This is the Crown Princess's hoof girls - ie.
 the women from the high nobility -

27
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.920
- which were selected to be in the Crown Princess's courting.

28
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.240
We can also identify several of them.

29
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.680
Ernestine von Griesheim, Henrika Juliana von Liewen, Charlotta Sparre -

30
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.440
--Ul rich and Agneta Strömfelt and Catharina Charlotta Taube.

31
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.480
And the rooster - Count Tessin.

32
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.200
Carl Gustaf Tessin was the heaviest power player of the time, and party fixers -

33
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.320
- And the client of the chicken board.
 He gave himself it in Christmas.

34
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.480
In bathrobe with freshly powdered lid wig nonchalantly placed at the workbench -

35
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.280
- He looks up from a copper stick.

36
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.120
The globe suggests that he sees the whole of Europe as his playground.

37
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.120
One should not throw stone-

38
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.280
-But Mr. Tessin would have had a hard time getting through the metoo movement.

39
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.200
His companion in Paris wrote troubled letters to Tessin's father.

40
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.920
One may wonder about the Father's thoughts when Weslander writes -

41
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.920
- That he is afraid that Carl Gustaf will wear a French disease.

42
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.760
He was some kind of peeping empty figure.
 After all, the whole idea comes from -

43
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.360
- That he has seen how they dress at some time.

44
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.080
And there are stories from Paris-

45
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.600
- If he looks at different ladies through keyholes and stuff like that.

46
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.240
We believe that there is a subtle erotic play in the foundation of the subject.

47
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.400
Erotic or not-the art takes great steps during the 18th century.

48
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.280
Adolf Fredriks and Lovisa Ulrika's son Gustav III founded the Academy of Arts -

49
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.360
- Where Johan Pasch's niece Ulrika becomes the first female member ...

50
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.520
... before women would gain access.

51
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.840
It is a very important break for female artists in Sweden.

52
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.400
Female artists were often hidden in the studios and brothers' studios.

53
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.600
But there was no doubt that there was a female activity.

54
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.080
Yes, if you have been waiting, it is now that they show up in art history ...

55
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.640
... the women.
 The winds of change are on their way.

56
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.680
