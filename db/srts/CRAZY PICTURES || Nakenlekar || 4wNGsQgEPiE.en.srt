1
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,600
Damn which schy tits on that bride.
 Huh?

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,841
She wouldn't mind playing some nude games with.
 Right?

3
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,699
I've been gay.

4
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,599
Huh?

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,375
I've been gay.

6
00:00:29,593 --> 00:00:31,504
I heard what you said, but what the hell do you mean by that?

7
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:35,719
Well, I mean I would rather play nude games with you than with her there.

8
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:37,117
With me?
 What the hell are you gay or?

9
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:38,359
Well, I just said so.

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,736
Maybe not right with you, but I just feel that I don't pallet with all the brides anymore.

11
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:49,596
They are so damn cheerful and everything nagged, and fucking.
 They so damn hard to bring home.

12
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:51,496
I must never lie down.

13
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:55,773
But then think if you start putting on guys instead, ie gays.

14
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:59,000
I mean it's just going out of town and looking up a gay and saying:

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,004
"Hello, we're going to fuck? Yes for the hell" he will say, because he is a guy, horny and gay.

16
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,308
It's Asnice.

17
00:01:07,787 --> 00:01:10,373
But the hell, are you serious?
 No?

18
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,674
But do you turn on guys then?
 It's a damn difference, you know that?

19
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:16,594
You can extinguish too.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,594
I just feel that it is the most practical and logical choice, for me anyway.

21
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,722
So you get gay because of laziness?

22
00:01:22,868 --> 00:01:24,908
Just!
 You could say.

23
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:27,555
I think it is more manner too.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,155
It is damn pretty gay to keep on and dance with the brides just to lie down a bit.

25
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:35,769
Is it too fucking fucking lying with guys?

26
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,331
No, that's not it, I don't think so.

27
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:45,501
It feels more softer, masculine above all.
 Two men .. male.

28
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:55,733
What, so you're kind of excited by me now or?

29
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:58,558
Well...

30
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:00,971
What "well"?
 What is wrong with me?

31
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:02,948
You are flimsy.

32
00:02:03,063 --> 00:02:07,000
Wispy!?
 Well, I'm not fucking fucking?
 I work out at the gym three times a week.

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,276
Well, you do.
 Good.
 Very good.

34
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:16,500
But now that I got gay and everything, then you want some demands.

35
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,125
I mean before, when I was with girls, then I had no requirements at all because it is not possible.

36
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,127
Now you can choose and choose and then you want some requirements.

37
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,229
No fucking guys for me.

38
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:27,800
Fuck off!

39
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,421
Yes exactly!

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,824
I mean him there!
 He for example.
 He could play some nude games with.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
