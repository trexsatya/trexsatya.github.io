1
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:18,600
Damn, that's one nice rack! Huh?

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,841
I wouldn't be opposed to having some fun with her. What do you say, huh?

3
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,700
I've become gay

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,600
What?

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,375
I've become gay

6
00:00:29,593 --> 00:00:31,504
Yes, I heard you, but what the hell do you mean by that?

7
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:35,719
Well, I mean that I would rather have some fun with you instead of, for example, that chick

8
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,118
With me?! Are you fucking queer or what?

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,360
Yeah, that's what I said

10
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:43,736
mean, maybe not with you, but I'm so freaking tired of all chicks

11
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:49,597
They're so fucking hard to please, and just keep on pestering me, and they never put out

12
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:51,497
I never get laid

13
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:55,773
But imagine if you start going for guys instead, I mean fag

14
00:00:56,235 --> 00:01:04,005
I mean, you just have to go out on the street, find a gay guy and say
Hey, do you wanna fuck? Hell yeah, he'll say, 'cause he's a guy, horny and gay

15
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:05,309
It's fucking brilliant

16
00:01:07,787 --> 00:01:10,373
But, for fuck sake, are you serious? No?

17
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,675
But do guys turn you on? It's a big fucking difference, you know that right?

18
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:20,595
Well, you could have the lights off.
I just think it's the most practical and logical choice, for me at least

19
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,723
So you've gone queer out of laziness?

20
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:24,908
Exactly! That's one way to put it.

21
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:33,155
It's more masculine as well, I mean, it's sort of gay to
suck up to and dance with the chicks just to get laid.

22
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:35,770
Come on, it must be a hell of a lot more gay to sleep with guys?

23
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,331
No fucking way it is. I don't think so.

24
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:45,501
It's way cooler, more masculine not at least, two men.

25
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:55,733
So, are you like turned on by me now?

26
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,559
Wellâ€¦

27
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,972
What do you mean "well"?! What's wrong with me?

28
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,949
Come on, you're skinny.

29
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:07,000
Skinny?! Fuck it I'm skinny? I work out three times a week.

30
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:11,276
Yeah. You do. Good for you

31
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:16,500
But now that I'm gay and everything, I mean, now it's possible to raise the bar a bit

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,125
Before, when I slept with girls, there was no way being picky

33
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:24,127
Now I can pick and choose

34
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,230
No skinny boys for me

35
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:27,800
Fuck off!

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,422
Exactly!

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,824
That guy! For instance. I wouldn't mind having some fun with him
