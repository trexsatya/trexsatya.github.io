00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.560
In tonight's section of Ifs, quiz about all culture in Sweden:

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.960
The character chameleon from Botkyrka, Thanos Fotas.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.120
Who is she?
 Her name is Jwan Rassuli.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.640
If you cross Angola and Degeberga you get Petrina Solange.

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.920
All of Sweden's Habibi: Mr Slick - Ricky Rich.

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.520
She runs humor ping pong between Gbg and London: Evelyn Mok.

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.760
Farstabarn on the Grammys and Gold Bag plane: Jelassi.

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.920
One-man troll factory: Hanif Bali.

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.760
And back in public service in a humor rum: Kodjo Akolor.

10
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.920
Last but not least - our program manager Ahmed Berhan.

11
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.120
Welcome to IFS, your favorite program's favorite program.

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.080
This is our fantastic competitors: Isabell!

13
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.520
At green we have Christer.

14
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.880
And at the far end we have Joakim.

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.360
This quiz goes so that the contestants choose one in the panel -

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.640
- As they ask another question, then they will decide if the panelist is lying.

17
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.640
Christer, you start the evening.

18
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.320
When I met Christer, he said, "Fun to be here."

19
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.880
"I was going to have a fly, but didn't want to be nicer than you."

20
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.840
You can choose one in the panel.
 Who do you want to talk to?

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.760
- Then we are investing in Kodjo.
 - You said I would be allowed to participate here.

22
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.000
- I thought I would stand there.
 - I thought that too.

23
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.240
You are the first from Vallentuna in the panel.

24
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.720
No one in the audience knows where it is.

25
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.400
The first from Vallentuna sitting in something.

26
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.440
- In addition to inside.
 - Hey!
 Zing.

27
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.640
Kodjo, if you eat ISKU Dhex Karis, what do you eat then?

28
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.000
Honestly, it is an Icelandic dish where you mix different types of fat:

29
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.200
Election fat, dolphin fat, sometimes shark fat.
 In a pot, down into the soil, fermenting.

30
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.360
Then you eat it.
 I don't want to say Geggga, for the Icelanders who look.

31
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.160
- But like a sauce, I can say.
 - I think it sounds ...

32
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.360
I've never heard of it.

33
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.200
You are a lot to speak truth, so I think you are lying.

34
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.000
- What the hell happened, Christer?
 - You think Kodjo is lying?

35
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.600
-Yes.
 - Drying.
 Congratulations to a point.

36
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.040
Neither Icelandic nor anything from Game of Thrones.

37
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.600
Isku Dhex Karis is a Somali dish: potatoes, meat and lots of spices.

38
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.680
- Joakim, time for you to shine.
 - Then we run Evelyn.

39
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.280
-Hello!
 –EVeryn ...

40
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.840
It is ... it is the countries that Swedes go to the most on holiday -

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.880
- And also the countries that top the list of countries with the most sex tourism.

42
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.480
So ... coincidence?
 I don't know.

43
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.480
Also the countries where I do best at Tinder.

44
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.800
What are you saying?
 Spain, Germany, Dominican Republic and Thailand.

45
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.520
- I think it's false.
 -You think Evelyn is lying.

46
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.400
Joakim, unfortunately no points for you.

47
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.680
It's true.
 Evelyn is popular on Tinder-

48
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.880
“But it is also the countries that are in the top of the world for sex tourism.

49
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.080
"Sex sells" apparently also applies to the travel industry.

50
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.160
What else does Germany have to offer?

51
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.480
Isabell, welcome into the match.
 Who do you choose?

52
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.440
I think Ricky Rich and I ... it will be good.

53
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.720
-Yes.
 Can you trust me?
 - I trust that it will be good.

54
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.880
Oh, oh, oh, she looked at you and called you Habibi.

55
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.960
Ricky, time for image question.
 Sadibou Sy is a Swedish-Senegalesian Fighter-

56
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.160
- As recently became world champion in MMA in PFL.
 But what else makes him unique?

57
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.920
He is not only the first Swede who won a world title in MMA -

58
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.160
- He is also the youngest ever.

59
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.360
So, Shunon just got ... Shunon is only 16 bast.

60
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.640
- He is still alive?
 -Yes.

61
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.400
I love that she paused the game to correct your Swedish.

62
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.400
Then I am.
 He looked ... pretty young.

63
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.640
-Yes.
 Yes, but I believe in you.
 - You believe in Ricky Rich.

64
00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.440
- Sadobou Sy is 16 years old.
 - It doesn't feel that way ...

65
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.480
Isabell has never heard the phrase "Black Don't Crack".
 - Unfortunately ...

66
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.760
- No point.
 It's false.
 - Attach.
 I who believed in you.

67
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.080
Isabell can work at the Migration Board.

68
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.760
- I may submit an application.
 -What are you saying?

69
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.920
"What do you say, Ahmed? Are you ten years? Absolutely."

70
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.320
You are ten years old and have three children.
 Great!

71
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.480
- Some work quickly.
 - Sadibou is definitely not 16.

72
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.560
He is actually 36 years old.
 What makes him stand out as fighter-

73
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.680
- Is he only has 40 % of his view left.

74
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.600
- Cheriters.
 Will it be another point?
 - I drive at Jelassi.

75
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.320
YES!
 I believe in you.
 We have discussed that.

76
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.520
Jelassi ... IKEA received criticism in connection with the launching new products -

77
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.480
- In Saudi Arabia.
 What was that about?

78
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.160
Arabs are very proud of names.
 My name is Fatima Linnéa.
 What the fuck?

79
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.480
In any case, they replaced the names of the products.

80
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.720
Type the bookshelf Billy was Mohammed.

81
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.600
Kajsa ... type some sink Kajsa became Khala.

82
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.960
They simply replaced all names.
 For example, Stockholm became Riyadh.

83
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.400
–And, yes ... it continues.
 --Hm ...

84
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.040
Yes, it's a pretty good ... explanation, but it knows damn ...

85
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.200
- Arabs stick to the names.
 -I've heard...

86
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.160
I recognize that it has been something, but can't touch if it was.

87
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.360
I thought you would say "I actually know of Saudi Arabia".

88
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.680
-What are you saying?
 -No I do not think so.

89
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.720
You choose not to believe in Fatima Linnéa.

90
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.600
Congratulations, Christer, you've got one more point.

91
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.760
In the catalog that was launched there in 2012–

92
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.680
- Ikea removed almost all women, including
 A girl who did homework.

93
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.640
"Ew, a girl learning!"

94
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.800
For those who believe that Ikea understood the criticism - absolutely not.

95
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:33.040
For 2017, a similar catalog for Orthodox Jews came in Israel.
 Inga Gäris.

96
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.520
Poor us girls, then.
 You do chaos with us in society.
 Honestly.

97
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:44.600
- Why do you remove our faces?
 - No one hears us.
 We are edited away.

98
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.160
Najs.
 Congratulations, Christer, another point.
 Awesome work.

99
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.200
Joakim, let's jump into the scoreboard.

100
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.440
- Now we want a point.
 Petrina.
 - Petrina, time for a picture question.

101
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.280
It must be in Belgium where pedophiles hang out these teddy bears -

102
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.520
- To show that it is busy in the basement.

103
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.920
Nämen, me ...

104
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.040
There are so many who want to laugh, but I hear how they suffocate it.

105
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.640
We will all burn in hell.

106
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.280
No, it is in Albania you hang them out to scare away evil spirits.

107
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.880
If I was an evil spirit, it would have worked.
 These are terrible teddy bears.

108
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.760
Albania?
 Yes...

109
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.600
It could be true, but I didn't really think ...

110
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.640
... the houses looked like my performance of what Albanian house looks like, so ...

111
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.000
- But I think you are lying.
 - Then the houses did not look like in Albania?

112
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.560
–Yes.
 - not p.g.a.
 The sickest tradition?

113
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.720
It was the architecture that was wrong.

114
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.760
- Unfortunately, no points now either.
 -No!

115
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.040
It's true.
 It is an Albanian way to scare away evil spirits.

116
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.680
And all the tourism, if you ask me.
 What Petrina said was true.

117
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.840
- Isabell, should we catch a point?
 -I think so.

118
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.080
- Who do we do it?
 –Hanif.

119
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.200
-Good choice.
 - I like your shirt.

120
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.440
Hanif is a statistician in Hawaii Five-0.
 - Hanif ...

121
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.360
They are all too nice to pay taxes.

122
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.640
No, but they all have through different stages in history seen -

123
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.200
- As a threat to the security of the kingdom, and treated like crap.

124
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.560
Therefore, they have now received a consolation award and are national minorities.

125
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.720
"National Minorities" is the answer?

126
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.320
You wanted to answer that they were too stingy to pay taxes?

127
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.400
I feel I trust you.
 It's the shirt.

128
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.760
You trust Hanif?

129
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.320
Awesome work, you've got your first point.
 It's true.

130
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.480
There are five national minorities in Sweden: Roma, Sami, Jews -

131
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.120
- Sweden finds and towers.

132
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:46.640
Sick that no nationality that is here is seen as a threat to the security of the kingdom.

133
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.160
What happens in Tornedalen?
 Why are they ...?
 Have you missed something?

134
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.560
Quite frankly, I didn't even know they existed, before this.

135
00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:01.840
When I heard Tornedalen ... "I've seen the story of the ring. Who were they?"

136
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.680
- Cheritr, you've had good flow.
 -Thanos.

137
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.120
Check out the man, confidence on top!

138
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.400
-How are you brother?
 - Just good, brother.

139
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.560
Otuz Bir means 31 in Turkish, but it's also hose.
 For what?

140
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.440
It is a hose for masturb.

141
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.480
In Turkish culture it is "to draw a 31st".

142
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.720
1, 2, 28, 29, 30 ...

143
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.920
Strong or mild sauce?

144
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.200
Rice, bulgur or french fries?

145
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.520
Right now I wonder why I chose you.

146
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.480
I believe in you.

147
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:03.840
You choose to believe in Thanos, that Otuz Bir is a hose for a hand trolley.

148
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Christer, you've just trolled on a new point.
 Congratulations!

149
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.840
It's true.

150
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.760
Otuz Bir is a hose to jerk.

151
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.040
Otuz Bir Geçmek is Turkish and means "31 moves".

152
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.240
Do you know how many guys will start counting?
 1, 2, 3, 4 ...

153
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.440
"I can jerk COK quickly, me!"

154
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.960
I get all Turkish issues.
 I will not be able to go to Fittja.

155
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.240
I want your class trip to go up.

156
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.760
Is it too late to leave the program?

157
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.400
Christer, congratulations to points.
 Full pot.
 - Joakim, on to you.

158
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.800
- Sista the chance to score.
 -This is it.

159
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.440
- Jwan.
 -Yes.
 Yes.

160
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.560
All three words mean prostitution in Kurdish, Arabic and Persian.

161
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.080
It is from there the English word ho comes from - from Hookah.

162
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.160
Oh ... yes ... I don't have the faintest idea.

163
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.480
No, that's why you're here.

164
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.320
What are you saying?
 Do you think Nargile, Hookah and Shisha mean the same thing:

165
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.720
-Prostitution.
 - I believe in you, Jwan.

166
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.160
Kindly.

167
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.560
- You choose to believe in Jwan.
 –Yes.

168
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.880
Unfortunately, you made it wrong. It's false.
 You also heard the audience:

169
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.600
“Yeah ...”

170
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.800
"Joakim ..." Nargile, Hookah and Shisha mean the same thing all three:

171
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.000
Hookah.
 Dear child has many names.

172
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.440
It was an Iranian who invented the hookah in India in the 16th century.

173
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.720
- It's always Iranians.
 - Don't start now!

174
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.000
Don't start!

175
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.160
Isabell, it's your turn now.

176
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.360
And as you notice, all panelists are consumed.

177
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.960
This means that your next panelist will be randomly selected.

178
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.240
We like this.
 It went great last.

179
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.680
Hanif, in 1996, took place the first kebab riot in Stockholm.

180
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.120
What was that about?

181
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:48.240
Thanos put extra garlic sauce on the kebab and then became the worst fight.

182
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.120
No, it wasn't.
 It was the big kebabintifadan.

183
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.560
Two Palestinian brothers lowered the price of kebabs against each other all the time.

184
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:03.520
In the end, the kebab was as cheap.
 It was the big kebab.

185
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.200
I don't know, but your shirt is very beautiful.

186
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.760
- I trust you again.
 - I think Isabell has taken mushrooms.

187
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.680
She looks at Hanif's shirt.
 "It's amazing! It feels like hot air."

188
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.320
- You choose to believe in Hanif?
 -Yes.

189
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.680
You know what?
 Go on your feeling, because it gives you another point - so congratulations!

190
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.920
It's true.
 The large kebab brawl 1996 was about two kebab stands -

191
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.360
- which was driven by two brothers.
 As a result, they basically gave away kebabs.

192
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.120
Or as we call it: The Good Old Days.

193
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.320
A huge applause to Joakim that does not move on to the final round.

194
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.400
An even bigger applause to our finalists, Isabell and Christer!

195
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.520
This is what we should do now: It's about coming first to five.

196
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.920
What is different is: If you answer wrong, the point goes to the opponent.

197
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.520
- Isabell starts.
 -Oh.
 I choose Petrina.

198
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:23.400
Petrina, 2022 created a library book controversy in Gothenburg.
 Why?

199
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.920
There were no pictures.
 No, but it was a book that contained IS propaganda.

200
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.120
It said that people who wanted democracy would die.

201
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.200
You got tips on how to create a caliphate.
 But no evil-

202
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.200
- Which has nothing to do with it, it is the most read book in Gothenburg.

203
00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.560
No, but it was the IS propaganda that was controversial.

204
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.120
-I trust you.
 It's true.
 - You love to trust people.

205
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.280
- Yes, I'm a little blue -eyed.
 - You choose to trust Petrina.

206
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.760
Do you know what it means?
 You get points.

207
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.120
-Cruelly.
 -It was a book with IS propaganda ...

208
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:11.360
... at a library in Gothenburg.
 10 times it was lent out before it was removed.

209
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.600
If you return the book, can you see who borrowed it?

210
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.320
Those people are on a very special list.

211
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:26.360
- Sick to return the books.
 - Jihadists are law -abiding.

212
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:32.360
"It's haram to twist, habibi. Here."
 - Congratulations on the point, Isabell.

213
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.200
–Evelyn.
 - Hi, Christer!

214
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.520
Hi, Evelyn!

215
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.760
Evelyn ...

216
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.280
It was an English newspaper that wrote an article where the heading read:

217
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.160
"Mr. Tegnell - Sexiest Corona Expert On Earth."

218
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.520
"At Least If You Ask the Swedes."

219
00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.240
It was the most shared English article about Sweden.

220
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.520
He was on TV every day for two years.

221
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.600
I love that you decide on whether you think Tegnell is good looking or not.

222
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.440
- "He was on TV" ... - I have already decided.

223
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.840
Evelyn is nicer.

224
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.200
I think you speak ...

225
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.040
- I think you speak the truth.
 -Thanks.

226
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:33.240
You choose to believe in Evelyn.
 This means that the score goes to Isabell.

227
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.640
-No!
 Oh ... —Sorry, Christer.

228
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.840
The article was about a man from Australia who went to Sweden -

229
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.480
- To remove parts of their ears for aesthetic reasons.

230
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.600
The article was shared 2.5 million times.

231
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:57.960
He left Australia?
 He could only have bathed with a shark?
 Or?

232
00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.720
I have no idea why he went here to operate.

233
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.080
He removed type the entire back of the ear.

234
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.320
All doctors in Australia said no, but one in Sweden: "Come. It's quiet."

235
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.480
Thank you the Moderates as privatized health care.

236
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.280
Let's move on.
 Isabell, you have 2 p, we'll see if you get a third.

237
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.280
- What do you choose?
 - I think I choose Kodjo.

238
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.680
Hurray!
 Hello.

239
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.000
--Codjo ... - Hi.

240
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.520
A picture from when I started on radio.
 That's what Sweden looked like then.

241
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.160
It is actually Gustav Badin, known as Couchi when he came here.

242
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.560
He was given as a gift to Queen Lovisa Ulrika in the 18th century.

243
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.760
He became her servant.
 Then he was released and worked as a freight.

244
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.960
He has made the same trip as you.

245
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.560
- What did you say his name was?
 - Gustav Badin.

246
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.760
- She thinks it's you in the picture.
 - "What did you say you were called?"

247
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.200
- What do you say, Isabell?
 -I do not believe that.

248
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.480
You think it's false.
 - The point goes to you, Christer.

249
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.760
-Is it true?
 -Yes.

250
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.960
Gustav Badin from the Danish Caribbean was given as a gift to Lovisa Ulrika -

251
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.400
- Who adopted him and had him as a valet.

252
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.920
He was the best friend with Bellman.
 Behind every large, white man who knows music -

253
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.000
- There is a small, black man who wrote the shit.

254
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.360
- What do you think wrote the Bellman joke?
 --That's what I'm saying!

255
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.560
Every time he came to the castle: "It was a German, a Danish and Bellman."

256
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.800
"You won't believe what the Swedes did."
 - Better luck next time.

257
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.560
- CHRISTERS, we continue with you.
 –Hanif.

258
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.080
So you know who is a guy or a girl.

259
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.680
No, I'm serious.
 In Thailand they have many who change the sex.

260
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.000
And then you want to know who really is a guy or a girl.

261
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.280
- They are good at makeup.
 - Hanif has been in Thailand.

262
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.320
Therefore, they put a ring in the ID actions that are pink or blue-

263
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.560
- So you know what you are going home with.

264
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.480
Yes, you, it was a damn good explanation.

265
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.360
But now I'm sitting in the shit again.

266
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.920
Consider when you were in Phuket -74.

267
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.080
No, I ... no.

268
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.360
-What are you saying?
 -You're lying.
 It's false.

269
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.920
Christer says Hanif is lying.
 - Christer, you got a point.

270
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:10.360
It's false.
 One is assigned a color, because each day has a color -

271
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.640
- Enough Thai tradition, so the weekday you are born becomes your happiness color.

272
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:20.360
Do they have a color for each day?
 Are there 365 colors?

273
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.840
7 days a week.
 What's with you?

274
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.040
- We cut it away later.
 -No.
 It's the trailer.

275
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.680
-Isabell ... —ya.

276
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.200
You're so cute.
 "Is that my turn?"
 It is your turn.
 What do you choose?

277
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.560
I feel like ... Thanos.

278
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.720
-Thanos.
 –Yes.

279
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.440
There is a tradition, because they lived like "out in the woods" before.

280
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.960
- Then the dad tore ... - before?

281
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.000
-Thanos.
 - He is tearing off the sweater.

282
00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.960
He struggles in pieces for the baby to be swept into it.

283
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:07.200
It is an ancient Serbian tradition.
 He feels "she has given birth to the baby" ...

284
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.320
Then when his macho ego is gone, then only ...

285
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.800
It feels a bit strange, but when the child comes out of the mother -

286
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:28.760
- So maybe it needs a little ... some of the dad, so it should feel at home.

287
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.920
So I think it can be true, though it sounds very false.

288
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.800
- I think it's true.
 –Din logic is incredible:

289
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.680
True, though it's false.
 And do you know what?
 It gives you one more point.

290
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.120
True.
 It is a tradition to tear off the shirt to wrap the child.

291
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:56.240
Nowadays you bring several shirts and sweaters.
 It is a congratulations.

292
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.720
So that more people can do it.
 Only Serbs can make a birth male.

293
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.920
- Drying.
 - Christer.
 - Jelassi.

294
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.800
It is an Albanian blood revenge.

295
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.120
An ancient word that was used in the past.
 Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

296
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.560
- Valle Shota.
 Shota ... - It sounds more like a shot.

297
00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.520
- Yes ... - but ...

298
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.960
- Valle Shota.
 Yes ... - it sounds aggressive.

299
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:37.080
- It sounds very ... exciting.
 -"Exciting."
 Swedish diplomacy.

300
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.200
It sounds like Albanian diplomacy.
 Now Thanos woke up.

301
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.720
- But, yes ... the name, I drive on it.
 - You think it's true?

302
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.960
-Yes.
 - Valle Shota is about revenge.

303
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.200
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

304
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:09.640
Unfortunately, Christer.
 The point goes to Isabell.
 It's false.

305
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.800
There is an Albanian blood revenge tradition, but it is called Gjakmarrje.

306
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.960
Albaner, don't shoot me for the pronunciation.
 Valle Shota is a nice folk dance.

307
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.920
It is seen at a wedding.
 It is also called the duck dance.

308
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.840
- Now, Isabell, it is very exciting.
 -Yes.

309
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.160
You don't know why?
 Right now it is 4-2 to you.

310
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.440
If you answer correctly now, you have won.

311
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.640
Aha!
 Yes...

312
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.800
Who do you choose to put your card on?

313
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.000
- I choose Jwan.
 - Jwan.
 You should get a video question.

314
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.760
This is a Norwegian news feature from the toughest ghetto in the Nordic region.

315
00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:02.080
- But what is it about?
 - About our king, Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

316
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.280
It is a news report from the Norwegians, because they felt -

317
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.440
- That Zlatan humiliated them by not running a training match with them.

318
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.640
- They made a report on Zlatan.
 - Are you a big football fan?

319
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:29.440
No, but I have for myself somewhere that I have heard this clip before.

320
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.920
But this particular clip I think is not about Zlatan.

321
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.120
So I think that's not true.
 But I don't know what it was about.

322
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.400
You just need to answer true or false.

323
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.880
- It's false.
 - It's false?
 We look at the clip.

324
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.760
I'll cut his tongue.
 Cut ears.

325
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.880
I'll do chaos with him.

326
00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.480
Isabell, you have not only received points but won the entire competition.
 Congratulations!

327
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.200
Come, Isabell.
 Come.

328
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.520
A large applause for our winner.

329
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.640
Here you have your IFS diploma.
 And here you have your price - a shisha.

330
00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:25.200
One stands applause to our winner.
 A large applause to our competitors.

331
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.520
Our fantastic panel.

332
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.800
To all of you who looked at home, thank you so much!
 See you again soon.

333
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.600
-What a thing.
 -It is perfect.

334
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.800
You know what to do with it.

335
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.640
