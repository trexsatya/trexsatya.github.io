1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,120
If you want to share an opinion, 
write a letter to the editor of a paper.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,360
Have a clear thesis and be subjective, 
since it's all about your opinion.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,680
Get the readers' attention. Convince 
them you're right by using arguments.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,960
Anyone can send a letter to the editor.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,360
Whether or not it gets published 
is up to the paper.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,320
Keep this in mind 
when you're writing a letter to the editor.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,120
Have a clear theme throughout to make 
your line of thought easier to follow.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,880
Weigh arguments 
against counterarguments.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,040
If you think some people may not agree 
with you, explain why you're right.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,040
Finish your letter by reconnecting 
to the beginning of it.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,560
Use that to urge the readers 
to take action.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,680
Sign it using your name or a signature 
to give your letter a personal touch.
