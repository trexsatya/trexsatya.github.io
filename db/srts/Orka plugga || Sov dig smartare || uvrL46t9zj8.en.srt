1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,160
Sleep yourself smarter. 
Yes, you heard right.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,800
If you get sufficient good-quality sleep-

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,920
-you can actually become smarter, 
because sleep affects learning-

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,520
-and performance.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,280
But why do we sleep?

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,160
You could say 
sleep is the price for being awake.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,760
When you're awake, 
your brain is fully engaged.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,880
It's exposed to a constant flow 
of new sensations-

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,440
-whether it wants to be or not.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,360
Sleep is the body 
and brain's chance to recharge-

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,520
-and create the right conditions to face 
the next day and learn new things.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,360
Sleep is like a superpower-

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,200
-which maximizes your brain 
in different ways.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,120
1. Strengthens Memory

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,080
During sleep, the brain sorts 
and processes impressions-

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,320
-and information received during the day. 
Things that are important to remember-

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,200
-are moved from short-term 
to long-term memory.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,200
You can help the brain 
know what's important to save-

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,080
-by repeating the info several times 
during the day-

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,120
-such as when studying vocabulary.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,760
REPEAT

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,000
When we sleep, memory is strengthened 
and information is saved.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,080
2. Your Brain is Purged 
and Cleaned

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,080
Your brain is like a hard drive.

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,680
Information the brain judges unimportant 
will be erased-

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,920
-so there's room for new information.

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,120
During the day, 
debris builds up in the brain-

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,800
-which must be removed 
for optimal brain function.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,320
3. Emotions Are Defused

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,240
During REM sleep, 
difficult feelings and impressions-

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,520
-received during the day 
are processed and defused-

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
-which helps you handle them better 
and become balanced.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,880
This leads to better concentration-

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,680
-because you can focus better 
and not be controlled by impulses.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,560
4. Strengthens Creativity

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,600
During REM sleep, 
your creativity is strengthened-

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,480
-because the brain opens up 
and is allowed to associate freely.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,720
Old memories are connected to new. 
The brain sees how things are related-

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,080
-and comes up with new solutions 
and ideas.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,000
You may have heard the expression: 
"Sleep on it."

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,520
But for this to work properly, 
you need to get sufficient sleep.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,960
For teenagers, 
that means at least eight hours.

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
Sleep consists of cycles 
of 90 to 120 minutes.

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,840
Each cycle 
has four different stages of sleep-

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,320
-which are equally important 
for your brain.

46
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,800
We need to sleep through a number 
of sleep cycles for effective sleep.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,200
Quality of sleep is as important 
as getting enough sleep.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,800
To make your sleep as good as possible, 
so that it has all of the important stages-

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,160
-we need to follow 
our natural circadian rhythm.

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,600
Man's biological clock is programmed 
to sleep when it's dark-

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,000
-and be awake during the day.

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,840
Reversing the clock worsens sleep 
as well as a number of bodily processes-

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,280
-which can lead to poorer health 
and performance.

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,520
Tips for better sleep:

55
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,440
Keep it as dark and cool as possible 
in the room where you sleep.

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,480
Do nothing in bed other than sleep. 
The brain is highly associative-

57
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,760
-and this helps it 
associate the bed with sleep.

58
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,720
Spend a lot of time in the daylight.

59
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,400
It affects your internal clock 
and makes you sleepier at night.

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,120
Avoid using your mobile or computer 
right before going to sleep.

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
With their blue light, 
mobiles and other screens-

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
-trick the brain into thinking it's daytime.

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Spend time in the daylight. 
It can help compensate-

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,240
-and reduce the negative effect 
of the blue light.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,640
Try switching the screen to "night mode," 
so it has a more yellow, warmer light.

66
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,200
Sleep well!
