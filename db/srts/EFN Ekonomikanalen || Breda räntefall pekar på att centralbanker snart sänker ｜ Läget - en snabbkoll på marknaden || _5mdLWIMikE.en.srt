1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06.440
Sweden, we are in recession.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08.960
Yes, what do we mean by recession?

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,320
In this case we use the US definition: two on each other the following quarter-

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:23,240
-With negative GDP growth. So the outcome was after Q2 and yesterday we got figures for Q3.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:31,520
But how dramatic is this? It is expected and the economy is quite divided.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,040
The construction sector, especially housing construction falls strong-

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,280
-houses hold harder in the wallet, but the export sector goes well-

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45.440
-And investment in business otherwise tough.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,240
The economy is cooled. Is the Riksbank's job thus over? It's not certain.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,080
Inflation indicators still point in the wrong direction.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,480
Companies' price height plans have arrived. In spite of the recession-

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,520
-Plan companies to continue to raise prices more than have been historically done.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,800
The inflation struggle is not over yet.

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,680
The inflation threat is not over, I say, but the market believes.

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:30,160
We see broad, large interest rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden. It also applies to expectations-

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,680
-At Central Banks' interest rate changes in the future. Now it is expected by the market-

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,960
-That Fed and ECB will lower before the summer and the Riksbank this summer.

18
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,720
What makes the decision becomes inflation development.

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Should we look at the companies' price plans or do a cooled economy make the decision?
