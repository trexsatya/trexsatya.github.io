1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
Then the day came. The 328th and last program of EFN Market.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,760
Today we will remember, reflect and try to get to a dignified finish-

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,960
-To one of the world's most popular television programs.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,600
Warm welcome to the closing program!

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,000
Almost four years ago, EFN Ekonomikanal launched a brand new stock program.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,880
The idea was to do something that would reach a wider audience-

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,880
-An the usual "stock exchange audience".

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39.040
The result saw the light of day on February 3, 2020.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,480
Warm welcome to the first episode of EFN Market on February 3.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48.560
-Do you have premiere nerves, Albin? -Yes, they're outside.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,920
What kind of program?

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,800
A program on investments that we broadcast each day's day 11.55.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,800
Now we sit here 300 programs later.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03.040
It is the very last program of EFN Market.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07.840
-We have dressed us up. -I go like this every day.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
As if we come from a James Bond casting.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,400
-I'm not a Bond bride. -Are you the villain?

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,840
It's done. Rather the villain.

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,240
The years have passed, what memories do you have?

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,600
Many ... I remember when we started creating EFN market.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,000
We were tasked with the responsible publisher to create a new program from Scratch.

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,440
I remember all good meetings we in the team had.

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,720
We chopped ideas, chopped, pondered, threw in the trash and started over.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:55,320
It was very fun. It was just as fun that creation lived for almost four years.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,600
I have two hats on me.

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02.240
The strongest memory is when I test played-

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04.800
-To become the program manager for EFN Market.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,480
It was sickly nervous.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,360
It has almost deleted all other fantastic memories.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,200
-Do you were so nervous? -It was so strong.

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,600
It came to me, the opportunity to actually start.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,320
Then you have followed all these incredible programs-

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,200
-And the response you have received in town by everyone who loves EFN market.

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36.560
It made me think of my test filming before the program-

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,600
-Then I spent on Albin.

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
He was told to ask some "curveballs", difficult questions.

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,920
-It was fun and memorable. -And traumatizing ...?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,400
I still remember it, so something was ...

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
I think I had to interview a guest.

40
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57.040
I do not remember. So traumatized I was.

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00.600
-Albin got to play guest. -Was that you...?

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06.600
In honor of the day, we have produced statistics on how things have gone over the years.

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,840
We have had 264 guests and made 328 programs.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,160
-Not bad. -Wow!

45
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,680
Awesome that we have had so many guests.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,920
Not only have a small number rolled.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,400
There have been an incredible number of guests over the years.

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,880
Imagine we scouted 264 guests, called and got them here.

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,640
Really not bad.

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,480
Guess how many broadcast hours of EFN market we have done?

51
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,400
I guess 110.

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,960
125.

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,960
We check the facts ...

54
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,200
-Oh oh oh! -Do you cheat?

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,840
I counted a little logical.

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,120
Was the EFN market farther from the beginning?

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,160
It has always been around 15-20 minutes.

58
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09.560
-I thought it came from stock exchange lunch ... -it was 15.

59
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,280
Sometimes EFN market has been up to 20. So it's been a little longer.

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,000
Then there have been some "curveballs". Some section has been 30-40 minutes.

61
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:27,080
-Ny balls some "curveballs" ... -I took Christian's expression.

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,640
In the beginning we broadcast every day. Now it is twice a week.

63
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,320
We also have statistics on the guests who have been most in the program.

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:46,080
-I know the answers, so you have to guess. -The fitted quiztime.

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49.840
Do you have any person? We'll get a list.

66
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,120
Uh ... look, now we got ...

67
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,720
Frida Bratt, Christina Nyman and Anna Svahn.

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00.800
Who do you guess in place number 3?

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04.960
-Then I guess ... oh, hard. -Princhorn?

70
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,960
No. I guess Maria Landeborn.

71
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,000
-What are you saying? -Erik sprinchorn.

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,280
We check the facts. Shared second place between Eric Strand and Carl Armfelt.

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,760
-I was not far from there. -Armfelt is almost sprinkler.

74
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,920
They run fund together.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,680
Then we have place number 1 left. What do you guess?

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,280
I try Landeborn again.

77
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,320
Who else could it be? I really do not know.

78
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,600
-Ah, we check. -Yes.

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,360
-It was Maria Landeborn! -How could you know that?

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,280
I was going to guess her until I got it right.

81
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,760
You should have your guess until it sits.

82
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,360
It's like betting on red. Sometime it must be red.

83
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,320
-Really. Nice work! -Runally.

84
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,920
As of an event, we have place number one in place in the studio.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,920
Maria Landeborn, welcome in!

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,520
-You get a small applause. -Welcome. Fun!

87
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22.560
Yes, what a surprise.

88
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,840
I have been in and of itself a few times, but ...

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,080
Did you think of any competitor?

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34.560
I thought it might be some manager.

91
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,160
Maybe Armfelt, Sprinchorn or Jonas Olavi ...

92
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,800
He was not on the list. I had guessed that kind of guest.

93
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,360
How does it feel after being eleven times that the program is now closed down?

94
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,480
It feels very boring. Generally, there is too little specific stock.

95
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,760
It's a pretty good focus here. Everything from specific corporate cases and managers-

96
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,480
-To little more general stock exchange, market prospects.

97
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,120
It is generally high ceilings and good substances.

98
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,520
And good guests. One reason you have been allowed to come back-

99
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,320
-Is that the programs have been immensely popular.

100
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:34,240
If you look back, what kind of favorite memories do you have?

101
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,160
During the pandemic when it was at its most turbulent on the market-

102
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,960
-There it was very exciting. Then it happened so much.

103
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45.560
It's such a memory.

104
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:53,240
I did a program together with Jonas Thulin which was quite fun.

105
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56.560
There were quite a few who looked at.

106
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,360
It was about market prospects for some year. May have been 2022.

107
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,280
I was a little more hesitant and he was pretty positive.

108
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,720
He is always.

109
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09.760
I think it was I who led the section.

110
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,320
I remember it went very well. There were at least 20,000-30,000 viewers.

111
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,440
You're something on the track. We must take the opportunity to take the temp for the new year.

112
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,400
But before we do that we need to look back-

113
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,880
-And get the stock exchange perspective on these years. What has happened?

114
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,080
It has been a very exciting period.

115
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,600
The pandemic has set the tone for what has happened.

116
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Partly in the beginning when we had the strong stock market fall ...

117
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,280
-. with huge course movements. -We have a graph over it.

118
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,840
I have it in my catalog with graphs that I usually use.

119
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,640
You wanted to talk about the stock market development during the pandemic. Then it was perfect.

120
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,000
-It's about the life of the entire program. -Just.

121
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01.600
Some boxes have emerged in the background.

122
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08.240
It is an incredibly special period. There is a lot you can talk about.

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,280
Partly in the stock market with incentives from monetary and fiscal policy-

124
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:21,440
-And the almost nail -shaft stock market rise from March 2020 until the end of 2021.

125
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,040
Partly the interest rate hikes.

126
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,320
Who could have believed that the central banks could raise interest rates in such a short time?

127
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,960
There is still no recession, the stock exchange has continued to rise.

128
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,400
It is up 42 % against the world index since the beginning of pandemic.

129
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,040
It has been a fantastic period in many ways.

130
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,640
When talking about market development and macro-

131
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,880
-To come back to things that happened during the pandemic.

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,160
To say that it is different this time, you would rather not-

133
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
-For it doesn't usually be. But it has been this time.

134
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00.040
Both with the huge stimulus and the incredibly high inflation.

135
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,240
The interest rate has been increased and consumption continues.

136
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08.880
There is a lot that does not work the way you expect it to normally do.

137
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,120
But it makes it very exciting. There is always something to talk about.

138
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,160
We have not had a shortage of subjects to deal with.

139
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
Not with other guests either.

140
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,800
The major movements in sectors on the stock exchange ...

141
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,760
The growth companies that went so incredibly strong, with the decline in 2022.

142
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,600
There has always been something exciting to pick out.

143
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,760
We will look at how the program correlates with the stock exchange.

144
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:44,080
We have a graph that shows the stock exchange and the most viewed sections on Youtube.

145
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,960
Do you see any clear correlation?

146
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,920
A strong trend that we become more and more seen.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,160
We may never have had as many viewers as we have had this past year.

148
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05.800
The information around the stock exchange ... many tell me:

149
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,520
"It's great what you do for the stock exchange goes so well."

150
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,440
But even when worried, there is a great need for information-

151
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,520
-From different perspectives and to have it described.

152
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,080
This speaks to that in troubled times when there is uncertainty-

153
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,280
-The you are looking for reliable sources.

154
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32.560
You see that people have done. The 4th, 5th and 6th are from a tough stock market period.

155
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,600
The 2nd, 3rd and 1st are from when it has recovered a bit.

156
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,760
But all six episodes are from turbulent times.

157
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,160
Rapid decline or rapid rise.

158
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,880
People get curious when something happens quickly.

159
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:54,600
If it is flat for two years, it is worse for Aktiesteve.

160
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,080
Then it's a bit boring. What to talk about?

161
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,400
But at a rapid decline or rise, people want to know how it is.

162
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,400
Then there is extra value in talking about how to act-

163
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,880
-and what to think about.

164
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,840
When it looks like the curve with very steep fall-

165
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,480
-And everyone suddenly wants to sell, a few want to buy, but most people want to step out.

166
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,800
Or when the market has rushed and many want to buy in-

167
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,600
-In themes on the market that have already gone very strong.

168
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,200
2021 when there were IT funds, theme funds and theme-ETFs.

169
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,920
Often you come in quite late when it looks that way.

170
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,880
Here is a great value in being educational and talking about long-term view-

171
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,840
-And how to stick to your strategy in these turbulent times.

172
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Now unfortunately none of these top 6 sections are with you-

173
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58.560
-But if we had added one, you would have been.

174
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,720
-What episode was it? -It was probably what you remembered.

175
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:10,160
I'm not sure. Here we see the most viewed throughout history.

176
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:18,160
It started to approach 100,000 viewers at the last season finale.

177
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,080
These programs are from the last two years.

178
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,640
We really got a push. A red thread seems to be strategies-

179
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,880
-Dividends and well -known financial profiles such as ...

180
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,800
-Putin? -Recis ... Hagströmer and Gardell.

181
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,120
-Marcus Hernhag is extremely popular. -I can imagine.

182
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,480
He goes straight into the target group looking at this type of broadcast.

183
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:54,040
Many equity enthusiasts who can withstand a little more profound information.

184
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,520
Dividend strategies and direct returns think people are super exciting.

185
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,760
It has been during this period when many have talked about fire-

186
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09.560
-And that you should build a stock portfolio that you can live on.

187
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,480
I'm not fire. I am for living and having a good time.

188
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,800
No, I'm not Fire, but I'm saving a lot. I've always done that.

189
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,880
I like to work. I love my job. I like to work on.

190
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,160
We have looked back at all the exciting things that have happened.

191
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,600
But we have to take the opportunity to take the temp on the coming year-

192
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,880
-and hear your thoughts. The program will be the most viewed for 2024.

193
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,000
You can hope.

194
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,120
I think 2024 will also be an exciting year.

195
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:53,440
Now I think we put the period of two years of high and rising inflation-

196
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,760
-And interest rate hikes from the central banks behind us.

197
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,480
It will be a bit like from 2021 to 2022.

198
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,520
Now we turn leaves and get something new to look at.

199
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,840
Then I think we have the interest rate top behind us.

200
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12.560
It will be positive. Inflation is clearly on the way down.

201
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,200
We'll see when it is 2 %. But it is clear that it falls steeply.

202
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,800
We'll see when we get that soft landing.

203
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,440
Speaking of that, the focus will be a lot on macro for a while.

204
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,960
Now everyone expects a soft landing.

205
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,680
The more the stock market rises, the more we praise from the upcoming soft landing.

206
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,320
But we will surely get periods when the statistics do not come in-

207
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,400
-So as the market wants. Then it can cause concern.

208
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,960
If there is recession, the fall height will be larger-

209
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,320
-When we have praised very positively.

210
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,080
But we believe in a soft landing. Now that inflation comes down quickly-

211
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,800
-Haming the central banks in a position when they can start lowering interest rates.

212
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,960
We have low unemployment, people still have money to spend-

213
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,680
-and uncertainty decreases. It is positive.

214
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,400
I thought you can be positive for 2024.

215
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,440
If you are to be even more long -term, then, which you should be happy to be when investing ...

216
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,920
This will in some way be a last fellow to the viewers.

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,360
If we look ten years ahead, what themes should you keep track of when investing?

218
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,840
There are themes, but to the last program and long -term I want to send with ...

219
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,960
Before looking at themes, ie what will go strongest on the stock exchange-

220
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,640
-Ka man building a long-term portfolio, ie a broad and well-diversified portfolio-

221
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,840
-Where you can put themes on top. Private savers, and even we who sit here-

222
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,000
-Will be happy to look at themes when things have already gone well. There are funds in top charts-

223
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,440
-And news in Fundspress and Media ...

224
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,760
This is when you discover them, when the trend is already at the end.

225
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,520
This can be seen, among other things, on green energy, superpopular a few years late-

226
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,720
-San it has gone pretty badly, and now everyone sells, which is probably the wrong timing.

227
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,160
The green energy conversion and electrification is a theme one should have.

228
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,240
You should not sell now, but rather start saving in it.

229
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,320
And most who have bought it when things had already gone well.

230
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,160
You came in wrong. And the research also shows that just tight funds-

231
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,280
-temafonds and sector funds ...

232
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,680
The return that the investment provides is not at all the same as investors receive.

233
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,200
The majority of investors come in late and are down. So the theme can look great out-

234
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,920
-But for many it will not be. They come in too late.

235
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,080
But if you have such things, you should keep it.

236
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,280
After all, there is a huge need to replace fossil fuels and electrify.

237
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,680
Then we have seen a large AI rally on the stock exchange.

238
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09.800
But it is narrow, it is the big US giants that have passed.

239
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,880
But then there is a second wave in this, when other companies that are not directly winners-

240
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,640
-And that does not manufacture the semiconductors in software ...

241
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,720
When you see companies absorb the technology, implement it-

242
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,120
-Do better, safer products, tailor affordable offers ...

243
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,480
And the other wave of AI, I think, but then you should invest a little wider.

244
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,560
It is difficult to find which companies among all these who look at-

245
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,000
-How to use the new technology in energy or AI.

246
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,040
Rather aim a little wider, so you get the companies that succeed.

247
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,240
Thank you for coming here, Maria. - You have something else for us, Christian.

248
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00.600
We three program managers are the active at EFN Market right now-

249
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:07,080
-But over the years a number of other program managers have been in front of the camera.

250
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:14,160
We will see a clip here with their reflections from the program.

251
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:22,360
I think we had many viewers because we had so much fun, in front of and behind the camera.

252
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,000
It was so fun! We had cannon atmosphere, good guests ...

253
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,960
Both small issues and small shares were noticed, but also large companies.

254
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,440
It was CEOs and renowned guests. I think that's the mix of all that.

255
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,160
It became part of my new job here at DI, that I could do television here as well.

256
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,520
I learned a lot from the team behind the camera too, super -lovely to work with.

257
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:04,280
"Basically" I do what I did on EFN with all videos, but in another workplace.

258
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,200
I have learned as much as I have brought with me.

259
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,040
Without EFN, I would not have had this job.

260
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,040
My favorite section was March 9 when the stock exchanges fell under Corona.

261
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,680
On March 9, 2020. That morning the oil collapsed 30 %.

262
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,120
I said the oil has collapsed 30 %-

263
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,240
-But the stock exchange has only collapsed 6-7 % here in the morning. It was pretty stable.

264
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,760
Georg Norberg was there and I asked how to think in such a crisis situation.

265
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,720
He answers calmly and methodically: "Yes, Matilda, even this crisis we will go through."

266
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,040
Favorite guests I have a lot, and I will miss several pieces.

267
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,400
But you know that there are three names that usually show up when guests are to be booked.

268
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:09,120
Anna Svahn always stands up, is committed and loves raw materials that few can get interesting.

269
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,960
Roger Josefsson, Makroguru, I loved listening to him, I learned lots.

270
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,360
Three were Eric Wall, the cryptocill who knew everything about crypto.

271
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,840
I took a maximum of 75 % of what he said, but that was enough.

272
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,480
Sven Hagströmer, I must say. He talked about many subjects-

273
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,960
-And was very nice and happy. Inspiring.

274
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,760
Thank you for this time. I hope you got some good tips.

275
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:50,720
I want to thank the viewers for being with you. It is you who have made it possible.

276
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,080
Thanks thanks thanks!

277
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,640
That was all phenomenal program leaders over the years.

278
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,720
How does that feel? I almost got a little tear in my eye.

279
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,840
I have had the privilege of working with everyone, both you and them-

280
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,240
-So I have seen many nice colleagues pass.

281
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,320
-Are you the institution? -Yes, they don't get rid of me.

282
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:24,520
After the program, they run in a tingle and lift me out of the studio, strapped.

283
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,320
Break you.

284
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,600
It's fun to have seen so many colleagues grow.

285
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:39,720
Everyone has gotten better at what they do during their time here, and become ...

286
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,760
... very, very good.

287
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,480
Speaking of program leaders, we will look at more statistics.

288
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:56.560
Which program managers have led the most programs? This is what it looks like at the bottom.

289
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,200
What kind of guesses do you have about who is in third place?

290
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,080
I guess at ARA. He has done many programs, but ended up ...

291
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,160
-He should miss the top two. -Gabbe or albin on one and two.

292
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,000
Gabriel quit before we started with EFN market.

293
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,080
-You are you one. - And you second. -We are checking.

294
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,440
-No, you're third, Christian. -I think Christian is second and ache third.

295
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,800
I'm one. That's my guess.

296
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,960
-There you see. Pallet site anyway. -Really.

297
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,680
You have made many good programs.

298
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,760
-And ARA ... -85!

299
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,040
-You are an institution! -I have done over a hundred pieces ...

300
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,800
One, two, three, a nice figure. A fanfare on it, huh?

301
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,360
-Ases, what many programs. -You've done more than ...

302
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,760
If anyone has come and has not gone, it is you.

303
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,840
-As I said, they get to go away. -How does it feel?

304
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,920
I didn't think there were so many. Maybe over a hundred.

305
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,200
-Lite less than half. -It feels good to have been able to.

306
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,680
-You have carried this channel. -Or vice versa.

307
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:25,280
-Will it feel empty now? -Yes, and above all that everything disappears.

308
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,640
I am very proud of the archive we leave behind.

309
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,840
A fun thing with the EFN market has been our thinking-

310
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,920
-That the sections should be able to live a little longer than just until tomorrow.

311
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,520
Much of what we have done is relevant today, tomorrow and in three years.

312
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Therefore, it is a pity that it disappears. There is a lot of wisdom in the archive-

313
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,480
-As you can benefit from in the future.

314
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,520
-You can find it in the Royal Library. -Yes, you are geeky enough, so.

315
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,760
The one waiting for something good.

316
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,040
-Yes, it felt a little ... what do you say? -What.

317
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,160
-But ... -worthy too.

318
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,520
And everything has an end. Even Rome fell. Remember that.

319
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,840
It was a good final word.

320
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,040
That was actually what we had to offer in our last EFN market.

321
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:32,600
I hope you will miss us, because we will miss you, really.

322
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,720
That's what has made fun of driving.

323
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,920
Number two: Fun guests and colleagues. Number one: Funny viewers.

324
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:51,080
Big thanks from us all for continuing to look, comment, like and follow.

325
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,920
-Thanks. -Good Christmas, and hello!
