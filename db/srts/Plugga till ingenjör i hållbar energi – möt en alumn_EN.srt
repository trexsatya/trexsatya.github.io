Hi, Philip here again!

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:07,120
Today I will talk to Emelia Lindh who works as a preparer at Nektab -

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,760
- And she has completed the same education as me.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,920
Come along!

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,020
Hi Emelia!

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,580
Can't you tell us a little bit about what you are working on?

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,780
Well, I work on projects within Electric power, where I plan - project -

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,820
- And I do everything, so when I'm done they should be able to start digging the day after.

9
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:51,968
What they dig down is the mains, they change the air line. - -

10
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,980
- Then I will prepare everything needed for them to do so.

11
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,900
What does your usual work environment look like?

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,160
It is very varied, it is everything from being out in the field to looking at how to dig -

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,780
- To sit in the office and draw in map programs and such.

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,760
Why did you choose to plug in engineering in sustainable energy?

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,620
I am environmentally interested, but at the same time wanted to read to an engineer -

16
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,700
- And this program combines it. So then I felt it was just right.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,400
How nice!

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,480
If you were to choose something that was the best thing about study time in Halmstad, what would it be?

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:43,020
It is that, before some steps I felt "how should I do this?" - -

20
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,680
- So that I stood there and had managed everything.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,100
So it felt very developing and strengthening.

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,080
I recognize that.

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:02,780
How was the class? And with the focus on sustainable energy? Did it all in the class?

24
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,120
Yes, I think so, it could be interesting discussions even between the lessons.

25
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,100
Which I appreciate it, also with the teachers, which was fun.

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,200
Yes they also feel like -minded.

27
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,360
Why do you think you should read this education that you and I have read?

28
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,440
I think it is right in time and more education is needed in this.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,520
A change to the climate goals is required and at the same time -

30
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,300
- So you can work in most things in the energy industry if you become an attractive worker.

31
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Yeah what good!

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,620
Thanks so much!
