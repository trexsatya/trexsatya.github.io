1
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,240
There will be signals that more and more people suffer from violence

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,056
mental illness now in coronatids

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,336
When more and more are home.

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,432
One of those working on the issue is Gisela Priebe,

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,248
Psychologist and researcher in psychology. Welcome!

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,920
What kind of violence is increasing?

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,500
What you think specifically about is violence in close relationships, so it is happening

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
At home now that many are quarantined now or can't move out in society.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,040
The schools are closed to high school youth and so on.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,380
And then all types of violence really increase. What one thinks first is physical violence, but it may also

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,620
be mental violence so that one calls someone for

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,820
horrible things and trying to break down self -esteem,

13
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
It can be sexual violence

14
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
And it can be neglect both by children but perhaps also for the elderly who depend on help

15
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,792
from his family.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,240
What can you do if you see that someone is exposed?

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,320
You mean if, for example, you are a relative?

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,160
Yes, or if you see in your job that someone seems to be affected?

19
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,540
It is very common to be unsure. You have suspicions

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,900
And then you start to think: What is this? Could it be violence in close relationship?

21
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,096
For most people it can be quite emotionally and you get quite committed

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,500
And you wonder what to do.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,800
I think the most important in these times when we when we can't have so much contact

24
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,128
with each other is to try to keep in touch

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,220
Although you may not be seen daily.

26
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,600
You should also consider making a notification to the social services,

27
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,696
Especially if there are children who are suspected are exposed.

28
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,780
If you make a notification, can you make it anonymous?

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,600
You can do that, but it becomes more difficult for the social services to investigate what it is about

30
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,480
They may contact it,

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,060
Anyone who has been notified, and says a notification has come in, but it will be

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
Very difficult to prove the tasks.

33
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
And above all if you think about whether it would be so that it will be a trial and be a trial and

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,640
that person is not prepared to testify, then the risk is quite high that

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,520
It will not be a convict.

36
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,080
So you have to weigh some pros and cons of reporting?

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,640
Yes, but at the same time I can understand that one becomes

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,980
Afraid that it will be a relationship that will be destroyed if you report your neighbor or your relative.

39
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,900
But I think that risk may be taken

40
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,460
If one compares to that

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,600
Children get exposed for a long time

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,000
And no one has sounded alarm.

43
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,920
Can you see that more notifications are made in coronatids?

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,020
I do not know if they do not know, but I know that there are more calls for example to

45
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
women's shelters or to

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,660
Children calling to BRIS or Save the Children

47
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,460
And have questions about home violence where they live.

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,580
This with reports of concern, can you say that people are too bad at doing it?

49
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,220
Yes you could say that.

50
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
It says in the law that the public that anyone - you or I - in any situation

51
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,060
should notify.

52
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,280
And that means you have to do it, but you don't have to

53
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
But you have to do it.

54
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,260
If I work in a business, for example in school or in health care,

55
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,100
Where I meet children, then I actually have an obligation

56
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,839
And we know that is too bad.

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,060
There are more people who suspect violence than those who report.

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,860
Could it be that reports of concerns in the end

59
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,240
Is the only real way you can help someone?

60
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,300
It's a good way,

61
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,840
Because then the social services are involved and then the question arises what can we do:

62
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,903
can one offer one

63
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Voluntary effort? It does not always mean that there will be a report to the police

64
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,380
A child gets placed in a family home,

65
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,220
Without it may also be a matter of

66
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
voluntary efforts for parents who may feel

67
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,460
that they have a hard time mastering themselves

68
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,000
And check your anger and you can get help with that.

69
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,160
If one yourself is affected by this in any way

70
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,660
what should you do then?

71
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,280
I think one should try to reach out

72
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,423
And contact someone you trust - it can be a friend, it can be a relative

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,740
Or the cuisine be the social service. There are a lot of organizations such as one

74
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,440
Can contact with in different ways.

75
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,180
One can call the women's shelter

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,580
You can look in the 1177 Care Guide, there are a lot

77
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,040
different organizations that you can contact in different ways,

78
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,280
for it is not safe now when

79
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,520
everyone sits in their apartments and one has

80
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,351
perhaps the one who practices violence close to

81
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Then it can be difficult to

82
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,240
make a call, but can text, you can chat, you can seek help in different ways

83
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,740
And I definitely think you should.

84
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,440
So at 1177 is there a collective page?

85
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,280
Yes it does.

86
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,840
But I will also now in Coronatids when all resources go to intensive care

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,420
that the government has allocated money for

88
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,740
different social organizations -

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,980
As I mentioned women's shelters, the Women's Frids Line, Save the Children -

90
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,440
can extend their resources really receive

91
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,335
All those who seek support. So no one should feel that I can't seek help for that right now.

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,620
Is it mostly women who have an aggressive man, or what does it look like?

93
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,560
Yes, it is a disputed question in the research

94
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,159
But most people who seek help are women.

95
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,840
Then there are also children who seek help.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,440
If one has an aggressive behavior or in any way

97
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,180
abusing close relationships,

98
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,860
what should you do then? Can you imagine that person can seek help?

99
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,320
Yes you can absolutely.

100
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,260
My call is to take responsibility for your behavior.

101
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,820
You are an adult and even if these are times with a lot of concern and one may have

102
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,940
much concern with different things

103
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,440
So it is still not okay to practice violence.

104
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,535
And then it is again 1177 the care guide that

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,420
one can go in and where there is

106
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,800
ability to contact specifically for those who feel that

107
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,700
they need to change their behavior.

108
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,600
And it's totally okay, you don't get convicted

109
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,340
This is all about

110
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,720
that you ask for help and then think

111
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,700
I to get it.

112
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,740
In many other countries you really sit in quarantine,

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,260
here it is relatively free anyway

114
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,960
Does it look even worse there?

115
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,700
I think of South Africa that has

116
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,560
Quite strong restrictions

117
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,260
And, for example, they have even banned selling alcohol and cigarettes

118
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,820
And there the violence has gone down.

119
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,960
Then one now fights if it depends

120
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,920
that you do not have access to alcohol, if it is that you are not affected

121
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,140
which reduces the violence

122
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,940
Or is it that the police are out on the streets in a different way than otherwise?

123
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,920
Here in Sweden we know that the sale of alcohol has gone up

124
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,980
And it is a bit difficult to interpret - it depends

125
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,460
That people no longer go to Germany and bordershops and shop there

126
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,160
Or what is it?

127
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:47,240
It can go both up and down and I think we have to analyze it afterwards.

128
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,720
Is there anything else you think about?

129
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,860
Yes, it can be a big step for relatives or relatives

130
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,439
to make this decision to call the social services.

131
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,260
If you are unsure how to do

132
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,580
Then you can also seek advice and support

133
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,440
And then I would like to refer to all these different organizations that

134
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
You can find the care guide.

135
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
It is great to call there and say

136
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:22,687
That I know someone I am worried about, this I have noticed, what should I do?

137
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,740
It is great help to be able to check with someone who has experience with these issues.

138
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,120
It must be the final words in today's conversation.

139
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,680
Thank you for being with,

140
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,720
And thank you for watching.

141
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,320
