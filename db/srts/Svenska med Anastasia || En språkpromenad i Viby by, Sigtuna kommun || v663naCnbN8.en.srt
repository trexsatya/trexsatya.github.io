1
00:00:03,157 --> 00:00:06,000
Look what wonderful weather!

2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,392
It's great weather!

3
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:12,325
The sun shines. It's warm and nice.

4
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:20,356
I want to tell you about our walk in Viby village.

5
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:24,000
Viby town is located in Sigtuna.

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:29,000
Look what we did on the walk.

7
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:35,484
We drove from MÃ¤rsta to a village called Viby.

8
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:42,324
It was overcast. The sun did not shine.

9
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:06,558
one sheep - many sheep

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,470
Sheep breaks.

11
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:14,644
They broke.

12
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,491
We walked in the village.

13
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:48,329
We walked there.

14
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:55,489
We looked at old houses and farms.

15
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:18,316
This is a fence, an old fence.

16
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:42,737
It was very windy when we were there.

17
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:51,745
We walked around and looked everywhere.

18
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:59,408
We could see how people lived before.

19
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:19,249
There was a play corner for children where the children could play.

20
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,651
In the village there is a cafe.

21
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:34,576
We were hungry so we wanted coffee there.

22
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:43,902
We bought a sandwich, two buns, a chocolate ball,

23
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:48,819
two coffees and two pear juices.

24
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,140
We paid with Swish.

25
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:56,150
How much did we pay?

26
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,060
There was hand alcohol.

27
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:27,230
We disinfected our hands first and then we took coffee.

28
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:40,682
The girls drank pear juice and ate their buns.

29
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:48,823
We ate a sandwich and a bun and drank coffee.

30
00:04:55,217 --> 00:05:00,718
After coffee we picked ourselves.

31
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:09,977
We threw rubbish in the bin and sorted the dishes.

32
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,808
We washed our hands afterwards.

33
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:24,752
After coffee we went and looked at the goats.

34
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:01,817
Then we looked at chickens.

35
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,701
This is a rooster.

36
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,702
Over there are chickens.

37
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:18,957
We also saw some tomato plants.

38
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:32,831
This is how houses were built before, a long time ago.

39
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:41,681
Then went to the car and went home.

40
00:06:42,857 --> 00:06:46,686
Have you ever been to Viby village?

41
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:49,640
Maybe it's time to go there.

42
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:55,692
Bring the kids and have a great time in Viby village.
