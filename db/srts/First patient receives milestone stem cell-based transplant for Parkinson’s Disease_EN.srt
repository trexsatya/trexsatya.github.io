00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02.145
February 13 -

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:05,670
a stem cell transplant was carried out

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,710
to a person with Parkinson's disease at SkÃ¥ne University Hospital.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,920
The product has been developed by researchers at Lund University

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,520
And is now being tested for the first time in man.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,680
Now we have finally transplanted the first patient in this STEM-PD study.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25.560
The STEM PD study is a stem cell therapy for Parkinson's disease.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,160
This is something we have worked for for many, many years.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,840
And we have now reached the phase as we can finally test this in patients.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,600
We have two steps.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37.560
The first is the planning itself.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,760
The patient is scanned with MRI deposition

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,680
With very high resolution.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,480
And based on these pictures, all planning is made

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,080
Through the brain and where we should reach to deliver the cells.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,160
Then a specific frame is used,

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59.040
A stereotactic frame, which is placed around the patient's head.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03.080
Then we use a specific instrument

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06.840
Which can deliver the cells where we want them to reach.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,800
So this is the first time

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,040
As we test these cells in humans, and it is a security study.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,720
We want to ensure that these cells are safe.

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,720
But we hope so clearly that the cells survive

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,680
and produces dopamine in the brain.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,680
This is a picture of human

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,520
Nerve cells that have been grown in the lab from stem cells.

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
What we see in the picture is that these cells have now produced

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,960
really beautiful nerves with long nerve threads

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,360
which fills up the entire cell cultivation bowl.

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,640
And that's exactly what we expect to happen

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,080
When we transplant these stem cells

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49.920
into the patient's brain, that they will mature,

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,200
and send out these long threads and start communicating with the patient's

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,040
own brain cells and then start producing dopamine

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,000
as needed in the brain of patients.

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04.560
These cells that we transplant are immature.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05.880
They need time

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09.480
To mature into the adult brain, and it will take at least one year,

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,919
Maybe even longer.

40
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,160
We don't expect to see any changes

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,120
before one year.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,040
Further studies need to take this

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,240
Clinical study all the way to a global treatment.

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,120
But it is an important milestone.

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,280
Our long -term goal with this kind of therapy is that we

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,000
may have a treatment that we can offer patients and which we can give

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,520
At the beginning of the disease, as a one -off treatment.

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,600
And that will suffice the entire patient's life

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,560
And make it possible to reduce the drugs they otherwise need.
