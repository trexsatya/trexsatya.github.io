1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:07.320
Have you thought about how you have been able to grow 1-1.5 meters since you were born?

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:14,000
Or why are you not like your siblings even though you have the same parents?

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,000
Two thoughts with one and the same answer: cell division.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,360
Celler's life is a few months and the body has to fill with new ones.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,920
This is done by cells cloning and creating copies of themselves.

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,400
The process is called cell division and there are two types:

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,280
Meios, when germ cells divide to sig-

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,280
-And mitosis, which is when more common cells in the body clone.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,760
To understand why they differ-

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,600
-Th we go through what distinguishes germ cells from ordinary cells-

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,360
-and briefly explain the DNA chromosomes.

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,440
Each chromosome is packed with DNA sequences on long threads.

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,600
These chromosomes are sitting in par-

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,560
-Ach contains the same information, the same genes and the same characteristics.

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,240
In a regular cell, our DNA consists of 46 chromosomes

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,720
-But in a germ cell there are only 23 chromosomes.

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,520
The difference in the amount of chromosomes affects how cell division is done.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,440
When a regular cell should split, when a mitosis is to be shown

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46.560
-Ad the process of coping DNA.

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,160
The cell gets a double set of its 46 DNA chromosomes.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,520
The organelles, cell components, are also doubled.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,600
When cell division is to be done, organelles-

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:09.120
-To the two daughter cells and DNA migrate into the cell halves.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,800
After that, the cell membrane closes and two new, identical cells have been created.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,440
They have exactly as many and similar chromosomes as the mother cell.

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,920
It is thanks to the mitosis that you grow 1-1.5 meters since you are born.

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,520
Then the split goes faster and more cells are created than those who die.

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,840
Germ cells have only half as much DNA as a regular cell-

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,360
-No 23 chromosomes.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,400
In the ovaries or testicles there are cells that are diploid.

31
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,280
They have 46 chromosomes, but are not included in the reproduction system.

32
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00.920
They are there to create germ cells with 23 chromosomes.

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07.040
MEIOS sharing of germ cells is initially weighed as in the mitosis.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,400
Organelles and DNA double and divide into two daughter cells.

35
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,520
But 46 chromosomes are too many. Therefore, another split-

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,760
-So that the chromosome number ends up at 23.

37
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,520
In this last phase, when two daughter cells become four-

38
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,720
-Ships what makes each individual unique, a so -called cross -cutting.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,240
Chromosome changes change and create new combinations of inheritance-

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,920
-And this way creates an endless variety of germ cells, all unique.

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,640
When the egg with its 23 unique chromosomes is fertilized by a sperm-

42
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59.840
-Of as well with their 23 unique, they will together form 46 chromosomes

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,600
-What becomes your genetic mass and a mixture.

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,080
If you are not a one -egg twin, you have your own inheritance not like anyone else's.

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:17,080
That is why siblings may not be the same at all, despite the same parents.

46
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,400
