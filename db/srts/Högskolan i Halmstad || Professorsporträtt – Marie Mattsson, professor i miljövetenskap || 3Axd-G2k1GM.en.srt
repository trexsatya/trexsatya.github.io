00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,492
Meet Marie Mattsson
Professor of Environmental Science

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,175
My name is Marie Mattsson-

3
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:08,527
-and I am a Professor of Environmental Science 
here at the University.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,559
What is your research about?

5
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:18,628
My research is very much about climate, 
environment and important societal challenges-

6
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:22,794
-and how we can learn more about them, understand them 
and maybe do something about them.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,073
The concrete example is the research we conduct on biogas.

8
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:35,350
How to use biogas, how agriculture can produce biogas 
and how it can replace fossil fuels-

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:43,241
-and what you can use the biogas for which 
it is produced for example in agriculture.

10
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:48,493
It can be used for heavy transport if we liquefy the biogas.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,891
Then I am also involved in other projects-

12
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:56,248
-linked to agriculture and eutrophication problems.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,809
It is a LOVA project-

14
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:05,879
-where we look at the concerns that agriculture poses-

15
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:14,596
-in the form of emissions of fertilizers and 
if we can avoid it in different ways.

16
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:21,502
When it comes to these eutrophication 
substances, there is a whole-

17
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:24,607
-a whole battery of different measures that you can take.

18
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:27,552
Then we have looked at this with peatlands-

19
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:34,430
-for peatlands have proven to be a very 
large emitter of greenhouse gases.

20
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:40,096
If we can re-wet these peatlands so 
that they become wetlands again-

21
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:45,588
-and then harvest the material 
that grows up, for example reeds-

22
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:50,272
-and use it for biogas, 
then we get a double climate benefit.

23
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,470
Why have you become interested in environmental issues?

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,136
I have been working with plants-

25
00:01:56,136 --> 00:02:01,882
-and I have been dealing with environmental 
issues in various places-

26
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:07,215
-at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and the Danish University of Agricultural Sciences for ten years.

27
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:13,876
You can see that agriculture is a very important industry. 
We need food that agriculture produces-

28
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:23,599
-but agriculture is also an environmental culprit in some areas. 
There we need to find solutions.

29
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,346
What is the significance of your research?

30
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:32,143
It can be important both locally and in general.

31
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:36,119
We may be looking at what it looks like here in Halland-

32
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:42,560
-with farmers who want to invest in starting 
to produce biogas and so on.

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,032
But there are also things that can be followed-

34
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:50,000
-both in other places in Sweden but also abroad.

35
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:54,880
What is most important in your role as a Professor?

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,311
I think it is very important to teach-

37
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:05,515
-make the students aware and increase 
their knowledge in these subjects.

38
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:11,184
So that they can then go out and 
maybe get leading positions in society

39
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:13,851
-where they can really make a difference.
