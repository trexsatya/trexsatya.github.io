1
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.760
ALARM CLOCK

2
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
ONE DROP

3
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.880
CLATTER

4
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.880
Leif: Cursed!

5
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.720
-cursed.
 -Did you see that aunt has died?

6
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.280
No.
 Have you seen the boiler died?

7
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.960
Yes, it was damn cold tonight.
 And then it drops from the ceiling.

8
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.680
Yes, the whole damn house collapses.
 I just want to break the pan.

9
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.240
What the hell are we going to do?
 We can buy a new pan.

10
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.600
But what a good idea!
 After all, I have hidden 15,000 in one of the sofa cushions.

11
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.920
Can't you go and pick them up, so we go and buy one?

12
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.200
Get them, so maybe we buy ice cream on the road too.

13
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.000
Well.

14
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160
God damnit...

15
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.280
-Do you find them?
 -They probably went in.

16
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.360
But God cursed!
 What happened to you?

17
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.120
Sometimes one wonders if the mother strolled with a gull.

18
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.720
-Stop it!
 -You have a bird brain in the skull.

19
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.640
We have been eating potatoes and water for a month.
 Would I hide 15,000?

20
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.000
-Yes, I don't know.
 Take it a little quiet.
 -Lugnt?
 What a position to take it easy.

21
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.120
-It drops and are minus degrees!
 -I take, Leif.

22
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.080
-You don't have to get so damn ... -What then?

23
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.560
"Leif Öhman is ..." Good!
 I can be like Billy Öhman and take it easy.

24
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.160
Then I can only lie here.
 How nice!

25
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.760
You can move in with some seal family on Svalbard and may have been on some ice floe.

26
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.880
-I get it.
 My God ... -cursed.

27
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.680
Surely you can't sit and glow while the house collapses?

28
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.520
It is the tar paper that is bad.
 Which idiot has built this house?

29
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.440
What the hell are we going to do with the heat?
 I will get the bird flu.

30
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.880
Billy, we have a barn full of firewood.
 It's just to fire.

31
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.360
And pull in that damn stomach.
 You take up four square meters.

32
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.080
Cursed ...

33
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.920
Cursed, fucking piss.
 Everything starts to fuck at the same time.

34
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.200
What should we do?
 The heat, the water ...

35
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.280
I know!
 Stop, I'm getting stressed.

36
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.800
We must fix it.
 We get to fire in the stove until we can buy a new boiler.

37
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.120
And then we cook under the roof tiles.

38
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.240
Leif?
 Why doesn't it smoke out of the chimney?

39
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.000
Pull the ass over the eye!

40
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.200
Cursed!
 Get the fire extinguisher!

41
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.360
-Billy!
 -Satan!

42
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.320
Hello.
 You, those boilers you have behind ...

43
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.840
-To do they go to buy in a construction account?
 -Yes.

44
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.080
-Then you pay on an invoice?
 -Correct.

45
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.720
Perfect.
 Then we want to open an account.

46
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.640
-Leif, you know it can't.
 -Why wouldn't that go, then?

47
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.080
-No was here one night and stole boards.
 -Stal and stole ...

48
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.040
My God, we borrowed some planks.
 You have closed on Sundays.

49
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.080
I'm sorry, but you can never open an account here.

50
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.160
Okay, is that how you want it?
 Then I will not shop here.

51
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.880
As far as I know you have never traded here.
 It makes no difference to us.

52
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.040
Should you have something of that?
 There are others who want to shop.

53
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.160
-Leif, we only have SEK 239.
 -I know.

54
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.480
-Able the garbage bags?
 -Yes.

55
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.800
This is the last time I shop here.
 This is a bad shop.

56
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.880
-Can you help here?
 -Yes Yes...

57
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.200
-During the roof plate!
 -Okay!
 Oh my God.

58
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.720
-Do we cook the roof with garbage bags?
 -Ar brain.
 We have no choice right now.

59
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.840
This is provisional.
 You have to make the best of the situation, Billy.

60
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.760
Hello guys!

61
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.120
Dad?

62
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.400
-Lill-Billyponk!
 -Nice to see you!
 That makes me happy!

63
00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.120
Satan, what a fucking surprise!
 What are you doing at home?

64
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.200
Yes...

65
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.040
Tjena, Dad.

66
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.280
The little boy min.

67
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.720
-Nice to see you.
 -Yes...

68
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.120
-What did you say?
 -It's funeral for aunt.

69
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.880
We read that she rolled off the stick.

70
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.800
I wanted to cremate her, but the others wanted a funeral.

71
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:42.400
-Remember to have two buckets extra.
 -Yes, Dad Lars.
 I have done that.

72
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.680
I know how a coffee maker works.

73
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:59.640
-Yeah.
 A little Finnish sticks and coffee.
 -Lovely.

74
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.720
Well.
 What about my guys?
 You had a little cold in the house.

75
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.840
Yes, it is the boiler that is broken.
 But otherwise everything is as usual.

76
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.480
-IN CASE WEASS FLY IN ... -BILLY ...

77
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.840
What then?
 Do you have bad steals at the checkout?

78
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It's not gracious right now.
 We only eat potatoes and tap water.

79
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.080
-But God cursed!
 -What?

80
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.880
Well, you exaggerate.
 Stop swinging.
 - It's not that serious.

81
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.560
-I should take a look at your forehead.
 -Thanks, it is not necessary.
 I am in control.

82
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.640
Yes, it was blurry then!
 Are you wrong with the coffee maker too?

83
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.600
-No have to buy a new heating boiler, boys.
 -I told Leif.

84
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.680
Although it is possible to fix it.
 You have to order some spare parts.

85
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.680
-It's a hose piece that has dried.
 -Yeah.
 What good, Leif.

86
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:24.080
Then you can order it from China, so it can fly around half the globe!

87
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.120
-Take it calmly, dad.
 -I can take care, Leif.

88
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.920
That you have a house you can't take care of I don't have to care!

89
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.920
No, I can sit here and wait-

90
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.760
-So maybe the heat boiler gets legs and takes a walk down to the workshop.

91
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.960
-That it does not work, we ignore!
 -OK, I understand.

92
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.840
God cursed ...

93
00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.120
Leif says the tar paper has rotted.

94
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.760
Yes ... tar paper.

95
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.800
And how would it have happened?
 Just like that?

96
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.960
Huh?

97
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.200
That you would be born with frigolite brain is a mystery to me.

98
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.760
It is obvious that the roof tiles are bad.
 Have you even looked?

99
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.040
-He has not, actually.
 -Fy fuck ...

100
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.360
The tar board?

101
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.920
-Pull in your stomach.
 -Yes.
 - What are you laughing at?

102
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.560
Yuk.

103
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.600
How wonderful that the dad is at home.

104
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:04.320
Very wonderful with someone who walks around whining and thinks he knows everything.

105
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.680
Snoring

106
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.680
How cozy to lie down now.

107
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:15.360
When a damn riding mower roars like some jet engine in the living room.

108
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.760
-You snoring exactly the same.
 -Stop it.
 I do not.

109
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.720
-Then I had known about it myself.
 -Yes ... good night then, Leif.

110
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.120
Morning Has ...

111
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.400
Banking

112
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.680
The bankings continue

113
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.800
Oh my God...

114
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.960
-What the hell is he doing?
 -I do not know.

115
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:19.480
It's just like I said!
 There are some roof tiles that are bad here.

116
00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.200
Well.
 Damn what good, dad.

117
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.720
-If have you cooked the roof with garbage bags?
 -It was Leif's idea.

118
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:39.120
It was provisional, but you get where they go when it blows.

119
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.840
Exactly.

120
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.600
So.
 Is it strong enough?
 So, good.

121
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.680
-Cok what the dad found in the chimney.
 -It was lucky that you did not burn.

122
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.960
Then the whole house had become smoke -filled.

123
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.480
Lucky then you found it so that the kitchen was not smoke -filled.

124
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.480
I have already put in extra buckets.

125
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:17.920
Well ... I was going to go down to Danne and greet a turn.
 Do you come along?

126
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:24.680
-I like to come along.
 -No, I have lots to fix with.

127
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.520
I have already ordered a new one there.
 But hey?
 Stop, I'll fix that!

128
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.640
But take it easy, for damn.
 I just wanted to check out.

129
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.360
You do not have to.
 I have fixed it.

130
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.960
-Sure there were ten plates you said?
 -Yes, it should work.
 Thanks, Danne.

131
00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.480
-You're welcome.
 Where is Leif?
 -He is home and fixes with the house.

132
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.640
Yes, I don't know that ... He mostly walks around and pretend jobs.

133
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.720
I don't know what he has done with the house.
 It is raging.

134
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:20.280
-What do you have for the boiler on the back?
 -You mean the boiler?

135
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.080
-Does it work?
 -Of course.
 It does.

136
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.880
"But what good! I'll just check out, Leif. It's the roof tiles, Leif."

137
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.880
"I'm so damn good and know everything about everything!"

138
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.360
Cursed Break -up Jävlar.

139
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.520
-Help for here, Billy.
 -Yes.

140
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.400
Leif!

141
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.880
Leif!
 Come you see!

142
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.120
Where the hell is he?

143
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.600
Hello?

144
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.400
Hello!
 Help!

145
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.560
Hello!

146
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.400
Ouch!
 Help!

147
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:27.400
-What the hell are you doing?
 -I am stuck.
 Help me.
 Drag!

148
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.720
Ouch!
 Cursed fucking badgers.

149
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.880
What are they going to do during our house and do?

150
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:41.000
Last year, Leif stopped a New Year's rocket to blast them.

151
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:48.240
-So it wasn't really.
 -You took the rocket and turned on.

152
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.200
-Grevings?
 -Yes...

153
00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.600
But God cursed, Leif!
 Have you become an ornithologist since last time?

154
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.040
-What then "ornithologist"?
 -Dard skull!

155
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.360
These are not badgers.
 After all, it is badly drained!

156
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.680
The water has nowhere to go!

157
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.840
Surely there is not a badger who wants to build a nest under your shit house?

158
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.160
-Leif has always said that ... -silent.

159
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.280
Well.
 What will be the next thing, then?

160
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.440
Big, fucking anacondas crawling around under the house-

161
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.680
-or a kangaroo in the forest?

162
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.280
Fuck!

163
00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.000
-Hop here, Billy.
 -Yes.

164
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.680
-What does one cost one there, then?
 -Nothing.

165
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.880
-Danne owed me a favor.
 -Ssny, dad.

166
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.880
What did you do?
 Sucked by him?
 It's not free with a heating boiler.

167
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:13.400
But God damned, Leif Öhman ... what if you could show some gratitude.

168
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.440
Stop pulling your feet after you.

169
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.680
Problems are not resolved because you look at them and whine.

170
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.720
Okay sorry.
 You may ask or wonder?
 It was a fun.

171
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.560
Do you have any suit for the funeral, or should I need to fix it too?

172
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.680
Hello There, Mr. Sex Object!

173
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.240
What did you say?
 You think I'm threat?

174
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.920
Look down here.
 It's Pretty Hot.

175
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.880
Six?
 No, in Cannot have sex today.
 My auntie is dead, so I'm sad.

176
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.320
Maybe Next Time.

177
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.680
-Screw me!
 Really handsome!
 -Do you think?

178
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.520
Good, is not it?

179
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:30.440
But Leif!
 My God, what a damn bridal magnet!

180
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.200
-Really.
 Shit, Leif.
 -Thanks.

181
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:40.040
But ... Surely damn is that my old student costume?

182
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:47.400
-Wo?
 Is it your old student costume?
 -Do on the pulley.
 Sure damn it is!

183
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.760
-I should not have it anyway.
 -So clear you should.
 You are shitty!

184
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.200
Yes, though it scratches and smells strange, so I don't want it.

185
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.840
Really handsome, Billy.
 Now the mom would see you.

186
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.080
Snoring

187
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.760
Duns and saw sounds

188
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.400
What the hell is this?

189
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.680
-It is called an excavator, Leif.
 -I know, but where does it come from?

190
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.840
Dad picked it up.
 He borrowed it from Danne so we can drain the kitchen.

191
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.880
But it didn't notice you because you slept all morning.

192
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.160
Oh my God...

193
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:19.040
-And what the hell are you doing on the roof?
 -The roof tiles do not cook themselves.

194
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.720
-Yes, but ... I fix that myself.
 -It won't take long.

195
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:29.880
Cursed!
 Come down from the roof, for hell!

196
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:35.040
It's my house, my plates and my roof, so I do it myself!

197
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.280
Yes, what the hell ... I may need a small coffee break.

198
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.320
-Remember to secure!
 -Yes, yes, yes!

199
00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.880
-He wanted to cook the plates himself.
 -Yeah.

200
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.480
Fy damn, have you read this?
 Idiots.
 When they started ...

201
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.320
What the hell?!

202
00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.880
How did it go?
 Have you broken anything?

203
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.240
-Release me ... -Come up here.

204
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.600
-I'll be fine.
 -What did I say about the fuse?

205
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:39.120
Leif, concussion is not to play with.
 Now it is important to rest.

206
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:44.280
Because the neck is properly broken ...

207
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.920
Where the hell is he?

208
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.800
Yes you, Billy ... we'll be at a funeral in 30 minutes.

209
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.040
Now he is coming.

210
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.440
How did it go?

211
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.600
Hurry up and change.
 We must not arrive too late for the funeral.

212
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.160
What the hell, we have a quarter over?

213
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:51.240
We have a house that is collapsing.
 We have a quarter of us!

214
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:57.360
Maybe we can watch out?
 Roof tiles.
 There we have one to be replaced.

215
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.760
There is one more.
 Maybe we should take it before the crows get there.

216
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:10.440
So, now the roof was fixed!
 What fun, dad!

217
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.640
But look, a little disgusting excavator!
 We can take the opportunity to drain-

218
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:22.240
-So that there will be no flooding!
 I love to drain!

219
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.560
It's so damn nice!
 Oh how nice!

220
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.600
Do you see what good?
 Your son can, he!

221
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.520
When we are still on the move, maybe we should fix a little more?

222
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.560
So damn fun with a handy son!

223
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.160
What the hell are we going to do?

224
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:02.000
Fy fuck ... so damn fun that you are home.
 Let's go!

225
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.400
What do you say, Dad?
 Damn, how wonderful!

226
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:27.960
Get to hell, what I love this!
 Damn, how nice it is to fix!

227
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.000
Fuck off!

228
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:37.280
Fuck!
 What a fucking gun it is in the machine fuck you borrowed, the dad!

229
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.040
-Now I feel much better.
 -Leif, for hell!

230
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.920
For the hell, Lars Öhman!
 This is my house.
 We have paid for it.

231
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.320
I am of age!

232
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:55.520
I do what I want.

233
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.000
We can cook a little in the stove, maybe?

234
00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.880
We fire, so we get the heat.

235
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:10.440
Then you do not have to walk around in long underwear.
 How nice it will be!

236
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.600
Huh?
 This is my fucking house.

237
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.160
And now we are going to fire in the stove, so we don't need the piss boiler you have fixed.

238
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.600
It works just as well with pisswood!

239
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.480
Then we can invite the whole family!

240
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:42.680
We can undress naked and aunt's tits can go around the entire kitchen!

241
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:56.720
You became a refuge for the weak, and for the poor in his distress.

242
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:02.400
Protection against the rain.
 Protection in heat.

243
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:10.360
The rage of the violence is like an ice -cold rain and heat in the desert.

244
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.360
You end up the strangers alarm ...

245
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.200
Leif?

246
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.280
Leif!

247
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.240
Isn't that where our house stands?
 Huh?

248
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.000
You got the hatch again for the stove?

249
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.360
Cursed!
 Damn!

250
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.960
Excuse me.
 Sorry...

251
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.720
Had the stove hatch been dense, the incandescent would not have jumped out there.

252
00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.200
-There is needed a real remediation.
 -Yes, fuck.

253
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.120
-It could have ended really badly.
 -Yes.

254
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.920
Hello then, my pone.

255
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.680
Hello then, Dad.

256
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.040
Well?

257
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.680
Yes ... Hello then, Dad.

258
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.760
Yes, but this is you fixing, Leif?

259
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.440
Hello then, the boys mine.

265
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.800
We Didn't Start The Fire

266
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.560
It was always Burning SINCE THE WORLD'S BEEN TURNING

267
00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.480
We Didn't Start The Fire

268
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.440
But when we are gone will it still burn on, and on ...
