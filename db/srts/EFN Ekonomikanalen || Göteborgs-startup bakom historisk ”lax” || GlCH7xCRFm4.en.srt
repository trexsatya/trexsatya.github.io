00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02.960
This vegan fillet of salmon type

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,920
-What recently began to be sold in the German food chain Rewes stores-

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09.800
-Is according to the companies behind the product historical-

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,200
-Stheft is the first 3D-printed food in the world to reach the store shelves.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,280
The raw material in the fillet is a mushroom rootin made by the Gothenburg startup Mycorena.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,720
The 3D-printed "salmon" is a very interesting product for many reasons.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,840
Both around the 3D printing that we ourselves do not stand for-

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,920
-Why it is Revo Foods in Austria who does.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,760
You have come so far in the technology that you can offer products to the market.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,240
What we are very proud of is-

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,080
-That we have also been able to develop our product, mycoproteinet-

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,080
-while used in these products to create texture-

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51.840
-As what the 3D-printed technology offers-

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,800
-But also get very high nutritional content on the product.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,760
It is something that we, thanks to us being strong on technology, research-

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,520
-and the development, has been able to develop so that you can use mycoproteinet-

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,960
-In this 3D-printed technology.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,400
This is the production hall at the Gothenburg company Mycorena.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,520
EFN has previously noticed mycorena-

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
-and their way of making mushroom rootin in reactors.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,040
A process that has given echo far outside the food industry.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,840
We have won a prize by NASA, where we could produce this in space.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,840
It may not necessarily be that we focus on technology for space-

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,440
-But it talks a lot about our production process.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,440
It is so resource efficient that you could do it in space-

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,280
-But even in Gothenburg or anywhere in the world.

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,040
It is produced in a very controlled process.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,240
The production process only takes 24 hours.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,280
Even the fact that we are not dependent on the climate.

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,760
We can produce this in cold Sweden, all year round.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,160
Back to the 3D-printed food.

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,520
One advantage of this is that it can reduce the load on fish stocks in the seas.

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,080
But there are more advantages, according to Ebba FrÃ¶ling at Mycorena.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08.040
Partly when it comes to alternatives to salmon that are vegan-

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,680
-To there are not so many good alternatives today.

36
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,360
You have challenges in getting to the texture.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,760
The vegan products available today are quite a lot of fillet -based.

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,240
There are quite a very simple textures.

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,960
In the salmon you want "flakes", both for appearance-

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
-But especially for the mouth feeling when you eat this product.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
This is something that the 3D print can add.

42
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,880
You can take it another step in terms of taste and texture. Is that how to see it?

43
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,240
Yes, and especially the texture is a very large iron in the 3D print.

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,760
What can that type of products get for space in a future global food market?

45
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,040
Brand new types of applications.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,320
Now there is a lot of focus on doing replacement-

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,400
-And like the traditional products, with salmon in this case.

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,960
But within 5-10 years it is not so much about replacing-

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07.040
-or mimic meat, fish and chicken-

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09.920
-What may be about making completely new types of products-

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
-W which is just about mouth feeling and taste sensation.

52
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,200
For the mycores it has bought a lot during the course of the journey-

53
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,880
-To try to synchronize your own production capacity with demand.

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,720
The construction of a factory is ongoing in Falkenberg.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
But even though demand is high, it has been difficult-

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
-To get enough capital.

57
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,400
It was the same as I said two years ago.

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Demand is very large-

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,480
-And the challenge is being able to scale and give customers the volume they require.

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,640
It is still a problem we face.

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,400
Customers need large volumes to launch on the market.

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49.040
But we have also been able to launch in smaller scale-

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
-And received a lot of feedback from the customers and done test runs.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57.040
Now we wait for the commercial scale to get started-

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,600
-If we should be able to roll this out for real.
