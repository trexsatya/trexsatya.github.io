00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03.328
My name is Rosanna

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:07.936
And plugs my fourth year at a civil engineer in software technology.

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,056
The most fun is the problem solving itself and that you are constantly being challenged.

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:19,712
Whether it is a math or programming problem, that you sit there and really try

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,480
To figure out!

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,296
And then like it works, hopefully.

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,880
Sometimes it takes a little longer.

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,696
I recently read an AI course

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
Where we got to learn more about machine learning, by trying to get a rocket to center.

10
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,936
The rocket had to try to go in slightly different directions

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,264
And then we gave it a reward or punishment.

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,896
It may be that it gets a certain point, based on how well it performed.

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:58,112
The less negative the point is, the closer the goal is the rocket.

14
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02.208
It is a rather practical education in the way of

15
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06.816
You have to program quite a lot. And no prior knowledge is needed.

16
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09.888
Anyone who has a technology interest,

17
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,192
who thinks this is awesome and

18
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,520
Want to learn more about the technology behind.

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,616
Just that you find it interesting.
