1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,603
We'll be moving back to Sweden soon.

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,671
That's the problem.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,008
And we're very embarrassing, often.
And we don't understand a thing, most of the time.

4
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:11,128
Exactly. You will not be allowed to come inside.

5
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:12,544
And when we were going to…

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,522
Welcome to our home.

7
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,023
It's a perfectly ordinary Sunday.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,525
A rather messy Sunday.

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,962
We're reading a book where...

10
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,363
Pink!

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,898
- Yes, it's pink.
- Pink!

12
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:42,034
There's text and then there's an image,
so you should say...

13
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:46,337
On the chairs. Under the bed. On the cabinet.

14
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:49,606
Yeah...
Laura thinks it's super fun.

15
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:55,511
But I think you should clean up a bit, Laura.
Look at the mess she's made here.

16
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,547
It looks terrible.

17
00:00:58,614 --> 00:01:05,019
- Huh? I want to read it.
- Yes, you want to read it. Matilda the Mouse Builds.

18
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:08,488
Those two would also need to clean up a bit.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,960
- You guys?
- Mhm?

20
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:18,029
What do your rooms look like?

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,365
Quite tidy.

22
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:25,668
Um...
Mine is not cleaned at all.

23
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:32,841
Okay. I think it's time for us to get stuff done.
Get cleaning done.

24
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:37,538
- Oh no.
- No, it's so boring.

25
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:42,974
- Yes, but then we can start the day, for real.
- Okay then.

26
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:52,156
Have you talked about Alma's braids?
The viewers haven't seen it.

27
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:57,494
- They haven't? God.
- No. This is one of the last things you did in Kenya.

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,228
Yes, exactly.

29
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:03,365
- How long did it take?
- Four and a half hours.

30
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:07,935
Now you've had them for a while,
so the real hair is starting to show.

31
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,540
They don't last that long.
You don't really have the right hair quality to do these.

32
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:19,678
No, my hair will probably be very damaged when I take them out,
but I think it's worth it. I think they look very nice.

33
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,746
They suit you.

34
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:27,951
I often look at you and think I see someone else.
Especially from the back.

35
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:29,400
Like...

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,823
Long, long blonde braids.
It didn't really register.

37
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,226
I agree.
What's it like to sleep with them?

38
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:42,362
- Very difficult. I can show what I sleep with.
- Yes.

39
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:56,173
- This is the one I wear, and...
- What's that?

40
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,344
It's a satin cap.
I can show you what it looks like on.

41
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:12,019
- Mushroom!
- Yes, you look like such a little mushroom.

42
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:20,309
And then I sleep, like this.

43
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:25,697
This way, they're not, like, everywhere.
Very good.

44
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:30,525
- It's like an extra pillow.
- Yeah, but not a very comfortable pillow.

45
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,669
No, I want it.

46
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:37,740
It's always like this when we have to clean,
then you suddenly want to play with the toys.

47
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,408
Then it won't be cleaned.

48
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:42,744
Play with it, play with it…

49
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,682
The never-ending pacifier fight.

50
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:58,440
Gone!

51
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,625
No. Not there.

52
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,360
Not there.

53
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:17,605
Laura, that's ruining your teeth.
You have to stop it. That's just how it is.

54
00:04:54,901 --> 00:05:01,006
Now I'm going to a classmate's house
for their birthday party.

55
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:05,897
- I'm just following you there.
- Yes, exactly. You will not be allowed to come inside.

56
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:09,346
- No, no. And neither will you.
- No, neither will you.

57
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:13,549
This one... I thought I would
carry the camera in it when we're not filming.

58
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:16,230
Now it's empty and just in the way.

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,419
Flopping around.

60
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:22,222
- Anyway. Our house is tidy and Alma is going to a party.
- Yes.

61
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,527
Yes! Beautiful Sunday!
What kind of present do you have?

62
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:33,898
I have this... little bag.
I didn't have a nice bag, so…

63
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,233
- You made one.
- It's a little worn.

64
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:41,471
- Yes, but you drew on it nicely.
- Yes. I bought a toiletry bag in a toiletry bag in a toiletry bag.

65
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:45,741
- Several toiletry bags.
- Yes. In a nice color.

66
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,840
Oops.

67
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:52,013
And...
God, I'm sorry.

68
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:54,848
And a bath bomb.

69
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:56,750
Yes!

70
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:04,289
- Oh, are they going to jump? Do you think they dare?
- Yeah.

71
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:06,291
Do you?

72
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,527
Oh, how brave!

73
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:17,867
Laura is going through a very
emotional period in her life right now.

74
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:25,606
She will stop using diapers, she will stop using pacifiers,
and she wants to dress all by herself.

75
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:28,342
- She wants to do everything herself.
- Yes.

76
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:31,210
Oh, what do you want? A banana? Or an apple?

77
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:33,679
Yes, you can take the apple.

78
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:37,215
And if we try to help her,-

79
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,286
-then she usually lies down on the floor, rolls around,
and screams as loud as she can.

80
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:51,827
So that's our everyday life right now and I think that's the case
for a lot of parents of young kids in periods.

81
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,963
It's completely natural. But...

82
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:06,005
We have had the chance to try an app called Peppy Pals.
It's filled with games for kids between 2 and 8 years old.

83
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:10,608
Games and situations, right?
You help these peppy friends.

84
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:15,012
- Exactly. In the app, there are a few different friends.
- Animals...

85
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,280
- My turn!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

86
00:07:17,347 --> 00:07:18,281
Mhm. Here we go.

87
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:22,951
- My turn!
- Yes, sorry. Sorry. We'll play it one more time.

88
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:25,553
Laura really likes that game.

89
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,222
Yes, she thinks it's super fun.

90
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:34,828
You can ask her nice questions about the friends
when they help each other, comfort each other,-

91
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:38,230
-or when they get angry,
or when they get happy.

92
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:43,334
The app is supposed to practice children's EQ.
Emotional intelligence.

93
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:46,937
Yes. It also has a lot of other games.

94
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:50,807
You can draw and you can do puzzles.
You can do a lot of things.

95
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:57,746
And it's completely childproof.
There is no third-party advertising in it.

96
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:02,100
And yeah, it's safe, simply put.

97
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:08,303
- What's happening now, Laura?
- Oh, now they're riding a whale. Gosh!

98
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:16,827
"How did Gabby feel when they were criticized?"
There's discussion material.

99
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:22,165
Maybe he got angry.
Or sad? He got sad.

100
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:24,967
Or they got sad, you say.

101
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:30,338
- Yes, the animals are gender-neutral.
- Exactly. All the characters in this app are gender-neutral.

102
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:31,606
Red.

103
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:33,007
Green.

104
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,947
We have an offer for those of you
who might want to try Peppy Pals.

105
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,218
A 14-day free trial,
then the app costs SEK 39 a month.

106
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:50,854
You can cancel at any time.

107
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:56,210
Follow the link at the top of the description
and download the app and give it a try.

108
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:06,533
Grandma will be visiting us, from Sweden to Portugal,
so I will pick some flowers.

109
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:12,720
It's so wonderful that it's November
but there are still flowers here.

110
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,174
Oh, look.

111
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,476
- Nice!
- This one's nice.

112
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:22,146
Take a few, then we can put them in a vase
in the guest room.

113
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:25,282
How does it feel that she's coming?

114
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,350
It feels great.

115
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:34,622
She's kind of been my best friend since I was, like, two years old,
so it's great that she's coming to visit.

116
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:37,024
I'm going to pick a lot of flowers.

117
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:43,907
Oh! Look, the flowers are falling off.
They're really delicate flowers.

118
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:47,299
It will be difficult to carry them.

119
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:53,040
Here's a really nice bush that you can pick from.

120
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:04,146
We'll be moving back to Sweden soon.
How does that feel?

121
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,414
It feels really bad.

122
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:12,219
Such great friends here, and...
now I have to move home.

123
00:10:12,286 --> 00:10:16,689
I hope I find good friends in Sweden.

124
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:20,440
Don't you still have your friends from before?

125
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,962
Yes... I do.

126
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:33,336
- But you're going to switch schools.
- Yes, exactly. So... That's the problem.

127
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:38,673
- I think it will go great, Harry.
- Mm, let's hope.

128
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:42,610
Come. Let's pick some more flowers
down by the meadow.

129
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,011
Okay.

130
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:57,960
There are mostly green plants here,
not that many flowers.

131
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,759
- Yes, one little flower.
- Yes, that's small. Tiny.

132
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:07,696
Where are you going now?

133
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:14,780
Over there. I'll pick one of those flowers
because I'm not really sure if you can pick from there.

134
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:25,343
If it was up to you,
would you want the family to stay here in Lisbon?

135
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,148
Easy. Yes.

136
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,301
- There!
- Nice!

137
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:38,420
Now I have all the flowers!

138
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:41,556
This is our guest room.

139
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:46,227
It's at the bottom of the house
next to the garage that's behind this wall.

140
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,962
We don't usually film down here.

141
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,298
No, but we're very happy to have it.
The guest room.

142
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:57,202
Yes, of course.
And now we're preparing for grandma's arrival.

143
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,270
Yes.

144
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:01,539
I don't like this duvet at all
because it's a double duvet.

145
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:04,942
It's very Portuguese.
Incredibly difficult.

146
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:08,678
It's a two-man job,
but I'm standing with the camera so I can't do much.

147
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:11,146
Two-man job and two-man duvet.

148
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,951
It hit me just now when I was out with Harry
and picked some flowers...

149
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,287
This vlog's theme will be emotions.

150
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:21,288
Will it?

151
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:25,995
Yes, because it's not just Laura who has a lot of emotions.
Harry has a lot of emotions.

152
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:29,027
- We all do.
- He'd prefer to stay here.

153
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:33,030
He's going to switch schools when we move home to Sweden.
So he has a lot on his mind right now.

154
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:37,234
And Alma, who's at a party right now...

155
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:43,405
She also has a lot of emotions.
She's very pre-teen. You don't see that, but...

156
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:45,007
We see it.

157
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:49,477
And we're very embarrassing, often.
And we don't understand a thing, most of the time.

158
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:52,412
Yes. According to her.

159
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:59,510
So what I mean is that our family is going through
a lot of emotions right now. A lot of feelings.

160
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,289
- You let go of it.
- Oh, sorry. Now there are more emotions in here.

161
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,623
Yes.

162
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:12,295
But I think... that's how it is in families.
But right now, it's extra much for us.

163
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:16,632
Yes, and it won't be any less
because we're getting closer to the trip home.

164
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:20,835
- No. It's not just a trip, we're moving home.
- Yes, exactly.

165
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:23,470
How do you feel about it?

166
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:27,207
I think it will be fun.
It will be fun with a fresh start.

167
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:34,679
I miss Sweden and I miss my friends, family,
and business partners in Sweden.

168
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:42,485
I think it will be wonderful to come home to a winter landscape.
Hope there's snow in Sweden when we get home.

169
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:45,421
- In some places, there will be.
- Yes.

170
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:50,559
- Maybe not in Stockholm.
- No. We'll see. And how do you feel?

171
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:59,499
I hate the darkness, as our loyal viewers know,
so I'm not too happy about moving home this season.

172
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:04,210
No. We're really moving home
at the most fun time of the year.

173
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,404
- He says, ironically.
- Yes.

174
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,942
But... We have a lot of exciting things
happening in Sweden going forward.

175
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:12,676
Mm.

176
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:17,480
So in that way, I'm looking forward to it.
And of course, friends and family. But I love living here.

177
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:18,814
Yes.

178
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:22,350
Mixed emotions.

179
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:31,240
I've taken my hair out.

180
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:33,607
Removed the braids.

181
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,411
Yes, exactly. But I've taken out the fake hair,
and it was much more than this.

182
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:45,016
But I haven't been able to throw this away yet.
I threw away about half.

183
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:52,488
It's been a few days since we last filmed.
You took out your hair - or, the braids - yesterday.

184
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:56,158
Yes, exactly.
I got help from a friend.

185
00:15:56,225 --> 00:16:01,362
But my hair is very damaged now,
up here and such.

186
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,565
But it wasn't as bad
as I thought it would be.

187
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:09,535
No, but also,
they were quite annoying and limiting.

188
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:14,806
I have quite a lot of activities,
so it was difficult to attend those with the braids.

189
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,341
Yes. Hardest to get the swim cap on, huh?

190
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:24,681
Yeah. I'm in swimming practice and we have to wear a swimming cap,
and it was very difficult to get it on.

191
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,906
Is Laura a little sad?

192
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:39,159
Well... No more than usual.
But there's a bit of crisis and panic here sometimes.

193
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,093
Yes.

194
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,629
There was also a bit of a crisis and panic last Sunday.

195
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:49,700
After we picked you up from the party,
we went to the beach, and…

196
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:55,472
- It wasn't me.
- It wasn't me either.

197
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,348
Laura... Like a chainsaw.

198
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:07,414
When we were going to film there...
Talk to the camera, I mean. Not just film us swimming.

199
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:11,351
Then the battery ran out,
so there was actually a bit of a fight.

200
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:13,152
- Yes.
- Yes.

201
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:17,022
So today Harry was like,
"I don't want to film."

202
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:17,956
But that's okay.

203
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,958
- That's okay.
- Sometimes, you have to take a break.

204
00:17:20,024 --> 00:17:24,695
- Oh, yes. You have the right to have your feelings, right?
- Yes.

205
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:29,640
- This vlog's theme is emotions, Alma.
- Yes, indeed.

206
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:35,670
- I'll take the opportunity to remind you of the offer.
- Yes, check it out. At the top of the video description.

207
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:36,871
The link.

208
00:17:36,938 --> 00:17:42,142
We have a Question of the Day.
Where will we be celebrating Christmas?

209
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:48,681
- Here. We will be celebrating Christmas here in Portugal.
- Yes. Probably here in this living room.

210
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,348
Yes.

211
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,380
And then we will go to Sweden
sometime around New Year's, we think.

212
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,380
- Yes.
- Exactly.

213
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,890
We've not decided if we'll celebrate the New Year in Sweden,
or if we're going to celebrate the New Year here.

214
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:05,430
- No, but it'll be one of the two.
- Yes. We'll see.

215
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,962
Where will you be celebrating Christmas?

216
