00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello Hello

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,740
maybe you are one of those who have easy

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,020
to learn grammar

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,740
that can teach you a lot

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
grammar

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,260
Outside quickly

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,280
then just congratulate and say congratulations

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,200
But I'm not such

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,880
There are many who

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
cannot or

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,940
can or have time

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,680
to

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,360
memorize

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,880
to remember a lot of grammar at one time

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,560
That way to study does not fit all

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and I was talking after all

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,020
in a video pretty recently about

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,540
How you can practice prepositions by reading and listening

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,860
and I was going to tip about about the same way to

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,220
consider when it comes to verbs

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,140
And then I think like this that if you

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,680
beats up a grammar book or

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Maybe find a piece of paper with a list of many many verbs

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Then it is very easy to feel that

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,260
This is what I will never learn, this is too much

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,200
It is too difficult

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,200
it won't get stuck in memory

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
and

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,920
a way of thinking then

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,080
is to

31
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,300
to prepare a little

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,760
first

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,220
and then

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,340
try to learn slowly step by step

35
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
By reading and listening

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,240
and maybe study a little at a time instead

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,240
and when I say prepare then

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,520
So if we think of Swedish verbs

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,960
So there are

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,400
can you say, four large groups

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,960
one can split a little different but

42
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,340
But to make it a little easy for us

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,900
so can we say there are four groups

44
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,380
it is not that much

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,340
Four different ways

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,040
as we

47
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,300
Thus bending verbs in present and past

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,100
And in supinum, the important forms are then

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,800
It's a little more but ...

50
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,600
We can start there, you need to be able to talk about now

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,060
you need to be able to talk. If then

52
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,660
and you need to be able to use have and had

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
For example, if we take, look then

54
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Do you have to be able to say "I'm looking now"

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
I looked yesterday

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I have looked

57
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,540
There you have supinum

58
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,500
and then you have to

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,420
Understand how you do infiniv

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,880
So I want to look, I'll look and so on

61
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
So it's done

62
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,180
There are a little different things you need to keep track of

63
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,120
But the first

64
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,900
As you then need to get some control over

65
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,880
This, how do I do the present?
 = looking

66
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,360
How do I do that time?
 = looked

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,100
And how do I do supinum?
 = looked

68
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,200
and then there are four groups

69
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,180
Three of those groups are pretty easy to learn

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,760
so they follow pretty clear patterns

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,760
And then it's then the fourth group

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
which is more

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
you have to remember

74
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,220
a little more because it can't

75
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,000
Guess so easy

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,660
if you have

77
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,160
For example, present, present

78
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,980
so is it hard to guess

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
How past and supinum become

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
An example would be

81
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
That I run

82
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,380
In the present, I ran in the past

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
I have been running

84
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
you can't guess so easily

85
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,840
Without it one must learn

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,660
so can you say that

87
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,880
There are four groups of verbs

88
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,780
Three of them are pretty light

89
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,900
and the fourth is a little harder

90
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,180
But then my tip is that

91
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,000
you prepare you by studying

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,760
the four different groups

93
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,120
I will give a tip on a website

94
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,840
As I think is pretty good and it's called SFI with Viktor

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,400
he has a good

96
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,200
Summary with examples

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,680
And movies

98
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,040
on its website sfi with Viktor, so I put a link to it in

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
in the description

100
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,600
but there are certainly lots of different good

101
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,020
Explanations of this

102
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,420
In your SFI book

103
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,140
or in your Swedish grammar book

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,380
But if you don't have then

105
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,380
If you are unsure of verbs then my tip is that you look

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,740
a little on: how does group 1 work

107
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,540
How does group 2 work?

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,960
How do groups 3 and 4 work and thus

109
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,880
I don't think you should be really stressed and think

110
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Oh, I have to learn

111
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,500
100 verbs in group 1 at one time

112
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,580
without my tip is that you learn a

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,920
or two

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,740
maybe three examples first

115
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
so that you remember

116
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,300
a few

117
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,960
example

118
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,880
in each group

119
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
it might be enough with one

120
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
and that you like

121
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Looking and thinking a little: Okay, if you have this

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
I want to look

123
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
I see-r

124
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,400
i look â€” the i have look t

125
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,280
Okay, so you are looking at infinitive

126
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,100
on the one you use with should

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,080
I will, I want to, I will

128
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,220
look

129
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,240
and then you see how

130
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,800
How do you change, how do you change

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,080
a little

132
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
the appearance of the verb

133
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
To get the different forms

134
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
and then group 1 works

135
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
in a way and group 2 is a little

136
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,440
different

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
and group 3 is a little different, so you try

138
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,420
seeing systems, trying

139
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,180
See the pattern

140
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,980
not remember a lot of things

141
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,580
Understand the system

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
so that you recognize it

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
And then I mean that if you've seen the system

144
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,940
and understood it roughly, how it works

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,100
so you come then when you hear people talk

146
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,820
And when you read books you will

147
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,800
Repeat automatically

148
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,500
For you will see: Aha, that was group 1

149
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,080
or you may not even think, that was group 1

150
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,760
You just think, mhmm ...

151
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
it was such a m m m

152
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,280
aha, it was one of those

153
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,440
I can say that is about the way I have done

154
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,380
with Somali, because I can absolutely

155
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,420
not memorize a bunch of different verbs

156
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't have time with that either

157
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,580
But on the other hand, I know a little how the different varieties

158
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,740
Works, so when I hear people talk so I can guess

159
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
or can i think that aha

160
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,060
that verb was like that

161
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,320
that verb was so instead

162
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,000
And then I think that

163
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,740
so it's the first three groups, it's pretty easy to

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,240
see the system, or ask someone

165
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
please can you help me

166
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
explain a little, how does group 1 work

167
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,160
Group 2 and Group 3

168
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
What is the difference?

169
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
between the groups of verbs

170
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,860
and then also group 4 then, and then there is even more

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
just look at examples

172
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,440
For there is not a very clear system

173
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,520
Without taking any examples at a time

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,720
and try to understand how they work

175
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Learn them by the way

176
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
and then when you have any examples

177
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,280
on common verbs in group 4

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
so can you add

179
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,160
New you hear

180
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,040
If you have learned to run, ran, ran

181
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,840
And then I say: "I drank coffee"

182
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,980
hmmm, drank .... drink

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,380
I drink, drank, drank

184
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,920
So runs, ran, run

185
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
and drinks, drank, drank

186
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,660
is like

187
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,940
Follows the same system

188
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,860
but there are .... they are more different

189
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,920
So you need to work more with examples

190
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,560
learn an example and late

191
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,140
see new examples that are the same way

192
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
null

193
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
So okay

194
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
A suggestion on how you can do this

195
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,600
It is that you take a week and so do you say

196
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,740
This week so I'll repeat verbs a little

197
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,440
every day

198
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,020
so the first day maybe you just look a little at verb group 1

199
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,760
looking at some examples, trying to understand the system

200
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,160
late the next day so you take verb group 2

201
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,900
and so the next day verb group 3

202
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,320
then maybe the fourth day that you just repeat a little

203
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,280
and see if you remember how it works

204
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Then maybe the fifth day

205
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,260
How to start watching verb group 4

206
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
and maybe for two days

207
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,540
you just, like repeating verb group 4

208
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,800
trying to find words that you can use that are useful to you

209
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,820
and that said, not try to remember

210
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,860
too much, memorize some examples

211
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,080
But above all, try to see how the system works

212
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,860
And then when you have done that, I think you can like

213
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
learn by reading and listening

214
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,080
that you begin to think that

215
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,440
There are these different varieties

216
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,020
And, as I said, only four different groups

217
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,680
three lightweight, one difficult

218
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,740
so that you just need

219
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,120
think about it that "aha, now he said so" or "now, she said so"

220
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,960
it must be group 4, okay that verb

221
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,020
Okay, that verb bend you that way

222
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,880
so that I'm sitting here

223
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,800
and talking to you today, I sat

224
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,340
Here last week

225
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,480
I've been sitting here many times

226
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,280
Okay, sit, sat, sat

227
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
sitting, sat, sat

228
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Even when you hear something so repeat

229
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,180
that a few times for yourself: sitting, sat, sat

230
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,460
so that you only give

231
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,280
You get examples by reading and listening and then you help

232
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
the brain to remember that by the fact that

233
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,360
Repeat it in a slightly more natural way

234
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,980
and sometimes you forget and then you just have to repeat it again

235
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
and if you want

236
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
so can you at the same time

237
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
Maybe for example

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
teach you a verb

239
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,060
From Group 4

240
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,060
every day, or every other day

241
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,120
perhaps

242
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,680
Look at a list of verbs and then you take it

243
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,060
Group 4 that is a bit more difficult

244
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,120
Find a verb you need, which you think is important

245
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,620
And then you train on it one day

246
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Next day you interrogate on it

247
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Then you take a new one

248
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,700
And so you interrogate it, you can take it very slowly

249
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,300
step by step by memorizing

250
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,640
example

251
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,180
Then you will still learn between

252
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,360
Say 300 and 150 verbs

253
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,560
In that group in one year

254
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,840
and you probably don't need a huge number to

255
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,400
manage in most situations

256
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
so

257
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,860
What I want to say with this movie is

258
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,420
that if you have a hard time learning a lot of grammar

259
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,940
at one time I don't think you need to stress so much

260
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,220
without

261
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,780
try making a small

262
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,520
Map, a basic map, a kind of sketch

263
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,320
About this is how verbs work in Swedish

264
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,300
Then you bring it with you

265
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,620
And then you start collecting examples

266
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
When you meet them

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,620
in ordinary texts and in ordinary numbers

268
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,360
Then you will also

269
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,980
Exercise on things you actually need the kind you actually hear

270
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,720
the kind of people say

271
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,720
and things like you read

272
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,700
Instead of learning a lot of things and so maybe

273
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,620
a lot of what you learn

274
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
will you not use

275
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,840
maybe later, but not at first

276
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,880
I hope you understand what I

277
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,760
about what I mean

278
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,400
I mean that

279
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
It is possible to learn

280
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
in a fairly relaxed manner

281
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,640
by doing some work to prepare

282
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,600
and then sound a little time and

283
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,220
The amount of Swedish

284
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
You hear and read a lot of Swedish

285
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
can work for you

286
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,760
without having to sit and tear

287
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
and struggle with remembering

288
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,320
However, you have to spend a lot of time on the language

289
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,040
but you can train verbs when you look at your

290
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Favorite TV series

291
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
only you have some control

292
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
on how the verbs work first

293
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,680
so it is excellent to train on the TV couch or when you

294
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
talking to a language buddy

295
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,700
It is also to train grammar

296
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,340
so

297
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Don't stress too much

298
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,400
relax

299
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Learn by the fact that

300
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,480
Using the language a lot

301
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,640
have a lot of time with the language and so

302
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
I actually believe that

303
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,660
if you

304
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,580
watching this video

305
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,760
in a year again and think back

306
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,720
so I actually think you will be much safer

307
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,820
on Swedish verbs in a year

308
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,420
If you do something like I said now, I actually think so

309
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,800
test

310
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
And as I said

311
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,280
You are always happy to comment, ask and so on

312
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,660
Please tell us how you do to study

313
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,780
are you one that memorizes very much

314
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,580
or are you a little more like me to try

315
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
learn a little at a time

316
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,340
By reading and listening

317
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,940
It is interesting for me to read, it is interesting for others who read

318
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,860
The comments on the videos

319
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,580
to read, so please write a small line about how you do and how you think

320
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,340
and so we'll see you again soon

321
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,560
Have a good time so long, goodbye.
