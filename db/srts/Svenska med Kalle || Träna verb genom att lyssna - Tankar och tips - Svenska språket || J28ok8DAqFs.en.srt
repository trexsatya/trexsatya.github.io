00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02.800
Hello Hello

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,740
maybe you are one of those who have easy

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08.020
to learn grammar

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,740
that can teach you a lot

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
grammar

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,260
Outside quickly

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,280
then just congratulate and say congratulations

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,200
But I'm not such

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,880
There are many who

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
cannot or

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,940
can or have time

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,680
to

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,360
memorize

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,880
to remember a lot of grammar at one time

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41.560
That way to study does not fit all

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and I was talking after all

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,020
in a video pretty recently about

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,540
How you can practice prepositions by reading and listening

19
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,860
and I was going to tip about about the same way to

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,220
consider when it comes to verbs

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,140
And then I think like this that if you

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,680
beats up a grammar book or

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Maybe find a piece of paper with a list of many many verbs

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Then it is very easy to feel that

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,260
This is what I will never learn, this is too much

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,200
It is too difficult

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,200
it won't get stuck in memory

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
and

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,920
a way of thinking then

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,080
is to

31
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,300
to prepare a little

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,760
first

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,220
and then

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,340
try to learn slowly step by step

35
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
By reading and listening

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,240
and maybe study a little at a time instead

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,240
and when I say prepare then

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,520
So if we think of Swedish verbs

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,960
So there are

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,400
can you say, four large groups

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,960
one can split a little different but

42
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,340
But to make it a little easy for us

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,900
so can we say there are four groups

44
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,380
it is not that much

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07.340
Four different ways

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09.040
as we

47
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,300
Thus bending verbs in present and past

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,100
And in supinum, the important forms are then

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,800
It's a little more but ...

50
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,600
We can start there, you need to be able to talk about now

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,060
you need to be able to talk. If then

52
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,660
and you need to be able to use have and had

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
For example, if we take, look then

54
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Do you have to be able to say "I'm looking now"

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
I looked yesterday

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
I have looked

57
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,540
There you have supinum

58
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,500
and then you have to

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,420
Understand how you do infiniv

60
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,880
So I want to look, I'll look and so on

61
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
So it's done

62
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,180
There are a little different things you need to keep track of

63
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,120
But the first

64
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,900
As you then need to get some control over

65
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02.880
This, how do I do the present? = looking

66
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,360
How do I do that time? = looked

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,100
And how do I do supinum? = looked

68
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,200
and then there are four groups

69
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,180
Three of those groups are pretty easy to learn

70
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,760
so they follow pretty clear patterns

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,760
And then it's then the fourth group

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
which is more

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
you have to remember

74
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,220
a little more because it can't

75
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,000
Guess so easy

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,660
if you have

77
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,160
For example, present, present

78
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,980
so is it hard to guess

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
How past and supinum become

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
An example would be

81
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
That I run

82
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,380
In the present, I ran in the past

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
I have been running

84
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,860
you can't guess so easily

85
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,840
Without it one must learn

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,660
so can you say that

87
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00.880
There are four groups of verbs

88
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,780
Three of them are pretty light

89
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,900
and the fourth is a little harder

90
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,180
But then my tip is that

91
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,000
you prepare you by studying

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,760
the four different groups

93
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,120
I will give a tip on a website

94
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,840
As I think is pretty good and it's called SFI with Viktor

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,400
he has a good

96
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,200
Summary with examples

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,680
And movies

98
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,040
on its website sfi with Viktor, so I put a link to it in

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
in the description

100
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,600
but there are certainly lots of different good

101
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,020
Explanations of this

102
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,420
In your SFI book

103
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,140
or in your Swedish grammar book

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,380
But if you don't have then

105
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,380
If you are unsure of verbs then my tip is that you look

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,740
a little on: how does group 1 work

107
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57.540
How does group 2 work?

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,960
How do groups 3 and 4 work and thus

109
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04.880
I don't think you should be really stressed and think

110
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07.240
Oh, I have to learn

111
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,500
100 verbs in group 1 at one time

112
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,580
without my tip is that you learn a

113
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,920
or two

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,740
maybe three examples first

115
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
so that you remember

116
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,300
a few

117
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,960
example

118
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,880
in each group

119
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
it might be enough with one

120
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
and that you like

121
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Looking and thinking a little: Okay, if you have this

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
I want to look

123
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,860
I see-r

124
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,400
i look â€” the i have look t

125
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,280
Okay, so you are looking at infinitive

126
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,100
on the one you use with should

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,080
I will, I want to, I will

128
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,220
look

129
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,240
and then you see how

130
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,800
How do you change, how do you change

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,080
a little

132
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00.900
the appearance of the verb

133
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02.920
To get the different forms

134
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
and then group 1 works

135
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
in a way and group 2 is a little

136
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08.440
different

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
and group 3 is a little different, so you try

138
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,420
seeing systems, trying

139
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,180
See the pattern

140
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,980
not remember a lot of things

141
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,580
Understand the system

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
so that you recognize it

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
And then I mean that if you've seen the system

144
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,940
and understood it roughly, how it works

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,100
so you come then when you hear people talk

146
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,820
And when you read books you will

147
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,800
Repeat automatically

148
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,500
For you will see: Aha, that was group 1

149
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,080
or you may not even think, that was group 1

150
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,760
You just think, mhmm ...

151
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
it was such a m m m

152
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,280
aha, it was one of those

153
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,440
I can say that is about the way I have done

154
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,380
with Somali, because I can absolutely

155
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,420
not memorize a bunch of different verbs

156
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't have time with that either

157
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,580
But on the other hand, I know a little how the different varieties

158
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,740
Works, so when I hear people talk so I can guess

159
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
or can i think that aha

160
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,060
that verb was like that

161
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,320
that verb was so instead

162
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,000
And then I think that

163
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,740
so it's the first three groups, it's pretty easy to

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,240
see the system, or ask someone

165
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
please can you help me

166
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
explain a little, how does group 1 work

167
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,160
Group 2 and Group 3

168
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
What is the difference?

169
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
between the groups of verbs

170
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,860
and then also group 4 then, and then there is even more

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
just look at examples

172
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,440
For there is not a very clear system

173
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,520
Without taking any examples at a time

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,720
and try to understand how they work

175
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Learn them by the way

176
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
and then when you have any examples

177
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,280
on common verbs in group 4

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
so can you add

179
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,160
New you hear

180
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07.040
If you have learned to run, ran, ran

181
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09.840
And then I say: "I drank coffee"

182
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,980
hmmm, drank .... drink

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,380
I drink, drank, drank

184
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,920
So runs, ran, run

185
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
and drinks, drank, drank

186
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,660
is like

187
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,940
Follows the same system

188
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,860
but there are .... they are more different

189
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,920
So you need to work more with examples

190
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,560
