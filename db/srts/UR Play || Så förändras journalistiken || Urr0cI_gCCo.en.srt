1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:09,160
Help me.
 I don't get a single penny on my swish journalism.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,360
-Din Swishjournalism?
 -Yes.
 Look!

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,520
Yes, and now to the weather.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,560
It rains.
 It was all for Edwin-News.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,840
No swish!

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,840
Swisha me!
 Give me Parra!
 Swisha!
 - Why?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,040
You are doing right as a journalist.
 But if you most want money, you have to think about it.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,560
Explain, please!

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,520
Journalists Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the Viral reviewer.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,880
Today, they run the source criticism, Sweden's national team in source criticism.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,440
Now they and Edwin Safari Källkoll Corona are doing.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,080
If we start with what it looked like before the internet destroyed everything

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,000
-So we can look at some examples.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,440
Imagine this is a regular news editor.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,800
Let me guess.
 Sofie is a reporter.

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,480
She does research, interviews, writes factual, impartial news texts-

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,280
-There she doesn't tell what she thinks but produces facts and refers.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,440
It is the most well -known professional role of journalism, which you may think of.

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,400
But there are more professional roles in a newspaper, which Nicolettas.

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,360
She is a leader writer.
 She thinks things as a job.

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,240
It is her work to run the newspaper's political line.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,600
If you say "they think this" you refer to the leadership writer.

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,760
That's the point.
 She should take out the turns and provoke a little.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,680
You don't have to agree, but she runs the social debate.

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,640
Then we have Fredrik who is a news chronicler and commentator.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,520
He analyzes things and tries to make us understand what has happened.

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,360
It is explanatory and like.

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,840
You not only want facts, dry reporting on what has happened-

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,480
-Why you want to have analysis and hear someone else's "take", someone who knows more-

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,920
-As gives a picture of what everything looks like.

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,600
Sometimes you want to be provoked by someone who thinks just the opposite-

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,520
-As to feel that "no!"
 And get a picture of how you look at the world.

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,640
-It's pretty nice.
 -The newspaper houses hold all three things.

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,840
You get facts, analysis and opinions.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
But sometimes it is people who do not understand the difference.

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,440
A leadership writer comes with thought, but not the news reporters.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Because a leadership writer thinks something, you do not know what the reporters think.

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,240
This is a nice model, if you are in the sentimental direction.

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,480
But it belongs to the past.
 So it will not look in the future.

40
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,920
If you have to guess, given the Corona crisis, several media houses are pure.

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,720
There are not as many newspapers in the future, or journalism jobs.

42
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,120
And it doesn't look bright now with a threatening economic crisis.

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,520
But what does that mean?

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,680
That more journalists work like this.

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,200
Some of those who have been kicked have become a freelancer.

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,480
They sell articles to the media houses.

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,240
Some work directly towards readers or viewers.

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,240
You get money directly from them.

49
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,520
You can make fundraisers, get money through subscriptions from readers-

50
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,320
-or get money through swish as gifts.

51
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,080
I have tried, but no one sends anything.

52
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,280
According to Wikipedia, safari is both a wilderness expedition, a browser-

53
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,640
-and UR's best host.

54
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,840
Well ... you may have to work away as the listeners can find themselves.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,720
They don't want you to check Wikipedia.

56
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,640
You can drive a hard line of opinion.

57
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,160
Many people prefer to give money to people who say what they think.

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,000
The loudness they are, the more money you want to give to them.

59
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,560
The disadvantage of that becomes that one sometimes risks saying things-

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,480
-No loud and more determined to get more money.

61
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,880
You become extreme because you know how the money comes in.

62
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,360
Is there anything else I can do?

63
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:34,000
One model is to take an area you are the best in Sweden or the world on-

64
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,640
-And then you become very niche and focused on that subject area.

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,720
-You are very good on tarot cards.
 -It's not a bad idea at all.

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,440
In the future, I think it will be more common with journalists-

67
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,040
-Or focusing on areas they know well and receives revenue directly from the reader.

68
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,560
It becomes important for us consumers to be critically set-

69
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,360
-And critically consume this type of independent journalists.

70
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,760
Is this reporter an expert, credible or bought?

71
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,040
Is it sponsored?
 We have to get better at seeing it.

72
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,680
A world grows where both you and your readers can fit.

73
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,960
It becomes more important how journalists act.
 Are they professional?

74
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,480
Do they stick to facts without personal opinions coloring the reports?

75
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,840
Can they correct?
 Are they purchased?

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,200
Edwin, you know the tarot card business.

77
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,840
You would never be purchased and can deliver both news and analysis.

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,280
This is the top.
 Become a reporter about Tarot cards.

79
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,920
You do not fall for loud opinions.
 You go the narrow path of the fact.

80
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,800
-Thanks!
 Now I'll go and work.
 -Gott conscience is the best pillow.

81
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,920
Today's card is "The Moon".

82
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,680
Mercury is in retrograde.
 I'm expecting malproofing and fake news.

83
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,480
Each section contains educational material.

84
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,240
You can find it at Urplay.se

85
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Search "Källkoll Corona" and select "Pedagogical Material".

86
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,920
Click on the worksheet to open.
