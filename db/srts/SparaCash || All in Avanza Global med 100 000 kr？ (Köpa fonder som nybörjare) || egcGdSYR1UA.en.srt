Hi Magnus, is it a good idea to go all in with SEK 100,000 in Avanza Global now?

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,740
The answer is no.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,020
Let me explain.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:22,280
I just went through in my monthly overview video that a lot of people have bought into the Avanza Global Fund.

5
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,580
Also this month Global funds.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,620
And here I see a rather big risk.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,420
We see that the USA is doing quite strongly.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:38,100
And if you scroll down and check, we see that the most bought funds are also this month Global Funds.

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,740
What I think is a risk is that quite a few people buy Global Funds because the US stock market is going strong.

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,140
What many beginners do is to buy the funds that are doing best at the moment.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,500
The most common mistake beginners make is to buy at a peak and sell at a bottom.

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,480
But let me also explain why you should never go all in on one fund.

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,300
There are a few different ways that I usually advise to think about.

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,200
And the first is when you start saving, yes if you have saved a hundred thousand kroner as in this case.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,280
Then you probably have no previous experience of having invested money on the stock market.

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,920
And then if you buy, for example, a fund for a hundred thousand kroner at a peak and the fund goes down five percent.

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,040
Yes, then it will be extremely difficult for you to log in and see your money drop.

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Because it is not unusual that some things that have gone up very much in a short time.

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,440
Maybe get a recoil down, maybe five, ten percent.

20
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,080
It depends a little on how the world economy is doing and what is happening on the stock markets.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,160
My suggestion instead, in case you want to invest a larger amount of money in, for example, mutual funds.

22
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,160
It's that you spread out the purchases.

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
So that you buy a little from time to time.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,200
Because on the stock market, funds go up, down, up, down.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Over time, they go well.

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:21,120
So the data says that it is always good to buy a fund or a share, i.e. broad, stable investments.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
That you can go all in.

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,720
But you also have to consider that a stock market downturn can last for one, two, even three years.

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,920
And how funny it is if you go all in now and then it drops by 10-20 percent.

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,400
And then you have to sit on that money for maybe four or five years before you get back to plus or minus zero.

31
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,400
That's why I usually say, spread out the purchases and then it will feel better for you.

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,720
Although, statistically speaking, in the long term it does not have to be the best, it is quite nice for the head.

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,160
Psychologically, that is.

34
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,600
I hope you got an answer to your question now Emil.

35
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,200
Or was it?

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,320
Eskil? Or what's your name again?

37
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
Yes, I don't know.

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Well, Magnus out.

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,880
Thank you so much for watching this quick answer video.

40
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,560
Have the best and if you have any questions, write a question below.
