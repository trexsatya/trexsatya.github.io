00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Hello

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,500
Good evening

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,220
Hope you have a nice Monday night

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,420
You who listen

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,100
So I will try

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,340
talk and think a little more about this with that

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,060
practice on talking and that

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,240
Start talking if you are shy

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,760
Start talking if you can just a little Swedish

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,620
Simply, we say in Swedish: "Getting started"

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,100
and that means roughly that (you know)

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,980
you should start something

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
you should start something new

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,320
Then we say you are going to get started

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,480
And I think that, now first

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,840
That said, I want to record more videos

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,180
So the first thing I think about is, if you are

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,500
Maybe beginner, or fairly new with Swedish

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,480
and for me it may feel, when i will try to speak in a new language

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,620
And I'm nervous, it's like I have a stop

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,460
It's like a stop in the throat

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,880
and I might be able to say some things that

23
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,020
As I have trained on, like "Hello", "How are you"

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,580
But as soon as I try to say something new so ...

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,960
So it goes very slowly or it can feel like ...

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,140
The head becomes completely empty, it becomes silent

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,740
And here it is completely ....

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,400
I can't, almost, say anything

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,800
So then we want to speak open ....

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,280
the mouth and

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,880
relaxing you can say

32
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,220
We want to try to relax and start daring to talk a little

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,340
And then I think it's important to take it a bit at a time

34
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,700
You can't think, now I'll talk very much

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,020
But if you are afraid to talk, if you are nervous to talk

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,240
So you have to give up ... small

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,740
Challenges

38
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,920
small

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,500
tasks

40
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,260
so that today I will say

41
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,640
this

42
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
And tomorrow I'll say this,

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,660
It could be

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
(thus) you continue to give you small tasks

45
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,180
that you should say something new

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,080
or say a sentence in a new way

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,100
that makes you try different sentences

48
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,680
different questions, different answers

49
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,380
okay

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
This I think then, this is my tip today.

51
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,780
That many of you have teachers.

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,900
And do you not have teachers

53
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
So maybe you live somewhere

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
where there is any staff or something.

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,680
Any person you meet frequently
