Hi, my name is Shevin and I am an administrator at Försäkringskassan.

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:14,333
To receive compensation when you participate in a program at the Employment Service

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,375
Do you need to take care of your job seeker and follow it

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,814
Plan and the agreements available.

5
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,958
If you misbehave or extend your time in unemployment

6
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,750
May the Employment Service decide that you are losing the right

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,025
to compensation for one or more days.

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:35,416
Examples of things that make you risk being without compensation

9
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:40,416
can be; that you do not submit activity report in time,

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,916
not attending planned meetings and activities without valid reason,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,583
Not reported absence to the Employment Service,

12
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,750
not actively looking for a job, thanks no

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,830
for job or education that you have been asked to apply.

14
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,625
If you misbehave repeatedly

15
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,125
Increases the number of days you become without compensation.

16
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,750
First time you get a warning,

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09.666
The second time you will be without compensation for a day.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,958
The third time you will be without compensation for five days.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,083
The fourth time you will be without compensation for ten days.

20
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:22,801
Each time after that you will be without compensation for 45 days.

21
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,458
The Employment Service may thus decide that you do not

22
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:30,541
has the right to receive compensation for a certain number of days.

23
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:34,916
When you apply for compensation, the Social Insurance Office looks at the Employment Service's

24
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:40,417
Decisions and decide which days you should not receive compensation for.

25
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,916
If you have questions about why you do not receive compensation

26
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47.041
Should you contact the Employment Service.

27
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,750
If you have questions about what days you do not

28
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:53,250
Get paid for, contact the Social Insurance Office.

29
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,750
Once you have received a decision from the Employment Service

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,583
If you are not entitled to compensation for a certain number of days

31
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:04,619
Is it important that you continue to apply for compensation as usual.

32
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08.333
For every day you apply and normally would

33
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,958
have received compensation pulls the insurance fund of a day

34
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:16,500
from the days you lost the right to compensation.

35
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,833
If you do not submit applications

36
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,833
Can't we count off a few days and then

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26.708
you can be without compensation for a longer period than necessary.

38
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,500
The Social Insurance Office can count from a maximum of five days per week.

39
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,000
If you have received a decision from the Employment Service

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,458
If you are not entitled to compensation for 45 days.

41
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,583
Do you therefore become without compensation for at least two months

42
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:45,083
If you had compensation at the same level as your unemployment benefit,

43
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,916
can it be lowered to SEK 223 \ HKR

44
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:51.838
If you get rid of the right to compensation for 45 days.

45
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:57,166
In that case, you need to work again to meet a new working condition

46
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,145
Before your compensation can be based on your unemployment benefit again.

47
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04.958
You must submit a special form

48
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07.958
to the a-cash to have this tried.

49
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12.041
The form can be found on the Employment Service's website.

50
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,750
If you think the decision to turn you off from compensation

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,708
If you are wrong, you can request reconsideration of the Employment Service's decision.

52
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,333
You do this in the way described in your decision from the Employment Service.

53
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:29.541
If the Employment Service changes its decision, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency will receive information about

54
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,958
it and investigate whether you are to receive compensation based on

55
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,958
What you have applied for before.

56
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,000
You do not have to reapply for reimbursement.
