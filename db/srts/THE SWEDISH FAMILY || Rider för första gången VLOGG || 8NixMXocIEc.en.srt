1
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.360
Zingo, spin around.


2
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.260
Do you want a treat?


3
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.540
Here you go.


4
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.260
He is quite disobedient.


5
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.960
This is the robot dog Duke.
Alma has been trying it out in collaboration with Silverlit.


6
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:59.540
If you saw our video "What's in the box" you know that
we tested Robo Kombat, which became Harry's favorite.


7
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.620
- Should we turn him off?
- Yes, let's turn him off.


8
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.260
There, off.


9
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:17.260
It says "Duke" here, but Alma named him Zingo.
You record different.... what's it called?


10
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.160
It's called...


11
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.700
When you train them... Calls? No.
It's called "commands" in English.


12
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.940
Yes, commands.


13
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.060
Then the dog should do what you ask.
It works pretty good.


14
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.160
Yes, but I would rather
have a real dog.


15
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.100
Yes, of course. That brings us into
Question of the Day - at the start of this vlog.


16
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.920
Elina Larsson asks:
"Do you want any pets?".


17
00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.760
- Harry, you can answer first.
- I want...


18
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.160
I have to think.


19
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.680
- Should I answer it first?
- Yes.


20
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:19.020
I want a rabbit, a cat or a dog.
It doesn't matter which, just one of those.


21
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.780
- Cat.
- Cat, yes.


22
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.440
Axel and I can definitely imagine getting a pet, but not
when we are about to travel nor while we live in the city.


23
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.020
If we move to a house
you can definitely get a pet.


24
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.880
- When we move back home.
- No, not when we move to the apartment.


25
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.280
- What?
- No. It's nicer to the pet if it can run outside.


26
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.680
Yes, even if it's an indoor cat
or an indoor dog or whatever.


27
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.400
- In the meantime something like this is pretty good.
- Yes.


28
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
A robot dog.


29
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.840
From one animal to another,
now we will go to a horse stable. Fun, right?


30
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.840
Yes!


31
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:17.520
Alma has been in riding school this fall.
Many of you have asked for a vlog from the stable.


32
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:26.900
We asked Alma's riding school and they didn't want us
to film there, so we put out a call on Instagram.


33
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.040
- So great.
- Indeed.


34
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.340
A girl named Emelie reached out and we are now
on our way to her stable, Hästravaganza.


35
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:48.980
- And... Harry will be riding for the first time.
- For the first time, yeah! ♪


36
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.620
I don't know the horses and I have
never been there before, so I'm a bit nervous.


37
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.760
Merry Christmas!


38
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.940
Hey!


39
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.440
- Daddy.
- Hey, Harry.


40
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.600
- Welcome to Hästravaganza.
- Thank you!


41
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.280
The horses are ready for you,
shall we go and get them?


42
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.220
What a luxury, you don't need to
groom them or pick their hooves.


43
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:36.320
- In here are things you can borrow.
- Oh, there are lots of things in here.


44
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.900
- Let's see what we can find.
- Here are different vests.


45
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.080
Yes, exactly.


46
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.500
Oh, it's so hard.


47
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Ouch.


48
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.160
Fully equipped.


49
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.740
- This way?
- Yes.


50
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.800
This is Erik, we will ride him today.
He's a Norwegian Fjord horse, an older gentleman.


51
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.700
Hey, hey.


52
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.960
He didn't wave back.


53
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.100
Wave, you have to wave back!


54
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.200
This is Dorina.


55
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.400
Hello, Dorina.


56
00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:06.420
- They are a bit bigger than what you are used to, Alma.
- Right. Dorina is a Black Forest horse.


57
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.100
- Are you nervous?
- No, I'm scared. Scared, scared!


58
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.980
She loves to give kisses,
she loves people.


59
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.080
And food.


60
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.980
- Do you want to kiss her?
- No!


61
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.880
- Should I kiss her?
- Yes.


62
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.720
No thanks, I would rather not.
But I can pet her.


63
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.200
- How are you?
- I'm fine.


64
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.380
Oh! There's the track.


65
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.420
Put your foot through here. Nice.


66
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.620
Nice, Alma.


67
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.240
Don't fall off now.


68
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.120
Are you ready?


69
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.580
Brave!


70
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.100
Brave!


71
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.300
Brave, brave, brave, brave, brave...


72
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.560
- Want to come to this one, or are you good over there?
- I'm good over here.


73
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.620
Okay, I will come to you then.


74
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.480
Oh... this will be a bit tricky.


75
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:59.300
- Put your left foot through here.
- No, your other foot.


76
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.860
There you go,
and put your leg over.


77
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:11.460
- What should I hold onto?
- Either the saddle or this handle here.


78
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:20.160
- I think I have to... well, it's on max.
- We will just have to twist another turn.


79
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.180
There.


80
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.360
- Does it feel cool? You are so high up!
- I'm bigger than you.


81
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.960
Yes, you are.


82
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.240
I think this is a sport for Harry.
I think he will love this.


83
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:51.360
- Should I go now, daddy?
- Very soon, we just have to fix this one as well.


84
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.620
- This is so scary.
- She is so kind, just stands still and waits.


85
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.360
Here we go.


86
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.940
Yeehaw!


87
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.300
Alma! Alma!


88
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.500
- Straight in the saddle. Does everything feel good?
- Yes.


89
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:33.340
- The movements are bigger on a bigger horse, right?
- Mhm.


90
00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:04.520
Lean forward a bit while we walk up this hill. Hold onto
the horse's mane - its hair, and stand up in the saddle.


91
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.360
And let's walk up the hill.


92
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.640
- That was scary.
- It's like being on a roller coaster ride.


93
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.200
Yeehaw, roller coaster!


94
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.760
Let's speed it up a bit.


95
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:19.160
- Alma, has it been harder with a bigger horse?
- No, easier, and more fun.


96
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:25.240
- Why is that?
- I don't know, it's just more fun on a bigger horse.


97
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.700
- Hey.
- Hey.


98
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.720
- Where have you been?
- I flew the drone while you were riding.


99
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:46.080
- It seems like they have had so much fun.
- Great fun! When they trotted... Harry went "Yeehaw!".


100
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:53.560
Now we will go inside the riding arena and trot
one more lap before it's... done, or what you call it.


101
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.340
It will be so fun
to see this footage.


102
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.480
- We are home.
- Yay!


103
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:43.760
I, Alma and Harry are, anyway.
He is playing a game in there.


104
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:50.780
Daddy Axel is out to dinner with his dad
and his sisters, and we went home.


105
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.080
- What do you think of the day?
- It was fun.


106
00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:02.940
It was fun to ride at a different stable
and on different horses, I must say. Very, very fun.


107
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.940
I'm drawing a dog.


108
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.780
It's obedient
and it's called Sötnos (cutie).


109
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.680
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.


110
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:20.180
- We will make our own pizza.
- Yay, yay, yay!


111
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:27.360
- Harry, come and make pizza with us.
- No, I'm busy.


112
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:37.440
- Hey you, one is never too busy to eat.
- But can I play a bit more?


113
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:45.240
- No. Alma, is that your towel over here?
- Oops, sorry. I forgot it there.


114
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.460
I had a shower after the stable.


115
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.760
Harry will begin making his pizza,
and I'm his assistant.


116
00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:00.840
- I need cheese.
- But Harry, you need tomato sauce first.


117
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.140
Oh, right.
I put that on my last one.


118
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.380
Thanks.
Let's sprinkle it on.


119
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.500
There we go.


120
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:27.180
- How was it to ride?
- Fun. It was most fun to trot.


121
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.080
It was like...


122
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.860
And faster.


123
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.460
I ran like this.


124
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:48.660
What did you say or do
to make the horse start trotting?


125
00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:02.200
- They turned out great!
- Mommy, can you cut it?


126
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.860
Yes, I will help you.


127
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.460
In our family we cut our pizzas
with scissors, and eat with our hands.


128
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.640
♪ Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more ♪


129

131
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.940
- It's really good.
- Yes.


132
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:52.120
I'm back home.
It's very late, the kids are asleep.


133
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.480
- This was such a fun day.
- Yes, it was actually fun.


134
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.900
- Good riding school.
- Yes.


135
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.520
We have to go to sleep,
we have so much to do before our trip.


136
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.300
Well, not right this moment,
but these next few days.


137
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.600
Very much, so we will kind of
go into radio silence.


138
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.740
See you in our next video
and thank you for watching this one.


139
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.680
Thumbs it up or down.
Let us know what you think, leave a comment.


140
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.740
Take care until next time.
Bye bye!
