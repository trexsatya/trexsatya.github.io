00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:01.565
Hello Hello

2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:05.615
I got an interesting question

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:08.395
After my movie about

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09.540
to write review

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,835
and I will of course text this movie

6
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:15,835
so turn on the subtitles

7
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:18,135
so it becomes easier to understand what I say

8
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:21,105
Well, the question was, can you make a movie about

9
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:24,185
How to write a story

10
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:27,655
And it's a fun after all

11
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:30,475
and difficult question and I have to

12
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:32,275
first say

13
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:35,345
I do not write directly stories myself

14
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:38.515
Sometimes I write small stories

15
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:41,195
on my blog, but it's any more

16
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:43,255
fact stories, that I tell

17
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:46,115
about something real

18
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:48,345
Not fantasy storytelling

19
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,175
and I believe that

20
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:53,285
This question was primarily about

21
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:55.575
fantasy stories, that one finds on

22
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:58,345
something that is not true

23
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00.695
But what is a bit fun is to

24
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:03.945
My son has worked with stories at school

25
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:07,295
and he is now thirteen years so he goes in sixth grade

26
00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:10,115
So I asked him

27
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:13,635
So I think I start with what he said

28
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:16,605
and then i add a little how i think

29
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:19,475
because just like the reviews

30
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:22,445
So I think that if you write a story

31
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:25,935
or if you want to be better at writing a story

32
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,275
so you have to think a little about

33
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:31,075
why you write a story

34
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:32,855
and

35
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,355
I will talk a little more about that, after I raised

36
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:39,365
my son's tips and

37
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42.515
what they have said in school then, as they have trained at

38
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:45,675
It is that a story must have a good

39
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:48,915
heading, a good title

40
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:52.105
It must be interesting or exciting

41
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:54,615
it must arouse the reader's curiosity

42
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,465
so that the one as

43
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:59.505
sees the headline becomes interested

44
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:01.095
of reading more

45
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04.825
so a good title, a good heading, it's number one

46
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:06,515
late

47
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:09.525
Should you have a good introduction

48
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:12,685
one can sometimes say appropriations too

49
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:15,225
or introduction = beginning

50
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:18,445
You have to start your story

51
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:20,555
In such a way that the reader directly

52
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:23,555
becomes curious and interested and wants to read

53
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,375
the rest of the story

54
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,765
So the first paragraph

55
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:31,715
First page

56
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:34,525
it needs to have something a little extra

57
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:37,245
so that you attract, you suck in

58
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,815
the reader in your story

59
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:43,365
And of course you can do that in many different ways

60
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:45.605
But it's something you need to think about

61
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:48.805
When you write, and it's something you can work out on

62
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:51,485
and it's something you can think about when reading others

63
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53.045
persons' texts

64
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:56,635
how do they start their texts so that

65
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,755
It will be interesting to continue reading

66
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:04.305
Just that, then

67
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06.895
So do you need it

68
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,275
As my son calls

69
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,795
an event or

70
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:12,955
a problem

71
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:15,615
So a story must

72
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:17,465
about something interesting

73
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:21,485
it has to happen something special

74
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:24,625
something that is not ordinary

75
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,365
something that is interesting to read about

76
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:30,895
Something dramatic maybe

77
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,095
Or something horrible

78
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:36.065
or something exciting, there can be different things

79
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:39.505
or there must be an interesting problem

80
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:43,005
in the story, perhaps that

81
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:45.855
The protagonist is facing

82
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,965
a difficult challenge or

83
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:52.015
the two most important people in the story

84
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:55,255
have a conflict that they cannot resolve

85
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:59,285
so that there is something that makes

86
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,560
The reader thinks: How is this going to go

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05.860
How is this going to go?

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,060
and therefore wants to read on

89
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,855
and the last thing to think about then is that you need

90
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:19,085
A good ending so that this

91
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,125
that happens at the beginning somehow

92
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,105
gets their ending, one will know

93
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:28,235
how it went or how it continued

94
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,245
somehow

95
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:33,655
or this conflict

96
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:36,695
This problem

97
00:04:36,695 --> 00:04:39,625
the problem, the conflict presented at the beginning

98
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:43,205
is not the same way at the end

99
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:47,295
any kind of change

100
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:50,265
some form of development, it's like

101
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:53,085
important in a traditional, a classic

102
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55.245
An interesting story

103
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:57,585
Then of course there are many ways to

104
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:59,355
violate these rule

105
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:02,175
And, for example, write a very boring

106
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:04.095
story like

107
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06.865
Still is interesting in a different way

108
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:08.755
But if we are to take the foundation

109
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:11,495
So should you have an interesting problem

110
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:14,445
and an interesting change

111
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:15,515
that something new is happening

112
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,605
right

113
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:20,795
the last my son said was to

114
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:23,685
they have trained that, it is important to have

115
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:26,595
same tempo, the same time

116
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:29.525
in your story, so you have to choose

117
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:32,475
Choosing if you tell us in the present

118
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,225
That things

119
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:37,375
happens in the present in the story, so

120
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,080
For example: Kalle enters the kitchen

121
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,200
There is a cat on the table

122
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,140
the cat jumps down on the floor

123
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:50,655
So I tell you as if it is happening now or

124
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:53,495
that I choose to recount

125
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:56.305
in preteritum so that

126
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:59.435
Kalle went into the kitchen, on the table sat a cat

127
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:01.615
the cat jumped down on the floor

128
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:05,145
and that you don't mix the two

129
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:08,745
so that when you are going to write a story it is

130
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:11,615
Very good opportunity to repeat

131
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:14,255
the presence system and

132
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:17,125
the preteritum system

133
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,095
There are other teachers who have made good videos about it

134
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:22,745
so think about it that you like

135
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:25,765
keeps a consistent time

136
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,805
the same time in your story

137
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,695
Yeah that was all my son said

138
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,085
At breakfast today

139
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:38,625
and I don't have that much to add really

140
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,665
because all of these points he takes up and that they train on

141
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:42.885
in school

142
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:46,345
is what I really think

143
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:49,365
So: Why do I write a story?

144
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:52.245
Well, because I want to make my reader

145
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,825
Curious, I want to do

146
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,455
My reader engaged

147
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:59.895
I want my reader to think it's exciting

148
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:03.025
I want the reader to think

149
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:05.545
oops, what happens later

150
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:06.545
How does this end

151
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:09,595
and all the tips except the last

152
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,415
Grammatical is about that

153
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,215
to make the story exciting

154
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:17,505
and that I can add

155
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,645
There is

156
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:24.305
Yes, one thing, is that in addition to

157
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:27,355
It should be an interesting problem

158
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:30,175
Interesting events, special events

159
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:33,185
So you have to think about the people in your story

160
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,785
The characters

161
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,575
Often it's good

162
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,575
If the characters are special in any way

163
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:44,365
It's something that stands out

164
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,655
It is something that is not exactly

165
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:49,285
as usual

166
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:53,295
it must not be the main character

167
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55.805
Sometimes the main character can be completely

168
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:58.405
ordinary but that it

169
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:01,975
partly happening unusual things

170
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:04.845
for an ordinary person and that

171
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08.085
An ordinary person has

172
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,785
unusual people around them

173
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:12,595
I will take an example

174
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,755
I recently read a collection of poems

175
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:17,175
that was a kind of story

176
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,345
It was narrative poem

177
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:22,435
The main character was a regular girl

178
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,435
maybe ten years old

179
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:28,045
What was unusual was that the main character's big brother

180
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:31,375
was mentally ill and had a schizophrenia

181
00:08:31,565 --> 00:08:35,045
and therefore it became very interesting to follow

182
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,425
How this protagonist felt

183
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:41,545
in relation to the brother who had one

184
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:44,585
Especially problems then

185
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:47.605
The situation and events were interesting

186
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:49,895
The main character was really an ordinary girl

187
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:53,335
so that is one then that

188
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:56,075
you need to have interesting situations

189
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:58,575
interesting events but also keep in mind that

190
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,115
have interesting characters

191
00:09:03,295 --> 00:09:06.245
and also think about your language

192
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,905
You can make the story

193
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,455
more or less interesting

194
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:14,755
by using

195
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:17,675
A little unusual formulations

196
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:20,985
imagery, comparisons

197
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,925
Metaphors

198
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:26,395
it can be too much like that

199
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:28,735
But when you practice writing stories

200
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,555
So I think you should try

201
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,475
play with such things

202
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,845
You can too

203
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:39.535
Switching to describe things

204
00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:42,425
In the outer world, what is happening

205
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:45,445
in the room and then you can go in

206
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:48,875
and tell us what people think and feel and so

207
00:09:50,305 --> 00:09:53.505
so it can also make it more interesting to

208
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:55.455
read a story

209
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57.665
because you also have with inner life

210
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:00.525
what people feel and think

211
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:04.065
After all, it is usually people we are interested in

212
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07.045
What do people think

213
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09.915
What do people know what do people do

214
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,875
Why do they do it, there are such things

215
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,355
We can investigate when we write a story

216
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,675
And do you also have an interesting and exciting language

217
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:21,655
so can you give more life

218
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,655
to your story

219
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:25,545
For example, my favorite author Birgitta Lillpers

220
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:28,435
has a very special language

221
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:31,425
so she writes a kind of stories in her novels

222
00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:34,405
But much of what is fun with her books

223
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:37,355
is that the language she uses

224
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:39,745
To tell us about this is very special

225
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:43,595
and I came on one last

226
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:45,755
Interesting thing

227
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:48.565
As my son actually said and that is to practice writing

228
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,595
Dialogue, your story may become more interesting

229
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:54,615
about the people in it actually

230
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:55,965
talk with each other

231
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:59,195
so there is also something you can practice on

232
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:02.035
write dialogue, to let people

233
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,615
talk to each other

234
00:11:04,185 --> 00:11:07,225
so yeah i think

235
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:10,165
that that was what I had to say first

236
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:13,475
It is possible to discuss this for any length of time, there is

237
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:15,235
Long courses

238
00:11:15,685 --> 00:11:18,195
One year, two years; three years

239
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:20,465
At folk high schools and universities

240
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:22,935
about how to write well so that

241
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:26,445
This was a start, if you ask and comment

242
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:29,085
And say what you think so maybe I can do

243
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:32,195
Another movie if I get new ideas

244
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:34,945
But then I need a little input, a little

245
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,035
feedback, some ideas from you

246
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:41,065
So maybe I can give more tips

247
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:43,645
Hope this helped, hope you who asked

248
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:46,965
thought the movie gave you some new ideas

249
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:52,785
And have a good time so we'll see and hear again soon

250
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,455
good luck with the writing

251
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,165
bye
