1
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,281
There is a lot of talk about artificial intelligence right now.

2
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,352
It is said that AI is the largest that has happened to humanity.

3
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:23,390
The Social Insurance Agency has used AI since 2019. But in what way

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,061
And how do we look at the new technology. Welcome Ann-Charlotte Munkhammar!

5
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,997
You lead the work with AI at Försäkringskassan.

6
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32.565
But what is AI really?

7
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,935
AI is a huge extensive technology area.

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,439
If you do a Google search, you get over 4 \ hillion hits.

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,209
So ai is not just one thing but it is like a sandwich table of

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,781
Different techniques that can also be combined for different solutions.

11
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52.085
And perhaps the most famous application today is

12
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55.388
Chat GPT which is a form of generative AI. But it may too

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,292
be different types of language translation services

14
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05.298
Or that you have taught a machine to perform certain tasks or steps.

15
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08.902
At Försäkringskassan we have already used AI since 2019.

16
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,371
What do you use the technology for?

17
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,442
Above all, we use it to support the administrators in

18
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,345
work tasks that are difficult and time consuming.

19
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,415
For example, to analyze medical advice,

20
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:26,920
to obtain relevant information that is the basis for an assessment.

21
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:30,690
But we also use to pick out information from different

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,694
forms that come in as paper forms scanned for the manager

23
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:39,299
Should not have to overwrite it and read and type it in the case.

24
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:42.840
What does it mean for our customers that we use AI?

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,197
By using AI, we can increase our efficiency, precision

26
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:51.913
And quality in many different areas, not just in handling.

27
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:56,917
But we can also detect deviations such as a contribution breach

28
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00.978
And when we use AI in the handling we have been able to see

29
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:05.013
That we reduce the risks of we miss and misunderstand information.

30
00:02:05,013 --> 00:02:07.496
We make more equivalent judgments and

31
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:10,719
We also reduce unnecessary supplements.

32
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:15,469
There has been a huge shark around Chat GPT.

33
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,877
And we are many who have tried this AI bottom and authored texts for us.

34
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:21,647
Is this a service that the Social Insurance Office also uses?

35
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:26,247
At the Social Insurance Office, security is incredibly important.

36
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:30,094
So we are very restrictive with cloud services.

37
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:34,752
However, we also look at Generative AI and use savings models

38
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:37,055
within different areas.

39
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:40,425
For example, to synthesize data ie create data that does not have

40
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:44,629
Some connection to real data but that still looks correct.

41
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,299
But when it comes to handling, we need to be able to have a

42
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,670
traceability and we need to know why a model responds as it does.

43
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,440
So there we have focused on monitored machine learning

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,978
And now it is business expert that has created the basis for the models

45
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:04.047
By creating and enriching exercise data that teaches

46
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:07.451
the machine what different things mean

47
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:12,255
As we then start from and data scientist-training our models

48
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,157
And then in common

49
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:17,094
so we evaluate how these respond before we publish and do them

50
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:18,729
available to the administrators.

51
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,631
So that in this process we have a traceability

52
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:26,570
around which model has been used, which data the model trains on

53
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,507
And who has created and enriched this training data.

54
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:32,276
And it is incredibly important from a legal aspect.

55
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:36,416
Not least on the basis of the new EU Regulation AI Act.

56
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:42,357
It is also talked about AI as a threat, including that it risks creating inequality.

57
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:43,958
How do you view those risks?

58
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46.661
And how do we ensure at the insurance fund as an authority

59
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,564
That we use AI in a legally secure way?

60
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:53,702
AI is a very powerful technique

61
00:03:53,702 --> 00:03:56,738
And as with all technical possibilities

62
00:03:56,738 --> 00:04:00,275
So they can be used both for something good and for something bad.

63
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,720
Just because we can do one thing does not mean that we should

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07.423
Or should do it.

65
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:08.922
And I think we need

66
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:13,411
Manage expectations of AI.

67
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:18,950
AI will not magically solve all our problems and the solutions

68
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,855
As we develop and they will also not take over the world and control us.

69
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:27,927
And they have solutions that we bring out need most often

70
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:33,666
Trained and evaluated by experts in the relevant business area.

71
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35.101
And of course it

72
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:38,338
Also requirements on the user that they are awake and attentive.

73
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:43.309
Because there will be times where the AI solution gives an incorrect result.

74
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:46,212
But then we should also keep in mind that even people are doing wrong and we do

75
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:49,982
In addition, very different assessments, although we are based on the same documentation.

76
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:53,719
The advantage they have is that we have this traceability based on that way

77
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:55.988
We have built it around this

78
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:59.791
Monitoring machine learning process so that we can correct.

79
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00.859
We do follow -ups and we

80
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:04,132
can correct if we see that errors come in.

81
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:07.803
And then it is also the case that the AI solution does not make a decision without

82
00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:11,306
It is always the manager who is in the end and makes the decision.

83
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:13,975
It's just a support.

84
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,077
If we should say a little about the future.

85
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:18,046
How do you think it looks in five years?

86
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:20,215
How does the Swedish Social Insurance Agency use AI then?

87
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:25,343
Yes, technology development is moving so incredibly fast now

88
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:29.547
So that it is so impossible and be able to say.

89
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:31,182
Who had thought we would have

90
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:34,719
Get this far around Generative AI a year ago.

91
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,256
But I really hope we take advantage of these

92
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:42.561
Opportunities and as well as reviewing our processes so we don't work

93
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:45,564
in the same way we have always done and solve small parts with help

94
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:49,401
by AI, without if we compare to

95
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:54,039
the financial side or that industry while having gone from cash

96
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,010
Handling for us using cards. That we can also do it,

97
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,114
that you can back down and see that process change within

98
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:04,684
The authority's world so that we can use AI optimally.

99
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,790
Very exciting, really!

100
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,127
It will happen a lot ahead and very fast as you say.

101
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,769
Thank you for coming here Ann-Charlotte.

102
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,773
Thanks for having me.
