1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07.240
Almost a whole Russian brigade may have been knocked out in the battle for vuh leads.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,720
They've seen us!

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,640
Ukrainian soldiers are training with Leopard 2 and more and more experts agree:

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,400
The Russian big offensive is running.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,800
Russia begins new offensives.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,960
In Ukraine's neighboring Moldova, the president says

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,720
that a Russian coup was planned. What does Russia have interest in the country?

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,360
"The War of the Week" deepens the latest news development in the Ukraine War.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,120
The Ukrainian Army claims that they knocked out almost a whole brigade

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,000
of Russia's 155th lake infantry in the Battle of Vuhledar.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,960
According to Ukraine, the Brigade must have consisted of 5,000 soldiers

12
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,960
As either killed, injured or captured, Politico writes.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59.040
If the 155th brigade has actually been beaten out

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,960
Is it a sign of how bloody battles are here right now.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,400
In addition, this brigade is a kind of elite joint

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,120
Although it largely consists of recently mobilized soldiers.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,120
This is a sign of how part of the Russian cannon food strategy

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,080
maybe no longer holds

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,200
Without how to switch to more regular, real soldiers' associations.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,720
15 miles north of Vuhledar is still ongoing struggles in and around Bachmut.

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,080
Now Ukraine has stopped relief workers and civilians from getting into the city

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,240
Because the situation is too dangerous

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,360
And the only major way in is shot by the Russians.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,640
They've probably seen us!

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,480
From Russian point of view, large amounts of troops have been thrown in for a long time

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,720
Not least from the mercenaries of Wagner, to win these land areas

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,520
while Ukraine continued herself and fought back.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09.400
There is information that from a foreign point of view you should have urged Ukraine

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,600
to step down the defense of Bachmut and consider retreating.

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,200
But there are other experts who say that from Ukrainian perspective

31
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,880
is better to hold their positions and let Russia waste, the hair draw

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,280
So much resources and soldier life to try to take control.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,600
Although Russia's main focus is the front in Donbas

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
where the battle for Bachmut is raging

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,520
Is it important for the Russians to also keep the front line in Zaporizjzja.

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,000
Zaporizjzja is one of the Oblast or County in Ukraine that Russia partly occupies

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,560
And as Russia claims is part of Russian territory.

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,000
Therefore it is extra sensitive to Russia

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,840
Losing land in what one claims to be part of the home country.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,680
On Friday, the region was hit by one of the largest air attacks

41
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04.560
Since the beginning of the war, according to Ukraine's prime minister.

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08.960
At least 17 Russian robots struck in the area over the course of an hour

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,680
and damaged Ukrainian infrastructure.

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,640
The latest information is that Russia actively builds its defense there.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,600
It may point out that from a Russian point of view, an attempt is made from Ukrainian side

46
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,680
to win back land in the area as has become known

47
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,120
Not least because of the important nuclear power plant there.

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37.560
Ukraine's neighboring Moldova has been in focus over the past week

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,680
After a Russian robot passed the country's airspace before it struck in Ukraine.

50
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,720
Moldavia is squeezed between Ukraine and Romania

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,160
And in the country there is the Russian -supported Breakthrough Republic Transnistria

52
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,640
As in the 1990s, independence from Moldova proclaimed.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,240
No other countries recognize Transnistria as its own country.

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,400
But Russia has forces placed there

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09.160
And the Council of Europe considers this as occupied Russian territory.

56
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,160
When Russia occupied parts of southern and eastern Ukraine during the war

57
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,760
Have you talked about a Landbro down to Transnistria.

58
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,040
For Moldova, this suddenly means that Russia

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,080
Which is not really a neighboring country, feels much closer.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,840
Latest developments in the country was that Ukraine's President Zelenskyj claimed

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,960
that he discovered a Russian plan with the aim of "destroying Moldova".

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,600
Shortly thereafter, Moldavia's President accused Russia

63
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,720
for planning a coup attempt.

64
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,280
Russian plans to conduct subversive operations on our territory

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,800
is nothing new.

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
Russia has denied all this, but it is obvious

67
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,400
that Russia has great interests in trying to politically destabilize

68
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02.720
and ultimately check other countries in the region -

69
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,240
Not least former Soviet states such as Moldova.

70
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,640
What about the robot that passed Moldova's airspace? What does it mean?

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,760
There are different ways to interpret it without being able to read the Russian military's thoughts.

72
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,160
It can be perceived as a conscious provocation

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,040
But it can also be just a pure practicality

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
That Russia shoots a bit as they please.

75
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,680
If it then passes over the territory belonging to Moldavia

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,960
As Russia has no greater respect for starting with, then it can be so.

77
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,760
Both in the German city of MÃ¼nster and here on an exercise field in Poland

78
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,840
Trained is currently being trained Ukrainian soldiers in handling Leopard 2 tanks.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,240
At present, we are in great need of armored cars.

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,160
So when we come with these vehicles to the front

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07.600
Should they certainly save the lives of many soldiers and bring us closer to the victory.

82
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Several countries have promised Leopard 2 to Ukraine

83
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,680
But it is still unclear when these deliveries will happen.

84
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,840
The first is expected to come within a couple of months.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,480
But Germany has now criticized other European countries

86
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,840
for what one sees as a kind of inertia in sending

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,760
Compared to what it sounded like when doing these commitments.

88
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,880
For some European countries it is even unclear

89
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,360
What you have to send to Ukraine.

90
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,400
Information in the Wall Street Journal points to

91
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,040
That it can take up to two years for the United States to send its Abrams tanks.

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,880
It has been speculated for several weeks about a new Russian big offensive in Ukraine.

93
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,160
Now more and more assessors agree that it is already running.

94
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,240
There is no indication that Russia is preparing for peace.

95
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06.080
Rather, on the contrary - Russia begins new offensives.

96
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09.840
The Russian offensive has been running for a while.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,520
This is seen through increased battles in several places, especially in the county Donetsk.

98
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,920
This really shows two things:

99
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,640
That an offensive does not necessarily happen suddenly and on mass scale

100
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Without gradually stepping up.

101
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,040
But it also points to how it takes a while for information to reach out.

102
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,840
A major problem for Ukraine is ammunition deficiency.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,720
Ukrainian military is estimated to shoot 6,000 artillery shoots a day

104
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,560
While Russia is said to shoot 20,000.

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,080
It is far more than Ukraine's western ally today can produce.

106
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52.840
Even if one is trying to find ways to increase production

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,240
Warned NATO Secretary -General Jens Stoltenberg recently

108
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,280
that the delivery time on certain types of heavy ammunition has increased to 28 months.
