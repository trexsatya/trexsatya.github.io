1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,560
Russian attacks with hypersonic robots

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,160
And fierce battles around the Bachmutka river, which is described as a death zone.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,920
The Wagner leader is fighting double battles.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,240
One in Bachmut and one against the Russian military leadership.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,760
What does the future look like for Prigozjin?

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,440
He paints himself and the Wagner group as the only ones who can fight

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,680
And the rest of the army as quite useless.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,400
The war this week deepens the latest news development in the Ukraine war.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,640
Cruise robots and kamikazavaters

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,880
should have been fired against several Ukrainian cities during the week

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,880
Kiev, Dnipro, Odessa and Charkiv, among others.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,800
The Russian attacks, which appear to have been directed at infrastructure facilities

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,800
contained unusually many hypersonic robots

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,560
According to the UK Defense Ministry.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,600
They go several times the speed of the sound and are then so fast

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,880
and can make course changes during the journey.

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,880
Ukraine currently has nothing that can shoot these down.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,200
Once they have received the latest variant of the Patriot robots, the same as we have

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,920
Is there a reasonable chance to do it.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,440
But how many of this most modern type of robots have Russia?

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,520
Tragically, we will probably see how many they have.

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,920
After a night of Russian attacks, the power supply was broken

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,280
To the nuclear power plant in Zaporizjzja.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,160
Let me remind you that it is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,200
As for the sixth time relying on diesel -powered emergency generators.

26
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,400
Since September, the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant produces no electricity

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,480
But all six reactors must be cooled down to prevent meltdown.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,720
For over ten hours, the power plant was driven by reserve generators

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,440
before the power came back.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,160
It is a dice throw every time.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,400
If we let it happen time and time again, one day the happiness will turn around.

32
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,040
The Wagner Group has taken control of most of the eastern Bachmut.

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,720
At the same time, Ukrainian forces have destroyed important bridges over the Bachmutka river

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,760
in the central parts of the city.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,120
The river now marks the front line in the bloody battles

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,240
According to the British Department of Defense, which describes the area as a death zone.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,360
It is difficult to go over watercourses if they are larger than a ditch.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,280
It makes it not unusual

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,400
That there will be fierce battles precisely at this type of terrain.

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,720
But will the Russians, in this case, over the river

41
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,920
It becomes very difficult for the Ukrainians to push them back on the other side.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,360
Therefore, for example, this river is very important for the Ukrainian defense.

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,920
Battle of Bachmut has been going on for eight months

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,360
And is described as decisive by both Ukraine and Russia.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,200
If Bachmut falls, many Russian soldiers will be full.

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,320
They will go down in the basements

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,440
Where the wine producers store their sparkling wine.

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,840
This celebration will also rely in Russia.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,320
This will then be the first slightly bigger victory

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,640
Then on July 3 when you took Lysytjan.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,440
I do not think it will lead to a greater operational breakthrough

52
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,720
where one gets the opportunity from Russian side

53
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,640
To advance on to Kramatorsk and Slovjansk.

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,520
Because here I think the Ukrainians have prepared defense lines.

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Wagner leader Jevgenij Prigozjin is fighting double battles right now.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,560
One at the front in Bachmut and one against the Russian military leadership.

57
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,080
Prigozjin has complained that he is not receiving ammunition

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,120
And the support he needs.

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,640
He says at the same time that only they have managed to succeed on the Russian side.

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,440
So he paints himself and the Wagner group as the only ones who can fight

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,760
And the rest of the army as quite useless.

62
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,360
And then also complains on the middle layer

63
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,440
That is, at the General Staff General General Gerasimov and the Minister of Defense.

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
Who then is the chief of general staff that Prigozjin is fighting?

65
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,280
Gerasimov, which in January was appointed new commander

66
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,760
for Russia's war against Ukraine.

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,360
He is an establishment figure and has been with a long time

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,320
and the Ukrainian General Chief of Staff Zaluzjnyj

69
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,920
says they have read all Gerasimov's writings.

70
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,200
Thus a military thinker

71
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,520
Who has held that position for a very long time and is respected.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,120
Prigozjin has repeatedly criticized the Russian military rule

73
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,040
And it is speculated that he is trying to strengthen his political position.

74
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,360
Prigozjin is an old prisoner who by keeping up with catering

75
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,760
to the Russian army and to Putin has been given a position

76
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,720
Where he has built up this private army, so these are completely different figures.

77
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Thus an established general, an officer who has risen in the degrees

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,240
And a prisoner who has created its own private army.

79
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,680
It is a very interesting power struggle.

80
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,360
But it could, if I dare to speculate, be so that prigozjin

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,880
that has gained its power from Putin

82
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,120
Perhaps it is easier to get rid of than the establishment figure Gerasimov.

83
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,200
According to US calculations

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,760
30,000 of the Wagner Group's Lego soldiers were injured or killed during the war.

85
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,880
Is it time to figure out Jevgeny Prigozjin?

86
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,960
The information that Prigozjin now says is supported by what we see on the ground.

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,480
That you do not shoot as much artillery from Wagner or the Russian side.

88
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,200
They probably don't get that much ammunition.

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,280
Then the question is whether he has any particularly bright future.

90
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,720
Either it goes well for him

91
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,040
that he establishes himself as a power factor and creates a political army.

92
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,280
Or that he is challenged.
 Because he's located near the front

93
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,120
Is it possible that he could suffer a tragic accident there.

94
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,560
This is how you have done before with managers from 2014 in Donbas.

95
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,440
Poland may become the first country to send fighter flights to Ukraine.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
This can happen within the next four to six weeks.

97
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,680
It is about the Soviet fighter aircraft model me -29

98
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,720
Which Poland has 28 pieces.

99
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,520
After Ukraine was promised a hundred tanks of the West

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,920
Is it now fighter flights that are at the top of the wish list.

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,720
An American surveillance drone of model Reaper

102
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,400
has overthrown in the Black Sea after a collision with Russian fighter aircraft.

103
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,280
It came so close to the drone that the propeller was damaged.

104
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,320
White House describes the Russian action as “dangerous and unprofessional”

105
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,920
At the same time as Russia denies that they have been in contact with the drone.

106
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,040
Instead, they accuse the United States of flying too close to the Crimean Peninsula.

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,880
Right now it seems that this is getting a diplomatic consequence.

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,800
Thus, diplomatic consequences, rather than any form of military.

109
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
Ukraine has a lack of ammunition

110
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,600
and in American scranton, nearly 8,000 km from the front

111
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,680
Walks this weapon factory at high speed.

112
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,160
We run full two shifts.
 We have a third shift too.

113
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,640
We are running five six days a week.

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Pentagon has given US weapons factories on assignment

115
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,280
To equip and increase the production of 155 mm artillery ammunition.

116
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,960
From 170,000 like this in 2021 to over one million a year next year.

117
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,040
Without constant supplement with ammunition and other supplies from the West

118
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,960
Can't Ukrainian Army continue and fight the way you do.

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,960
Then the intensity goes down and we end up in a war war clearer.

120
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,480
One must also on the Ukrainian side build up stock

121
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,000
For what you say is the upcoming spring offensive.

122
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,320
When tanks, combat vehicles or artillery should work for

123
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,000
to continue to free the country.

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
