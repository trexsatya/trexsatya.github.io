1
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.330
Good morning everyone, then.


2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.120
Those of you who watched our last vlog saw that Hailey was going to have a little party.


3
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.890
So listen now Definition party! But she has girl friends at home and sleep downstairs


4
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.790
in the little house.


5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.510
The headline read Hailey is moving to the little house and this was a little test to see


6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.240
if we could live in the little house.


7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.350
So, she is 13 years old.


8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.320
It is clear that she will live by herself in a purple house, but then,


9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.960
she will never solve it.


10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
First of all, it's like this When you live alone or live in a house, then


11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.510
you have to keep some order, some order and things like that.


12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.560
Alina Knapgök! Stop running! But when I came down this morning that I didn't panic


13
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.520
and think about I can cut in.


14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.110
I'm cutting in here next to me now.


15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.410
A film sequence that I filmed when I came in and just to the point, I hear that


16
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.330
today my parents are coming home again and then I have to make sure that it's kind of


17
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.220
nice here.


18
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.880
So yes, we have a bit of work to do, one might say.


19
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.070
But they have started and that is good.


20
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.900
And I have started the dishwasher.


21
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.270
But now I'm going to do the washing because it's necessary to say the least.


22
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
And I will also fill up so we can get.


23
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.280
When mom comes home, they just go Oh my God, how did you manage to get it this


24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.790
nice.


25
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.130
Well, I'll tell you that.


26
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.760
We've cleaned for a living, but


27
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.960
even in here they haven't been like that.


28
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.650
In here, it's quite nice to turn on the underfloor heating a bit because it's a bit half raw


29
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.150
outside.


30
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.760
But I'm going to start the dishwasher, the washing machine and clean up a bit and


31
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.610
this croft will be in order in time too.


32
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.400
Even if it takes a little time, I can imagine so it can be there.


33
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.610
So now it is.


34
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.220
Pretty tidy here again anyway.


35
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.039
But yes, you could say it was an experience.


36
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.660
Now I have a severe cleaning obsession, so I've said you can clean up after yourselves.


37
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.050
Now I mean a little cleaning.


38
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.580
This one needs some lubrication 5:56.


39
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.250
But now we must go and fix the horses anyway.


40
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.780
We are going for a walk with all the horses.


41
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.230
Oh No, it's hug snow.


42
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.100
Oh shit! Wondering if it is possible to walk up the hill without getting stilts?


43
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.830
We have to try.


44
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.610
Maybe it will work.


45
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.690
I get to bring the hoof scraper and scratch the hooves.


46
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.310
It is quite soft in the forest.


47
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.550
I wonder what that sound is, but it's my phone. But you feel that it is plus degrees or it is


48
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.200
zero and plus.


49
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.430
But it was so damn good for their bodies to go climbing the round and sometimes


50
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.750
it's actually good not to ride without walking alongside because then they kind of get to


51
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.670
use their whole body.


52
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.680
But to work in a free way.


53
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.940
If you understand what i mean.


54
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.140
So we go round the climbs.


55
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.890
We hope it works.


56
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.070
Here I am waiting for the children to go and get the horses so we can go out and


57
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.500
the vafas never finished but got the horses.


58
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.440
We're going out for a walk in the woods and I'll leave the camera at home because it wo


59
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.140
n't be fun to film anyway so I'll see you later.


60
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.730
Now me and Robin are going down to the car shop.


61
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.540
I'm going down, stop there to


62
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.260
the car dealer because my car has been inside.


63
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.240
It has been sick.


64
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.680
No, it's been in for service so I'll pick it up now and then we'll go to


65
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.170
KC and buy some more Valentine's Day stuff or more.


66
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.940
I have bought a few and now I think I have to tie the sack and get


67
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.420
it sorted.


68
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.230
Because it actually is.


69
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.870
Hello! There aren't that many here.


70
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.120
Well, so it will be.


71
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.190
there at Beckis? Yes, it's small, but it's actually a bit bad with sledding slopes here


72
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.890
And there aren't that many people down here.


73
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.970
No, it isn't.


74
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.850
Yes, so now I have collected the key to the car and am going home again.


75
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.279
It's a bit cloudy outside, but I think.


76
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.590
Because now the snow is going away and I think that hopefully there won't be any more


77
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.120
snow now because I'm moderately tired of snow, God knows.


78
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.460
But back home again and now the car is serviced and fine.


79
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.780
Good God, then you can drive a couple more miles with a clear conscience.


80
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.380
What a thing! Let's see when you drive away.


81
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.010
Perfect.


82
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.980
I think you have to grab and pull it by hand.


83
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.140
Hey sweetie! E so cuddly, so cuddly.


84
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.830
Oh, you're going to have lunch soon, so now I'm going to take it and drive home again.


85
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.810
It's very fun! Now it's the perfect surface for kicking because the snow


86
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.760
is so packed and I'm so happy.


87
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.590
I bought that kick last year and we just loved the little Calypso.


88
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.290
Big and when you.


89
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.660
No, very, very good.


90
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.130
Those of you who know me know that I never cook, and Robin does all


91
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.710
the cooking here at home, which I am so grateful for.


92
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.030
But now I have his girlfriends here and Robin is doing lots of important


93
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.350
things that I don't know what.


94
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.430
And then I got to be the one responsible for the cooking and it can be fun.


95
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.930
Said myself very funny that I'm standing here


96
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.620
Yes, I understand that.


97
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.380
But I'm now making chicken.


98
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.010
I can't decide if that's enough chicken, but I


99
00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.800
think so.


100
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.440
So there will be chicken, rice and then I will make my own sauce which is very, very


101
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.940
tasty.


102
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.640
It's


103
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.020
creme fraiche and chilli sauce.


104
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.830
Then if you want.


105
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.700
If you feel this way that you don't like creme fraiche, there is also


106
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.720
béarnaise sauce and it may not be the best combo in the world, but it's still an


107
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.620
okay combo.


108
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.320
But it's a chili sauce like this and it's super super tasty and it's also a very


109
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.840
quick lunch and you're a little hip like this


110
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.810
Type like that.


111
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.260
Is it.


112
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.660
is there water flowing anywhere?


113
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.380
Boiling.


114
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.570
Chicken fried chicken Cook rice.


115
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.340
running No water.


116
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.330
you shouldn't be worried while I stand here


117
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.590
And wait.


118
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.090
Yes I know.


119
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.510
They are.


120
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:55.530
Four pers.


121
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.210
Four a little less.


122
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.990
But these are food-loving children, I think.


123
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.660
They are gymnasts, they have to eat properly.


124
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.930
Yes, as long as I'm going to eat too.


125
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.890
So there are five of us then.


126
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.470
You can also eat.


127
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.120
It's chicken.


128
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.150
I'll make a little extra and we can take what's left over,


129
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.630
I think.


130
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.140
We're going.


131
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.370
What is it called? Clams yesterday? Makes you not so full of it.


132
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.080
But you will be gratefully full.


133
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.680
But you're not like when you eat tacos and are full for four days.


134
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.480
So it's done.


135
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.980
I think I'll add some more chicken.


136
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.520
This is Rose's chicken


137
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.270
that we got from my brother-in-law.


138
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.860
To test.


139
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.510
This is frozen through because I want Hectare Robin's tractor boiler because then


140
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.610
you could sort of let it sit and simmer so it gets heat from above as well, but I couldn't


141
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.110
borrow it.


142
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.330
So now it will be this instead.


143
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.660
Will take a while.


144
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.730
Oh how it boils here so


145
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.570
I season with salt, garlic and pepper.


146
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.510
There are three spices that I like very much myself.


147
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.570
It's about seasoning with what you like.


148
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.910
Then I also like chili, but I think we shouldn't


149
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.580
make too much of it.


150
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.480
And now I came up with something.


151
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.650
She was allergic to nuts.


152
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.570
Now we don't have any nuts here, but


153
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.690
it might be good to keep an eye on the fact that one of the girls can't stand nuts.


154
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.730
But otherwise so.


155
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:35.770
Yes.


156
00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.510
Let's get meaty here.


157
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.299
So now we're starting to show up here.


158
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.310
It's still very cozy when you set the table and usually we always take our food


159
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.820
in the kitchen.


160
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.810
It's not like it's super long in between, but it happens.


161
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.460
So the food is getting ready anyway.


162
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.990
Which feels good.


163
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.170
kokelikok


164
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:10.790
I just got a bid on the post that was also opened, but that's, I think


165
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.510
from.


166
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.930
Prime


167
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.030
which is.


168
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.200
Super fun.


169
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.070
I haven't ordered anything from Prime, but I have received.


170
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.400
A lid with Prime.


171
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.400
You see what this was then.


172
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.950
Prime energy drink ice pop.


173
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.910
The children must not taste this.


174
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.380
We got Prime the other day but then there was no energy.


175
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.400
So this one.


176
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.170
If you have tasted this please comment on it and comment on what you like


177
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.250
which prime you like.


178
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.680
I've never really tasted them.


179
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.290
Oh, it tastes like a mix of probably the red and the blue.


180
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.380
I probably only taste the red, but very sweet.


181
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.610
I rarely drink energy drinks, but thank you so much Prime! Mmmmm.


182
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.420
Yes, can drink a little or so.


183
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.820
Give it away to someone I know likes Prime very much.


184
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.070
But I think it's fun to get these things because it's fun to try new


185
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.580
things.


186
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.500
But then, as I said, I don't drink very much.


187
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.590
Or not energy drinks at all because I don't think that's what I experience when


188
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.440
I myself drink energy drinks that I get very energetic then of course.


189
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.150
But then I also get very, very tired.


190
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.830
So the question is whether you become like that.


191
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.810
That it will have a negative effect.


192
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.540
But then there was another delivery here.


193
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.850
But I think it was for Robin because it was an


194
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.280
electric car charger.


195
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.630
Our company has both in both my company and also Robin's company.


196
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.860
After all, we have the company together, among other things, and what it looks like here.


197
00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:00.540
I go crazy and then there may be deliveries of things that are not for me.


198
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.250
It's boring enough without him.


199
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.020
But that's how it is.


200
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.810
I'm going to go into Haley's room and sneak something.


201
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:13.530
After all, I have been the world's opponent of snail slime.


202
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.300
I think it's so disgusting.


203
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:21.420
So just the thought of sticking killer slugs in my face makes


204
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.850
me want to start crying.


205
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.350
Type.


206
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.050
Now I say hello.


207
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.940
Ah but then I'm having a mental breakdown


208
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:33.600
This Then we have Hailey's solution to all the world's problems and that is to


209
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.430
throw everything away.


210
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.820
Maybe I should get dressed, but you see here, I'm panicking.


211
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.480
However, I think I might have to take a little bit of responsibility for looking the way it does in


212
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.250
her room because I called her, can you go out to Chloe's and hang out with


213
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.860
her? And then I think she dropped everything and left.


214
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.980
But this is no exception and something she uses far


215
00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.850
too much.


216
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:06.810
It's pads like these makeup pads and it's because she.


217
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.920
So for real huh? I will buy this.


218
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.110
So really lose it.


219
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.110
And that's because she.


220
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.140
I kind of can't bear to talk anymore because I get so irritated.


221
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.280
She is so careless.


222
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:31.100
What's up with kids today? To be so extremely careless? Or is it just my


223
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.950
child? Because now I'm losing it.


224
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.620
Hard huh? So parenthood.


225
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.440
Help me please.


226
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:47.800
I'm so tired.


227
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.960
What I would say about snail slime.


228
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.870
Now that I've trudged out of Hailey's bedroom, I'm going to try that


229
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.370
the other day.


230
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.830
Because in my feed everywhere it shows up how good.


231
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.330
Snail slime is here.


232
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:04.510
Or this snail it is this one.


233
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.980
So I had to try it and I kind of liked it.


234
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.260
Which the character in me.


235
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.170
Went in and ordered three more products like this.


236
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.860
I'll feature them in another video because they haven't come home yet.


237
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.930
But feel free to comment if you have tried snail slime in any form.


238
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.030
And feel free to comment!


239
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.380
What did you think of it, because as I said I have been against it because I think


240
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:37.600
it is so gross to think of getting snail slime on my face considering that


241
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.840
I hate, no hate, loathe snails.


242
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.550
At least the slime.


243
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:48.580
But if you think they could have named it something else they could have named it Super


244
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.180
Power Serum, I wouldn't have thought of that.


245
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.860
But is it so? Snail in.


246
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.830
But feel free to comment what you think and


247
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.710
if you have any products.


248
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.740
I have understood that there are slightly different products like this, because there is


249
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.710
this one that is like this.


250
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.100
And then is there any face cream, any eye cream? I think what I


251
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.620
ordered was the face cream and eye cream.


252
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:12.430
But then I saw.


253
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.610
There is another brand of this too.


254
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.850
So yes, there is little to choose from.


255
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.670
But go ahead with comments because it feels like I said many who follow us are a bit


256
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.390
in the same generation with tik tok and other things


257
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.500
So yes.


258
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.120
I also have to say I am now using the Charlotte Tilbury Flawless filter.


259
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:38.110
I really like that foundation, or it's more like a serum foundation


260
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:43.030
But it is yes.


261
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:49.840
I like a lot and also Huda's baking powder also superb! Lots of fun,


262
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.260
lots of fun.


263
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.550
That's a lot, I can say.


264
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:57.580
But tik tok that you have learned or received a lot of tips about some fun products


265
00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.180
to use.


266
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.390
Above all, as my make-up routine has become completely different, which is super fun.


267
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.950
As a surprise.


268
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.890
You haven't filmed Robin Robban's kitchen?


269
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.900
It's a little dark in Robban's kitchen today.


270
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:09.250
But then thought.


271
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.480
I not so much.


272
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.860
So then it will be at Robban's kitchen today.


273
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.260
Since it's so much like pork, stew etc.


274
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:30.730
Not so advanced, just with mushrooms and shallots and cream and ghee.


275
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.650
What are you going to eat then?


276
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.810
I'm going to eat like.


277
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.040
I'm going to eat chili sin carne.


278
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.610
And it will be.


279
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.180
Yes, it's chili without the meat.


280
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.010
Chili con carne, without minced meat.


281
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.310
Without minced meat, mince and.


282
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.940
Beans too.


283
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.560
Or I'll start, me


284
00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:52.890
and.


285
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.150
Böna and I will perhaps see what is available.


286
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.600
Kidney beans and white beans.


287
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.960
Yes, and I would hectare with a small one so it will be easy like this.


288
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.860
And do I have crushed tomatoes?


289
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.010
And paprika?


290
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.780
Shall I share it for you? I can run it in my blender.


291
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:20.590
No I do not know.


292
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.580
Got something I missed.


293
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.360
Yes, Janne.


294
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.920
I like my pieces.


295
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.390
You are boring.


296
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.530
Greece is a success.


297
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.630
I didn't say it was bad.


298
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.280
I said I like my pieces.


299
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.600
Now my father is finally coming home again and they are coming up here to eat so I


300
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.560
am setting the table


301
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:40.890
a bit.


302
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.310
Hello! We have one friend left.


303
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.290
There will be as many of us as the table.


304
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.390
Yes, the table is full, seven.


305
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:52.660
It will be cozy.


306
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.710
I still think it's nice.


307
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:59.080
And now it's time for us who live on the west coast but who live in Västra Götaland.


308
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:05.109
But it was so strange because no, only Kungsbacka but not Varberg.


309
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.450
It's weird.


310
00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:08.230
Gothenburgers.


311
00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.079
And also Skövde and Trollhättan and these.


312
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:19.420
But the strange thing is that not Orust, they were sort of deported from LOV.


313
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.220
They follow through on the promise the week after that.


314
00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:26.440
But yes, then you have to take care and have a little fun, I think.


315
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.310
Yes, so very cozy.


316
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.010
What dinner do you know? Fantastic! We go clams.


317
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:36.760
Clams yesterday.


318
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.800
Yeah, do you like it? Can you taste Robins here.


319
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.910
And dad doesn't like clams.


320
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.580
Not salmon anyway.


321
00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:47.790
I don't know mussels.


322
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.230
It's not salmon.


323
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.210
Was it good? It was swinging.


324
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.250
Robin is great at cooking and the other side.


325
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.380
Now it's food.


326
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:02.160
I'm walking around looking for my cell phone and wondering where did I put it? And then


327
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.260
it is next to the coffee cup.


328
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.450
Good point.


329
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.880
God, my eyes are watering so much and I look very tanned again.


330
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.960
But I'm not.


331
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.330
Or yes, on cheating.


332
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.800
It's time to end today's vlog and I've kind of had a reaction to


333
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.630
something so I've kind of swollen up one eye during the night.


334
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.720
I don't know if you can see it, but it is like that.


335
00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.580
Or the eyelid is completely swollen.


336
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.430
But thank you so much for watching this blog and thanks also


337
00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.570
to everything else you've watched on our channel.


338
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:52.120
And one thing for this vlog we did before this blog which was about


339
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.240
we've been to a funeral and we were going to do a video where we pay tribute to


340
00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.640
everyone, everyone, everyone or someone we know or someone we miss or if we've


341
00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.940
lost does not necessarily have to be a person.


342
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:10.120
That video really has the East on with such amazingly nice comments.


343
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:16.360
Feel free to go in and look at it and just be filled with love because it was so nice.


344
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.820
And even though sometimes I said oh that was fun and you wrote something, everyone


345
00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.680
really took the opportunity and did it, which I thought was incredibly beautiful.


346
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:34.000
So thanks for that! But now we have to finish this video and now


347
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.560
our sports holiday also begins.


348
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:41.320
We are not going to do anything special other than to go and compete, probably this


349
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.590
weekend at Grevagården, Thursday to Sunday.


350
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.350
So we are really looking forward to that.


351
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.310
But hope you are having a great time and that you are well! And if you have a sports holiday,


352
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:55.360
I hope you have a great holiday! Take care and we'll see you again soon.


353
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.000
Bye!
