00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,680
Hello! We broadcast from Lund University where we interview a researcher every day with

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,220
Research that in one way or another relates to the Corona crisis.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,520
And today I have with me Henrik Andersson, a researcher in practical philosophy. Welcome!

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,720
Right now, care is facing very difficult decisions and doctors all over the world

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,440
Must choose whose life to be saved.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,920
In what way did your research related to the Corona crisis?

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,140
As a moral philosopher, I think much of all research in philosophy

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,140
relating to the Corona crisis.

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45.620
But come to me specifically so i have researched

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,980
Much about difficult comparisons.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,820
And then it is about choices we make

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58.880
When to choose between two different options and the options differ

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,200
In such a way that it seems impossible to say which is the better option.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08.720
It can be alternatives that are so different in its character

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,860
So that it seems difficult to know how they relate to each other.

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,140
And if we don't know how they relate to each other

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,920
Then it will also be difficult to make the right decision.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,460
And it seems to be the way it looks today

19
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,760
In many ways.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,380
Partly at some kind of state level

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,300
where Sweden as a state is trying to arrive at

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,180
What strategy we should have to fight the Corona outbreak.

23
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,600
Partly it is about the value of human life

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,980
But you also hear those who discuss

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,400
Values that may be more linked to economy

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,520
and that the standard of living will be reduced

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,280
If we try to fight the Corona infection too strongly.

28
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,120
So there are two very different values that are in contrast to each other.

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,900
And then the question is: How should we act?

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,380
A question asked right now is who would have the most right to intensive care

31
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,000
If two patients are set against each other, o ch i have a case here that I would like you

32
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,380
Thinking about from a philosophical perspective.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,380
If two people,

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,400
who have the same need for a respirator to survive:

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,160
one is a 53-year-old sofa potato with poor health

36
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,980
And the other a 73-year-old Superatlet.

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,260
Their biological age is the same and they would have equal opportunities to survive.

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,060
How would you reason and what would you need to know?

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,900
I have come across many of this kind of questions

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,480
And they have seen on social media how people have reasoned about these types of questions.

41
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49.560
I don't think the interesting is

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,320
To give a definitive answer

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,360
on this kind of question, without what is interesting

44
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,200
is that it rather raises questions

45
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01.248
When you think about these things

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04.060
So maybe someone is asking the question

47
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08.560
What do we know about these people? Is one doctor for example?

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,260
Then maybe some feel that if it is a doctor then we should of course prioritize that person

49
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,800
While others may think it should not play any major role

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,020
So what is good about this kind of case

51
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,700
and to discuss them I think is that one

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,940
can learn anything from them.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,080
One can try to reason up to what is relevant and important to know

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,480
in these situations.

55
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,360
And there maybe you come up with different answers.

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,060
Hopefully you arrive at the same answer

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,280
So that we can have some kind of consensus around them.

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,800
I think one should be careful about saying

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,660
That it should of course be this younger person to be chosen here.

60
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,580
In these cases we know far too little

61
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,100
About these people to make a good decision.

62
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,600
So it is good to lift these issues, because we can

63
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02.560
come to what we need to know more and need to know

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,320
And we need to know more or if something is missing.

65
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,120
And if we all agree that if it is a doctor, it is clear that we should prioritize that person

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,860
Then we have learned something that we can bring it out in real life.

67
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,400
Or if we learn that it is not important what they have for professions

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,480
and that it is not important what types of life they will live

69
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,600
After they have become healthy, then we have also learned something.

70
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,320
Then we can bring this knowledge out in real life

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,940
Where we will encounter much more complex cases and situations.

72
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,820
I think it should look at these types of questions.

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,620
Another topical question is how much we should slow down the economy

74
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,680
to save human life. How would you reason about this?

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,240
What I think is interesting in such cases

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,120
is to ask the question is what we really want to know when we make such a comparison

77
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,020
About economic prosperity and human life.

78
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,680
And i think it is not about

79
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04.640
that those who advocate financially and that we are not allowed to take on everything for drastic methods

80
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07.820
Because it will have bad consequences for GDP and so on.

81
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,860
What they mean is probably not that we should

82
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,580
Protect people's money on the bank, without they mean it will have poor health effects

83
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,020
on individuals and society if we choose

84
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,840
To put too much financial resources here and now.

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,200
So what is really important

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,160
In this election situation, perhaps the health aspect is.

87
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,440
So it may not be about two fundamentally different

88
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,580
values where we are to compare economy and human life

89
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,740
but in many ways it is probably about

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,480
Health aspects here as well. And then it is important to know what would have the best health effects.

91
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:52.080
Is it not not to make a total lockdown

92
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,340
Or is to actually do it. Which has the best health effects?

93
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02.620
And that is a question that others may be better suited to answer

94
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05.820
But I think it's important to see that it doesn't have to be about

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09.540
Two widely different values that are in conflict here really.

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Do you think philosopher's knowledge is utilized in this Corona crisis?

97
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,920
To some extent it has been done because moral foil has been involved in

98
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,900
to develop different guidelines, far earlier but also to some extent now

99
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,600
How to make priorities.

100
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,980
It is clear that our knowledge could perhaps be used more than that.

101
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,780
Above all, perhaps for individuals in society.

102
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,660
I think it's a special time now

103
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,460
Then many people can live their everyday life without having to think

104
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,920
Too much on ethical issues.

105
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:54,000
You may have pondered some things in periods in your life, many times maybe in your teens:

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,500
is it right or wrong to eat meat

107
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,480
and one may have come up with an answer to that

108
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02.940
and can justify for oneself and others to do so,

109
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,720
Or you put your head in the sand.

110
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,000
And so you can live a rather carefree life afterwards

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,340
Because one has made many ethical positions

112
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,080
But today it seems that we are facing ethical positions daily

113
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,860
And difficult questions even in our everyday lives.

114
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,720
Should we go to Åre or may I go and visit my older parents or whatever it may be.

115
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,660
There are many difficult ethical decisions that we encounter daily.

116
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,260
And there I think there is a lot of expertise in philosophy

117
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,000
To help people make these decisions.

118
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,640
Above all, I think philosophers can contribute

119
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,500
The tools needed to answer these types of questions.

120
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,900
To give people concepts to that

121
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,140
Discuss this and know how to reason.

122
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,460
It might facilitate their ethical pondering.

123
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:06,340
One last question: Do you think that the Corona crisis will in any way affect research in philosophy?

124
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09.540
I certainly think it will.

125
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,080
There will be some ethical issues that one must address

126
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,120
After all this is overplayed.

127
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,600
It is perhaps difficult to say what those issues will be here and now

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,480
But I also think it will affect philosophers

129
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,400
in the way we discuss many times

130
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,860
quite extreme situations on a very theoretical plane

131
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,940
We are thinking about extreme situations

132
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,180
and trying to come up with answers how to act in those cases

133
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
And now we may be in such a situation.

134
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,340
And then maybe there is an opportunity for us philosophers

135
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,700
To ask the question again.

136
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,920
Now that it really is a reality, I can still stuck to my opinion

137
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56.560
And can I still think my arguments are holding?

138
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,740
It is perhaps an opportunity to think about their positions once again. I think so.

139
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05.020
Thanks so much Henrik Andersson

140
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,399
It was all for this time and more news

141
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,920
