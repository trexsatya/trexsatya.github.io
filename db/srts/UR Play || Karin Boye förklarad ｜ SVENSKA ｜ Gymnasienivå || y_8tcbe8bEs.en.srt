00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,520
When Karin Boye is found dead behind a stone in AlingsÃ¥s in April 1941-

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,600
-Have one of our most prominent poets and writers gone out of time.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,360
She goes from writing emotional and vulnerable poems-

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,560
-To dystopian social depictions.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,200
But how are it, and what did her lyrics bottom in?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
"Yes, of course it hurts" and "in motion"-

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,200
-Is two of Karin Boye's most loved and known poems.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,520
"The saturated day, it's never the biggest. The best day ..."

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,200
It is precisely mainly for her poems that we remember her.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52.720
But a few years before she dies, 40 years old-

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,800
-she gives out a novel that makes people amazed.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,800
A science fiction novel with dystopian element-

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03.320
-If a future surveillance society. "Kallocain."

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07.800
It was so controversial that it was banned in several countries.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,440
Kallocain caught a lot of appearance when it came out.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,240
A very surprising, interesting leap in her literary development.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,680
Karin Boye was born in 1900 in Gothenburg in an upper middle class home.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,800
The family then moves to Huddinge in Stockholm.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,400
She spends lots of time reading and writing.

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,240
As a ten year old, she has started writing poetry and short novels.

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36.560
After attending girls' school at high school-

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,200
-Moves Karin to Uppsala to go to university.

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,280
A male -dominated environment where female students are unusual.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49.560
Karin gets her eyes on how unequal women are treated in teaching.

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,240
She had been staying in girl environments, so this with inequality-

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,480
-In how boys and girls were treated would not have been a matter for her.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,320
Now she came to a very male -dominated environment.

28
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06.640
One in many ways conservative environment-

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,280
-There the girls, the student shoes were something unusual.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,880
Some thought they were intrusion into that environment.

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,800
After all, it sharpened her gaze for injustice in society.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,520
An idea is raised at Karin at the university.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
She has written extensively since she was little-

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
-And now wants to start sharing their texts with more.

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,640
She gathered her best old poems and went to Bonniers publisher-

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,040
-To Karl Otto Bonnier and asked if she could be published.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,640
After only a few weeks they heard from them and said, "Yes, you are accepted."

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,240
So she was 21 years old. It was something very unique then.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,120
The debut book "Cloud" is a collection of poems about a young man's pondering.

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,000
About life, about God, about his own future.

41
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02.880
Suddenly she became a celebrity in Uppsala, a literary celebrity-

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05.640
-So then she got into these author gangs.

43
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09.640
Then she became more politically radicalized too.

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,760
With feminism she had discovered the injustices between men and women-

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,160
-and it was the next logical step to detect the injustices between class-

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,080
-and between different countries.

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,480
Interest in politics and how people in other countries had it-

48
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
-Growing with Karin and she started traveling.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
Among other things, she goes to the then Soviet Union and is struck by the oppression.

50
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,680
1932 she travels to Berlin, the year before Hitler takes power-

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,120
-and sees how Nazism begins to permeate society-

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,360
-But then without understanding the seriousness, as for so many others.

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,720
She is curious and observes. Fascination mixed with fear-

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,640
-What is visible in her texts.

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,240
But the trip down to Germany she not only did for the sake of travel.

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,520
Her real reason was to get help.

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,240
She had wrestled with her sexuality and attraction to women.

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,320
Something she tried to push away, as homosexuality was seen as immoral-

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,360
-classed as a disease and was criminal.

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,280
She wanted to cure herself from it, so she would not be drawn with it.

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,360
Then the method of the time was to go into psychoanalysis.

62
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,400
But instead of, as she calls it, "being cured"-

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,640
-She is recommended to live out her desires.

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,640
"Purple that page instead. Try to live gay."

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52.560
Then she did. She was out on "Dambars" there.

66
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,760
In the letters home, she talks about her forbidden love relationships.

67
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,160
Maybe it was the fear of having its secret revealed-

68
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,240
-and the feeling of being supervised-

69
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08.840
-which it was the first seed of the novel "Kallocain". That and Kafka.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,440
It is very clear that she was inspired by the outside world-

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,640
-But for Karin, the big thing was that she read Kafka.

72
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,280
This horror mood and feeling that the world is incomprehensible and evil.

73
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,800
She took it with her.

74
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29.640
Kallocain is very interesting literary history-

75
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34.560
-Stheft it is a fairly early, in Swedish context, dystopia.

76
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,640
In the subtitle of Kallocain it says "a story from the 21st century".

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,600
Kallocain takes place in a future community-

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,160
-Where several totalitarian states dominate the earth.

79
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
The main character is called Leo Kall.

80
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,800
He is a chemist who is loyal to the future despotic society.

81
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02.440
He invents a truth drug that he calls Kallocain.

82
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09.720
Leo cold, the narrator, is a scientific man, so it's a pretty dry prose.

83
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,960
I am an insignificant cell in the state organism.

84
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,680
But there are other elements as well. They eventually show up-

85
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,560
-Recomy when he interviews people with Kallocainet's help-

86
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,040
-The you hear other thoughts, much more emotionally, lyrical language.

87
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,080
But even the dialogues he agrees with wife Linda has a different language.

88
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,920
And the poetic language could sound like this:

89
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Then one should remember that this with truth-

90
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,680
-and to be able to maintain a personal reserve-

91
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,840
-We something very deep for her, to do with her homosexuality.

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,960
In a future society of truth drug-

93
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,000
-Can not keep your innermost sexual and private.

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,840
It was something that scared her very much.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,480
When "Kallocain" comes out, it becomes popular in Sweden.

96
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,920
In Norway and Denmark, which are under Nazi occupation, it is banned.

97
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,800
The consequence is that it is pirated and spread anyway.

98
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,480
There was a possibility that it could have gained even greater spread.

99
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,920
There were thoughts of translating it and releasing it in the United States.

100
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,960
Karin Boye was familiar with Gunnar Myrdal, who was a researcher in the United States.

101
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,360
He would bring the book with him.

102
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,280
But he was overweight on the flight and had to leave the books at home.

103
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,360
It was that random story that made it not come there-

104
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,120
-And the right person was not spoken.

105
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11.560
I don't know if they sent it, but there was nothing with translation.

106
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,520
But in that case, it had arrived a few years before George Orwell's 1984.

107
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,240
But if the surveillance community was relevant in the 40-

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,880
-Is it no less relevant today.

109
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,200
In many ways, Karin Boye's depictions were before her time.

110
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,200
All these small cramped spaces that people live in, in the underground.

111
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,120
Police eyes and police ears, even the bed room is guarded by the state-

112
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,000
-So that you know that it is bred children, that is, future soldiers.

113
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53.560
So Kallocain is not just a novel about surveillance technology and sow-

114
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,400
-What is a novel about closing women's life opportunities.

115
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,400
And there is probably something that has become more and more relevant over the years.

116
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,320
And Karin Boye still inspires contemporary writers and poets-

117
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,840
-When Athena Farrokhzad, who named her latest book after the poem "In Motion".

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,520
In the beginning when I met her I probably considered her like this-

119
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,760
-Reding, existential, tormented the poet.

120
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,480
But as I got older, I realized that she addressed urgent questions-

121
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:39,000
-Not only the existential, without political circumstances in the contemporary.

122
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,800
The years before Karin dies, it seems that she is in balance.

123
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,760
But an unanswered love gets in the way.

124
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,200
In despair she ends up in old habits.

125
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,400
She had a pattern throughout her life with staged suicide attempts-

126
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,440
-The time arranged so she could manage, be found, be saved.

127
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,240
But this April night in 1941 no one sees she leaving the house-

128
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,960
-and no one who can save her.

129
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,760
Her life gets a dramatic and abrupt end.

130
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,120
The suicide was a mistake, a classic cry for help that failed.

131
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,560
This life force has been lost.

132
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,880
It is important to come back to this living Karin Boye.

133
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37.560
Yes, it hurts when buds are lacking.

134
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,800
Why else would spring hesitate?

135
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,800
Why would all our hot longing be tied in the frozen bitter pale?

136
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,760
After all, the casing was the bud all winter.

137
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,760
