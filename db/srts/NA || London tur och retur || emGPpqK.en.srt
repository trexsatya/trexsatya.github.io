1
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.880
I know Astra is on her way up.
 It is too risky -

2
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.720
- Even considering the interest rate announcement.

3
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.520
No, with the GATT Agreement in Risk Zone-

4
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.000
- Is it uncertain to invest in Latin America.

5
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.240
Yes ... and you don't forget to do the homework and put the milk in the fridge.

6
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.840
Hello then, Max.
 Kiss!

7
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.640
KNOCK

8
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240
Come in!

9
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.920
Hello.
 All is well?

10
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.240
Yes, but there is a lot to do.
 Was it something special?

11
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.880
No.
 You enjoy the job?
 A month as a manager - everything flows as it should?

12
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.240
It goes very well.
 Unfortunately, you get harvested as chambers for a few more years.

13
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.200
- I have a little stressful ... –May!
 Have you seen the latest courier?

14
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.880
-How lucky!
 But look ... - What have you boiled together?

15
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.040
Solveig Nordenskiöld at Nordbanken: "With us your money is safe."
 Huh?

16
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:23.240
She looks like Ulf Elfving.
 Embarrassing with everyone who should be in the newspaper.

17
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.280
- It is enough to do your job.
 - Not according to the head office.

18
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.400
You will represent our bank on next week's center spread.

19
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.960
- I can take it instead.
 - Reminished manager at the rise ...

20
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.560
- I should be in the newspaper!
 - What a perception of perception!

21
00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.720
-What should I wear?
 !
 - Should I ask Elfving where he goes?

22
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:11.360
Quiet.
 You should show yourself as you are.
 You work at a bank for the small savers.

23
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:19.000
They want an article where the small savers can bring up confidence in the bank.

24
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.040
-When is it?
 - In the morning at seven.

25
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:32.080
- Maja, book Grand Hotel's crystal room.
 -It is local press, not satellite TV.

26
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.640
That's the difference between us, Rune.
 I think globally, you municipal.

27
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.960
It is the humility they are looking for!

28
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.920
The interview, and major office manager, is done in your home.
 Simple and relaxed.

29
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.320
In order to ... "show that our bank" -

30
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.960
- "Has managers who are quite common".

31
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.040
- Take the pictures in the garage.
 -Good luck!
 We keep our fingers crossed.

32
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.560
Take it easy, it's just the local press.

33
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.920
Just.

34
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.560
One more thing...

35
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.640
- That fruit bowl was very empty, you.
 -Yes.

36
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.160
- I fill it.
 - Make it, you are kind.

37
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.920
- Shit, shit, shit!
 - Fifted Dan in a row it burns ...

38
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.320
They complicate everything!

39
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.880
- Warm the cup cannot fail.
 - It goes.
 Look here.

40
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.920
- There is Africa and there is Antarctica.
 -What's that?
 A boat?

41
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.840
It's the fish stick from yesterday.

42
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.440
- You can't cook.
 - It is a matter of setting up!

43
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:28.040
- We have to cooperate.
 - You cook the food, we throw it.

44
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.040
-Hello!
 –20 buckets were, if you keep the color.

45
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.320
- MMM, how exciting it smells.
 - Yes, we have eaten a hearty meal.

46
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.760
Yes, we are really big.

47
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.040
Do you know who will be in the courier?

48
00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:02.000
You don't mean ...?
 They brought my submitter on the roof on the stand stand!

49
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.920
- Now it gets up to the municipal guys.
 - It doesn't apply to you, that applies to me.

50
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:18.440
They want to make a report on me in an article series about the banks' future.

51
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:26.080
The head office chose me.
 There is a journalist and a photographer here.

52
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.880
-Wonderfully!
 Here?
 - The clock seven tomorrow night.

53
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:41.360
- We have to clean, we have to move ... - no.
 Everything should be as usual.

54
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.360
- No weirdness, nothing unnecessary.
 - Where are we going to hide dad?

55
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.360
- Are you not happy for my sake?
 - Yes, of course.

56
00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:02.080
- But where are my football trophy?
 - They are not interested in it.

57
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.720
- You have already been in the newspaper.
 - You rolled with the bike at Konsum.

58
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.280
I won the competition "The county's fastest postman".

59
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:24.000
Who came up with the idea of fifteen half -fat postmen on each post cycle?

60
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:31.160
It was a folk party!
 Where is the article?
 I framed it.

61
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.640
- It hangs well in the countryside.
 - You don't go!

62
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:44.520
I have never been seen before.
 I was never chosen for Lucia.

63
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:52.600
That place was important for Nettan Olsén - my God, she does not forget.

64
00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:00.600
- Did you know what we guys called her?
 - Yes, and you don't say that here!

65
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:08.160
- I and dad can go somewhere else.
 - Don't interfere with this!

66
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.680
- Now it's me to be seen!
 -Okay!

67
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.680
- Gustav?
 - We should not be in the way.
 I promise.

68
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.760
- Max ... is mom at home?
 - She hasn't arrived yet.

69
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.960
-Where have you been?
 - In the country and fixed a thing.

70
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.520
She kills you!

71
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:10.920
This shows what an equal family we are.
 We are all in the newspaper sometimes.

72
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.960
- You can't look like that.
 - It's your genes.

73
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.480
Hello, old man.
 Now it will happen soon.

74
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.560
-Where is Dad?
 -Where.

75
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.720
My God, I knew it!

76
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.400
-What are you wearing?
 - Everything else is in the laundry.

77
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:56.560
The competition dress?
 Stay in the background - it's me they're going to interview.

78
00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:04.000
- I should show that you have succeeded with me.
 - I can say that I am adopted.

79
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.200
The doorbell

80
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:12.800
- You put on something decent.
 - Do you have a dress I can borrow?

81
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.560
Max - up!

82
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:24.560
- Josefin.
 We are here for the interview.
 -Hello.
 Peo.

83
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.120
- Was it difficult to find?
 - Yes, all houses are the same.

84
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.360
- This is Lina.
 - Silver in the Örebro Cup.

85
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:45.040
- You get to train as long as you want.
 -Thanks.
 - The SM is starting to approach ...

86
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.920
This is how I live.
 Simple and usual.
 No weirdness.

87
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.040
Do you want a glass of plain water?

88
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.720
I don't know how you want to do ...

89
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:13.320
- I think we start.
 - You can sit on the regular sofa.

90
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:19.200
The article series has received a lot of attention.

91
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:27.000
Okay, keep your thumbs up!
 - Oh ... Hello.
 Gustav Svensson was the name.

92
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.000
- Josefin.
 There is my photographer, Peo.
 - Tjena, Peo.

93
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:39.280
Excuse the upholstery.
 I am the center in the postal team.

94
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:46.280
- Have you got coffee?
 - You can pick up the coffee, Gustav.

95
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:53.200
- I am very proud of my wife.
 - Gustav, coffee!

96
00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:03.720
-Nice man.
 Does he work at the post?
 - Yes, he is ... distribution cases.

97
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.360
-Shall we continue?
 - Yes, as I said ...

98
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:17.320
Your relationship with the customers ... the small savers lost on the crisis.

99
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.000
Here was coffee in long courses.

100
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.280
Vivalla Football Association 1973?

101
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.160
After the qualification in Division 6. There I am.

102
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.560
Sugar!

103
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:52.440
What would you like to say to those who doubt the savings bank?

104
00:12:52.600 --> 00:13:00.960
I work hard.
 After all, my task is not to suck out the small savers.

105
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.800
It was an original sugar bowl.

106
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.960
Skåne Cup –73.

107
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:22.960
- I found no sugar bowl.
 - I saw it in the garage.

108
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:30.040
We have a match on Saturday.
 Roofs are needed on the standing stand.

109
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.200
- But I've written a submitter ... - Garage!

110
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.920
We meet ICA 15.30.

111
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.080
I apologize for my husband.

112
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:50.600
The managerial job means so much else, with the EU and the borders that are opened ...

113
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.000
Who knows how long I sit here?

114
00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:02.120
In an expanding market, we must be prepared for all eventualities.

115
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:09.120
- Forgiveness - 14.30 the match begins.
 - Yes ... 14.30.

116
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:22.400
Imagine we have lived here for 15 years now.
 I think it has gone so fast.

117
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:30.600
When we got here I wore my red -white dress and you had a stomach.

118
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:38.600
- I've really been happy here.
 -I also.
 Especially with the dish.

119
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.480
But life is not as you imagined.

120
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.000
Yes, only you plan.

121
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.320
The bank has a branch in London-

122
00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:01.760
- And the leadership keeps an eye on those who show the front feet.

123
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.160
What would you say about moving?

124
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.560
I'm needed here!
 What would you say if I disappeared?

125
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.280
-"Hurray!"
 perhaps.
 - I don't just distribute post ...

126
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:23.400
- If you knew what people entrust me!
 - You help Persson with the rough garbage.

127
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:30.760
It doesn't have to mean anything, but I thought the interview went so well.

128
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:39.040
Please Gustav, listen now.
 If we get the chance, we have to take it!

129
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:46.440
Imagine us in London!
 A new life, a new country, a new language!

130
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:54.400
Do you think an interview in the courier gives you a top job in the banking world?

131
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.320
Nice that you have your feet on the ground.

132
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.680
Hello.
 My name is Lena Svensson.

133
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.480
In Started My Career a Long Time ago in Sweden.

134
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.240
Sweden is a very cold country.

135
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.640
Budentralen.

136
00:16:52.800 --> 00:17:00.320
Has it arrived?
 The newspaper.
 The article about Lena Svensson, bank manager.

137
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:09.680
Yes, yes ... no, I don't think so.
 Was it today it would come?

138
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:15.640
–60 courier ordered.
 - I have not ordered.

139
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.800
Let them lie down because you have gone up here.

140
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:28.480
- Have they come?
 –60 each that Lena has not ordered.

141
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.560
It was good that you came.
 We will talk about the future.

142
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.560
Nothing is determined yet-

143
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:46.560
- But I may need to stay more time abroad now.

144
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:52.560
- Should we read first?
 - Lena, you look really nice.

145
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.280
Who stands outside the window with a trophy?

146
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.640
Lena Svensson, the boss who does not let the success rise to her head.

147
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.840
Everyone's money is equally worthy.

148
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.200
"I work hard. My task is after all to suck out the small savers."

149
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.920
- Read what it says.
 -I did it!

150
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:31.960
"My job is to suck out the small savers," says Lena smiling.

151
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.800
I didn't say!
 I didn't say suck out the small savers, of course!

152
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.760
You have to believe me!

153
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:48.280
We believe you.
 The question is whether the small savers do.

154
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.440
-What should I do?
 –Singapore 6 900 ...

155
00:18:53.600 --> 00:19:00.760
- The head office burns me on a bonfire!
 - Not if the small savers come first.

156
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.680
Do not answer!
 Cancel all meetings.

157
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.880
I barricades the main entrance.
 I'm kidding.

158
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.360
- It's enough if we lock it.
 - How should I come out unseen?

159
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.320
There is a gap in the elevator shaft ...

160
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:25.160
Calm down, it's a wrong quote.
 You have nothing to be afraid of.

161
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:31.960
And I was going to London.
 Everything was clear.

162
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:39.200
- London is cheaper than Singapore.
 - Fun, Rune.
 You are of great help ...

163
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.760
-Password?
 -Open!

164
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.160
- Open, fuck!
 -Right.

165
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:10.760
No one cares about the article.
 Mom has been home for two days.

166
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:18.640
- But today she opened the blinds.
 - What are you afraid of really?

167
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.040
The media's impact beats blindly and ruthlessly.

168
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:33.040
Think of Stig Malm, Hans Holmér ... The list of innocent victims is endless.

169
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:41.040
- And here comes the last in the line.
 - Many people want to hurt your mother.

170
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:50.120
- We have a solution to the problem.
 - Wedding beards and bulletproof vest?

171
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:56.120
Personal letters to the small savers or a dementia.

172
00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:04.440
- In the garden they are waiting with rope.
 - I am not ripe for such jokes.

173
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:12.720
- My submitter came in.
 - Have you written to the courier?

174
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.320
Better.
 Express.

175
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:22.600
Lol!
 "Hello, B.O. I think it's too damn" -

176
00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:31.000
- "That journalists are allowed to write anything without being imprisoned."

177
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:39.360
"Mom is innocent. Mikael Jackson too. Lina. I love horses."

178
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.480
- A law -historical moment.
 - Fint, Lina.

179
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:53.280
- It's going to be no London now, huh?
 - But you dreamed, that's the important thing!

180
00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.760
- What had I been without dreams?
 - Helt Normal, maybe.

181
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:07.760
Yes exactly.
 Who wants to be?
 Keep the dream alive!

182
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:13.560
- I will improve in my English.
 -Good!

183
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:20.720
- Everything is not about career.
 - The course ends in May.

184
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.280
The London chief is coming in August.

185
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:31.840
Then I'll show up for big tasks!

186
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.840
I'll arrange with dementia.
 The magazine can photograph me down in the pub.

187
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.880
I take the tweed suit and sit in the English armchair with a little sherry.

188
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:55.880
Heading - "Lena Svensson speaks about the felvitat and the future Europe."

189
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.360
Then dad cooks food again.

190
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.040
