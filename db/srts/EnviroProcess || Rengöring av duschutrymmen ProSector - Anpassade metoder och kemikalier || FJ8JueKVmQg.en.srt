00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:28.028
Hey, today I was going to clean a shower room at a public bathing facility.

2
00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:38.539
So I was going to go through some basics, talk about what you need to have, to do a good job on walls and floors.

3
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.011
It is important that we have protective equipment.

4
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:55.055
Long gloves, goggles, there are slightly different variants, boots or protective shoes.

5
00:00:57.024 --> 00:01:01.028
We will work with an alkaline agent and an acidic agent.

6
00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:07.001
We will work out the agent with a foam cannon,

7
00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:13.741
And we will work with brushes, soft brushes.

8
00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:19.713
And we will use floor scraper.

9
00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:27.688
The alkaline agent is an agent that removes organic dirt.

10
00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:37.531
Organic dirt is, among other things, fat, what we have on the body, oils etc. and this will end up on the wall.

11
00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:59.150
When you shower and soap your entire body, the dirt ends up in a radius around the body, a little bit on the side and down.

12
00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:09.029
We have talked about the importance of goggles.

13
00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:21.008
For example, when we have to fill the foam cannon, this is often where the accidents happen ...

14
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.082
It can splash in the eyes and then it is very important that we have goggles.

15
00:02:30.084 --> 00:02:38.392
Should the accident occur, it is good to have eye shower, I have a portable eye shower.

16
00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:47.334
Most often, the eye shower is in a storage room where we store the chem.

17
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.976
But great to have a portable if the accident should occur.

18
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.317
We're running

19
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:05.853
We will start by applying the alkaline agent and I take on the glasses.

20
00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.025
Now I have prepared with alkaline agent in the foam cannon.

21
00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:20.033
We will work with cold water, or barely lukewarm.

22
00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:28.108
It is because the chemist works best with cold water.

23
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.018
If you don't have access to cold water in the taps, make sure you get it.

24
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.023
We will start by applying from the bottom and further up.

25
00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:47.694
And why do we do that

26
00:03:48.028 --> 00:04:03.010
Well, if we start from the top and go down, the agent can run down, and fat and oils penetrate joints and give discoloration.

27
00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:07.082
So that's why we put from below and go up.

28
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.083
I show.

29
00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:18.025
And here you do not have to put on every centimeter, have an even flow upwards.

30
00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:20.853
Let's go

31
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:34.007
I put the chemical out to the shower head.

32
00:04:36.043 --> 00:04:38.612
I also put a string at the bottom.

33
00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:50.390
Important, put down the cannon because if it falls, they often break.

34
00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:56.029
We will work with soft, or medium -hard brushes.

35
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.003
And when we put out the chem, we let it work for five minutes.

36
00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:13.847
Like that, now five minutes have passed and it's time to start working on the surfaces.

37
00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:20.520
I know many people enjoy working with scurry blocks,

38
00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:26.493
But for best results we use brushes.

39
00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:35.669
If we use scrubblock now I hold it with a handle but there is also for rod,

40
00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:45.445
Then you do not get into the joints, does not matter how hard I press, I do not get into the joint.

41
00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.249
And then we get a bad result.

42
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:53.019
Work with brushes.

43
00:05:54.354 --> 00:06:01.027
And, here it is important that you do not push the brush so hard, now we just have to work out the drug.

44
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.402
If we press too hard, then you see what happens to the hair on the brush,

45
00:06:09.403 --> 00:06:11.671
they bend aside and then we will not ate the joints

46
00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:24.851
Without now, we will work back and forth, important that we work in the corners.

47
00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:34.161
We work in one direction first and then we take the next direction.

48
00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:40.233
As you can see, I don't take much.

49
00:06:57.217 --> 00:07:06.026
We work with the floor as well, and here we have special floors, with a lot of structure so we should not slip,

50
00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:12.516
So here it is extra important that we access every millimeter.

51
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:23.343
Work back and forth, do not press with the brush but let the chemistry and the brush work.

52
00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:57.010
So now that we have worked with the chemistry and of course with the whole wall, I disconnect the foam cannon.
 Now we will rinse off.

53
00:08:02.015 --> 00:08:04.017
It is important to find a beam that is adequate.

54
00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:13.960
Rinse plenty of water.

55
00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:46.693
As I said before: Important to work with cold water or barely lukewarm.

56
00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:57.003
If you work with warm water you get an aerosol formation, and we do not want that.

57
00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:05.011
So then we have run the alkaline agent.
 Now we will take the sour agent.

58
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:26.699
The acidic agent removes inorganic dirt.
 Such as salt, urine, sweat, lime etc.

59
00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:32.672
Goggles on

60
00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:52.025
We dose in the same way, from the bottom up.
 The agent flows about 30 cm, and this is because it is gel -based agents.

61
00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:55.543
I post

62
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:16.649
Do you now see on the surface that the chem is flowing down, but only a short distance, because it is gel -based.

63
00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:32.031
While it is running down, the agent works with the dirt and we let it work for five minutes.

64
00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:44.010
Now it's been five minutes and it's time to work.
 We do the same way.

65
00:10:56.022 --> 00:11:04.497
Then, when we run the entire surface, we rinse.

66
00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.018
Remember to put the cannon on the floor.

67
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.439
We rinse off.

68
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.649
This is how we have worked with the sour drug.

69
00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:38.631
When working with shower walls and floors, we work with the alkaline agent 2 days.

70
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.071
So only the alkaline agent and then for example Monday and Tuesday

71
00:11:47.807 --> 00:11:52.011
Then, the third day, on Wednesday, you take the sour agent

72
00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:57.350
So two days alkaline and one day sour.

73
00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:04.690
Then you get the best out of the funds and you get a nice and clean plant.

74
00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:20.339
After every time you have run chemistry and when you are done with the flushing you should work with the surface disinfection.

75
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.480
Now we have flushed away the chem and we have scraped dry.
 Then it's time to put out surface disinfection.

76
00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:35.021
And the surface disinfection removes bacteria, viruses and algae.

77
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:40.893
It goes down about a few cm in the joint.

78
00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:46.766
Normally you lay it out with a low pressure syringe.

79
00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:54.340
There are slightly different variants on low -pressure syringes.

80
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.010
Now I have already dosed clearly and this is done with water and chemistry.

81
00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:03.015
I start it.

82
00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:08.020
We post.

83
00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:13.025
You don't have to spray the entire surface.

84
00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.699
You see it becomes a spray fog

85
00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:24.003
Such more than that you don't have to do

86
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:37.016
Now you let the agent work for 15 minutes after that you can go in and shower.
 So you don't flush this.

87
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.553
This kills bacteria and viruses.

88
00:13:44.557 --> 00:13:47.526
Ok a small summary of what we have done here today.

89
00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:51.030
We have used an alkaline agent.

90
00:13:51.364 --> 00:14:07.013
A gel -based agent that removes the organic dirt eg shampoo, oil fat etc.

91
00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:21.360
We have used an acidic agent that removes sweat, salt, urine, lime etc.
 The inorganic dirt.

92
00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:34.006
We have used a surface disinfection that removes bacteria, viruses and algae.

93
00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:53.025
To my help I have used a foam cannon, a low -pressure syringe, soft and medium -hard brushes and a scraper.

94
00:14:55.027 --> 00:15:09.008
When you have done this, you will have a brilliant fine facility and your customers will come back to your bath.
