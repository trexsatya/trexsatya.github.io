1
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:08,666
What is psychosis?

2
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,216
We will find out today.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,866
When someone experiences a psychosis one has

4
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:18,850
hard to distinguish between between imagination and reality

5
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,350
And it can manifest in different ways,

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,400
As for example through a sense of paranoia where the person

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,150
may feel persecuted or in danger without a concrete reason.

8
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:34,383
Or by hearing voices, which is a type of hallucination

9
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:39,866
where people hear sounds or conversations that others cannot hear.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,983
Psychosis Diseases are a collective name for illnesses

11
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:46,266
Where reality is experienced differently.

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,166
The most common psychotic disease is schizophrenia

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,466
Which I have also made a separate video about.

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,083
But there are also others such as

15
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,516
reactive psychosis that is a temporary psychosis

16
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:02,516
triggered by stressful events,

17
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:05,033
Schizoa -efficient syndrome

18
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:09,450
that combines schizophrenia symptoms with mood swings,

19
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:13,316
delusions syndrome, giving prolonged

20
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:17,950
delusions without other psychotic symptoms.

21
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:21,216
And then there is something called birth psychosis.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,033
It is a rare type of psychosis that can occur shortly after childbirth.

23
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:28,350
Psychosis is not

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,516
a disease in itself without rather a group of symptoms that may

25
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:36,850
be part of several different mental health conditions.

26
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:40,066
It is important to understand that a psychosis is something that can hit

27
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,366
Anyone and there is nothing the person himself has chosen.

28
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,933
Symptoms may occur as a result of frightening or severe events,

29
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:53,133
other diseases or use of certain types of drugs.

30
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:56,933
There is help to get and with the right support and treatment, many can live

31
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:00,666
A good life despite periods of psychosis.

32
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,350
But what exactly does it mean to have a

33
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,783
Psychosis and what is it causing?

34
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:09,866
A psychosis can develop in different ways.

35
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,766
It can occur suddenly or gradually over a longer period.

36
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,850
How long a psychosis can last can also vary

37
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:20,250
From just a few weeks to several years,

38
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,266
and it can either occur a single time

39
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:26,033
or return on several occasions.

40
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:30,833
During an ongoing psychosis, the individual is usually strongly engaged in their own

41
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:36,516
Thoughts and experiences that can be very intense and overwhelming.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,550
If you experience the following symptoms, it may be a sign of psychosis.

43
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:47,650
Delusions, hallucinations and thought disorders.

44
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,433
Delusions mean

45
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,616
that your perception of reality is changed

46
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,716
And often in a way that is difficult for others to understand or to believe.

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,766
For example, you may experience a strong feeling that you are persecuted,

48
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,566
Although there is no evidence of this, which is a form of paranoia.

49
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,066
You may also be convinced that you possess special

50
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:15,300
supernatural abilities and has a great important fate

51
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:20,700
Like you are selected to do any special assignment for the good of humanity.

52
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:25,283
You may experience that you are in danger, perhaps exposed to radiation from space

53
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:30,483
Or other threats, even if there is no concrete evidence of this.

54
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,916
In addition, you may feel that the surroundings are communicating with you

55
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,916
By sending secret personal messages,

56
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,650
Maybe via radio, TV or on the internet.

57
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,733
Messages that only you can understand.

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,600
These experiences are often very intense and experienced

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,900
As completely real, even though no one else around you experiences them.

60
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,750
Hallucinations mean that

61
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,983
You experience and see things that are not in the real world.

62
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:01,950
You can hear voices that no one else hears.

63
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,616
You can see things that are not there,

64
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:08,366
feel things on your skin that are not there or even feel

65
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:13,083
Smells and flavors of things that are not there.

66
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,066
Thought disorders means that your thinking can

67
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:20,100
be confusing and difficult to follow and understand to others around you.

68
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:25,450
You can jump between different subjects and ideas without a clear connection between them.

69
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:30,000
Your thoughts may feel spinning and overwhelming and that

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,816
Can be difficult to focus on one thing at a time.

71
00:04:33,883 --> 00:04:37,883
This makes it difficult for you to make decisions and to solve problems,

72
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:42,850
Which can make everyday tasks very challenging.

73
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,566
What causes a psychosis?

74
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:48,683
Psychosis may have different causes and there are

75
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:52,383
Several factors that can increase the risk of developing the condition.

76
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:56,733
Here are some of the most common causes and risk factors.

77
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:58,400
Heredity.

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,716
If there are psychotic diseases in the family, the risk of developing a psychosis may be higher.

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,400
Trauma and experiences of trauma, especially

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,666
During childhood, can increase the risk of psychosis later in life.

81
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,283
High stress levels or significant life changes

82
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:20,883
may trigger psychotic episodes in some individuals.

83
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:24,566
Prolonged sleep deprivation and even psychiatric

84
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,316
condition such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,316
It is important to note that psychosis is not always linked to another illness

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,200
and can be triggered by an isolated event.

87
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:43,450
In addition, a combination of different factors can contribute to the development of psychosis

88
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:46,900
And different individuals can have different risk factors.

89
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:50,516
But as I said, psychosis can hit anyone,

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,816
regardless of age, gender or life situation.

91
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,500
Although certain risk factors may increase the likelihood of some individuals

92
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:02,783
is there help to get when someone is undergoing a

93
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:07,516
Psychosis becomes the changes in behavior often noticeable to those around them.

94
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,733
Especially if you know the person before.

95
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:14,466
For example, a person may begin to tell about their delusions madmen

96
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,183
Like feeling persecuted or being exposed to threats.

97
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:21,616
It may also be obvious by the person not answering when

98
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:25,650
one is trying to get in touch or that they talk to themselves or

99
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,250
Maybe even breaks out in laughter for no apparent reason.

100
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:33,800
People who experience a psychosis can sometimes feel an excessive

101
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:38,183
rising despair or hopelessness, which can lead them

102
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:43,416
to consider very serious and harmful actions against themselves.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,750
It is of utmost importance to seek professional help and support immediately.

104
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:54,400
If you or someone you know, these tanks or emotions are experiencing.

105
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:59,283
You can contact a psychiatric reception, a regular emergency room

106
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:03,333
Or if there is an acute risk of self -harm behavior.

107
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,966
Call 112

108
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,750

109
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,500
