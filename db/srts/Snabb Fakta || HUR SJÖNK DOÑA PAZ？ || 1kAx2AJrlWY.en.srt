1
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:12,416
The time was

2
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:17,583
06:30 in the morning December 20, 1987

3
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:22,566
When the Doña Paz ship left the port of Tacloban

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,416
located on the island of Leyte in the Philippines.

5
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:32,066
Ship Doña Paz was a passenger ferry built by the Japanese company

6
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:38,500
Onomichi Zosen of Hiroshima in Japan and was about 93 meters long,

7
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:43,616
13.6 meters wide and could take on board 1518

8
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:48,400
Passengers and 66 crew members.

9
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51.916
The ship operated the distance between the city of Tacloban

10
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:57.633
and the capital of Manilla in the Philippines, located on the island of Luzon

11
00:00:57,716 --> 00:01:02,200
With an intermediate stop in the city of Catbalogan on the island of Samar.

12
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:07,450
This route did Doña Paz twice a week.

13
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:12,466
When the ship left the harbor it was scheduled to arrive at Manilla the clock

14
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:17,133
Four in the morning the day after.

15
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:19,516
Philippines is a country consisting of

16
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:27,150
over 7000 islands and is completely dependent on vessels or boats as a means of transport between the islands,

17
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:34,350
Which makes passenger ferries the most economical mode of transport for many locals.

18
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,950
According to reports it is apparently very common

19
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,400
that the ferries are overloaded in the Philippines.

20
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:45,266
So even if a ship such as Doña Paz can only

21
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:51,783
Receive 1518 passengers and people are still crowded to come along.

22
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:57,400
And it is especially common before festivals as at this time,

23
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:01.466
Only a few days before Christmas.

24
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:05.416
When Doña Paz left the harbor after her stop in the Catbalog

25
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:10,116
It was clearly noticed that it tilted heavily to one side,

26
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:14,950
Which showed that it was overflowing with people.

27
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:22,166
According to reports and testimonies, over 4400 people were aboard the ship

28
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,466
And many of these were children under four years.

29
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,250
None of them knew they would soon be involved in the worst ship disaster ever

30
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:38,166
in peacetime.

31
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,266
A day before,

32
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,133
December 19 at.

33
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:47,400
20:00 in the evening, left the oil ship MT

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,900
Vector the port of Limay in the province of Batan in the Philippines

35
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:57,333
to get to destination even a masbate.

36
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01.416
The ship Mt Vector had 13 people in the herd

37
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:06,300
and was loaded with 8800 oil barrels

38
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:13,000
which included gasoline, kerosene and diesel.

39
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:16,000
December 20 at.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,266
22:29 - The ship Doña Paz was now out in the strait,

41
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:28,766
Table between the two islands of Marinduque and Mindoro.

42
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,666
It was a dark and silent night

43
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,850
but the waves were high and hit the ship

44
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:43,083
And somewhere out there in the dark, the ship MT Vector was also.

45
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:47,000
Right now we're just seconds from that disaster

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,050
that will soon occur.

47
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:56,583
Some things that are important to know at this time are the following.

48
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:03,116
Inside the vessel Doña Paz it was extremely crowded and most of the passengers tried to sleep.

49
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09.383
People slept in the corridors on top of the deck and almost all the cabins were overcrowded there.

50
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:13,750
3 to 4 people could split on a single bed.

51
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:20,100
The ship's communication system was broken so they could not call for help if needed.

52
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:23,716
The Life Rights on board were locked up in a separate room

53
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:28,800
And if that wasn't enough, the ship was also ruled at this time

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,550
An apprentice without sufficient experience.

55
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:41,216
The captain and the rest of the officers were either at the bar or watched TV in their staff room

56
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,000
And on board MT Vector it wasn't much better.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They were heavily understaffed with only 13 men.

58
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:55.883
They had no training in dealing with crisis situations, inadequate navigation equipment and that

59
00:04:55,883 --> 00:05:00,300
In its most recent inspection of the Philippine Coast Guard was discovered

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,300
That an MT Vector had an error on the steering.

61
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:09,150
The radio license had expired 1.5 years ago and they missed

62
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,916
also an inspection certificate.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,516
When the clock strikes 22:30 Mt Vector shows up

64
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,583
and collide with the port side of Doña Paz

65
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:31,716
Which knocked out the engines and all electricity on board.

66
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,950
In connection with the collision they ignited

67
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,083
8800 oil barrels aboard My Vector

68
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:49,533
which led to an immediate and powerful explosion.

69
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52.066
The explosion was so violent that

70
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:56,516
It immediately settled both vessels on fire.

71
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59.633
The passengers had nowhere to go.

72
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,300
The oil had leaked into the sea, as well as the water around.

73
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Both vessels were in flames.

74
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,450
No lifeboats could be hoisted down because of it.

75
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,450
The fire spread rapidly on deck and looked into cabins

76
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:18,183
And the social spaces that packed with people.

77
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:20,550
The life jackets were locked up.

78
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,350
The desperation caused many to jump out of the side of the ship

79
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:29,916
Just to land into the burning inferno below them.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,083
The crew of a ship named Don Claudio,

81
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:37,466
who found themselves some nautical miles from the collision, the explosion heard

82
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,800
and saw a fire bullet that towed up several hundred meters

83
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:45.866
in the air.

84
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,016
They arrived at the site

85
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:51.016
A few hours later and managed to save 26 people.

86
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:56,966
24 of them were from Doña Paz and two were from MT Vector.

87
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:02.433
They were taken ashore where they received medical care.

88
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:06.083
Doña Paz sank 2 hours after the collision

89
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:15,183
And Mt Vector sank 2 hours after that.

90
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,100
As I mentioned earlier it was

91
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,950
Over 4400 people aboard the Japans and 13 on 50 Vector.

92
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:27,750
And since only 26 people survived, this is

93
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,266
the worst ship disaster ever in peacetime.

94
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,166
Because most of the passengers are encapsulated

95
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:42,783
Inside that Japan, the total death number is unknown.

96
00:07:42,866 --> 00:07:52.416
But estimates show a figure that about 4385 people died in the accident.

97
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,600
Since no SOS signal was sent

98
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:01,300
Out it took about 8 hours before the Philippine Coast Guard learned about the accident

99
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:05.366
and another 8 hours before the rescue service was sent out.

100
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:10,316
But once they arrived at the scene, both vessels had dropped

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,250
a long time ago.

102
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:21,300
The tragic collision between Doña Paz and Mt Vector

103
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,450
Became an alarm clock for the whole world about the importance of security aboard passenger ships.

104
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:35,466
This event created a national grief over the entire Philippines and raised urgent questions

105
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:40,916
about how ships are maintained, about how many people they are allowed to wear really

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,266
And how well equipped they are for emergency situations.

107
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,216
We can only speculate what went through the head

108
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:53,583
on the passengers aboard Doña Paz who was stuck in their cabins

109
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57.866
When the ship was standing in flames and sank.

110
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,116
How many were alive when the ship was on the way down underwater?

111
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,100
And what to do in such a situation?

112
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,350
You run out of the cab and risk being suffocated by the toxic smoke

113
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:19,566
or you throw yourself down into the burning sea

114
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:26,250
Or just wait until the sea encloses one?

115
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,266
What do you say to their child

116
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:32,366
When you know there is no way out?
