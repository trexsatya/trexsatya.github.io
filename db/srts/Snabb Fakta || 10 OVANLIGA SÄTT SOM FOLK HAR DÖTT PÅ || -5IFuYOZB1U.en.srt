1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,740
To die

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,440
is something we all people will do sooner or later.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,220
But sometimes this goes faster than we might have thought.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,300
Sometimes an unlikely event can

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,000
or a bad decision to lead to death.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,720
Today we will look at ten unusual and maybe too

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,940
A little stupid way people have died.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,640
We can start in Sweden in 1771.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,240
The then king of Sweden, Adolf Fredrik,

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Had for some time had problems with their health.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,060
Headaches, migraine attacks, stomach pain and colds that came and went.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,820
And a beautiful day, February 12, 1771

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,400
ate the king to death.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59.640
Yes, you heard right.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,600
The meal that became his death consisted of sauerkraut,

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Meat, root vegetables, lobster, caviar, Böckling.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,280
The kind of fish and rinsed everything with champagne.

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,800
But it did not end there because it was also fat day.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,600
So the king finished his meal by eating bran,

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Or hot wall as it was called at that time.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,700
It is when you eat a trout in a deep plate of warm milk.

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,100
Anyway, the king pushed 14 pieces of bran

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,980
And a little later in the evening he felt dizzy

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,980
and fell lifeless to the floor.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,960
The big meal had given him a stroke and he

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49.860
is now forever known as "the king who ate to death"

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,520
Garry Hoy

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Was a lawyer in Toronto who in 1993 was involved in an accident.

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,120
He worked on the 24th floor of a skyscraper called Toronto

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Dominion Center and Gary was fascinated

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08.860
over how large the windows the building had.

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12.560
While working there he had come to a small party trick there

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,660
He threw himself at the windows to show how safe and robust they were.

34
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,200
One day July 9, 1993,

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,460
Had the law firm study visit and Garry gave law

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,860
Students a tour and decided to make their party trick

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,060
to impress the students.

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,620
They took the batch, threw themselves against one of the windows,

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,740
But instead of bouncing against the window as usual

40
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,240
So the window loosened from the frame where it was stuck

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:05.040
And Garry went out and fell 24 floors down to his death.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
January 6, 2015 in Taiwan.

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,820
A 32 year old man whose last name was "Hsieh", stepped into an Internet café.

44
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,380
He was a regular customer there and often played for several days in a row.

45
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,640
Employees have said that when he got tired he slept in his chair.

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,620
But this time his visit to the Internet Café would be the last.

47
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,200
Hsieh sat down at a computer and started playing.

48
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,360
He played nonstop for a whole three days.

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,020
After these three days the body was able

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,700
no longer the physical and mental stress.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,440
Without any break for food or sleep.

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,440
And he collapsed over the desk.

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,300
The heart had stopped beating.

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,600
The staff and visitors were completely

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,980
Unaware of this and thought he was asleep.

56
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,580
He lay dead on the desk for several hours before one of the staff

57
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,160
Discovered that he did not breathe and brought him to the hospital.

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,480
But it was already too late.

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,340
Then we go to France and in 1912.

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,940
A man named Franz Reichelt, who was a tailor,

61
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:26,080
had invented something he thought would revolutionize the aviation industry.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,680
He had invented a type of parachute suit.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,500
It was supposed to act as a normal flight suit, but that it quickly

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,920
could be triggered to be used as a parachute in an emergency.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
It could save life

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,200
on pilots whose aircraft suffered any technical error.

67
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,980
February 4th of the 20th century he would demonstrate his invention

68
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,100
Public and the demonstration would be carried out from the Eiffel Tower.

69
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,940
From the beginning he had intended to conduct the test with a doll,

70
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02.340
But decided at the last moment to conduct the test itself.

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,300
It would seem more convincing, he thought.

72
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09.560
So February 4th he climbed up to the Eiffel Tower

73
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,780
First ledge that is about 60 meters above the ground and threw themselves out.

74
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,740
But the suit did not work and Franz

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,380
fell straight down into the ground and died immediately.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:30,060
In front of audiences and journalists who had gathered on the site.

77
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,600
Tycho

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Brahe was a Danish astronomer who lived late

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,020
during the 16th century and just in the early 17th century.

80
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,640
October 13, 1601 participated

81
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,600
He at a big dinner event in Prague.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,460
According to this story, Tycho drank a lot during this party,

83
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,760
but refused to leave the dinner table to go to the toilet

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59.860
Because he felt it was rude to leave the table before the party was over.

85
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04.800
This made him held from urinating for several hours

86
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09.060
And it led to a massive overpowered fermentation in the bladder.

87
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,860
When the party was over he could not urinate properly even though he

88
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,960
really needed, and eleven days after dinner he died

89
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,680
only 54 years old.

90
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
The cause of death may have been urine poisoning

91
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,980
and/or urinary tract infection.

92
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,080
In 1958 happened

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,340
something tragic during a live TV broadcast in Britain where

94
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,620
Gareth Jones, a British actor, was in the middle of a performance
