00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:05,000
For us, free research is important

2
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:13,207
Free basic research is driven by the researcher's curiosity and interest in looking for new knowledge.

3
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:19,123
Many discoveries that we see as obvious have come out of free research:

4
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:20,331
Penicillin

5
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:21,498
Microwave oven

6
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,456
Lithium batteries

7
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:26,561
Solar panels

8
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,538
X -ray

9
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:29,538
The greenhouse effect

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,371
The discoveries have been made from curiosity, randomness or research that did not become as they first thought.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,037
Some of them have received the Nobel Prize.

12
00:00:40,037 --> 00:00:45,036
The graph, DNA, LED lamp and the scissors

13
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:53,035
Free research gives us new knowledge beyond today's horizon and can open entirely new areas of knowledge.

14
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:59,034
It gives us important knowledge and preparedness to meet our societal challenges.

15
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:07,283
Therefore, the majority of the Swedish Research Council's money goes to projects where the researchers themselves formulated their research idea.
