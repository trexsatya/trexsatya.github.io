1
00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:04.804
We arrange various activities for people who are newly arrived here.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,000
We think nature is important.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,345
Everyone who comes here may not have knowledge, so we need to inform.

4
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:17,680
Right now, we will inform about the public right.

5
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:26,794
Now it's the eighth year in a row that Antonio and I have done this.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,792
It is a popular activity.

7
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,953
We are open to everyone.

8
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:38,172
To cook together, get to know each other and get to know the environment where the children play.

9
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:42.302
Now we will go through question number five.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,655
What do you think?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,884
This is what we do, we call at -covered vocal. You get close to nature. We open another world for the kids.

12
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:52.615
And for adults too.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,553
It is to come really close to something.

14
00:00:56,553 --> 00:01:03,676
A loupe is an opportunity, you don't need that much. And then you get close to nature.

15
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:07,597
At the nature school we will have different themes every day.

16
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:16,520
Among other things, we will have flowers, aquatic animals, beaver safari, fire and butterflies.

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,156
You become an expert on flowers as well.

18
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:25,816
So you can get these pins and become an expert on every thing we do in nature.

19
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,153
And also just being.

20
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:38,927
It is not so common when you come to a country that you just go out and are in nature.

21
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:44,000
It is important to move. Feel how healthy it is in nature.

22
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:49.303
This is the first time I am here, in this forest. So it's great fun.

23
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:53,160
It tastes better in nature and the kids have fun.

24
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:56,389
Dare. Dare to test such activities.

25
00:01:56,389 --> 00:02:03.081
In the beginning it may not come so many, but then when people start to know the activity ---

26
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05.081
- Then the number of participants is constantly increasing.

27
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:08.919
Have it open, and listen to everyone.

28
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:14,434
And let the participants be free in the activities.

29
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,798
I would recommend that.

30
00:02:15,798 --> 00:02:20,528
Then comes the knowledge of everything else we want to convey in between.

31
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:26,974
I like nature myself. And my dream is for everyone else to love nature as I do.

32
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:33,480
It's the only dream I have. And I think most people appreciate nature.

33
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:37,143
So it's just to continue that way. And use nature a little more.

34
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:39,740
Bye!
