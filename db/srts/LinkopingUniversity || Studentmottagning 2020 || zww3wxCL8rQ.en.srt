1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,760
It will definitely be a reception. It will not be as usual,

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,320
But we will do the best we can given the restrictions we have.

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,360
You will be assigned a smaller group that you gather in, instead of having these huge activities.

4
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,140
It gets a little more centered about getting to know your class, or the ones you will plug in in the future.

5
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,520
At LinkÃ¶ping University, we have a tradition of a comprehensive reception for all new students who come here.

6
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02.080
And it is older students who have been with before planning and arranging many different

7
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:10,180
activities in order to invite to a fantastic new start when the semester starts this fall

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,420
And that ambition remains this year as well.

9
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,300
We have many students who want to join and make the best possible based on the conditions that exist.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,860
A mix of social activities. A little get to know campus, get to know each other,

11
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,500
Get an introduction to the studies. Both from the university and from the corps.

12
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,480
One of the big differences this year is that we will have arrangements with a maximum of 50 people at a time.

13
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02.920
Then we want to make sure that these 50 people who meet are also the same people who have met during the day.

14
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:11,280
We will have in place teaching, and then we want it to be the same groupings that meet outside the study period.
