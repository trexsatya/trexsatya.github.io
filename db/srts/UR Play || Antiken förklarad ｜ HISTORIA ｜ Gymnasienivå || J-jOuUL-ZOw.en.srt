1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,920
We often imagine antiquity in a single color-

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,760
-But it didn't look.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,600
We have a picture of white antiquity.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,440
That sculptures and architecture were white, but it was painted.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,320
Antiquity is more colorful and dirtier.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,920
All the statues we are used to seeing this looked like this.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,000
Painted, gold -clad and often dirty.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,080
Antiquity is seen as the starting point for our modern history-

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,240
-And is a time when much we have today takes shape.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,920
Everything from democracy and religion to philosophy and architecture.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,120
So what happened under the colorful antique-

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,360
-and what was it like to live then?

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,800
Early European history can be divided into three eras.

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,320
This is the first: antiquity.

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,480
It consists of a Greek and a Roman part.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,840
It begins when Greek city states have its first Olympic gaming

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,480
-And ends when the Empire in Rome is set aside.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,120
It is now our time count begins - year 0-

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,800
-But we are far from the beginning of man.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,360
Rome's dictator Julius Caesar has the same length of time to today-

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,680
-As the completion of the pyramids in Egypt.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,120
We start with the Greek antiquity.

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Greece is divided into city states.

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,960
They are independent and consist of a city with surrounding landscapes.

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,840
Most are farmers.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,360
If they are self -governing - why are we talking about a Greece?

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,080
Greeks see themselves as a people, regardless of where they bor-

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,720
-And everyone speaks and writes in Greek.

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,680
They also share the same god-

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,320
-And every four years, Olympic games are held to honor them.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,320
Religion was polytheistic, with many gods.

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,240
They had different special functions and work areas, you might say.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,360
This is this gang: Zeus, Athena, Poseidon, Apollon, Aphrodite, etc.

34
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,880
Although much holds the city states together, much else separates them.

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,400
They have their own laws and political systems.

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
In addition, they are constantly at war with each other.

37
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Two arch enemies are the leading city states Athens and Sparta.

38
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,520
We take a closer look at them.
 First Athens.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Athens has its heyday during the 400s before our time-

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,000
-And here the idea of democracy is born.

41
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,760
It is a long political process where one is trying to find medium-

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,960
-Ee to take power from the rich aristocratic family heads-

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,800
-and distribute it to more.

44
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,040
This is solved by giving all citizens voting rights.

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,920
The parenthesis is that only free, Athenian men are counted as citizens.

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,440
In Athens, women, foreigners and slaves also lived.

47
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,400
They had no right of voting or the right to speak in this system.

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,760
It is a democratic principle, but not a democracy like today.

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,840
Elections were not seen as a democratic institution, because they could be influenced.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,320
The lot was the democratic way to choose people.

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,120
With it comes rights and obligations.

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,320
If you are drawn forward, you are obliged to take your responsibility.

53
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,040
If you are drawn into the council, you need to be able to convince the free Athenian men.

54
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,400
You both need good ideas and be a skilled speaker.

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,040
Many philosophers were also a teacher of rhetoric.

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,600
There is a small bonus in the system.

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,800
A politician you dislike can get a land -defeated with 6,000 votes.

58
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,040
It is seen as a protection for democracy.

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,720
While Athens focuses on democracy, life in Sparta looks different.

60
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,600
It is one of the few monarchies in Greece-

61
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,320
-But above all the view of society and the war distinguishes them.

62
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,000
The collective went before-

63
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,480
-And the whole community was organized according to the best of the state.

64
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,600
Citizens were some kind of warrior.

65
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,240
War characterizes the entire life of the Spartans, and they conquer land.

66
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,200
You should always be ready for battle, and loss is nothing that is accepted.

67
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,840
Boys are raised by the state and do military service until they are thirty.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
For people in Sparta, the state and the collective are at the center.

69
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,960
One should live a sparse life.

70
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,880
One would live spartan.

71
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,720
You looked down at material wealth, so you would live poor.

72
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,960
The city states differ, but nothing unites as an external enemy.

73
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,280
One of these has the city states in the east: the Persian Empire.

74
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,040
The Persians are an arch enemy of the Greek world.

75
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,520
Athens and Sparta are side by side against the Persians in several wars.

76
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,320
At Thermopyle, Greece goes on a loss, and you dream of revenge.

77
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,720
When Alexander the Great inherits power in the Greek Kingdom of Macedonia-

78
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,200
-he thinks revenge.

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,520
He leaves on an expedition east and is successful.

80
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,000
He conquers the entire Persian kingdom.

81
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,480
Finally he reigns over today's Greece, Turkey-

82
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,240
-Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Afghanistan and India.

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,360
He dies young, probably after heavy alcohol consumption.

84
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,800
He seems to have been driven by eagerness.

85
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,880
A willingness to lower the world.

86
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,240
After his death, the kingdom falls apart to the small kingdoms again.

87
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,240
However, the expansion leads to Hellenism.

88
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,160
It is the mixture between the Greek and the eastern.

89
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,520
A typical such mixture is the coin here.

90
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,600
A side in Greek and one in Persian style.

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,480
When it is not war - what is it like in the ancient world?

92
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,000
It was a wonderful period if you were an aristocratic man.

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,440
Then they had great fun.

94
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,360
The majority are not free men and do not have great fun.

95
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,360
Slaves have no rights, and often married women away when they are twelve.

96
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,600
The marriage was mainly something man in

97
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,040
-A social and economic reasons.
 Love did not matter that much.

98
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,280
The goal was to breed the heirs-

99
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,560
-So you got married heterosexually.

100
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Then you could have other relationships-

101
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,560
-When we might be described as gay or bisexual.

102
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,480
So you didn't think then.

103
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,520
There are strong ideals and norms-

104
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,640
-Dore if you are a woman or a man, free or slave.

105
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,960
A man should be strong and have control.

106
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,680
One had control over one's body, their feelings and lustar-

107
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,280
-And even over others.

108
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,160
After all, they controlled your wife, their children and their slaves.

109
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,840
The woman should be everything the man is not: passive and without control.

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,920
A slave has no norms or ideals, because it is not seen as a human being.

111
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,720
This is included in part two - the Roman antiquity.

112
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,040
For a long time, the Greek and Roman antiquity coexist.

113
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,440
From the beginning, Rome is a city state, but here you have other ambitions.

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,640
This with independent city states is nothing to the Romans.

115
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,920
They will build an empire with Rome in the center.

116
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,520
Rome puts areas underneath, and after three wars they conquer Carthage.

117
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,840
You are at the center of the Mediterranean world and an established superpower.

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,240
Now nothing can stop the Romans.

119
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,080
The Mediterranean starts to be called "Our Sea"-

120
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,800
-And you control areas up to today's United Kingdom.

121
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,120
In addition to the Greek areas, they also take their gods.

122
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,960
They get new, Roman names.
 Hello then, Zeus.
 Welcome, Jupiter.

123
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,920
But for the people in conquered areas - what happens to them?

124
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,200
How does the life change to belong to the Roman Empire?

125
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,800
A principle is that Rome does not interfere in local affairs-

126
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,560
-or the religious life.

127
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,800
You let people speak the language they speak.

128
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,760
In the eastern part you still speak Greek.

129
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,280
You are relatively open and take in citizens from parts of the Roman Empire.

130
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,920
In the end, all men can become citizens.

131
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,120
Some may get full citizenship and others without voting rights.

132
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,160
The Romans call their politics to disintegrate and rule.

133
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,680
Different conditions to different areas-

134
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,120
-makes it harder for them to come together against Rome.

135
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,680
Those who are given voting rights must go the long way to Rome.

136
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,920
This is where the Republic is governed.

137
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,840
Here is the Senate, an advisory body with the wealthiest men of the kingdom.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,480
The officials ensure that the decisions are enforced.

139
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,880
They are selected two and two for one year at the time-

140
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,240
-To avoid getting too much power.

141
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,760
The two most important officials - the consuls - lead the kingdom in war.

142
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,440
Then there are people's congregations.

143
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,200
In those who appoint officials, all male citizens are allowed to vote.

144
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,840
In the Republic of Rome, big cities grow in

145
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,160
-But wherever you live, it gets carbon black as soon as the sun goes down.

146
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:00,040
Here is a Roman oil lamp - the only light you have except the sun.

147
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,440
You must have many, and it was one of the most common objects.

148
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,320
They are manufactured on running bands in workshops around the kingdom.

149
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,800
The workshops were named after the owner.

150
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,840
The names were printed on the bottom, so you knew where the lamp came from.

151
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,360
It was one of the first objects that were mass -produced.

152
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,360
It is also true that these brands are pirated.

153
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,920
Much of the workforce is slaves, and most are conquered on the battlefields.

154
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,600
Something the Romans may be that war-

155
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,320
-And here is one of the foremost generals: Julius Caesar.

156
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,640
He dreams of more power and a greater role than is allowed in the system.

157
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,360
Caesar is chosen as a consul, but you cannot be re -elected.

158
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,840
His position is not quite in the system.

159
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,720
How does he solve it?
 By force.

160
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,920
He trains towards Rome, and that leads to power struggle and civil war.

161
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,960
In the end, Caesar stands in the capital with the sign "Veni, Vidi, Vici".

162
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,160
"I came I saw I conquered."
 Caesar is proclaimed dictator.

163
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,480
First in one year, then ten and finally life.

164
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,600
Now "dictator" gets a negative tone.

165
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,840
It would have been something you could be chosen in a crisis situation.

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,280
If both the consuls fall, someone must control Rome.

167
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,760
Then you can choose a dictator of a maximum of six months, but not for a lifetime.

168
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,680
Therefore, Caesar becomes less popular and ultimately murdered by senators.

169
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,000
Then the empire takes over.

170
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,280
Rome is governed by an emperor, and everyone gets the title Augustus.

171
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,800
Now follows a period of 200 years of peace.

172
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,280
Much we recognize now is established: monuments, bridges and aqueducts.

173
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,320
For the Romans, life is quite comfortable, but all good has an end.

174
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,440
It crackles in the joints, and the Roman Empire is in crisis.

175
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,120
The Conquest War has subsided, and they gave all the slaves.

176
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:38,920
The governing bodies are forced to raise the tax, which deteriorates for farmers.

177
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,520
A new religion emerges: Christianity.

178
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,640
Christians refuse to worship the gods of Rome

179
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,440
-The Christianity is banned and the Christians are persecuted.

180
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,400
But with Emperor Constantine, everything changes.

181
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,640
Constantine perhaps expects the potential of Christianity

182
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,440
-Som something that can hold together the now rather fragmentary empire.

183
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,840
By the end of the 300s, other religious expressions are banned

184
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,920
-and Christianity is state religion.

185
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:20,560
Now everyone is forced to release the Roman gods and worship the Christian.

186
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,600
Konstantin prohibits crucifixion, the Peter's Church funds in Rom-

187
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,000
-And makes Sunday work -free.

188
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,960
But not even that can hold the kingdom together.

189
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,840
Power moved to Constantinople - today's ottanbul-

190
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,400
-And that city is getting bigger and more powerful than Rome.

191
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,360
The Great Empire is split into two: Västrom and Östrom.

192
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,680
Östrom grows strongly and later becomes the Byzantine Empire-

193
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,280
-As lives on for a thousand years.

194
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,560
For Västrom things go worse, and the last emperor loses power.

195
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,760
It is said that antiquity ends in 476, when the last emperor is set aside.

196
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,040
We have found that.

197
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,000
The question is whether anyone who lived in 476 noticed any difference 477.

198
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
That an era was over - probably not.

199
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,400
There was probably no giant difference-

200
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,360
-But antiquity has been symbolized a wonderful time with philosophy and knowledge.

201
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,000
We have read the philosophers.

202
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,280
They do not tell how they exploit women and slave-

203
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,120
-and how others are treated.

204
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:50,720
We only got this ideal image from those who were doing well.

205
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,600
The second picture we have had to dig out.

206
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,560
The democratic heritage has been given a great place, and it has often been idealized.

207
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,040
Not least Greek democracy, but it wasn't always.

208
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,840
Only in the 1850s began the ancient democracy-

209
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,280
-Ses as a political role model.

210
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,360
Before that, democracy was regarded as a mob.

211
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,200
The idea of a Roman Empire power has inspired rulers.

212
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:33,080
Napoleon, Mussolini and Hitler used Roman symbols.

213
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:39,560
From the first democratic steps in Greece to the military empire in Rome.

214
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,720
In ancient times, different types of rule and view of power may take place.

215
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:52,560
Whatever you want to legitimize, you can often find it in antiquity.

216
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,320
Almost like a sandbox of experiences.

217
