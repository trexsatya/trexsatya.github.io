00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09.423
Very funny that you are so many who come here and hope too -

2
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:13,595
That you are many who sit and listen to this online.

3
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:18,602
The title of our lecture, proximity to nature - has a way to better health?

4
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:19,837
with question marks.

5
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:24,110
It might also have the sub -heading, we are on the right track.

6
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:27,087
Not least with the image you can see here.

7
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:31,852
My name is Åsa Engström and I am, as I said, professor of nursing,

8
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,813
Also subject representatives there.

9
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:38.501
Also a nurse and worked primarily in intensive care

10
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:41,204
And courses linked to it.

11
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:47.570
And this with the importance of nature is something that is warm to me.

12
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52.313
And maybe a little contrast to the high -tech.

13
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:57.585
Päivi and I work together on many issues linked to this.

14
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,258
You may introduce yourself.

15
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:04.368
Päivi Juuso is my name, assistant professor at the department of

16
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:07.766
Nursing and medical technology. And just as Åsa says,

17
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:13,258
Colleague and we have worked and work in many different projects together.

18
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:18,704
I am a district nurse, primarily worked in sparsely populated areas.

19
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:24,032
So this with nature is very close really, my everyday life -

20
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:28,977
And my everyday life. It will be great fun -

21
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:34,223
To give this lecture for you. And also welcomes all of you -

22
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,841
on site and all of you on the web.
