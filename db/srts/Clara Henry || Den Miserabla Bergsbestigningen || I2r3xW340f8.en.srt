1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,220
Clara: What the heck are you doing?

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,360
Kimba: I thought you weren't recording!

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,320
All: Hey!

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,660
Clara: Well. What are we doing tomorrow?
Kimba: We're going to Kebnekaise!

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,480
Clara: Hi youtube, this is my dad and little sister!

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,520
Kimba: Hello!

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,680
Kimba: (singing Wizard of Oz theme song)

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,040
Dad: Follow the yelow brick road!

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,480
Clara: Tomorrow I'll be climbing the Kebnekaise mountain with these two!

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,260
Or, we're climbing the day after tomorrow. First we're going to Kiruna and Nikkaluokta.

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,480
Kimba: Nikkaloukta is where we get off the bus.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,720
Clara: It's 9 PM the night before.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,120
So tomorrow we're flying to Kiruna, then taking a bus to Nikkauokta,

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,800
then we'll be trekking 11,8 miles to Kebnekaise, and 5,6 miles to the top.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,660
Then we'll trek back down the mountain, and back to Nikkaluokta,

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,040
then we're taking the bus and sleeping at a hotel and then we're going home.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,560
And this will take us four days.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,320
So let's go!

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,900
Kimba: Come on, let's go.

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,840
Dad: (bangs head against the frame glass)

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,040
Clara: Bloody idiot

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,340
Kimba: You are so stupid.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,060
Kimba: I'm ready! OH WAIT. Clara. Safety first.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,040
Clara: Good morning! We're on our way to the airport to catch the plane to Kiruna.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,500
Kimba: Beautiful, beautiful.

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,420
We're gonna have so much fun.

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,260
Clara: Are you sure about that?

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,440
Clara: We're here! Dad, what's the name of this place?

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,280
Dad: Nikkaluokta!

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,400
Clara: What was it called yesterday?

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,920
Dad: Nukkolokta.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,880
Clara: And the day before that?

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,660
Dad: Nakkalikta.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,300
Clara: So we've gone by bus from Kiruna to Nikkaluokta.

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,920
And it's freezing. But at least it's not raining.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,800
Excited?

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,620
Kimba: Let's take photos!

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,680
Clara: OKI OKI

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,320
Kimba (in fake danish): ... in the little pocket.
Clara: What in the little pocket?

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,080
Kimba (still in fake danish): And then, you push... like hell.

41
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,160
Clara: If you want to say something in Danish and you don't know the Danish word, you say it in English.

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,320
With a Danish accent, and it'll sound Danish.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,020
Like, I don't know the word for "dinner", but I can say like this:

44
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,520
"Jeg ska hjem og spise lidt dinner."

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,980
It works?!

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,160
Look at this! Kebne, babe!

47
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,080
Kimba: I'm yor kebne-bae.

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,680
Clara: The long wandering has begun!

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,760
(Wizard of Oz theme song)
(and the Wizard of Oz fecken DANCE MOVES)

50
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,440
Clara: Dad, what's that on your rucksack?

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,860
Dad: A baguette? Salmon baguette. For dinner.

52
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,000
Clara: Wooaah, oh god

53
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,200
FECKEN HELL

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Damn!!

55
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,960
That bridge was horrible!

56
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,680
One adventure completed! Now continues...

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,040
Kimba: The great adventure!

58
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,640
Clara: CORRECT

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,900
Clara: Next... I'm gunna drink me piss.

60
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,880
And you didn't cast me for the Wild Kids TV-show you bastards?!

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,220
Look at me now!

62
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,560
Gosh this feels like the Blair Witch Project.

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,000
Since the last time I recorded, it's been raining.

64
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,780
And it's been raining.

65
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,020
And it's been raining some more.

66
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:43,920
So I've had my camera inside my raincoat all the way to the mountain lodge, where we are now.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,420
That's 7,5 miles of pouring rain. Everything we brought is soaking wet.

68
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:53,313
My sleeping bag is so wet I could squeeze the water out of it. I don't know how I'm gonna sleep tonight.

69
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm gonna freeze my ass off.

70
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,520
Can you hear the rain? This is so distressing.

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,460
I wasn't built for challenges like this.

72
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,500
I feel like a spoilt city kid. Which I am, to a large extent.

73
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,780
But it's taken so long?! Soon it's midnight. I think the last time I recorded it was 6 PM.

74
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,060
Holy fecken christ.

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,580
But, to see it from the bright side, we've arrived.

76
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,780
Kimba: And you could've had your period.
Clara: I could've had my period.

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,440
And also, we get to fall asleep to the cosiest sound on earth.

78
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,620
So we're gonna try to get some sleep and dry up a bit. See you tomorrow, good night.

79
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,860
Morning. Time for oatmeal.

80
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,700
How are you today?

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,360
Kimba: Wet.
Dad: Tired. Hungry.

82
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,860
Clara: We're so bloody miserable.

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,880
I slept really bad tonight, I had the worst pillow. It's just air, basically.

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,300
But now it's time for... mmmmmmhh delicious, look.

85
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,140
I think I'm gonna let the vapour get off of the lens, but

86
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,120
today we're climbing Kebne, right? But it's super foggy and it's raining.

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,000
If we're lucky, we might not be allowed to climb. He he.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,160
Well. Here we are again. Ready to get soaked.

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,660
It's still raining, and these two are convinced that we're gonna reach the mountain top today.

90
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,060
I'm way more pessimistic. And I'm usually an optimist.

91
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,040
Kimba: Leeeet's doooo thiiiis

92
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,300
Clara: It's raining so much and I'm so happy that we're not crossing here.

93
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,100
We're going up to the snow instead.

94
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,400
I've got sore feet and no energy. Five out of five nasal sprays.

95
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,820
Okay, so, this is what's going on: my feet are super sore,

96
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,220
while we went down this hill to cross the bridge, over a frickin river,

97
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,060
my leg buckled twice and I have blisters on three different spots on my feet.

98
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,420
So I felt like, nah, I'm going back home. And I ain't even disappointed about it.

99
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,680
But these two will continue a bit more! Go you!

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,200
On the initiative from one of them, guess which one.

101
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,700
Okay bye, enjoy!

102
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,180
Clara: You're back! How did it go?

103
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,620
Dad: Like two fishes out of the water.

104
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,320
Kimba: Or like two hikers in the water.

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
Kimba: That's what we were.

106
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,360
Dad: We came a hundred meters from where we said goodbye to you.

107
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:41,120
Clara: So now we're here, having lunch. Noodle, soy protein and a very fake sweet and sour sauce.

108
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,720
Morning! Day three, with these two, in the forest.

109
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,860
Today we're trekking back to Nikkaluokta, then taking the bus to Kiruna and checking in at a hostel,

110
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,320
and tomorrow we're going back home! It's just that there are these 11,8 miles to Nikkaluokta.

111
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,380
So we thought we'd steal a ride with the boat.

112
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,480
Or, we're gonna go by the law and pay for our tickets, but

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,020
we'll be walking for 5,6 miles instead, and then go by boat.

114
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,440
Which is going to be lovely, since my right foot is aching badly.

115
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,460
This is something you can do.

116
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,620
This is a solution when the road is going to be wet

117
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,520
and you know you're gonna have to step in water with at least one foot

118
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
but the other foot can't wear a boot because it'll die.

119
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,380
I'm very not fresh right now.

120
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,320
Dad: I'm longing for a shower. But apart from that, I feel good!

121
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,740
Clara: Here's my rucksack. I'm longing to put that on my back.

122
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
See you along the way, bye bye!

123
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Wow so pretty.

124
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,640
CUUUUTE

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,420
Kimba: Memebulle!

126
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,560
Clara: Woho, 0 miles left! After 5,6 miles!

127
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,800
Kimba: Hello
Clara: It's me

128
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,280
Clara: Gosh I'm so sweaty. Let's go find the boat.

129
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,020
Clara: What's going on?
Kimba: No!

130
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,860
Dad: You hate people?

131
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,420
Kimba: No! I love them!

132
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,940
Dad: She hates people.

133
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,540
Kimba: I love them.

134
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Clara: Here comes the boat!

135
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,400
We've got off the boat, and can you see what I'm seeing?

136
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,840
Where the heck is it now

137
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,700
Clara: Can you see up there?!
Kimba: We haven't been there.

138
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,300
Clara: But we made a great try. We strained the bow. The string broke. So we went home. Shit happens.

139
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,380
Woohoooo!

140
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,740
We're back, bisheees!

141
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,340
Kimba: What did you say?!

142
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,860
Clara: Clever!
Dad: Clever yourself!

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,820
Dad: Well done!

144
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,880
Kimba: Arrhhhh clever...

145
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Clara: We're on the bus to go back and I thought about something.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,040
We've trekked over there. We've walked to that mountain.

147
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,880
How crazy is that!? We've walked all the way over there!

148
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,820
I can't even.

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,120
Good morning! It's day four on our great adventure.

150
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Today we're going home!

151
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,300
We came to the hostel last night and had dinner, washed our clothes and went to bed.

152
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,700
I didn't film anything and you didn't really miss anything,

153
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,740
except for when some dude mansplained to me how the washing machine worked.

154
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,840
So now we're going to the airport transfer to go home!

155
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,100
Great!

156
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm home, Bob!

157
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,280
Oh, really...

158
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
Shine bright like a diamond.

159
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,220
I'm home, I just said bye to dad and Kimba, and it's wonderful to be back home.

160
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,860
Oh my god. I'm gonna sit down and edit this video now, which is going to be interesting

161
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,580
because partly I feel like we haven't done anything because we never reached the mountain top.

162
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,120
It's 5,6 miles to the top and I don't even think we reached one and a half because of the heavy rain.

163
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,640
On the other hand, I'm not really disappointed that we didn't make it because it would've been so tough.

164
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,940
and partly, if you put together all of the distances we walked during these days, it's 21,8 miles.

165
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,420
21,8.

166
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,100
I understand why my feet have blisters and started to develop an extra heel.

167
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,340
I mean, look at this.

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,340
What is that.

169
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,280
But anyway. Thank you so much for watching and for joining our miserable mountaineering.

170
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,360
I enjoyed bringing you.

171
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,640
Take care and I'll see you guys as usual next week.

172
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,400
Bye!
