1
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.740
Howdy to you!


2
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.840
Here I sit and auntum-plowing.


3
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.580
It was a while since I posted a video, but I've been a little sick.


4
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.980
Is still a little bad, a cold.


5
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.940
Here I am


6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.120
auntum plowing. Should be wheat here.


7
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.120
It has been grassland here before, as you can see.


8
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.200
It's dry!


9
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.060
I have had to replace wear parts here on the plow.


10
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.640
New inserts and lace.


11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.760
It seems you may not, but it's a little green on the inserts.


12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.440
It is worn now.


13
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.260
It will not go down with the old lace and inserts, so I had to change the.


14
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020
The plow pretty good now.


15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Though you can see that it is dry.


16
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.080
Today I sit in the MXU and the plow and not of MX.


17
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.560
MX had been more beautiful, for it has been working AC.


18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You have to take what is available!


19
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.260
Then it will not be after this loader,


20
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.000
On the MX as well.


21
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.980
For it is always in the way.


22
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300
Here, will it be wheat as I said.


23
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.200
I have plowed two pieces to which it will be wheat.


24
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.140
It's the only thing we should winter seed this year. The three bits.


25
00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.020
The four bits we had with wheat and triticale, spring barley will be sown with the next year


26
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980
It will be grassland in two years on them.


27
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.860
It does not run very fast and


28
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120
plow. It is situated, and


29
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200
sneaks into three km / h.


30
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.200
I do not know how much fun you have to sit and stare at me when I drive here and talk nonsense ...


31
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.180
I have well maybe not so much quality right now. Do not so much new machinery that way to you.


32
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.000
The tractors, I have of course gone through, with buttons and. The plow, I have of course gone through twice.


33
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.740
So that...


34
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.840
This tractor, I have of course nothing more to say really.


35
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700
Clutchless forward and reverse.


36
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.060
Have all modern tractors, or mordern tractors have barely there anymore.


37
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.940
This is normal brakes and no ABS brakes, or slat-coupling.


38
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.760
This is the loading lever.


39
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.760
The fluorescent lamp means that the implement lock is unlocked.


40
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.280
So that I can put on a bucket.


41
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.500
One can say that it is like an aircraft lever.


42
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.840
If you pull it towards you to raise the loader and press it forward as you lower the loader.


43
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.980
Pull it toward you to tilt it up.


44
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.040
Slide the lever away, then tilt down the loading bracket.


45
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.920
It's like an airplane stick around.


46
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
Looks pretty good, plowing here.


47
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.520
There hitched it up for rock ejaculation. Hit a stone there.


48
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.180
It was not as nice plowed right there.


49
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.500
I will probably not have time to finish this piece today.


50
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.300
The time is


51
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.260
16:31 here.


52
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Will not run as a really long time tonight.


53
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.460
It is not as broad aspect, but it is long.


54
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.320
There are pieces that we like around here everything basically.


55
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Right up here is not ours.


56
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.340
That's the only one in just this score here.


57
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.360
Yes, I do not know if I should say much more.


58
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.060
I take with the camera today when I plow, I thought,


59
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.060
so that it is a film.


60
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.540
So that you do not lose interest completely!


61
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.520
We'll see what I do next time.


62
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.940
Do you have any ideas, you are welcome to leave a comment.


63
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.720
It can be difficult to resolve some things. If you may want to see specific machines, which I have not.


64
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.440
Just ask for!


65
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.140
I usually say that you feel free to comment and share my videos, so that more people can see them.


66
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.560
Please subscribe and like my videos.


67
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.440
If you do not like the video you may well make the thumb down ...


68
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.120
But I wonÂ´t be happy about it!


69
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.360
* Laughs *


70
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.440
Just doing one of these little short video.


71
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.680
I'm still sick, so I'm not going to keep talking so much


72
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.720
See you next time!
