1
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.480
After all, we are affected by what we eat.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.640
But what happened to us as a species when we started eating cultivated food and having livestock -

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.240
- The place of gathering and hunting?

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.240
The new way of acquiring food changed all life.

5
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.480
Dinner and where it comes from -

6
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.080
- Have always interested man.

7
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.680
For three million years, our ancestors, the hunters and the collectors - took

8
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.800
- Everything they needed directly from nature.

9
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.480
But 10,000 years ago, when agriculture was introduced -

10
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.080
- The man's way of eating was changed.

11
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.880
It was the beginning of a revolution that turned upside down on our history.

12
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.080
A new era began - the younger Stone Age.

13
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.320
You master the fire, domestic the cereals: you develop over time.

14
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.840
We know that you bred and ate sheep, goats and pigs.

15
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.480
And also horses.

16
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.280
In the last ten years, archaeological excavations - have

17
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.880
–And progress in research and analytics technology -

18
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.880
- We are brand new things about the prehistoric eating habits.

19
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:14.000
With our methods we can see traces of milk for thousands of year old shards.

20
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.880
Thanks to these methods, the researchers have new hypotheses -

21
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.240
- If the connections between the diet, the body and the way man develop.

22
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.720
During the younger Stone Age, the nutritional value of the diet decreased significantly.

23
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.080
The skeleton shows signs of anemia.

24
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.400
The food is one of the basics of biology and for living creatures in general.

25
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.600
The selection pressure is severe on that factor.

26
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.360
How would the new way of life affect us?

27
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.120
It all began in the Middle East and spread during the younger Stone Age west-

28
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.720
- Against Europe.

29
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.680
Could the new food have changed health, demographics and social structure?

30
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.600
What does it say about our ability to adapt?

31
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.760
This is the largest known settlement from the younger Stone Age -

32
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.720
- In the current Turkey.

33
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.680
Typically for the time are densely populated settlements -

34
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.840
- And this is one of the oldest that has so far been excavated.

35
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.640
Carbon-14 dating of items found at the site-

36
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.120
-shows that people have lived here from the mid-7000s BC

37
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.440
French scientist Alain Froment has come to the excavation -

38
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.240
- To find out more about the latest finds and study them in place.

39
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.200
He works closely with his Turkish colleague who leads the excavations.

40
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.960
Here we see a wall of bricks.
 With plaster.

41
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.360
Yes, the wall is polished.
 And you see the hole after a coarse beam.

42
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.600
When you needed a new house, you tore the upper half of the house.

43
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.560
And so the waste was used as the new foundation.

44
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.920
Çatalhöük was discovered by James Mellaart, David French and Alan Hall -

45
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.640
- When they did an excavation in 1958.

46
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.840
With its 14 hectares, this is the largest in the Middle East and Southern Europe ...

47
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.520
Yes, even the largest settlement in the world from the younger Stone Age.

48
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.400
During the younger Stone Age, plants and animals were domesticated, one became a resident -

49
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.680
- You started producing ceramics and a new type of polished stone.

50
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.880
The younger Stone Age entered gradually and not simultaneously on the different continents.

51
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.320
It was the first time in history it happened.

52
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.960
We know they kept animals here from the beginning.

53
00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:00.680
They had domesticated sheep, goats and pigs here.

54
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.440
They formed a large part of their diet.
 And the same was true of the horses.

55
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.280
Because of the fat content, it was an important part of their diet.

56
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.440
Sheep and goats accounted for a large part of their protein intake.

57
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.520
The most startling with çatalhöyük is -

58
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.400
- How to grow wheat and other cereals.

59
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.480
All types of cereals were grown.

60
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.840
We find especially Emmer wheat and single grains.

61
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.640
In addition to Vicker, Oats and other cereals, legumes were grown.

62
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.000
Chickpeas, lentils and peas were important sources of nutrition.

63
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.560
During the younger Stone Age, they were limited to things that gave much more -

64
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.880
- question about calories, availability and production.

65
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.960
Through agriculture you can consume more - you can create new resources.

66
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.720
By getting a wheat on a meadow where it did not grow before, the earth is usually used.

67
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.200
You create resources where there were no before.

68
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.360
And you multiply the resource.
 For example, if I sow a corn grain -

69
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.680
- Can I harvest 200 grains and have increased production capacity 200 times.

70
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:46.440
During the younger Stone Age, they concentrated on the foods that gave the most.

71
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:53.680
You were no longer limited by nature - you created your own environment.

72
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.360
This area is new.
 We dug it last year.

73
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.160
And you think this is a street, so it's an urban structure?

74
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.680
Yes, and here is a new neighborhood.

75
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.040
- And these are the upper layers?
 - The upper layers in this hill.

76
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.440
The settlement consists of 16 layers.

77
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:29.680
The oldest layers are from 7200 BC and the youngest from 5950 BC.

78
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.320
This is a period of about 1,200 years.

79
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.880
For that time it is very long, longer than for any other settlement.

80
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.080
Two factors helped the population increased:

81
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.840
The transition to fixed settlement ...

82
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.280
... and the improved access to food.

83
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.280
The hunters and collectors had few children.

84
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.440
Infant mortality was perhaps high or they regulated their nativity -

85
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:16.400
- By spreading the births.
 But when people became resident, childbirth increased.

86
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.960
The world's population was 25 times larger in just 5,000 years.

87
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:32.760
4000 BC
 Had Europe's population increased to two million people.

88
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.760
The excavations reveal what you ate during the younger Stone Age.

89
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.680
It is more difficult to find out how the food was cooked and consumed.

90
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.280
If we find out more about the cooking methods -

91
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.000
- will the image of our ancestors' lifestyle become clearer.

92
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.200
Archaeologist Anne Flouest is trying to recreate prehistoric recipes -

93
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.840
–And the Stone Age's Way of Cooking -

94
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.200
- With the help of the tracks from the settlements.

95
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.200
I will test the flint shavings that you have brought with you from Grand-Pressigny.

96
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.160
It cuts well, huh?
 Incredible...

97
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:30.200
You cut to the food with a knife, ie by flint.

98
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.600
Then the ceramics were added:

99
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.760
Younger Stone Age's great invention, the first artificial material.

100
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:46.520
With the help of clay, water and fire, one made a vessel-

101
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:53.000
- So resisted fire and was waterproof, so you could start boiling the food.

102
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.040
When boiling, either during younger stone age or today, meat reacts the same.

103
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.200
Therefore, I let it cook for at least three hours:

104
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.160
It always takes as long for the collagen to break down so that the meat becomes tender.

105
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:20.840
When we cook the food we can also mix vegetables and meat -

106
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
- And you mix solid and liquid food.
 Previously, grilling was the only method.

107
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.680
These combinations probably made a big difference to nutritional intake and lifestyle.

108
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.960
This way of working is called experimental archeology.

109
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.120
By recreating the cooking methods and the flavors -

110
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.720
–Can we understand the choices made by the Stone Age man -

111
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.200
–And why she preferred some dishes over others.

112
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.760
But depended on the new diet on a specific migration -

113
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.320
- Or did it spread when you started to live closer to each other?

114
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:15.440
Researchers at the University of Vienna are trying to answer that question.

115
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.800
They compare DNA from younger Stone Age groups in Europe and the Middle East -

116
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.120
- With those who lived before the agricultural revolution.

117
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.920
The first challenge is to collect enough good DNA samples-

118
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:42.840
- From the skeleton in the areas concerned from 10,000 to 4000 BC.

119
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.080
We were looking for the place where DNA would be best preserved.

120
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.720
So we experimented with one of the hardest legs in the body.

121
00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:02.120
And it is the rock bone that surrounds the inner ear.

122
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.600
There DNA is a hundred times better.

123
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.720
With a small sandblasts clean and freely free the leg -

124
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:26.800
- Till we have isolated the so -called seashell, which then ground into a powder.

125
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.800
By analyzing several hundred samples-

126
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:39.720
- Can you compile a database with DNA from the younger Stone Age -

127
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.400
- Outside of bargains and age on the skeleton.

128
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.440
They compare the genetic material from the groups -

129
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.600
– With DNA from hunters and collectors who were in the same areas -

130
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.280
- For the beginning of the younger Stone Age.

131
00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.640
Our research on DNA from ancient times shows that there was a population -

132
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.440
- Let us call it "hunter/collector", and a new one that we can call "farmers" -

133
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.560
- And that the new population took the place of the old population.

134
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.960
It may have been violent, or only moved the hunters/collectors.

135
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:24.040
But we see no genetic mix of the two populations.

136
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.880
These people came to southeastern Europe and brought agriculture.

137
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.400
Genetically, it is the same people.

138
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:46.000
They came in several waves: at least one through the Mediterranean and one via the Danau corridor.

139
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.080
All population groups in Europe and the Middle East during the younger Stone Age -

140
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.560
- So had a common origin.

141
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.680
The first cattle breeders wandered north and west.

142
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.160
They took over time over the location of the local people -

143
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.320
–And introduced their habits, livestock, seeds -

144
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:15.000
- Objective and cultivation methods and not least their food.

145
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:35.200
The researchers are interested in the major change in eating habits -

146
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.880
- So people have changed physically.

147
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.200
Were there bodily differences -

148
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.400
–Man between the older Stone Age hunters/collectors -

149
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.560
- And the younger Stone Age farmers?

150
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.600
It is one of the issues that Alain Froment has studied.

151
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:07.880
Here at Musée de l'Homme we store legs, especially from the younger Stone Age.

152
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.720
This is a femur -

153
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:17.200
- And it talks about an important aspect of health, namely the body length.

154
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.280
It is an excellent marker.

155
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.440
We know that the body length certainly depends on genetic factors -

156
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.360
- But also on the individual's growing conditions.

157
00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.800
It not only tells about a person's age and dietary habits -

158
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.720
- Also without any diseases.

159
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.280
- Do you have another whole beam?
 - Yes, this is also completely.

160
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.800
This is a hunter and collector from the older Stone Age.

161
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.640
This leg is from the younger Stone Age.

162
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.200
You see the difference in roughness between the two legs.

163
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:15.360
The hit the leg shows a strong, quite muscular individual.

164
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:22.040
You can clearly see the late brackets that have shaped the leg surface.

165
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:29.760
This leg is much narrower and has had visibly less muscle.

166
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:38.480
When comparing skeletons from older and younger Stone Age, some tendencies are visible.

167
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:45.200
For example, older Stone Age hunters and collectors were really athletically built.

168
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.560
They were quite powerful and long, they ate a nutritious and varied diet.

169
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:56.400
During the younger Stone Age, the body length decreased due to the transition-

170
00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:03.120
–To a more single -handed diet, often based on a single cereal -

171
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.080
–And to less strenuous activities.

172
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.880
That is, arable farming and animal husbandry.

173
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:18.280
That work is less intense, but more repetitive.

174
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.440
You can also analyze the impression that muscle activity leaves on the legs.

175
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:36.600
Here I am looking for traces of damage of the osteoarthritis type type

176
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.200
- As the femur carries the body weight.

177
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.920
During the younger Stone Age, muscle activity changed.

178
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:57.920
A farmer did not live the same life as a stray hunter and collector.

179
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.320
His movement patterns were more one -handed.

180
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.880
The women had injuries to knees and ankles -

181
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:15.080
- which are compatible with the crunching position you have when grinding grain.

182
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:21.440
It gives a number of imprints on the pipe legs and on the joints.

183
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:28.120
Based on them, one can assess both the posture and its intensity -

184
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.120
- And thus the consequences for the skeleton.

185
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.640
Thanks to the settlement in Turkey, the researchers have access-

186
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.200
- Too outstanding archaeological material.

187
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.720
Many skeletons found -

188
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.520
- As the inhabitants buried their dead under the floor of their houses.

189
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.080
During the excavations made between 1960 and 2017–

190
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.960
- The remains were held after 815 people from the younger Stone Age.

191
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:29.360
Last year, another 15 were found, ie a total of 830 people.
 There are very many.

192
00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:37.640
The skeleton shows signs that health was deteriorating by the new diet.

193
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.720
The food covered the basic needs, but was less varied -

194
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.840
- And that led to deficiency diseases.

195
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:56.480
There were signs of anemia, so the anthropos wondered what had happened.

196
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.040
It is believed that there may be a lack of something.
 The farmers' diet was poor on proteins -

197
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:10.640
- And rich in carbohydrates, so there will be a shortage of vitamins and maybe trace elements.

198
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.440
I am now examining the teeth of a woman who lived during the younger Stone Age.

199
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.960
A leg can tell you about someone's life-

200
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.120
- And a tooth or a tooth set can tell how that person lived.

201
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:37.280
If someone while the tooth is developing goes through a difficult time -

202
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:44.160
- With stress, starvation or a severe infection, then it is seen as the annual rings on a tree:

203
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.560
It leaves a mark on the tooth.

204
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.720
This front tooth is a bit attacked -

205
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.040
- Two premoors are very attacked and the canine is also attacked.

206
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.400
Iron deficiency leads to anemia -

207
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:10.760
-And here we see micropenations in the eyehole that is due to iron deficiency.

208
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:19.280
It's pretty clear.
 There are criteria that people were in poor health.

209
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.640
It explains inhibited growth and a shorter body length.

210
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:32.400
Moving general health is visible traces of oral infections and tooth loss.

211
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:45.200
During the younger Stone Age, the flour contained grain of silica from the millstone -

212
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.280
- As the tooth surfaces ground and made them almost flat.

213
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:58.520
On the canines and the first cheek tooth, the beginning caries are visible on the dentist.

214
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.440
It is a gateway for infections: bacteria from the mouth can get in -

215
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.840
- And even cause sepsis.

216
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.760
Oral hygiene thus has a crucial importance for human health.

217
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.840
Through the supply of carbohydrates and the changed way of chewing the food -

218
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.720
- The general oral health was deteriorated.

219
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.720
Although agriculture and animal husbandry improved the lives of the people-

220
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.960
–Fick the new diet some negative effects -

221
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.720
- On their physical development and health.

222
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:51.120
The lifestyle brought the younger people's people closer to the animals.

223
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.520
They now lived with sheep, goats and cows -

224
00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:01.160
–And all species attracted by the grain stocks, such as different rodents -

225
00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.040
- And also dogs and cats.

226
00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.560
When humans and animals live close to each other, new problems arise.

227
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.480
The proximity is clearly visible on these murals in Turkey.

228
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.840
Wild animals have always worn on huge amounts of viruses and bacteria.

229
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.080
During the younger Stone Age, people lived with their animals, it was a close contact -

230
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:37.360
- And because of the population increase, you see another pattern of infection.

231
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.600
As an example, I can take measles, which is related to this place.

232
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.960
In the beginning, measles, the wild form, was, so to speak, livestock plague.

233
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:53.280
It was the virus that gave rise to the measles virus.

234
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.880
It was probably during the younger Stone Age, through contact with wild cattle -

235
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:06.800
–As the virus transferred to man, and because of the large population -

236
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.600
- Lightly spent the virus between people and stayed in the population.

237
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:19.120
Younger Stone Age infection patterns differ radically from older Stone Age.

238
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.280
From the sheep came anthrax, pigs and chickens brought with them influenza -

239
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.200
- The dogs rabies, and the horses gave tetanus.

240
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:35.440
Now even tuberculosis, smallpox, malaria, plague - began

241
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.920
- Petty and syphilis to spread.

242
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:46.120
Over 180 diseases appeared together with the agricultural community.

243
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.840
Nevertheless, the population increased sharply during the younger Stone Age.

244
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.960
Perhaps the people adapted to the new threats.

245
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.320
Céline Bon is studying changes in the hereditary mass -

246
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.360
- Hos people who lived during this time period.

247
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:27.480
In paleogenetics you study DNA from ancient people in my case.

248
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:33.760
Their DNA is degraded, but we can still reconstruct different phenomena -

249
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.640
- including population movements, population mixing and so on ...

250
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:46.560
Adaptation to a new environment is evident from how genetic variants have increased in frequency.

251
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.520
The food is one of the basics of biology and for living creatures in general.

252
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.000
So we can imagine that the selection pressure is huge on that factor.

253
00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:02.280
Change in diet changes the environments that people live in -

254
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:08.800
- So it leads to new selection pressure and thus to new genetic variants.

255
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:16.440
The world around us and how we live affects the population's genetic mass.

256
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.760
Gene variants that provide benefits are becoming more common in future generations -

257
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.400
- And some genes that have previously been silent begin to be expressed.

258
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.560
In this way, genetic diversity increases.

259
00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:38.480
The first diet -related change we see is the increase of a variant -

260
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.440
- which brings light skin color.

261
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:55.760
The skin had been darker, but from the younger Stone Age it changed:

262
00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.720
Almost 100 % of the population had the variant that brings lighter skin.

263
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:13.080
One possible explanation for that skin color is adaptation to the younger Stone Age diet.

264
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:20.920
The diet of the hunters and collectors was richer on protein and thus on vitamin D.

265
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.960
During the younger Stone Age, the diet became less varied, more starchy -

266
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.960
- And therefore less rich in vitamins and nutrients in general.

267
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:42.040
But vitamin D can be formed in the body when the skin is exposed to sun.

268
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.600
And light skin color makes it easier.

269
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:55.520
The lack of vitamin D led to dark-skinned population groups-

270
00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.040
- With time developed a lighter skin color.

271
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:13.560
It is conceivable that when you no longer received vitamin D through the diet-

272
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:19.800
–Ativated a selection pressure that favored individuals with lighter skin -

273
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.920
-As it could more easily absorb vitamin D.

274
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:28.400
The light -skinned then spread to Europe.

275
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:34.160
It was not the only diet -related change man was exposed to -

276
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.640
- During the younger Stone Age.

277
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:45.000
Equally crucial was a new food that would be vital - milk.

278
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:52.000
As soon as you started breeding pets, you could consume their milk.

279
00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:00.680
Man needs the enzyme lactate to break down lactose into milk.

280
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.040
When children stop breastfeeding reduces the production of lactase -

281
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.240
- In most population groups.
 Then it becomes difficult to drink milk.

282
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.080
From the younger Stone Age, there is a selection pressure in Europe in Europe -

283
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.920
—To a variant that could split milk as an adult: that produced lactate then -

284
00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.160
- In contrast to what is common in mammals.

285
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.640
There was a population that could drink milk throughout their lives.

286
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:39.880
But how fast did it go?
 How long does it take for heritage to change?

287
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:48.680
At the University of Bristol, the researchers seek answers to that question -

288
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:54.400
- In ceramics from the younger Stone Age that has been found at excavations.

289
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:08.320
One must imagine that then was the ability to split milk vital.

290
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:24.480
This ceramic comes from an ancient cooking vessel.

291
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.880
When cooking in porous ceramic -

292
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:35.480
- Things fat and other lipids into the pores on ceramics.

293
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.000
With the help of these multi -thousand -year -old shards -

294
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.600
- Can you find out what was cooked in the ancient clay vessels.

295
00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:55.000
With our technology we can see traces of milk in shards that are thousands of years old -

296
00:31:55.160 --> 00:32:00.440
- Yes, up to 10,000 years old.
 It's pretty impressive.

297
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.840
One grinds away the surface of ceramics -

298
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.720
- To ensure that the lipids to be analyzed are inside the shards -

299
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.920
- And is not a contamination on the outside.

300
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:29.320
You take two to three grams which are then powdered.

301
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.920
Charlie pours solvents on the shard that we have just crushed.

302
00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.120
Then it all mixes.

303
00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.480
And we will now analyze this.

304
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:08.000
Each time an association is registered, the curve goes up.

305
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.640
We see the difference between fat from ruminants and fat from non-packers.

306
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.200
We can also distinguish between milk and meat.

307
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.440
By tracking the remains of milk in ceramics from different settlements -

308
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:33.000
- You know which population groups drank milk, where they lived and when.

309
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.880
The tasks, and the research on gene changes during the younger Stone Age-

310
00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:46.520
- Make it possible to map how and when the lactostolerance spread.

311
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:55.320
Preserving the production of lactas is the strongest selection pressure -

312
00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.800
- In man's through today.
 Sometimes that process took only a few thousand years.

313
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:11.000
The mutation is most common in northern Europe, that is, in the UK -

314
00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.280
- Germany and Scandinavia.
 It is less common around the Mediterranean.

315
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.560
For those who went over to animal husbandry -

316
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:29.200
- It was 2,000-3,000 years to adapt to drinking milk.

317
00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.200
But the researchers do not know why that property -

318
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:43.880
- Is so common in some European groups and so rare in others.

319
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.760
There were groups during the same time -

320
00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.960
- As a dairy products without having this gene change.

321
00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:02.080
This shard was found in Poland, in Ludwinowo.

322
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.560
It is from the younger Stone Age, about 7,000 years ago.

323
00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:12.080
The shard has been decorated by pinching.
 One sees the imprint-

324
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:18.680
- Of the person who made the ceramics 7,000 years ago.
 Very moving!

325
00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:31.240
We have analyzed ceramic shards with holes in -

326
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.280
– Which is very similar to today's cheese molds -

327
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.800
- So we know they were used to make cheese.

328
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:47.320
It was during the younger Stone Age that you learned to process food.

329
00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.160
For example, making cheese and yogurt.

330
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:57.320
They came in ways to reduce the lactose in the milk by acid -

331
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:05.200
- Or to remove it, by making cheese or yogurt.

332
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.280
The genes changed to fit the new diet.

333
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.920
At the same time, people learned to change the food -

334
00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.200
- So they could use it.

335
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:30.080
Methods were developed to preserve and cook the food -

336
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:35.280
- So it became easier to digest and provided as much nutrition as possible.

337
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.480
Now we're going to grind grains.

338
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.840
During the younger Stone Age, the harvested grain began to be processed -

339
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.760
- By baking bread.
 The bread was energy -rich and had good durability.

340
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.920
So it became a basic food.

341
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.600
It is starting to be clear.

342
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.440
We are going to make a whole grain loaf.

343
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:19.000
Wheat and milk are two super foods.
 Wheat has sugar, protein, vitamins.

344
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:25.440
When baked it may lose a little, but younger Stone Age flour was whole grain flour.

345
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:33.280
Now we let it ferment in peace and quiet in the heat.

346
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:52.360
The new ways to process the food all have one thing in common.

347
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.680
They make it softer and easier to chew.

348
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.720
This has led to some unexpected consequences for man.

349
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:35.440
Foneticists at the University of Barcelona have discovered something strange.

350
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.840
It has been thought that today's language sounds much like the language of ancient times.

351
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.560
But in the 1980s, it performed the appearance of Linguist Charles Hockett the thought-

352
00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:03.520
–Ad the languages spoken by agricultural people and those spoken by non-agricultural people-

353
00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:12.160
- Has slightly different sound systems.
 This applies to the labiodental phonemen /f /and /v /.

354
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.360
/f/

355
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.560
/V/

356
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:22.360
Fonemen / F / and / V / is much more common in languages spoken by agricultural people.

357
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.360
The idea comes from an appearance change.

358
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.520
During the younger Stone Age, people's lower jaw took new form.

359
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.760
Before the rise of agriculture, the children were born with slightly overbite-

360
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.600
- which was corrected when the lower jaw had grown completed.

361
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.960
Then the front teeth were met towards the tip-

362
00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:54.880
- And it made hard and tough food chewed effectively.

363
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:06.400
Here we have photos that show the change in the jaw that we are talking about.

364
00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.720
The first skull is from the older Stone Age -

365
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.720
- And there the front teeth meet to tip.

366
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:21.280
The other is from the middle age, and the bite looks the same.

367
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:28.200
However, this one comes from the Bronze Age, after the introduction of agriculture -

368
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.800
- And here it is clear that the bite looks like this, like mine.

369
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.440
During the younger Stone Age, when the food became easier to chew -

370
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.520
- ceased the change in the bite.

371
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.840
The lower jaw did not grow as much as before.

372
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.600
The lower jaw helps to shape the different language sounds -

373
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:56.280
- In the same way as the tongue, lips, nose and vocal cords.

374
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.640
The researchers have measured the effect of the change of jaws -

375
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:09.720
- When it comes to the muscle power required to create different language sounds.

376
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.560
When pronouncing the lab dials /f /and /v / -

377
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:25.560
- You actually have to put your lower lip against the upper teeth.

378
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:33.800
It is easier if the lower jaw is a little shorter than if it looks like this.

379
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:40.200
The first thing we did was run a so -called biomechanical computer simulation.

380
00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:46.040
Through biomechanical simulation you can measure the load on the muscles -

381
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:52.320
- Which helps to get the sound in question.
 Here is the lace-on-tip bite.

382
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:59.200
The sound produced is a labiod number.
 And the model shows -

383
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.440
–To the load on the muscles when one / f / or / v / pronounced -

384
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.120
- Is higher with this bite than with this.

385
00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.280
/f/

386
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.720
/V/

387
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.120
The greater effort a language sound requires -

388
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.440
- Desto is more unusual in the language.

389
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.360
The new diet changed the lower jaw.

390
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.280
Could this in turn have led to other sound systems in the language?

391
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.320
We are in spain.
 We will probable not see the sagrada família.

392
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.880
ESTA MAñana He Comido Fruta Fresca a Trozos.

393
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.240
Ce Matin au Petit-Déjeuner, J'AI price des œufs, you bacon.

394
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:48.200
To test language sound hypothesis, you have statistical methods -

395
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.960
—Mold the frequency of phonemen /f /and /v / -

396
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:56.720
- Hos the hunter and collectors who remain today.

397
00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.680
One has gone back in language history -

398
00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.320
- To try to determine when / f / and / v / arose.

399
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.880
The important thing is that in the beginning, 8,000 years ago -

400
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:20.480
- were the probability of labiodental small, but they became more and more common.

401
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:27.160
The changes can be correlated with the production of more lightly owed food -

402
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.840
–The then with the introduction of agriculture.

403
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.440
There has been a language sound development -

404
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:53.560
- This can be linked to changed eating habits with the rise of agriculture.

405
00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.240
The new food would not only change the anatomy of man

406
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.360
- and thereby the language.

407
00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.440
The production of large amounts of foods that were easy to store -

408
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.760
- also fell consequences for the entire social structure.

409
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.560
At the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria there is an archaeological find site -

410
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.880
- Which testifies to profound social changes.

411
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:43.160
This burial ground is outside warn.

412
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:50.160
The first excavations were made in 1972–

413
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.200
- And they resumed last year.

414
00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:03.680
This is from the middle of the fifth millennium BC, from Copper Age -

415
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.760
—They between 4,500 and 4300 BC, simplified.

416
00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.280
French and Bulgarian archaeologists -

417
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:22.840
- Have participated in the excavations of this place since it was discovered.

418
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:35.760
The strong flow in human history is the transition to agriculture.

419
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.000
After a period of agriculture, the possibility of storing -

420
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:46.520
- And thus very quickly also the opportunity to store surplus.

421
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:54.840
When the younger Stone Age had lasted for 800–1,000 years in Europe -

422
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.720
- Specialized businesses, crafts.

423
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.040
The abundance of food enabled society to support people -

424
00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.800
- which devoted itself to other than agriculture.

425
00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.800
For example, they became warriors or craftsmen.

426
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:20.200
This is where you showed me that the grave was.

427
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.160
It was this one.

428
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:32.120
And this is grave 310.

429
00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.040
308, 309, 311.

430
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:42.440
So far we have excavated 311 graves.

431
00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:51.120
In grave 307 there are vessels with some stones.

432
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.600
Then we have a group of legs between them, under this skull.

433
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:05.160
In this vessel we found a copper needle -

434
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:11.360
–And a small necklace of ...

435
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.120
Oh, so nice.

436
00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.360
Each item has been selected to be placed in the grave with the dead.

437
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:29.040
Therefore, it is of course chosen by the society that buried the dead.

438
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.920
We try to understand this society's values.

439
00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.880
Great!

440
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:43.280
Laurence Manolakakis is a specialist in stone tools from the younger Stone Age.

441
00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.760
Especially on strange objects of flint.

442
00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:58.680
They have only been found in some rare cases among the gifts in the 311 graves.

443
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.280
They clearly show that the tasks were divided.

444
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.920
This is a miracle.
 It is a dagger blade of flint.

445
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:21.680
It is the longest known leaf in this part of the southeastern Balkans.

446
00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:27.160
It is 42.5 centimeters long.

447
00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:34.480
It is almost evenly thick in its entire length-

448
00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.320
- And is very thin, despite its length.

449
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:45.400
It is about great skill that was achieved after a long apprenticeship.

450
00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.840
It is also about specialization -

451
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.600
- Something more than: "I'm very handy."

452
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:59.800
That is in line with what we know about the emergence of craftsmen.

453
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.640
On one of the burial grounds, a gold tax was found -

454
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:22.920
- Which is unique for this stage in the history of humanity.

455
00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:40.360
Only specialized craftsmen who did not have to devote themselves to agricultural -

456
00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:45.000
- Can have made these gold items.

457
00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.960
The most important object is the spire.

458
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.600
The battle ax has a shaft -

459
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:05.080
- Which is enclosed in gold rings.

460
00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.360
The necklace of gold beads is also very important.

461
00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:16.960
But it is only in this grave that we have found pearl necklace -

462
00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:22.120
– Which is not just made of pure copper, pure gold -

463
00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:28.200
- The out of a natural alloy between gold and silver.

464
00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.840
A new diet that arose during the younger Stone Age -

465
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.840
- Have changed us forever.

466
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.520
It has affected both our bodies, and how we think, speak and create.

467
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.000
The long flint daggers, ceramics and golden jewelry -

468
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.240
- was made by specialized craftsmen.

469
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.200
They foretell the next step in human development:

470
00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:11.640
The Bronze Age - and the emergence of the first major civilizations.

471
00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:18.080
Soon new inventions in the management of food would follow.

472
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:22.960
Humans began to refine plants, fruits and vegetables -

473
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.360
- To make them more useful and tastier.

474
00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:33.320
New groceries, such as marinades for preservation and wine, became everyday.

475
00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.080
Diet continues to develop -

476
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:41.040
- And helps to shape us into who we are today.

477
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:49.400
What should we eat now, then, to develop into better creatures?

478
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.880
How should we get to the next level?

479
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:58.520
We may return with answers to that, in some program in a few thousand years.

480
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.720
But this movie is on SVT Play this summer.

481
00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.000
Now news from the world of science.

482
00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.440
Although the Coronapandemia has sounded from, many are still suffering from the virus's suites.

483
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:22.040
Postcovid has been difficult to diagnose and treat.

484
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:28.160
But now researchers have found an important cause of the prolonged problems -

485
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.800
- With
 Extreme fatigue and worse cognition that many suffer from.

486
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.560
Now it has been shown that some proteins -

487
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:45.000
— Which are involved in these systems for blood clots and inflammation -

488
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:50.800
- Is elevated or lowered in patients with postcovid.

489
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:56.000
And then you know better where to direct your drugs.

490
00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:01.400
Researchers have analyzed over 6,000 different proteins -

491
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:08.600
- In blood from 113 covid patients, of which about half have developed postcovid.

492
00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.440
The blood has been analyzed on two occasions -

493
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:19.880
- And then changes have been found in some proteins in those with postcovid.

494
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:26.240
This is a very important study.
 After all, this is a new disease -

495
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:32.800
–And now we know more about which proteins and other markers -

496
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.960
– That differs for these patients -

497
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:40.920
- And then we can better think about the treatments.

498
00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.040
So it is an important step forward.

499
00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:53.800
Breaking uranium from mountains in this way is a dirty business.

500
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.000
After all, uranium is used as fuel in nuclear power plants.

501
00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:02.320
But there is a more environmentally friendly way to get uranium: from seawater.

502
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:08.680
The seas are so large, so there are about 4-5 billion tonnes of uranium in the sea water.

503
00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.800
If you pick it out of the seawater -

504
00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:17.320
- So the fixed uranium minerals will dissolve a little to -

505
00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.840
- So it becomes a Renewable Source.

506
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.560
The uranium is leached from the rock through rivers and lakes and then ends up in the seas.

507
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:32.200
But cleaning the uranium from the seas is difficult.

508
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.320
Now Chinese researchers have developed a new material:

509
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:43.920
A carbon fiber weave that captures uranus in electrochemical.

510
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.520
The yellow on the carbon fiber fabric is uranium.

511
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.360
You don't have to break a bunch of stone-

512
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:57.720
- Use you pick up the uranium quite clean from the seawater.

513
00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.920
And unlike when breaking uranium from mountain-

514
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:08.680
- So there is no hazardous waste when cleaning uranium out of water.

515
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:14.760
But it is still an expensive method and not yet commercially useful.

516
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:27.080
The development of artificial intelligence is fast now.

517
00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.600
It is often heard that it goes fast.

518
00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.920
Where is the limit for what AI will be able to do?

519
00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:39.040
In the next world of science we find out how AI really works -

520
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:44.160
- And what the experts consider to be the greatest danger of AI.

521
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:51.400
What kind of future are we going to meet - dystopian or fascinating?

522
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.480
In the future, robots can help doctors and nurses -

523
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.640
- Concentrate on the needs of individual patients.

524
00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:05.760
"We solve everything with the help of AI! Cancer, Transport, Education" ...

525
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.720
Someone suggested AI to detect genocide.
 I just: "huh?!"

526
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:16.080
AI can be used to distribute resources such as food and energy.

527
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:22.000
Within traditional symbolic AI, the machine is provided with knowledge.

528
00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:27.560
Suddenly it turned out that deep machine learning works much better.

529
00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:32.800
Mathematics try feverishly to understand how it works, but no one really knows.

530
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:38.520
- Are you often in New York?
 - Mest at work, but sometimes for pleasure.
