00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
If you keep track of your finances, you get more money. A "quick fix".

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,520
I have to keep track of my finances now.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,120
Mia Ingelström is not only an economist, she is also a personal trainer in economics.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,960
Yes, you hear. Should we start this?

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Welcome to this series that will make you financially stronger-

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35.560
-The gear and maybe freer.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,480
If you keep track of your finances, you get more money. A "quick fix".

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,280
-Does it agree, Mia? -Absolutely. You can't afford not to keep track.

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,520
You need to do the things you want in life.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,200
Here is Mia. How can you so much, so you can make such statements?

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00.800
I love finances. I'm economic p. Personal trainer in finance.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02.880
What should we learn today?

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06.800
Where you have to start to take control of your finances.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
-And where is it? -You have to keep track of where you are today. The current situation.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,360
Then we run. We can skip this section. I already know what I earn.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,320
I know how much dog food costs ... and lunch.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,240
-To the ear? -A crown here or there ...

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,480
-How exactly should it be? -The exactly. The risk exists ...

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,120
... that we forget things we have paid. Do you keep track of all streaming services ...

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,880
... you subscribe to? Do you keep track of all the dinners you have paid?

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,000
-All presents you bought? -No, stop ... I don't have it.

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,080
-No, exactly. -How do you do then?

23
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,200
You take the help of an app. Either the bank or any other economy app.

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00.440
They help us get all the expenses of the year, but also the income.

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,640
An indescribable help for this job. Because you have to go back a year in time.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:14,280
For the months, differ. Sometimes comes an annual invoice, another time it's Christmas ...

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,000
... or birthdays. You need to get the rub in one year and then share with twelve-

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,960
-To get one average per month. Then you can use it-

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,160
-To see if what comes in is enough for what goes out, on average per month.

30
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,080
—Tocking, right? -Here you just do it once?

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,920
Yes, we will find out the current situation.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,720
And it then sets the bar for what we want to do in the future.

33
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,120
-Then we'll do it. Easy, now we take a cup. -We'll do that.

34
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,360
Mia, like this can be a little difficult.

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:07.840
To cave in old bad choices. Rice loans and a payroll negotiation you just satisfied with ...

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,440
-It's not so fun. -You aren't the only one ...

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,360
The most important thing is not to evaluate.

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,040
When we find out the current situation you should just check out the fact-

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:29,760
-Not value what you've done. You can choose to do differently in the future.

40
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
-So do not value. — Like a robot running down the numbers ...

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Turn off the emotions. Look up facts.

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,680
Hello. Viewing question. Funny.

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,680
"Hello 'got in shape financially'. I have iron check on my money"-

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51.040
-"But not on my partner and we have a common economy."

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,160
-How do you do then? -You need access to information ...

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,680
... about what the household has done with.

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02.840
But you don't have to do the job together. But if you do, it is fantastic.

48
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,360
Sit down jointly if you can and do the job.

49
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,480
Otherwise, you need to access information about what the other has paid.

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,320
Hope the viewer was satisfied with the answer. What have I learned today?

51
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,080
What have we learned? Do not evaluate. Keep the facts and emotions apart.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,760
Use app. Smooth. Think of the entire household, not just your part.

53
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,240
-Just right. Good. -Well then. Then we have learned it.

54
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,760
Thanks for today.

55
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,000
-A financial tip for you. -Exciting.

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,360
Do not use soap. After all, there will be a few bucks.

57
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,720
I thought I knew something ...
