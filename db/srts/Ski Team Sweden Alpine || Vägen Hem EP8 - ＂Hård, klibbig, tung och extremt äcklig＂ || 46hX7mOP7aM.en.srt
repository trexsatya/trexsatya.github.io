1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
In February 2019 the World Championships are held i Åre Sweden.


2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.240
A village that hosts the Championships for the third time.


3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.120
When the best alpine skiers in the world compete for medals and honour.


4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.440
Follow the Swedish Alpine Team behind the scenes


5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.560
When they prepare for the World Championships


6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.520
Follow us on our way home


7
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.320
My autumn training has been good.
 -


8
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.400
I improve all the time and i think…


9
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.880
it’s coming more and more, then there are a lot of ups and downs


10
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.120
but the speed is there and


11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.920
I just need to grind and it will come more and more


12
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.640
all the time I believe that, well yes.


13
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.080
One often talk about speed and experience


14
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.640
Can you feel now, compared to last year, that when you return


15
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.080
to certain places,


16
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.760
you’re familiar with the slope, how much that that have an impact?


17
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.520
Yeah, definitely


18
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.120
I wish I was one of those that just:


19
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.200
whatever, let’s go, new slope, doesn’t matter.


20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.800
But so much difference.


21
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.320
Just arriving now at Garmisch and having raced the downhill-


22
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.600
so nice, I already know, before the first inspection where-


23
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.560
I’m going and whats needed


24
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.120
I know so much already before step one.


25
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.000
Instead of starting at step zero and then working your way up


26
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.720
So, enormous difference.


27
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.720
Arriving at new slopes there is an immediate noticeability


28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.120
that I’m behind and can’t match the top skiers


29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.480
in the world, so there is a vast difference.


30
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.800
It’s extremely comforting to arrive at a place where you’ve been before.


31
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.400
It takes a lot of experience.


32
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.880
Partly because you have to get to know the slopes in a new way.


33
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.640
The speed is so high and there is so much going on


34
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.400
and very high risk.


35
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.160
I believe that the mental part of a speed competition - partly learning-


36
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.840
everything, but also have the guts to throw yourself out there, it takes a while.


37
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.640
before you get over the part you have to find your way down there


38
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.400
Then you can just focus on riding the skies and seeking the speed.


39
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.560
Many times I’ve arrived at a slope for the first time


40
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.160
not knowing where I’m going


41
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.880
Even though you have two practice runs and two competitions it is


42
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.320
still difficult to make it all the way down on the last day.


43
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.120
It takes a while because you have


44
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.880
four runs in the same slope and the you get to


45
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.400
come back the year after.


46
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.400
So it takes a while before you learn.


47
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360
Welcome.


48
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.880
No, no cleaning.


49
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.320
Let’s hurry to Lisa’s.


50
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.120
Welcome to us, by the way.


51
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.720
I’ve tidied up.


52
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720
Then how lives here?


53
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.760
When Lisa has her own room it’s pretty ok.


54
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840
If you don’t share rooms with her, then you have


55
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.760
about a fifth of the room, and she has the rest of it like this:


56
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.880
The sickest thing is her packing, no-one can beat her pace at packing.


57
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.880
She just showed everything down there, nothing is folded, everything is just


58
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.680
Then she jumped on her bag, zippes it shut, then she’s ahead of everyone.


59
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840
Do you want to say hello to Lin?


60
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.080
Here’s someone who’s related to Matts Olsson I think.


61
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.200
Hello


62
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.840
Howdy


63
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.720
-Are we disturbing? 
-No


64
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.840
Look at this.


65
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.320
Yes, even the inshoes.


66
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
Everything should be nice and clean.


67
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.760
It’s not even super nice.


68
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.840
I actually get a little anxiety from that.


69
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.560
You and Matts Olsson.


70
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.960
Agree, Matts, I get you.


71
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.240
Do you also fold your dirty laundry?


72
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.680
Trainers-tucked away. 
Dirty laundry- folded!


73
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.800
Yes, I do, actually.


74
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.040
Otherwise it doesn’t fit. I don’t get how Lisa


75
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.920
Hörnblad is able to.


76
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840
We also have Ida here.


77
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.840
Ida?


78
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.640
She hasn’t left that spot since she came home.


79
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.760
I’m a little tired so I laid down.


80
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.200
Should we talk a bit about Lisa’s porridge perhaps?


81
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.200
Let’s.


82
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.800
No we do it all together, so she doesn’t have much of


83
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.240
a choice


84
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.840
If she makes it by her self then she will


85
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.400
What would you say the oatmeal recipe calls for, is it 50-50


86
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.080
water and oats?


87
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.320
And Lisa’ll do 90-10


88
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.280
Oats being 90 then


89
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.000
And a tiny tiny drop of water


90
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.880
and then its left to mush together.


91
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.920
Oatmeal a la Lisa. How does it work?


92
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.960
It’s simple.


93
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.640
A lot of oats, a lot of salt and a small amount of water.


94
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600
Sticky?


95
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.440
Sticky, as it should be, yes.


96
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.440
So good.


97
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720
It’s very…


98
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.680
Hard, sticky and heavy.


99
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.440
Horrendously disgusting.


100
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.560
Salt. It’s like supposed to taste salty.


101
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.480
The you just pour it on.


102
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680
It’s horrific.


103
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It’s like.


104
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.480
She’ll cook it twice as long as a normal person would.


105
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.280
It turns into a glue:ish cement.


106
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.680
Rock hard.


107
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.040
Hard and though.


108
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.520
I don’t get how she can eat it.


109
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.360
Actually, It’s quite impressive.


110
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.200
Now it’s ready. 
Nu it just needs to,


111
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.800
Mix, you know.


112
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800
Nothing on top?


113
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.240
Yes banana.


114
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960
There’s banana on top.


115
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.920
You add some banana here, and then it’s go time.


116
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.320
It could use a little more salt.


117
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.200
My jump was better now, wasn’t it?


118
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
Yes it was


119
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.000
Now you where more aligned, and then the skies will follow the substratum.


120
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.320
Now you’ve been selected of the World Championships.
What went through your mind?


121
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.520
It like, felt too good to be true.


122
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It’s so exciting and I


123
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.120
feel like I’m here to gain experience.


124
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.320
If I manage to do the skiing, I know I’m capable of,


125
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.760
Then I will be so pleased. But I haven’t set any


126
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.480
goals to preform at a certain level compared to the competition.


127
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.440
If I where to give you any advise


128
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.400
it would be to take advantage of


129
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.520
thats you’re on your ”home turf” and


130
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.880
I know I shouldn’t say ”enjoy it”, because I used to hate when people said


131
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.600
”enjoy it” to me, that I in a race would enjoy it, but


132
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.080
really feel the strength of playing on your home turf.


133
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.320
When I stood at the START and everyone was shouting ”Åre” it felt


134
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.440
so damn powerful.


135
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.680
And something that built me up even more.


136
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.480
For everyone thats arrive here, the audience?


137
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.440
What can they expect?


138
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.040
Spectacular races.


139
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.400
The best afterski and night life, maybe we shouldn’t mention that,


140
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.680
for the athletes, but for the audience I think it will


141
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.080
be a tremendous ”folkfest”/ party


142
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.440
Where skiing is one big part


143
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.040
but also whats is happening in the surroundings,


144
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.480
what the town, Åre has to offer.


145
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.280
I think it will be epic.


146
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.400
It finally dawns on you, that it’s finally happening.


147
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.560
It’s just feels great, and as I said


148
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.600
My aim is set on top ten, but the expectation is just that it


149
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.120
will be so much fun to race, full speed ahead.


150
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.480
I’m super stoked.


151
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.160
A bit jittery, but mostly just looking forward to getting out there and race.


152
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.320
I’m excited. 
It will be so much fun.
