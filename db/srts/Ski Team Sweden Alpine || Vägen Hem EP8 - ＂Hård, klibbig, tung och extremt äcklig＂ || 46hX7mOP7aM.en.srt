1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
In February 2019, the Alpina World Cup is decided in Åre.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.240
A village that for the third time is hosting when the world

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.120
 Best skiers should make up in honor and medals.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.440
Follow behind the scenes when Sweden's alpine national team

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.560
 Prepares for a World Cup at home.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.520
Follow along on the way home.

7
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.320
I have made a very good autumn, trained hard and

8
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.400
 I take steps all the time and I think that -

9
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.880
 It comes more and more, and then it is very upside down -

10
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.120
 But that the speed is there and ...

11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.920
I just need to rub on and there will be more and more

12
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.640
 All the time so I think, yes.

13
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.080
You often talk about routine.

14
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.640
Can you feel now, from last year, that when you come

15
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.080
 back to some places, that you have been there once and -

16
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.760
 You recognize the hill and how much does it affect?

17
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.520
Super very much.

18
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.120
I wish I was one of those just as:

19
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.200
"Lala, now we drive, new hill, doesn't matter."

20
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.800
But a lot of difference.

21
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.320
Just to get to Garmisch now and have run the downhill

22
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.600
 Great, I already know before the first inspection was -

23
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.560
 I will, what is needed and what it takes as well as and -

24
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.120
 I know so much before step one.

25
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.000
Instead of starting on step zero and then trotting up.

26
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.720
So, huge difference.

27
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.720
When I get to new slopes, you immediately see that

28
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.120
 I am behind and then you do not match the best -

29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.480
 In the world there is a big difference.

30
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.800
It feels extremely nice to come to a place you have been.

31
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.400
A lot of experience is required.

32
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.880
Partly because you have to learn the slopes in a different way.

33
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.640
There are such high speeds and there is a lot that happens

34
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.400
 And a lot of risks.

35
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.160
I think the mental part of a speed competition partly to learn -

36
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.840
 everything but also to dare to throw out, it takes a while -

37
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.640
 Before you get over the bit that you have to look down.

38
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.400
Without then, you can focus on skiing and searching for speed.

39
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.560
I have come many times the first time to the hill and

40
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.160
 Don't know where I'm going anywhere.

41
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.880
Even though you have two throughout and two races, it is

42
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.320
 Still difficult the last day you get down.

43
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.120
It takes a while because one has

44
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.880
 Four rides in the same hill in one year, then you should -

45
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.400
 come back next year again.

46
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.400
So it takes a while before you learn.

47
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.360
Welcome.

48
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.880
No, no cleaning.

49
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.320
We rush to Lisa.

50
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.120
Welcome to us by the way.

51
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.720
I have cleaned.

52
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720
Who lives here then

53
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.760
When Lisa has her own room, then it's okay.

54
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840
If you share room with her, then you have

55
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.760
 One fifth of the room she has the rest about this.

56
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.880
The sickest is when she packs, no one is so quick to pack.

57
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.880
She just pushes everything down, nothing is weight, everything is just:

58
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.680
Then she jumps on the bag, pulls it again, so she is before everyone.

59
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840
Should we greet Lin

60
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.080
Here we have someone who is related to Matts Olsson I think.

61
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.200
Hello.

62
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.840
Hey.

63
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.720
 Do we disturb?
 - No.

64
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.840
Here you can see, check out there.

65
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.320
Yes, even the inner shoes.

66
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160
It should be neat and nice.

67
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.760
It's not even very nice.

68
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.840
I get some anxiety from that actually.

69
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.560
It's you and Matts Olsson.

70
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.960
Yes, so Matts, I understand you.

71
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.240
Do you also fold the dirt wash

72
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.680
Exercise shoes wrapped.
 Dirt wash - weight.

73
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.800
Yes, I actually do.

74
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.040
Otherwise it won't go down, I don't understand how Lisa

75
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.920
 Corner leaves can do it.

76
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840
We also have Ida here.

77
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.840
Ida

78
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.640
Haven't moved out of the spot since she came home.

79
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.760
I'm a little tired so I lay down.

80
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.200
Should we tell you a little about Lisa's porridge maybe

81
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.200
Yes we can do that.

82
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.800
Now we all do together so she doesn't have much to

83
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.240
 Choose.

84
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.840
If she does herself, then she does ..

85
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.400
If you were to say the recipe for porridge, it's 5050 -

86
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.080
 Water, oatmeal?

87
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.320
And Lisa thus has 9010.

88
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.280
Oatmeal is 90 then.

89
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.000
And then it's a little splash of water.

90
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.880
And then it gets to go together.

91
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.920
Porridge at La Lisa.
 How does it work

92
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.960
It is easy.

93
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.640
There is a lot of oatmeal, a lot of salt and some water.

94
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600
Sticky

95
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.440
It should be sticky, yes.

96
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.440
Good as well.

97
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720
It is very ...

98
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.680
Hard, sticky, heavy.

99
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.440
Extremely disgusting.

100
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.560
Salt.
 It should taste salt as well.

101
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.480
Then you just pour.

102
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680
It is terrible.

103
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It's like.

104
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.480
She boils it twice as long as an ordinary person.

105
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.280
After all, it becomes like wallpaper paste.

106
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.680
Hard.

107
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.040
Hard and tough and ...

108
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.520
I don't understand how she can swallow it.

109
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.360
It's impressive indeed.

110
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.200
Now it's finished.
 Now it's just going to ...

111
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.800
Together, like.

112
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800
You have nothing on

113
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.240
Yes, the track.

114
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960
The track is on.

115
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.920
If you put on a little track here then it is ready to run.

116
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.320
A little more salt, I could have.

117
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.200
Sure my hope was better now

118
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
Yes it was.

119
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.000
Now you were central to the stuff, then the skis follow the ground.

120
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.320
Now you have been selected for the World Cup.
 How did you think then

121
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.520
It feels too good to be true.

122
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It's great fun and I

123
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.120
 Feel that I am here to create experience.

124
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.320
If I manage to ride the skiing I know I can go

125
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.760
 Then I will be really happy but I have not set up -

126
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.480
 Some results.

127
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.440
Should I give some tips ...

128
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.400
so is it to take advantage of

129
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.520
 Partly that it is home and ...

130
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.880
I will not say enjoy because I hated when people said

131
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.600
 Enjoy me, that I would be at the competition and enjoy but -

132
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.080
 Feel the strength of being at home.

133
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.320
When I was on the start and everyone roared "Åre" it felt

134
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.440
 So damn powerful.

135
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.680
And something that built me even more.

136
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.480
For all who come here then, the audience

137
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.440
What do they have to expect

138
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.040
Spectacular competitions.

139
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.400
Funny nightlife, maybe you shouldn't talk so much about

140
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.680
 For the sake of the athletes but for the sake of the audience, I think that -

141
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.080
 It will be a real folk party.

142
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.440
Where one should take advantage of the skiing as you

143
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.040
 Will get to see but also all around as -

144
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.480
 The village and Åre offer.

145
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.280
I think it will be powerful.

146
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.400
It goes up for one to finally happen.

147
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.560
It just feels fucking fun and as i said then so

148
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.600
 I bet on top 10, but expectations are just that -

149
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.120
 It will be great fun to race and out and gas.

150
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.480
I am very charged.

151
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.160
Pirry, but look forward to going very much.

152
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.320
I'm charged.
 It will be great fun.
