1
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.880
<c. Head talkative> I have always had the feeling that we <C. HOVAPratare> who went to Solvikskolan was lucky.

2
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.720
The children should not live in a pure life -

3
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.120
–And learn to become peaky people.

4
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.800
<c. Head Tapers> But through a Facebook group I made <C. Head talkative> contact with former students.

5
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.960
It was good to be crazy, many games were about being crazy.

6
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.560
<c. Head talkative> After hearing their stories -

7
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.800
<c. Head Tapers> - I started to see <c. Head Tapers> a completely different side of Solvik.

8
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.960
Those who wanted to bully me had free hunting season.

9
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.160
"Clearly she gets bullied, she is who she is."

10
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.320
"Look what she said, what he said ..." It is to look in a trash can.

11
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.520
<c. Head talkative> The school had <c.hhukhurstare> a magnificent plan for us.

12
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.800
They should not be adapted to society, they should change society.

13
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.080
<c. Head talkative> But the plan suits only some children.

14
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.480
She loved you as a student.
 It was very "jasper here and jasper there".

15
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.280
Hello!

16
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440
The school has a very dark side -

17
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.840
- With ideal and how to change people.

18
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.160
<c. Head Tapers> Was the school split us <c. Head Treaty> in the right and wrong kind of child?

19
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.000
There were some who were not in principle attributed to any human value.

20
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.600
<c. Head Tapers> Each New Story <c. Head Tapers> is like a puzzle piece -

21
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.520
<c. Head Tapers> - As step by step <c. Huvudpratare> take me closer to an answer.

22
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.880
If I say Boll-Ove, what do you think about then?

23
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:05.320
Yes, that is one reason why I thought I wanted to be interviewed.

24
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.520
<c. Head Tapers> What was we really about <C. HOVE PREPERS> - We who were children at Solviksskolan?

25
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.760
<c.sang> up through the air

26
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.720
<c.sang> away over the ocean

27
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.520
<c.Sang> over the earth

28
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.000
<c.sang> in a staggering journey!

29
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.240
<c.sang> the queen of the morning

30
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.640
<c.sang> with the rosy rod

31
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.160
<c.sang> waving us out

32
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.920
<c.sang> against a waking world

33
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.160
<c. Head Treaty> Solvikskolan is a Waldorf School.

34
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.760
<c. Head Tapers> Waldor Movement was started in Germany <C. Head Tapers> In the late 1910s-

35
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.120
<C. Head Tapers> and came to Sweden in the 1930s.

36
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.200
<c. Head Treaty> 1980 it was started as with time <c. Huvudpratare> would be called the Solvikskolan -

37
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.280
<c. Head Tapers> - and just like other Waldorf schools <C. Head Tapers>, freedom and art were put into focus.

38
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.880
For the whole pedagogy is a matter of awakening the young man.

39
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.720
<c. Head talkative> But at my school they took that <c. head talkative> much, much longer.

40
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.640
<c. Head Tapers> Instead of Common Tuition <C. Head Tapers> we had plays and great spectacle -

41
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.200
<c. Head Treaty> - which could take over the entire school.

42
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.560
<c. Head talkative> like the dragon game.

43
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.480
<c. Head talkative> or the antelope dance.

44
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.880
More art above all, more play.

45
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.680
Common teaching is fatal.

46
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.200
People become idiots of being educated in the way we do now.

47
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.120
I loved the time I was selected for death antelope.

48
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.960
Summer closing performance.

49
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.800
The death house is coming!

50
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.320
The death house is coming!

51
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.080
The death house is coming!

52
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.160
"The death house is coming!"

53
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.720
Those who were selected for death antelop could move beautifully.

54
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.320
You had to have a silk shawl to dance with when you were killed by the arrow.

55
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.680
That was the lead role.
 High status.

56
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.800
<c. Head Tapers> I recognize <c. Head Tapers> That feeling of being selected.

57
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.720
<c. Head Tapers> My Class Teacher Merete <c. Head Tapers> Often selected Me -

58
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.440
<c. Head talkative> - to the lead role in our school pieces.

59
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.240
<c. Head Tapers> But many of my schoolmates <C. Head Tapers> had the feeling of -

60
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.520
<c. Head talkative> - that they were wrong in the teachers' eyes.

61
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.280
<c. Head Tapers> What was it that decided - -

62
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.520
<c. Head Tapers> - If you were seen <c.hhuvatare> as the right or wrong kind of child?

63
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.560
When I was little, Lavinia, I went to a school called Solvik School.

64
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.760
- I don't want you to talk about it.
 -Why?

65
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.560
- I want you to dough with me.
 - What should I dough for something?

66
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720
A cat?

67
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.160
Check out, here is the cat's head.

68
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.520
But at my school you could not do so that you made your head first.

69
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.800
It would be in one piece.
 Then you had to do this.

70
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.480
You had to model out ... so.

71
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.000
Now I could shape my ears.

72
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.000
The entire school was permeated by some anarchist attitude as well as -

73
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.280
- As the outside world.

74
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.720
While it was incredibly regulated within this system.

75
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.760
We had very determined opinions, after all freedom thinking and so -

76
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.160
- If what was good and not so good.

77
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.920
We painted a lot.
 You were not allowed to decide what to paint -

78
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.680
- The way you would paint layers in layers with different colors and shades.

79
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.960
One would start from within, spread out -

80
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.240
- And find where the edge went with the crayon.

81
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.440
If you painted a horse, you did not paint a horse and then filled in.

82
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.760
Without you started with a clue, and then "here the back should be".

83
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.360
It was: "How to do it, so it should be. This is a good person."

84
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.280
It could be things like "piano is bad".

85
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.880
It is a static instrument and you do not see what is happening.

86
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.280
You were not allowed to play football, but on the other hand, fireball went great.

87
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.960
<c. Head talkative> As a child, I did not think <c. Head talkative> so much on the rules.

88
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.560
<c. Head Tapers> But with what I know now -

89
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.240
<c. Head Tapers> - I can't help but wonders how they affected us.

90
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.440
There were a lot of rules, but they were not recorded, so finding them ...

91
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600
... it was impossible.

92
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.840
Either they had them in themselves, you were already according to the rules -

93
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.240
- Or so you were not, and then you couldn't ...

94
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.600
You couldn't ...

95
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.120
Or, there was no manual.

96
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.280
It was completely impossible to live up to that, because I didn't take ...

97
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.640
... how I could do it.

98
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.120
It happened that people came in from the outside in the class who got it damn tough.

99
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.920
Because they could not, the codes, the language could not, how to behave.

100
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.400
I was a little scared -

101
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.640
- And didn't really understand how things were connected and so on.

102
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.640
And so I noticed very quickly that I was not such a student -

103
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.120
- As you would be at Solvik.

104
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.840
Because my teacher said.
 "When you started in class, I thought,"

105
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.840
"Hope it's not a shy, scared girl, but a brave and tough girl."

106
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.520
Then she discovered pretty quickly that I was a shy and scared girl.

107
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.680
So I really felt I was wrong.

108
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.720
<c. Head Tapers> When I meet Linda I realize -

109
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.840
<c. Head talkative> - that it wasn't just about <c.hhuktaret> on rules for what we had to do.

110
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.040
<c. Head talkative> It went deeper than that.
 It was <c. Head talkative> like that we children in the eyes of the teachers -

111
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.240
<c. Head Tapers> - Kunde be wrong, without us <C. Head Tapers> could really do anything about it.

112
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.400
We all sat around the wood stove sometime ...

113
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.960
... and so just: "But you are reading."

114
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.240
Or like: "You can't talk."

115
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.760
And it was on that kind of as well ... downwear in some way.

116
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.560
I was incredibly popular with my friends, but she like ...

117
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.160
... tried to peel me out of that.

118
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.400
I wasn't good enough according to her ideal.

119
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.160
<c. Head Tapers> Where did this ideal come from?

120
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.200
<c. Head talkative> Why was it so important for the school <c. Head talkative> that we would live up to them?

121
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.000
Hello.

122
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.400
<c. Huvud Tapers> In the Facebook group there are several BC.
 <c. Head talkative> students who talk about the teacher Helena.

123
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.200
<c. Head talkative> How she used the ideals <c.hhuktaret> to lift or lower students.

124
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.760
When the Facebook group came -

125
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.960
- What was the pieces that took the hardest or that felt the most?

126
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.640
It's that I manipulate ...

127
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.360
... and have favorites.

128
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.680
That I favor and manipulate and that those who do not go out go out.

129
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.760
I may have done it, but completely unconscious.

130
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.920
I just joined something.

131
00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:00.760
My ignorance of how I was myself, it has hit them.

132
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.000
My uncertainty has affected other students.

133
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.280
I have apologized several of them.

134
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.520
I didn't know better, didn't know any better.

135
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.600
<c. Heat Tapers> Helena was only 25 years old when she <C. HOVE CHECKER> started as a teacher at the school.

136
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.920
<c. Head Tapers> Maybe what she says, <c. Head Treaty> is that she just went into something.

137
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.760
<c.huvudaret> that she simply unconsciously <c.huvudare> embraced these ideals.

138
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.760
As I look now with my adult eyes on it -

139
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.000
- Then it was very much that I would be able to join the gang.

140
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.080
That I was seen and would be able to help create this new school.

141
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.800
"What does Pär say? What does Merete says?"
 They were great authorities for me.

142
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.600
Jasper: that with the assessment, categorizing and ranking -

143
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.240
-What is that?

144
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.600
I got that ...

145
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.320
... really really smeared around the nose all the time.

146
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:29.600
I know it is true that students have felt sponsored or not.

147
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.480
That you should be like that, and you are judged very strongly.

148
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:40.400
I understand that at least many have felt that way.

149
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.760
- Where do you think it comes from?
 - I don't understand it completely.

150
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.000
I don't recognize it.

151
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.200
<c. Head Tapers> It is like <c. Head Treaty> that all roads lead to Pär.

152
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.520
<c. Head Tapers> But then it stops <C. Head Tapers> when I come here.

153
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.680
<c. Head talkative> I think about what Merete said.

154
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.880
The school has a very dark side -

155
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.400
- With ideal, how it should be and how to change people.

156
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.280
<c. Head Tapers> "How it should be, and how <C. Head Tapers> one would change people."

157
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.880
<c. Head Tapers> I think of all games <C. Head Tapers> and all the exercises we had at school.

158
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.680
The children sat around the walls.

159
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.200
One or two children were moving in the middle and the others watched.

160
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.480
<c. Head talkative> What was the idea with everything really?

161
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:58.400
You were not allowed to put in your heels, not weak or that the buttocks stuck out ...

162
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.400
You were not allowed to go too fast, not move as mechanically.

163
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.800
And then they could suddenly say:

164
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.200
"God, so ... what she goes! Look how she goes!"

165
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.200
And we just ...

166
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.800
<c. Head Tapers> It feels like a door has been opened <c. Head Treaty> on the open to my childhood.

167
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.120
<c. Head Tapers> Inexplicable Things <C. HOVE PREPERS> which has been going on at school -

168
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.480
<c. Head Tapers> - I now start to see <c. Head Precate> in a different light.

169
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.440
We had something called the "bench".

170
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.360
Mm.

171
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.720
It was always an invisible threat.

172
00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.760
You knew that "I do not take care of myself, then it will be the bench".

173
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.760
You sat on a bench in the middle and then everyone sat in a ring around.

174
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.280
First one would tell you something about yourself that was a secret -

175
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.480
- Or that was hard to tell.

176
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.920
Then you would go around and say to your classmates -

177
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.120
- How to experience your relationship.

178
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.600
When you were done, everyone would in turn tell you -

179
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.920
- What they liked about one.

180
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:40.400
And that was what became ... it could be very sensitive.

181
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.920
I was often in the middle of the ring.

182
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.800
And there was pretty much hot to try to dig and so ...

183
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.800
It was incredibly hard, I thought.

184
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.560
It felt like an experiment.
 I felt very experimented with.

185
00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.440
I don't know how long, but it felt like an eternity -

186
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:13.440
- Where all the girls sat and just explained everything that was wrong with me.

187
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.200
All students had to say something.

188
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:23.680
I talked to a friend who was then, and she broke.

189
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.280
She had nothing she wanted to say -

190
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.440
- But she was forced to say something by the teacher -

191
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.680
- Otherwise, there was a risk that she might be put there.

192
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.840
If you said something really sharp, you got a little ... Thumbs up from her.

193
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.360
<c. Head Tapers> It sounds almost like the teachers <c. Head Treaty> consciously trying to expose us -

194
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.680
<c. Head talkative> - for painful situations.

195
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.560
<c. Head Tapers> and that in some way <c. Head Treaty> would help us change.

196
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.480
Then we had Merete.
 When it was about the bench, it was mete.

197
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.720
<c.huvudaret> There were several teachers at the school that <c.hhukhurstare> had exposed their students to the bench.

198
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.960
<c. Head Tapers> But both Linda and Elsa had <C. Head Treaty> My teacher Merete in that exercise.

199
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.760
<c. Head talkative> It is difficult to take in.
 Why <c. Head talkative> did she expose the students to this?

200
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.040
<c. Head talkative> she as always <c.hhuvoretare> had my guarantor of security?

201
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.680
It was so much bullshit, so it was an attempt to ...

202
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.360
"Hello, let's calm us down a bit and say what it actually is."

203
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.240
–And clear the air in some way?
 - Review the air.

204
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.960
They probably thought it was a little scary.
 I do not know.

205
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:20.280
But was it like you tried "we see how this works"?

206
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.280
More ... don't see how it works, but ...

207
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:30.960
You hear, you see how it goes, and then you see what people ... what they ...

208
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.960
What comes out, and ... or ...

209
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.880
Many thought it was very nice too -

210
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.120
- To finally be able to say something you have not dared to say to anyone.

211
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.800
- But they haven't heard of them?
 - No, people are just angry.

212
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.960
- To feel compelled, right?
 - Exposed, I think.

213
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.760
To sit in the middle and that people said things that were nasty.

214
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.120
They felt hounded, I think.

215
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:10.040
You didn't have to say anything.
 You did not need to go if you did not want to.

216
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.800
<c. Head Tapers> Maybe the bench <c. Head talkator> was exactly what Merete says.

217
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.400
<c. Head talkative> an attempt to resolve conflicts <c.hhukhuktare> among the students.

218
00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.560
<c. Head talkative> But I get the feeling of <c.hhuktaret> that it is not the whole truth.

219
00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:00.600
As I remember it, so I and the teacher have conflicts.

220
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.560
One thing that started during the school days -

221
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.560
- It was that one of the other students had to beat and kick me -

222
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.560
- With his approval.

223
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:25.200
She was very aggressive.
 She chased me or was after me all the time -

224
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.600
- So I tried ... When I tried to get away from her, I know that ...

225
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.640
It was like hammocks in the ceiling.

226
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.960
I searched up to those hammocks quite actively -

227
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.440
- For that, it was easier to defend yourself.

228
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.920
- He allowed she to beat you?
 - mm.

229
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.960
Mom asked him the question sometime: "Why do you allow this?"

230
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.240
"She's a hard time at home, that girl" -

231
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.920
- "So she needs to get her aggressions out."

232
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.200
The counter -question from Mom was: "But Maya, then?"

233
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.560
"No, but she needs to learn to say."

234
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.840
So it was like some kind of win-win situation ...

235
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.680
... in this responsible adult version of it all.

236
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.880
Eh, yes ... strange.

237
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.080
<c. Head Tapers> Maya's teacher <C. HOVE CHECKER> Don't want to be interviewed.

238
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.240
<c. Head talkative> He claims not to have used <c.hhuktaret> such methods in the teaching -

239
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.560
<c. Head talkative> - and he does not remember the conversation <c.hhuktaret> with Maya's mother.

240
00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.560
It became so incredibly strong when you created this Facebook group -

241
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.800
- And other students started writing and telling and testifying.

242
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.680
I understand when I read the stories -

243
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.720
- I am not alone in having trauma from there.

244
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.320
And it was an incredible relief!

245
00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:31.320
We were so taken, so obviously taken, of what was talked about.

246
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:36.880
This was something we almost all thought we were carrying for ourselves.

247
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.240
That it was our image of something -

248
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:46.000
- Fast it was a whole system that was like harmful.

249
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.440
<c. Head Tapers> Almost everyone I talk to, <c. Head Tapers> thinks Pär had the last word -

250
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.400
<c. Head Tapers> - In which teachers got to work <c.hhuvatare> at the school - also Maya's teacher.

251
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:12.160
He was a terribly bad teacher, put it with students a lot.

252
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.320
He had been sustained for himself.

253
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.760
What to call it?

254
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.920
To be honest, a psychotic dictator, as surely ...

255
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.000
He was very gymnastic.
 Did things with trees, and climbed and adventure.

256
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.200
It was really fun, really good.

257
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.600
But then there were back sides where he ...

258
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.160
... drove hard with the kids.
 It was not good.

259
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.280
These are dangerous things, when it is not really right.

260
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.280
Skilled and talented people with severe errors ...

261
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.640
... are dangerous.

262
00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.720
But interesting.
 Great.

263
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.640
This fantastic teacher who had walked through the desert.

264
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:13.000
Survived one with the other.
 Great at telling stories.

265
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:19.120
A very charismatic person.
 No one was interested in hearing -

266
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.280
- "That there are things going on there that are not good".

267
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.760
- Why did he have to stay?
 - I've always liked him.

268
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.960
I like him, although at the same time I was not so impressed with -

269
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.160
- His spiritual career, but it is interesting.

270
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.280
<c. Head talkative> Maya's teacher thus had to be left -

271
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.920
<c. Head Tapers> - To "His spiritual career <C. Head Tapers> was interesting".

272
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.040
<c. Head Tapers> What am I missing here?

273
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.560
I'm still thoughtful how they could carry on like that.

274
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.560
Were the students so important?
 Was it more important?

275
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.000
There was...

276
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.680
There was something behind it.

277
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.880
I don't know what the school was for.

278
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.560
And you felt that "here at school something other than what we see" - is that how you mean?

279
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.560
Mm.

280
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.240
After all, they had the Waldorf pedagogy, which Rudolf Steiner had written.

281
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.720
And I wonder about ... it was ...

282
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.920
You can interpret it in many different ways.

283
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.360
<c. Head Treaty> Rudolf Steiner.

284
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.560
<c. Head Tapers> This face has been there <c. Head Treaty> present throughout my upbringing.

285
00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:14.640
<c. Head Tapers> I think almost everyone I knew <c. Head Treaty> had his portrait at home on the wall.

286
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.600
<c. Head Tapers> Yet I have never really known <C. Head Tapers> Who he was.

287
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.880
<c. Head Tapers> More than it was he <c. Head Treaty> who had created anthroposophy.

288
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.040
I got to know anthroposophy without knowing what it was.

289
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.360
I found in my mailbox ...

290
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.560
It was a book in it - no address, nothing.

291
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.840
The book was of Steiner.
 I had no idea ... I didn't know who he was.

292
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.400
But I started reading the book and it was damn good, I thought.

293
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.120
It was called in German Geheimwissenschaft Im Umriss.

294
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:11.320
In Swedish it is usually called the knowledge of the hidden.

295
00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:17.880
I liked it sharply.
 I thought there was ... "So there it should sound."

296
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.280
We will look at something called anthroposophy.

297
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.120
To come to Järna is to get other perspectives on man and the world -

298
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.360
- I what we are used to.

299
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.400
<c. Head Tapers> As a child I only knew <c. Head Tapers> that we were anthroposophizes -

300
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.120
<c. Head Tapers> - Or "AntiSar" as we were called.

301
00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.960
<c.huvudaret> But never ever had I explained <c. Head Precate> to me what anthroposophy was for something.

302
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.360
They have started schools, so -called
 Waldorf schools.

303
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.000
They invest in herbal remedies.
 On several small farms around Järna -

304
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.000
- Investing enthusiastic youth in biodynamic agriculture.

305
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.200
<c. Head talkative> For us, anthroposophy was primarily something -

306
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:19.320
<c. Head Tapers> - Which made us very different <c. Head Tapers> from the other children in Järna.

307
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:26.200
<c. Head Tapers> We ate strange food, we had strange <c. Head talkators> clothes and we were not allowed to watch TV.

308
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:32.280
<c. Head Tapers> that it was linked <c. Head Tapers> To Anthroposophy I thought enough -

309
00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.080
<c. Head talkative> - But how, I never understood that.

310
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.400
<c. Head Tapers> I realize that if I understand Pär <C. Head Treaty> and the vision behind Solvik -

311
00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.560
<C. Head talkative> - so I have to understand Rudolf Steiner.

312
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.440
<c. Head Treaty> In the early 1900s <C. Head Tapers>, Steiner created the life view-

313
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.880
<c. Head Tapers> - He called anthroposophy.
 He postponed to a comprehensive material:

314
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:15.680
<c. Head Treaty> Books, Lectures and Drawings <c. Head Treaty> which describes his thoughts and ideas.

315
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.280
<c. Head Tapers> A central part of anthroposophy is <c. Head talkative> that there is a spiritual world -

316
00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.760
<c. Head Tapers> - which should be just as real <c. Head talkative> as the physical one.

317
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.520
When you meet a child and know, "You're not just what you look like."

318
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:39.280
You are not just the one standing and talking.
 We are much, much more.

319
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:48.360
<c. Head Tapers> Rudolf Steiner wanted <C. Head Treaty> Children's Spirituality to be upheld.

320
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.720
<c.huvudaret> It was one of the reasons for <c. Head Treaty> that he created Waldorf pedagogy.

321
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.960
Spiritual life was taken seriously as a reality.

322
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.640
Angels are not a small kids talk about, but it is ours ...

323
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.800
... friends that we can have contact with.

324
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.960
<c. Head Tapers> For Steiner, <c. Head Treaty> The spiritual world was not religious.

325
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.920
<c. Head talkative> He meant that it could be proved.

326
00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:21.240
<c.huvudtaret> In his books and lectures <c.hhuvoretare> he spread his so -called.
 spirit science.

327
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.680
<c. Head Tapers> But none of this <c. Head Treaty> We got to learn at Solvik School.

328
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.560
Pär: You do not teach it in a Waldorf school, it is not a subject.

329
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:44.520
Anthroposophy is not taught, but anthroposophy is practiced every day.

330
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.360
<c. Head Tapers> This is Dorothea, <C. Head Treaty> EN F.D.
 Pupil at Solvik School.

331
00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.640
<c. Head Tapers> Also she has had difficulty understanding -

332
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.920
<c. Head Tapers> - why we did <C. HOVAPERTARE> as we did at school.

333
00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.120
For 26 years I have not been given an explanation for anything.

334
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:09.840
Why do you make the Christmas game?
 Why do you do the antelope dance or the dragon game?

335
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.680
Why is it better to have some colors on clothes?
 Some materials?

336
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:21.360
It is only now that I have started to find out things - read and ask.

337
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.520
Which is provocative for many.

338
00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.880
But I feel that I have to know the truth about why ...

339
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.560
... Everything has happened that has happened.

340
00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.320
<c. Head Tapers> Much of what happened during <c. Head Tapers> Our School Time was natural for us -

341
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:47.120
<c. Head talkative> - We had nothing to compare with.
 <c. Head Tapers> But when I look back today -

342
00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.320
<c. Head Tapers> - On some things we did, <c. Head Tapers> it sounds almost absurd.

343
00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.680
<c. Head talkative> as the different temperaments.

344
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:03.560
Do you remember the way to divide children into different temperaments?

345
00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.880
Yes...

346
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.560
Yes, I do very much.

347
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.680
Oh ... yes, the personality types.

348
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.480
What was that?
 Phlegmatic...

349
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:26.760
Do you remember this?
 Flegmatic, sang -wine, choleric and ... ah ...

350
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.240
-Melancholy?
 - Yes, melancholy.

351
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:34.520
<c. Head Tapers> According to anthroposophy <c. Heat talkers> there are four different temperaments.

352
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:42.040
In the 6th or 7th, Pär came to our class and showed us the temperament.

353
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.720
"What the flower is nice! It's yellow! Look!"

354
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.880
"I know you should not talk loudly."

355
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.040
The sang winery, the child's temperament, is the one that is a bit volatile -

356
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.360
- As sparkles and is usually happy.

357
00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.880
"Wait, I'll ... Oh, it's itching!"

358
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.160
They don't want to sit still as well.

359
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.400
And then there is the cholerician.
 Very determined, often small people.

360
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.160
They usually walk with the heel before.

361
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.600
They think they themselves know a little best.

362
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.280
Napoleon was a cholerar.
 Hitler may have been cholerics.

363
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.520
The melancholy, it is a bit difficult.
 It feels a little sorry for itself.

364
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.080
They don't know that ...

365
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.800
... I am the guilt to everything.

366
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.040
Everything.
 World War.

367
00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.440
Never forget injustices.

368
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.040
- Was it almost like a rating scale?
 -Yes you could say that.

369
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:59.120
Flegenmatics are those who enjoy taking it easy and working with something for a long time.

370
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.880
A little comfortable as well.

371
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.440
Ha-Han ... he sits ...

372
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.880
He may not say right that one was finer than the other.

373
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.520
But his way of telling the elements -

374
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.200
- I made it understood that one was better.

375
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.280
Hay-hay ...

376
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.600
It is a one -sided phlegmatic.

377
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.600
How good did you quickly read?

378
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.280
Very capable.
 I got really good at it actually.

379
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:44.560
Steiner went pretty far.
 He said that phlegmatists often have a big head.

380
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.760
Yes, but that is often the case when Flegman considers.

381
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.240
It may happen that the head is bigger.
 It feels bigger anyway.

382
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:01.760
<c. Head Tapers> Steiner said that one often <c. Head Tapers> can look at a child's appearance -

383
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.920
<c. Head talkative> - which temperament they belong to.

384
00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.120
<c. Heat talker> that the melancholy <c.hhukhuktare> is narrow and spvenish.

385
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.800
<c. Head Tapers> that the Sangviniker <c. Heat Tapers> is the most normal.

386
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.360
<c. Head Tapers> and the cholericians <c. Head Tapers> are short and powerful.

387
00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:22.400
There is an educational idea in Waldorf that the temperament takes each other out.

388
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:28.360
Put together two choleric violent types, so they will not be able to end up.

389
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.680
Then they can calm down.

390
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.880
Do you know it and can work a little, turn to the temperament properly -

391
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:41.200
- And take it into account, so it's a very good tool.

392
00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:49.960
<c. Head Tapers> Steiner said that the teacher would respond to <c. Head talkative> students based on their temperament.

393
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:54.360
<c. Head talkative> against a phlegmatist <c.hhukhuktare>, the teacher should be unengaged.

394
00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.880
<c. Head Tapers> and the cholericians need to fight.
 <c. Head Tapers> They feel good about getting bruises.

395
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.360
- But you are convinced that they exist?
 - Yes, what the hell ...

396
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.120
It is no conviction, it is pure knowledge.

397
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:25.040
What I think is problematic with temperament ...

398
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.600
It becomes very easy categorization.

399
00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.000
We all knew what temperaments we were.

400
00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:40.040
I was choleric because I was pretty ... I got pretty easily angry.

401
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:45.440
I was kind of the one who is a little leal and a little dreamy, I think.

402
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.320
- Flelegatics?
 -Yes maybe.

403
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.120
- What were you?
 - It was probably some form of sang wine.

404
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.640
The best.

405
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.480
- Was it?
 -Yes.

406
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.720
We had lessons with Pär where we would paint colors.

407
00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.960
He would check out the picture and say:

408
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.520
"You are most sang -wine" or "you are most choleric".

409
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.520
I struggled to take the right color, it should be yellow for being sanginical.

410
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.440
Nevertheless, it always became that I was choleric-melancholy.

411
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:28.560
And the melancholy ... I had such anxiety because I was a melancholy.

412
00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.400
This student is ...

413
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.560
... Probably Sanginical.

414
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.880
The one that is most implemented is the yellow one.

415
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:50.040
It was more than me who fought.
 God, what I struggled with the drawings!

416
00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.760
I never managed to become sang -wine.

417
00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.720
Flegmatic, it was ... It was nothing good.

418
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:06.240
I remember this how I had got the label from being a phlegmate.

419
00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.240
It was something we talked about outside the school.

420
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:17.000
I remember how hard it was when someone pointed out or could say like PIK -

421
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.640
- I was a phlegmate.

422
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.880
You can have temperaments.

423
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.320
It is no shame to be a choleric or melancholy.

424
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.080
Flegmatic is one of my ideal temperaments.

425
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.400
The occult temperament.

426
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:42.280
You were stuffed into a compartment: "You are this one, so you need this."

427
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.480
I felt that I had no chance to change.

428
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.040
You were sentenced ...

429
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.640
...I feel.
 You are sentenced, and then you remain in that union.

430
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.680
<c. Head Tapers> If I say ball-Ove, <c. Head Treaty> What are you thinking about then?

431
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:15.200
Yes ... it's just a desert name I've heard now.

432
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.560
The desert name I remember was thick Daniel.

433
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.040
Yes, that's a reason to -

434
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.840
- I thought I wanted to be interviewed.

435
00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.200
<c. Head Tapers> Daniel went <c. Head Tapers> a couple of classes under me.

436
00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:44.600
<c. Head Tapers> In our class he was called <c. Head Treaty> Boll-Ove, others said thick Daniel.

437
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.120
<c. Head Tapers> I remember that as a child I thought of <c. Head Treaty> him as the archetype of phlegmatics.

438
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.680
<c. Head talkative> The worst thing you could be.

439
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:57.520
<c. Head talkative> and I have vague memories of <c.hhuktaret> that we were awkward to him.

440
00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.840
<c. Head talkative> But strangely I can't remember <c. Head talkative> that I felt any guilt for it.

441
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.440
<c. Head Treaty> Everyone was, including teachers.

442
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:19.120
I felt that thick Daniel was an expression supported by my teacher.

443
00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.360
And when we were really small -

444
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:28.080
- Then she used to pick us up at the school bus and go with us.

445
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.320
Since we were so small then, she went with us on the way to school.

446
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.480
We walked a small cluster with classmates.

447
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:45.000
Behind us suddenly two older guys came and then they grabbed Daniel -

448
00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:50.360
- On each side, in each arm, and then they shouted like that ...

449
00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:56.080
"Now thick Daniel will be allowed to run. He needs exercise."

450
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.440
And then they started to drag him between them.

451
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.920
My teacher shouted and laughed.
 Our little cluster also shouted:

452
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.320
"Now thick Daniel will have to run."

453
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:14.200
"That's good. Run with him, so he gets exercise."

454
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.480
Yes, but it was mental abuse.

455
00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.160
Clearly.

456
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:30.920
I think it was - as I remember it - everyday.

457
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.320
A freezing and a peak.

458
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.640
We were in the classroom, and suddenly she rushes up to Daniel ...

459
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:48.200
... and then she hits his head between her hands.

460
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.680
Like this.
 And at the same time, she says:

461
00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.800
"Are you totally fucking stupid in your head?"

462
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:03.080
<c. Head Tapers> I think we thought that <c. Head talkative> that happened to Daniel was self -inflicted -

463
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.640
<c. Head talkative> - because he was who he was.

464
00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.360
He was very busy with his ... he had video games, TV and all that-

465
00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.840
- As we did not have then, because it was forbidden.

466
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.520
<c. Head Tapers> He represented everything we thought <c. Head Treaty> was wrong with the ordinary world.

467
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:28.280
He had not gone there from the beginning, but he was a bulge.

468
00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.000
And so he did ... You can't report to the police for violence.

469
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.040
You do not go against.

470
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:48.320
He reported his teacher for the teacher to beat him.

471
00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:55.560
I do not know.
 Gave him an ear file or something - at least used violence.

472
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.760
I remember she told us -

473
00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.920
- That she had been reported for child abuse.

474
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:10.560
We students thought it was very horrible by Daniel's parents then.

475
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:18.120
<c. Head Tapers> It became a trial, and I remember <c. Head Tapers> that many from the school joined.

476
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.400
<c. Head Treaty> How the Busy Pupils <c. Head Tapers> To the District Court -

477
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.640
<c. Head Tapers> - To show solidarity <c.hhuktaret> with the teacher.

478
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:33.520
We went in, including teachers, to sit on this trial -

479
00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.760
–And more or less make fun of the ball-Ove.

480
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.520
We were on the teacher's side all

481
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:47.720
- The person to have someone at all about the situation at all.

482
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:53.040
Terrible!
 And this was not something that came from us students, but ...

483
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.920
That's how it was said that "So it is-Boll-Ove is lying".

484
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.800
<c. Head Tapers> The School thus chose <c. Head Treaty> to stand on a teacher's side -

485
00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.560
<c. Head Tapers>-In an abuse case <c.hhukhuktare> with a 10-year-old child.

486
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.560
<c. Head talkative> Why do you do so?

487
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.160
After all, there was a picture of Solvik ... it was against them ...

488
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:25.400
... there "we who were Solvik", we did right.

489
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:31.360
Everyone else was wrong and everything else was reprehensible.
 It was therefore -

490
00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:36.640
- You would not read comic books, have pressure on the sweaters and watch TV -

491
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.200
- For it was those who did not understand, who did it.

492
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:48.800
Those who did not know what was right.
 And they were worthy of mockery.

493
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.520
<c. Head talkative> The question is whether the violations were <c. Head talkative> an expression of the teacher's shortcomings -

494
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.840
<c. Head talkative> - or if there were <c.hhuktaret> a conscious thought in what she did.

495
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.280
She might think she would make him stop enjoying video games.

496
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.120
There was that way of salvation in it.

497
00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.360
And it was a prestige in that there -

498
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.640
- What to transform these people into.

499
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.960
<c. Head Tapers> There is something about what Robin says that <c. Head Tapers> You would convert us into something.

500
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.560
<c. Head talkative> like this with video games.

501
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.960
<c. Head Tapers> As a child, I only remember <c. Head Treaty> that it was forbidden.

502
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:54.560
<c. Head Tapers> But maybe it had to do with anthroposophy?

503
00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.040
<c. Head Tapers> It's like Small, <c. Head Tapers> Seems Insignant Details -

504
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.520
<c. Head talkative> - starts to get new meanings.

505
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.000
At my school you were not allowed to make cats so -

506
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.200
- That you made your head first.

507
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.000
It would be in one piece.

508
00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.240
It could be such things like piano being bad.

509
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:23.080
When I designed people, I drew with a line around.

510
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.320
Head and so on ...

511
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.680
... and it was very wrong.

512
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.320
In our class you were a hundred times better -

513
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.520
-If one dared to jump between trees or do dangerous things -

514
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.520
- It if you were good at reading and writing.

515
00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:48.760
<c. Head Tapers> Everywhere in Steiner's books I see <C. Head Tapers> connections to our time at Solvik.

516
00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.720
<c. Head Tapers> But when I talk to Pär, I understand <c. Head talkative> I that Solvik's interpretation of Steiner -

517
00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.200
<c. Head Tapers> - separated himself from how <C. Head Tapers> Other Waldorf Schools interpreted him.

518
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.880
We plugged Steiner.
 We did not plug what the Waldor Movement Ville -

519
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:11.280
- Out what Steiner said and how he worked.

520
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.880
We tried to understand what it was.

521
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.600
And we probably understood a lot.

522
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.240
And it became a conflict.

523
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.880
After all, we were removed from the list, from the Waldorflist.

524
00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.040
<c. Head Tapers> Solvik was excluded from <C. Head Treaty> The Swedish Waldorf community -

525
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.800
<c. Head Treaty> –And went his own way.

526
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.840
After all, there was also a pride that not being counted as Waldorf school.

527
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.920
That you were not part of it, but something much better -

528
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.200
- And something much higher.

529
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:52.000
<c. Head Treaty> In Sweden <C. Head Treaty> Solvik ended up in the cold.

530
00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:56.200
There were plans to try to get rid of us.

531
00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:01.680
Although it was not possible, because there were lots of protests -

532
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.000
- Out of all the world almost.

533
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:09.440
"Should that school be away, then Waldorf is gone."

534
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:16.000
<c. Head talkative> The school in the forest went <c.hhuktaret> from the black sheep of the Waldor Movement -

535
00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:22.560
<c. Head Tapers>-To a pioneer example on the <c. Head Treaty> International Anthroposof stage.

536
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.840
<c. Head Tapers> Pär is still touring in the world <c. Head Tapers> with workshops on the school's pedagogy.

537
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:40.360
<c. Head Tapers> We Children who went to Solvik were sold in <c. Head Treaty> as the proof of the school's success.

538
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:50.760
One has such high thoughts about yourself and indoctrinating everyone to believe -

539
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:56.320
- That "this is fantastic", that we are involved in something outstanding.

540
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:05.360
That it like: "Wow, here's something!"
 "Something is going on," as you often said.

541
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.440
The term "something is going on here".

542
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:18.800
It's like you puncture something when you say this.
 Do you notice it?

543
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.160
-Yes.
 I almost want it.
 - As a balloon like man: "Pfju!"

544
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:34.440
Some of these people write -

545
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.640
- The school time has had a harsh consequences for those in life.

546
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.040
Yes, it is popular.

547
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.600
It is simply in that childhood means a lot.

548
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:55.280
I can only say, "Oh, then. So pity you were injured in the soul."

549
00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:00.240
"I've been lucky to never be injured in" ... do you believe it?!

550
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:05.880
That I have never been injured in the soul?
 What is it?

551
00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.080
We are so damn injured in the soul!

552
00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:14.440
Otherwise, we would not sit here now and try this project.

553
00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:19.440
What would you say that the school is responsible for those stories?

554
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.800
Nothing.

555
00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:31.400
<c. Head Tapers> Pär does not think the school has <c. Head talkative> any responsibility in what happened to the students.

556
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:35.360
<c. Head talkative> but the fact remains <c.hhuktaret> that students suffered badly.

557
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.480
<c. Head Treaty> Like Daniel.

558
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:49.320
What has been so strange is how the school reacted.

559
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.400
- There is a ... - yes, exactly.

560
00:51:53.560 --> 00:52:00.040
... a ten-eleven-year-old boy with a whole school against him in a situation like ...

561
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.120
... which must have been tough anyway.

562
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:10.360
Yes, what a thing to sit there and try to defend yourself before something.

563
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:17.160
<c. Head Tapers> Daniel had accused his teacher <C. Head Treaty> of abuse.

564
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.680
<c. Head talkative> she admitted <c.hhuhuktaret> that she darkened to him on the cheek -

565
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:27.920
<c. Head Tapers> –And drummed with his fingers on his <c. Head Pers> Head to get his attention.

566
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.720
<c. Head Tapers> But the District Court acquitted her anyway.

567
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.440
<c. Head talkative> We had won.

568
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.840
<c. Head Treaty> Daniel had lost.

569
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.480
I don't remember that anything further.

570
00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.760
I know about it, but I have no personal memory.

571
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.080
I wasn't involved so much, I think.

572
00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.320
I was never present, for example.

573
00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:05.040
- You were not in the trial?
 -No no.

574
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.520
So I can't say that much about that.

575
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:18.760
I would like to know that more about that.
 What it was that happened, and ...

576
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:24.200
What happened to Daniel.
 Where he is today.

577
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.080
- He is dead.
 -Okay.
 Uuh ...

578
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.400
<c. Head Treaty> Daniel ended at Solvik.

579
00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:42.920
<c. Head talkative> He died in 2006, as a 25-year-old.

580
00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:53.680
<c. Head Tapers> He never got any rectification for <c. Head Treaty> How the school had treated him.

581
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.480
<c. Head Tapers> His teacher <c. Huvudpratare> has chosen not to comment.

582
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.680
Now I was a little badly affected, but ...

583
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.320
Yes...

584
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.280
And you want more ...

585
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.520
... had made police reports.
 There was a lot to take off.

586
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.920
There was a lot of violence on the part of the teachers.
 Suddenly some teacher-

587
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.360
--Able throw something against one so that you had to duck, or so there.

588
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.320
Has there been a physical discipline ...

589
00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:47.040
...in school?
 The answer is yes.

590
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:58.680
<c. Head Tapers> Many students are today critical of <c. Head Treaty> How they were treated by the teachers.

591
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:03.360
<c. Head Treaty> One of them is Gudmund, <C. Head Treaty> Pär Ahlbom's own son.

592
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:07.840
Some who were adults then-

593
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.880
- They knew it was something that was going on.

594
00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:17.080
Then I will be, "Where the hell were you? What kind of person are you just looking at?"

595
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.240
If you have now known that these skewed stuff has happened -

596
00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:26.720
-And all the children who have broken lives because of this fucking school ...

597
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:32.960
This violence that many have described from teacher to student ...

598
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:39.160
- You know that it has been going on, huh?
 - I have not experienced that much.

599
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.720
I think it's exaggerated.

600
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:49.320
But didn't you know when it was going on?

601
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.920
Yes...

602
00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:03.920
I did.
 But I knew more afterwards when I got it confirmed.

603
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:09.640
I don't understand why we didn't do anything as parents.

604
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.800
I really don't understand it.

605
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.000
What kind of person are you?

606
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:19.640
After all, it is such a person who is filming while someone is raped.

607
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:25.240
Everyone was so damn addicted that no one made any notification ever.

608
00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:35.120
So your material could make me make me ... to a damn pig.

609
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.440
-Yes.
 - It's no art.

610
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:42.960
There is proof of that.
 It's just watching.

611
00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:51.000
Everything was sanctioned, and then it becomes a tremendously strong culture of silence.

612
00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.280
Did you report him?

613
00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.880
No, then it would not have been possible for my siblings to stay.

614
00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.760
It is far too great consequences to do such a thing.

615
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.360
It probably could have been dangerous.

616
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.720
It is very strong loyalty.

617
00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:21.320
"What a fucking man! What he says. Hear. Hear himself."

618
00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.880
You understand!
 Or vice versa.

619
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:30.120
"What a wonderful person! Think, what the open and open."
 You know...

620
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.760
It's just to take care of it.

621
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.960
I think so ... you should know that.

622
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:43.120
- Yes, that's it.
 - All is always right and completely wrong.

623
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.000
It does not matter.
 I don't touch it in the ass.

624
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.920
Here, anything can happen and no one knows.

625
00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:58.360
It was any situation when you hid?

626
00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:07.000
The pain and horror would be so strong that the child woke up.

627
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.880
Children could have died!
 Why isn't it important?!

628
00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.640
You have not arrived for the first time on earth.

629
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.160
