1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,360
-Cok, Edwin, I got him out! -Yes...

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,080
Edwin, how is it? You look so depressed.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,120
It turned out that lots of my followers, my safaris, were fake.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,880
I talked to my agency and they would check what had happened.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,480
It may be fake followers. Purchased, scam, fake, like.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,720
-When they bought. -Now I look at one of my followers.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,200
-Yeah. -I am completely uncertain.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,240
-On what? -If she even exists!

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,560
Is she a female? Imagine if it's a computer program that locks my stuff-

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,720
-or a hacker on any 'click farm' in some land-

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,520
-or a troll that sits and laughs at my amazing videos.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,760
It is difficult to know who is hiding behind fake accounts.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,400
Now this week, at SVT News, they had a company in Skåne-

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,560
-Which was revealed in a corruption.

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,320
It turned out that press officer at the company was an invented person.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,120
Huh? So she wasn't at all?

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,640
No, they had used a page on the net where one can randomize faces-

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,360
-And it is generated a face that doesn't really exist.

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,840
You must probably accept the uncertainty that is on social media.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,120
You do not know if the person you are talking to is there.

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,000
Many sites allow one to name themselves what you want.

22
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,960
On Facebook you should have your real name-

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,080
-But even there it is easy to create new accounts and hot something else.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,240
On other social media or forums you can name yourself what you want.

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,680
"Leather62" or "lars the fat" or whatever seven.

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,640
That anonymity is there so we can use it.

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,400
-It's so on the internet. -You might not want to be himself.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,600
No, and you shouldn't have to be. Anonymity is also good.

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,920
With it we can become whistleblower or alert about misconduct-

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,280
-And say when something is not right.

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,920
It gets lousy when many get afraid of not being able to tell things-

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
-When they experience. So anonymity is needed.

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,640
But remember that everything is not black and white.

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,640
Anonymity can lead to problems.

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,840
One who is hiding behind the anonym may breed, mock, hate or threaten.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,920
-So there are problems with anonymity. -Oh...

37
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,960
All life is a lie. What else is not for real?

38
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,200
Right now you have a "pull away the carpet under your feet" -The moment-

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,640
-And it's hard, but this is what we do the "Källkoll" programs about.

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
What is fake online and what will be the consequences of it?

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,840
Now it's time for three important things:

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,680
Fresh air, coffee and some brainstorm.

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,400
Would you say you are good at discovering fake news?

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,040
No not really. I am not very pleased with fact -checking.

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,120
Yes, I would say.

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,640
-Oh yes. -Yes.

47
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,840
But some things are very difficult to say.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,640
One should not be too confident.

49
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,280
No.

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,920
It depends well on what it comes to subject and how familiar you are in it.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,920
I want to say yes, but you are often bad.

52
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,040
Yes, I'm pretty trained in it throughout the years.

53
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
No.

54
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,680
People do everything possible stupid when they are anonymous.

55
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,040
During the Melodifestivalen that Tusse won ...

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,200
96 points, which means Tusse has won the Melodifestivalen 2021!

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,080
Someone changed Tusses Wikipedia article so that it said he was cheating.

58
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,920
It wasn't out for so long and the one who did it was blocked.

59
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,320
Okay, but that doesn't sound very dangerous.

60
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,480
-No they wrote that he was dead. -Oh, it was pretty onejs.

61
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,240
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia everyone can edit.

62
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,920
That everyone can edit means that some can destroy-

63
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,680
-But at Wikipedia there is a strong community with serious editors-

64
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,840
-O which usually turns down hard on that type of scribble.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So you can trust them, then?

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,640
Actually, you should probably assume that you should check everything you see ...

67
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,960
-. in forums and comment fields. -Everything is always worth double checking.

68
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Especially when it comes to unverified accounts.

69
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,840
Believing in what they say straight away is like believing in rumors.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,400
We have said that we should talk about journalists-

71
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,160
-And how they work to confirm information.

72
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,240
Then when you see something, it's just as good to go out and check out news media-

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,240
-and see what is written.

74
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,440
If they talk about unconfirmed information then one should know-

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,000
— that an unconfirmed task must not be false-

76
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,360
-But you should wait and see how it develops.

77
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,880
These are the fake stuff with real consequences that we talk about here.

78
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,640
That someone sits behind an anonymous account-

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,320
-And writes a lot of stuff. It can grow and get out of control?

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,840
Yes, already in the Middle Ages ...

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,560
Not your ancient examples! Do we have anything a little more fresh?

82
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,040
The Instagram race in Gothenburg is a good example.

83
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,360
The brawl, which developed into something that can be likened to a riot-

84
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,720
-Have its origin in a large number of pictures published on Instagram.

85
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,040
It is a good example of something small that then becomes like a monster-

86
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,200
-What cannot be checked. It's a good example.

87
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,760
After all, this was some girls who started an Instagram account

88
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,080
-And then they started putting out gossip and rumors about other girls' sex life.

89
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,920
Oh my God! I remember that! I lived there then. But it was 2012.

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Yes, but it's not like people don't hang each other online now.

91
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,040
The principles are the same. There is something small-

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,600
-Ny in a comment field or in some forum-

93
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,360
-And then people start to care in a wider circle and then it rolls on.

94
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,080
In this case it became calabal-

95
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
-When people would look for those who made the account.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
Innocent were hung out.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
Not to mention how it felt to the girls who were hanged.

98
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,480
Okay, but we jump to modern times. You are factorying things online.

99
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,800
Last year, fake stuff has had real consequences.

100
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,320
God, yes. It is enough to watch the Covid tests-

101
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,280
-When people realized that they do not work, are false.

102
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,440
We looked at the conspiracy theory-

103
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,800
-and it was based on the fact that people who did not have the right knowledge of the question-

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,000
-Hade found details in various scientific study-

105
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,200
-And then spun about it in, for example, Facebook groups.

106
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,120
Yes. The consequence of this was that doctors at Sahlgrenska Hospital Sa-

107
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,880
-people who were in for other refused to take covid-test-

108
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,239
-trot that it is good for them to know if they have it.

109
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,080
Then it was a cavalcade of completely wrong statements during the year.

110
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,360
Then I see the disinfection agent. It knocks it out in a minute.

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,280
One minute. And can we do something similar, by injection-

112
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,200
-or almost like cleaning.

113
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,640
That the vaccine changes your DNA.

114
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,360
Neither the MRNA vaccine nor the others that develop-

115
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,720
-Have the potential to change our DNA.

116
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,440
That you get oxygen deficiency from having masks.

117
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,120
Prolonged use of masks can be uncomfortable.

118
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,720
But it does not lead to carbon dioxide poisoning or oxygen deficiency.

119
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,960
That the vaccines are untested and dangerous.

120
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,600
More and more people are not going to take vaccines.

121
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,400
I don't want to inject anything like that.

122
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,760
That there is microchip in the vaccine.

123
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,320
Dr. Rose, first question: Is there microchip in the Covid vaccine?

124
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,640
No. There are no microchip in the vaccine.

125
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,920
Only vaccine and a bit of a chemical-

126
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,960
-As you react correctly to the vaccine.

127
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,240
That the 5G network, this one with mobile telephony

128
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,520
-Have something to do with Coronavirus, which it doesn't have.

129
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,400
I recognize this from the demonstration poster I have seen.

130
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,080
It was planned to hold a demonstration at Medborgarplatsen.

131
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
-It didn't have the police condition. -... against the order of order ...

132
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,200
It has created effects in reality.

133
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,640
The conspiracy theories around the vaccine and virus-

134
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,720
-Have created a smaller, but loud, group ...

135
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,720
-. who doesn't believe in Covid-19. -That it doesn't exist at all?

136
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,520
Some believe so, others maybe more that the vaccine and virus-

137
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
-Is part of some kind of diabolical plan-

138
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,200
-No an elite that they think controls in the shadows.

139
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,560
And that the world's rulers either dance to their pipe-

140
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,080
-or is included in the conspiracy.

141
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,400
Okay, but then it's a good example?

142
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,840
It is a colorful example, spectacular and maximum-

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,280
-But do you really want to shed light on that group of ideas?

144
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,400
How big is it really? How many people believe in it?

145
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,360
Isn't the risk that you just showcase the idea for new ones?

146
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,640
The question is how representative they are.

147
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,080
We will see that now when it is to be vaccinated on a large scale.

148
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,280
Several times, even healthcare professionals have refused to vaccinate.

149
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,280
-Yes. -Th the other side, you have to leave.

150
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
-It's totally okay. -Yes.

151
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,160
And you have to be critical of the restrictions and laws.

152
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
-This are opinions. -Time "on the one hand, on the other".

153
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,200
-It's getting bad TV. -It's so to be factor.

154
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,440
It is difficult to determine what to raise to give attention.

155
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,720
Do you risk spreading something, or is it good to disprove it?

156
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,680
-Sån we wrestle with every day. -Yes, and conspiracy theorists ...

157
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,960
-Folia hats. -To call them so ...

158
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,080
... just make you widen a gorge here.

159
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,640
It is difficult to approach each other when you call someone stupid in the head.

160
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
Yes, this has split more than one family.

161
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,040
Some have lost friends because of things like this.

162
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,360
It is a problematic consequence in real life-

163
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,000
-That it affects how we are against each other-

164
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,920
-And how we trust each other and community institutions.

165
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,520
-It's a consequence. -What is the worst ...

166
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,840
-.. with fake stuff online? -Where should you start?

167
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,200
Yes, it is a big area. We make it easier.

168
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,840
Which is the worst example you think-

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,520
-If something that has been false and had a real consequence?

170
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,840
It is, for example, I think, the movement around the vaccine resist-

171
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,120
-There you use parents in different ways whose children have died.

173
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,120
What is common to how the vaccine opponents handles-

174
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,560
-This the kind of stories about people who lost their child-

175
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,920
-In a preventable disease as a measles is to point out-

176
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,000
-It, regardless, the vaccine is more dangerous than the disease itself.

177
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,680
I have talked to people who say that measles is not a disease-

178
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,760
-and that measles cannot kill, which is completely wrong.

179
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,240
It's about trying to bring

180
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,400
-That it is not serious illnesses and that vaccine is dangerous.

181
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,560
But there are a lot of good tips here to give.

182
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,480
We can do this in our channel.

183
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,400
Okay, but uptempo this time. Remember where I taught you.

184
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,720
False claims on the web can cause substantial injury.

185
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,840
Here are some tips for not being part of it-

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,960
-When you share things in your flows.

187
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,080
Tip one: assume that something is wrong or fake.

188
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,400
Think like it's April 1st and you don't want to go on something-

189
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,960
-When you are out on social media.

190
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,200
Tip two: Check it out. If anything was interesting enough to share-

191
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,120
-Is it absolutely important enough to check if it is correct.

192
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,840
Even if it's just something you read, it may be well worth checking out too-

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,320
-Stheft it can affect your picture of reality.

194
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,920
Tip three: Think about the effects, for you, for the one you write about.

195
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,840
Can this cause harm to someone?

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,320
Tip four: Keep in mind that things can scale up.

197
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,080
This little, little you write-

198
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,840
-or posts in your feed-

199
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,600
-Lo pretty openly open, and if many begin to split something-

200
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,080
-And something goes viral, it can have consequences you have not imagined.

201
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,840
Oh. - Hello?

202
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,640
Yes. Okay. I get it.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,320
Oh, do you want to? Yes, but absolutely.

204
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,360
-Okay! -What is going on?

205
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,200
