00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,320
Hello. Majken is my name, and I am a shooter and did my military duty as it -

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,120
- And it is very broad what a shooter is but for me it was that I had another weapon.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,360
I had a shotgun, which is a slightly larger weapon.

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,920
Yes, my name is Birger and I did the military duty as a radar commander -

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,440
–And that means you have a large radar -

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,360
- A truck that drives around and then you set it up in a place -

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,400
- And so you stand with the help of radar and scout for airplanes.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,600
Today we are here to answer some questions.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,440
I have got an iPad here so it will probably show up something,

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,160
But I don't really know what questions we should answer.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,080
So it gets exciting.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,880
Yes, sounds exciting.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,520
Yes, they do.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03.560
It is part of that that you do not make a difference in gender.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,960
I thought it was good.

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07.560
It really shows that you do not make a difference in gender.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,800
Yes but exactly. And I think it would have become more we and them feeling -

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,520
- If you had slept separately.

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,640
Really.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,880
Oh.

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,200
Yes, you are placed in war at the end of your conscripts -

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,400
- And should be prepared to solve the service you have been trained.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
But then you can also take employment, if you would like to, you do not have to -

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
- And work within the Armed Forces.

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,880
There are good opportunities to do so.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,680
You get salary, so to speak.

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,480
You get a full SEK 146 a day.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,720
So that's nice money.

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,080
But you have no expenses either.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01.720
No. You get free accommodation and food.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Yes and all trips home on leave paid.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08.400
So I really had no expenses, it was a little candy type you buy on the weekends.

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,240
But otherwise it really is, most people save that money.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,040
And then you get a lump sum.

35
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,840
What you have earned you get again when you have finished the education as well.

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,760
So if you do for nine months you have received 40 thousand -

37
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,120
- And so you get it again, so 80,000 then.

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,200
Tax -free.

39
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,120
Yeah.

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,400
And I did 15 months as KB, as it is called, company fäls -

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,600
- And 15 months times the four thousand you get a month will be a little more maybe.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,720
It was a nice cling at the checkout when I got there, the day we finished.

43
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55.920
Yes but a little this macho culture.

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,720
Everyone should be big, strong, tough ... endure a lot

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,480
But I noticed that pretty quickly -

46
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08.360
- That no one was prepared for what was waiting in the beginning.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,400
And then I ended up on a fairly technically oriented pluton then.

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,280
There was everyone like me. A little nature interested, or had this interest in plugging and so on.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,320
Yes and a little similar, though, it is for me, because it was not very theory in my position -

50
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,240
- Out it was more out and pig in the forest type.

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,120
So I thought everyone would be this huge, strong man -

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,560
- But I fit in very well there and I'm not that stereotype.

53
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,080
So that I think it is very much wider than you think.

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49.560
Then it is also an education, and that was perhaps not what I had mainly in my head -

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55.560
- That it would still be a bit theory even though I had significantly less than I can imagine you had -

56
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01.880
- So it was still some theoretical lessons and you talked a lot about how a group is and you should get to know each other.

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06.920
And that's not what I had seen in front of me when I saw the lump in front of me.

58
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
Mental.

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,080
I would probably say a mixture, but the physical I think it will be psychic.

60
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27.560
So you are out walking and wearing heavy, it is very busy physically.

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,280
But the hardest thing, I think, is the mental thing to constantly motivate oneself to continue walking or to cope a little longer.

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,920
So what is most difficult physically also gets the most difficult mentally, I think.

63
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,360
Oh.

64
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,760
I have so many memories, but I would probably say that both the best and the worst was probably the end of our group manager school.

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:05:00.360
We ate maybe one meal a day, and were under constant stress and then hunted by the enemy.

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:09.120
That's when you realized that shit I know so much more, I can live with very little food and with very little water -

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,320
- Because there was something I was very afraid of before ...

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,960
... when I go three hours without food so I start to get cheerful and dip together total -

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,480
- But it went well, because you were still prepared for it in some way.

70
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,520
And that was also the toughest.

71
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,120
I remember we went, and then we almost got back to where we had started the exercise.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,240
So I thought now maybe we can go home ... but then we stayed for three more days.

73
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,720
Then you never get ... When you think you can go home so just no, it will not be so.

74
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Ah. So I had many dips there.

75
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,480
But it was also what made it feel so good afterwards, that you managed it.

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:55,320
For me a little the same, the worst memories are also the best in some way because they are the ones you learn most from I think.

77
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Mine was probably ... we had a soldier's test so we had done this and tested without food and such ...

78
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03.440
... how do you manage for a few days. And it would have been shit.

79
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06.640
But after that we had a job training ...

80
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,040
... and then I would have the shotgun for the first time,

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,160
Also, we would have a march to learn to go with it and pall the packing -

82
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,160
- And then I wore the charging bag, ie where you have all the bullets to shoot -

83
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,080
- And it gets pretty heavy because there is a lot to shoot.

84
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,440
So I thought it was ... It's my worst memory, but there I really learned ...

85
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32.560
... it was probably the first time during the entire undergraduate education, then I had been in for a while -

86
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,520
- As I really felt that shit what I pallets more than I think.

87
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,920
Because then it really was this one, find more motivation to keep going even though I just want to lie down and scream on the ground.

88
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,040
But it went.

89
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,080
And I took that with me then, all other times I needed to carry all that equipment.

90
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,480
But the best thing, if I do not say a specific memory, then this is probably around.

91
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,320
So it's not just being out in the woods and walking and wearing heavy, or like -

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,680
- Lodest in some clay so, but it is a lot of community too.

93
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06.600
So we went away and sometimes bathed in our spare time.

94
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,160
We played a fireball tournament.

95
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,520
All the things, the community you have, it is fantastic.

96
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,920
Yes indeed.

97
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,440
So that these are probably my best memories too. Leisure.

98
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,600
Nah. -No.

99
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,560
I thought it was very nice that there is no difference between women and men.

100
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,800
Then you may notice as a woman that like this, you are a minority -

101
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,640
- But I would say that the commanders, ie the teachers I had during my education - -

102
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:50,200
- They were very good that if we were out in the field we also got five minutes to pee -

103
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,720
- That every time you like this, I request more time, so I can't pee in five minutes -

104
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,760
- You may have had menstruation or so, then they were very very understanding.

105
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,760
And I only had male commanders, so for me it was a bit of a shock in the beginning that they were so understanding.

106
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06.800
I thought it would be much harder than it was.

107
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,160
And what are fields? Should we start there?

108
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,520
We can start with fields. I have a little control over.

109
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:26,840
When you are out in the woods simply and practice or do different things, you are in the field, then it is called.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,440
And you can live in the forest then. So, sleep over.

111
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,760
All the guys who were in combat pairs with a woman had to have some tampons in her pocket always or some kind of menswear -

112
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,320
- To be out in the field, maybe they would end or so.

113
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,080
So that there was always someone extra that wore.

114
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,640
I could always go to my combat companion and then he could pick out some tampons.

115
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,640
But if you have menstruation in the field, that is, the only thing is to bring the type of wet wipes out so you can wash your hands properly.

116
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01.440
Yes. -Yes.

117
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,320
After all, there is no weapon -free military service today.

118
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,120
Nah.

119
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,800
So we had a job training as it is called when you start to focus on their different branches -

120
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,680
- I suspect you were out and shot a lot then.

121
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,440
We were.

122
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,400
Pig and had a hard time, in my world.

123
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:30,880
While I was sitting in a lesson room, had a cup of coffee, took a little break from time to time, taught us ...

124
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,080
... Like sitting in the school bench and plugging.

125
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,640
I thought it was much more difficult than what I did.

126
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,720
Because it is very theory and technically so.

127
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:47,440
I thought ... Obviously it's hard sometimes if you are out and going with packing and sowing, for example -

128
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52.560
- But a lot when you shoot a shotgun, you might lie down, shoot at different goals in different places sow -

129
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:02,520
- So it is not always very physically and I do not think it is so hard because you do not have to think that much.

130
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:09,160
Of course you have to think about safety and everything like that but otherwise ...

131
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:16,480
- No, it is usually nice to go to the shooting range one day and just lie down, Panga a little.

132
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,440
Yes, it really is not hard all the time.

133
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Yes, you have to do that. It is always possible to have a map in your pocket.

134
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,000
So I really didn't see myself as a typical military and still don't do it -

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
—The far from the stereotypical image I had before I did my military duty -

136
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,560
- That it would be very macho and you would be very big, strong and you would have an interest in being out in the woods -

137
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,600
- And maybe different weapons systems that some find interesting.

138
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,480
I was like this, I liked to hang out with friends, make up, I liked clothes ...

139
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:05,280
... So, it was really as far away as I could imagine that you could be from the Armed Forces and the military.

140
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09.960
But I enjoy it very well and have found something that I really like.

141
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,480
So even though I really didn't see myself as the stereotypical military, I'm a military now.

142
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,280
Yes but exactly. And I recognize myself a lot in it because I saw myself pretty much like ...

143
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:31,800
... I am not strong enough and not enough on and forward, and I like to joke about it a little and so -

144
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,200
- And be a little lattjo, and it doesn't fit in because there it should be strict and "up oppos".

145
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,920
I'm a little more in the geeky direction maybe.

146
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:47,960
You are actually needed there, even if you think you are a reading head that may not have sports as a favorite subject.

147
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,520
And it has boosted my self -esteem so much because I thought a little about myself before the military service.

148
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,720
Yes but that was for me too. You get a bigger perspective, I would say, on things.

149
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,960
Although I might like to make up, or still do -

150
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,200
- So I can live in the forest without doing it, so I do not die from it.

151
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09.400
So that you learn a lot about yourself and you learn to appreciate things a lot.

152
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,760
I think we can appreciate a hot shower, more than many who have not done military service can, for example.

153
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,840
Or a bed.

154
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,480
A bed!

155
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,280
Food.

156
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,120
There are many who are perhaps a little nervous about this, yes, but the bed is very narrow and hard and boring JU -

157
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,360
- But after being out in the field for a week, it is the best bed you could wish for.

158
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,960
To just ... a bed.

159
