00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:05,732
Megalodon

2
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09.502
was a prehistoric shark that ruled in the sea of the world

3
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:14,874
About 23 \ hilmins to 3.6 \ hilmillion years ago.

4
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:19,546
It was about three times larger than the present white shark

5
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:23,149
and it was not only known for its huge size

6
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,953
but also for their huge teeth.

7
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:35,862
The name "Megalodon" actually means big tooth.

8
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,431
But how big was megalodon

9
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,401
In comparison to today's sea animals?

10
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:46,106
Where in the world was it and how did it die out?

11
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:51.845
That and much more we will find out today.

12
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,480
Megalodon wasn't just

13
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57.016
The largest shark that existed on our earth.

14
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,454
In fact, also the biggest predatory fish that ever existed.

15
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05.525
Megalodon was a top consumer,

16
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09.162
which means it was at the top of the food chain

17
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,198
Without any natural enemies.

18
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,468
As a top consumer, Megalodon had an important role

19
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:19,139
in keeping the ecosystem of the sea in balance.

20
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,242
It held the populations of other marine animals

21
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,613
As whales and large fish under control.

22
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,483
This helped to maintain a healthy diversity

23
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,420
and prevented a certain species from becoming overdominating,

24
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:40,827
which can lead to imbalance in the ecosystem.

25
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:41,461
Megalodon

26
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,564
body length varies slightly depending on the source

27
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,734
And the method used to measure.

28
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,670
But many scientists believe that they were usually between

29
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,140
15 to 18 meters long

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,678
And some researchers estimate a length of up to 24 meters.

31
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01.748
For the largest individuals.

32
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05.418
If we compare megalodone with today's sea animals like that

33
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:09.822
Can you see a little clearer how big megalodone was.

34
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:15,161
A full -grown white shark can reach a length of up to six meters.

35
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,530
A killer whale can reach a length of

36
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,335
up to nine meters and the elections may easily reach a

37
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:26,773
Length of between 16 to 18 meters.

38
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,777
A LED bus has a length of about 18.75

39
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,147
meters and as I mentioned earlier so could a megalodon

40
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,551
have a length of between 15 to 24 meters

41
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,187
and this gives us a little clearer picture of

42
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:48.861
How big this shark was.

43
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,533
A full grown megalodon was estimated to weigh about 50 tons

44
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,738
But that the largest individuals could reach a weight of 100 tonnes.

45
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:04,377
This massive size and weight required a huge energy

46
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,679
A megalodone needed to eat approximately

47
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:11,184
1.1 tons of food every day

48
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,521
And that corresponds to about two grown cows.

49
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:20,193
But it wasn't cows that megalodone ate

50
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,530
Fossil evidence shows that megalodon chased whales

51
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,001
For example, caskets and greenlands,

52
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,070
But also other marine animals such as seals,

53
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,141
Sea turtles and dolphins.

54
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:39,846
Probably megalodone also had cannibalism tendencies,

55
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:44,884
So they could eat each other in the absence of other foods.

56
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,321
They are not uncommon among sharks.

57
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,323
As I mentioned earlier so means

58
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,760
The name Megalodon - "big tooth".

59
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,997
The teeth could be over 18 centimeters long,

60
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:02.935
Megalodon had about five rows of teeth in each jaw

61
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:08,274
with a total of 276 to 328 teeth.

62
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,910
These teeth were nothing you wanted to end up

63
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,748
in between. Today's white sharks already have a terrible strong

64
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:20,386
bit power of about 1875 kilos.

65
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,523
Megalodon on the other hand, was estimated to have a

66
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:30,163
bit power of between 10 \ H900 and 18 \ H100 kilos.

67
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,765
This is so powerful that it would be enough

68
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:37.603
To easily bite steel.

69
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,341
It is believed that Megalodon gave birth to live kids.

70
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,177
However, it is unclear if the species was ovovivipar

71
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,181
meaning the eggs remained inside

72
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:53.019
modern and hatched there or if it were “vivipar” there

73
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:58,391
The fertilized embryos were given continuous nutrition directly from the mother.

74
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:03,796
Like mammals. Assessments based on teeth from young individuals

75
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:07.367
suggests that recently born megalodonians

76
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:14,040
may have been at least two meters long.

77
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:18,144
Megalodon Ann's in the seas almost all over the world.

78
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,013
Fossil finds of megalodone has been discovered

79
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:25,184
on each continent except Antarctica.

80
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:29,422
It thrived in warm coastal waters, but also had the ability to

81
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:34,293
dive deeply as it chased after its prey.

82
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38.231
When talking about prehistoric animals as dinosaurs

83
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,734
so we often think about their skeleton

84
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:46,739
And how come we only found teeth from Megalodon?

85
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,876
Shouldn't there be skeletal parts?

86
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,144
The truth is that

87
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:55,314
Hajar's skeleton is not made of legs.

88
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,584
Their skeleton is made of cartilage.

89
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,587
Same soft and flexible materials available

90
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,590
In your ears and your nose tip.

91
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,897
This applies to all sharks from the white shark to the whale shark.

92
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12.565
The cartilage is softer

93
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15.568
than legs and does not harden as easily over time.

94
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:21,007
So when a shark dies, the cartilage breaks down faster than legs

95
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,577
And that's why we don't find old shark skeletons

96
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,347
As we do with, for example, dinosaurs.

97
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,750
But some of the shark not made

98
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,020
of cartilage is their teeth.

99
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,356
The teeth are hard and can remain in the ground

100
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,460
in millions of years and it is through

101
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,132
these massive teeth that we have been able to draw conclusions about the size of megalodon

102
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,736
Diet and distribution.

103
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,204
The final question

104
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:57.043
Well, why is no megalodone left anymore?

105
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:57,910
There are several

106
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02.215
Reasons why it is believed that Megalodon died out.

107
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05.918
The earth became cooler during the time the time when megalodon was alive

108
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,656
The ice was expanded at the poles and the sea level fell,

109
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:15,495
Which limited Megalodon's habitat and access to food.

110
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,065
And even if megalodone managed colder water

111
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,634
made the big changes in the sea that

112
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,637
difficult for it to survive.

113
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27.707
Whales and other large prey animals that were important to megalodone

114
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:32,645
moved to other parts of the seas as it got colder,

115
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,248
which forced megalodone to compete

116
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,785
With, among other things, the white shark about the smaller exchanges.

117
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:45,258
The white shark was faster and more adaptable when hunting for these changes

118
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,194
And besides, it was so that even if Megalodon

119
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,197
managed to catch these minor changes

120
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:55.801
so required its huge size such a large amount

121
00:08:55,801 --> 00:09:01.307
feed that they could not maintain their energy needs.

122
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02.074
Megalodons

123
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06.012
size that had previously been an advantage

124
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:12,652
Instead, became a disadvantage when environmental conditions were changed.

125
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:17,690
This eventually got this huge creature to die out

126
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,295
and some day there about 3.6 \ hilmillion years ago

127
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,997
sank the last megalodone

128
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:33,339
down to the bottom.

129
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:38,644
This top consumer who once ruled the ancient seas,

130
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:43,616
had now settled down for his last rest.

131
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:47,553
Megalodon is a reminder that nothing,

132
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,889
No matter how big or powerful it

133
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:55,194
may be, can resist nature's unpredictable

134
00:09:55,261 --> 00:10:00,366
changes.
