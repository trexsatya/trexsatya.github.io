1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
- Have you ever clocked yourself when you cycle between town and school?

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,160
- Yes, it's ten minutes you usually say.
 - Ten minutes no matter what direction you are going.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,880
- It's like a big city in a small town.
 - Mm!

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,720
- There is all university life and student life linked to it.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,520
There is a real city supply.
 Close to nature.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,280
But I don't have to take the bus anywhere really.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,000
- I was given the opportunity to greet a friend here.
 - Okay!

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,400
- I had to come here and test on student life.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,000
Feel the city and the city vibes like that.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,320
After that, I felt I wanted to move to Örebro.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,520
Then, of course, it was a security that I knew a person before who plugged here.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,640
- I understand that.
 - It's nice to have it.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,280
At the same time, I know that even though I had not had it, I would have had a great welcome.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,280
For my absolute closest friends today is not, that person is still a close friend,

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,960
But it is not the person I plug with.

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,160
- My friends had heard so much about Örebro

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,320
About student life, how welded and welcoming the city is.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,560
Then it was like this, it sounds pretty good.
 That's why I chose Örebro.

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,160
- Klara and I know each other since before.
 You started plugging a little before me.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,840
Me and another friend have been and greeted you a couple of times before we started plugging here.

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,720
We thought it was a lot of fun.
 Got to go to a nightclub in Örebro City.
 Very funny!

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,080
We got to meet your friends.
 Great fun!

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,760
We had to live three people in one.
 Great fun!

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,240
- An experience!
 - An experience!

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
- It's just that planning.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,280
At home, it was required to check bus times and train times.

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,840
Here's just jumping on the bike and it takes ten minutes!

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,040
- Pretty!
 But also another thing.

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,000
Just the proximity and agility to get home to Stockholm,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,600
I think is a great advantage with Örebro.
 The train I think takes a maximum of two hours.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,640
- And there are often trains.
 - Yes!

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,640
So it's easy to get home a weekend or a day.

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,960
- I had lived in Australia for two years before.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,120
I would move home to Sweden.

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,520
I felt I didn't want to move home to mom and dad.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,680
I heard rumors and thought Örebro, easier to get a home.
 So I thought I move there.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,840
Also that it is close, but also that I knew in Stockholm, I have the family there,

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,320
I have friends there.
 I am already established.
 Thought it's probably the same for most people there.

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,400
Örebro I have heard, as you say, is a student city.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,200
People move there and they don't know anyone there.
 Then it becomes forced out.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,720
It will be this student life where everyone wants to get to know each other.

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
- I applied for all medical programs in Sweden and entered Örebro.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,320
- Correct!
 - That's why it became Örebro.

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,840
- Congratulations!
 - It was as good as any.

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
- How good!
 - How good!

46
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,320
- I haven't bought bus tickets since I moved here.
 - boast, boast, boast.

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,600
Haha, no but it's really nice as well.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,400
- Yes, I have saved money on it because it is so cheap.

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,840
- How do you get around, do you cycle?
 - No, or ...

50
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,400
My bike is either twisted or gone, or not as much away as ...

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,720
When I moved it was winter and I am not super sharp at cycling.

52
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,080
I thought I won't cycle right now.
 So I leave this and pick it up soon.

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:34,240
Then they tore that house!
 Did they tore the bike?
 Maybe maybe not.

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Does anyone have turned the bike?
 Maybe maybe not.

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,040
Is it left?
 Maybe maybe not.

56
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,120
- You haven't checked?

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,480
- So I may have a bike.

58
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,920
But I do not use it, but I drive a lot of electrical kick bike or walk.

59
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,400
I think that works great for me.

60
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,400
- It is much easier to be spontaneous and get to this everyday hang.

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,200
Which otherwise can be quite difficult to get.
 - Yes indeed.

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,840
- It will be difficult with planning.
 You should go long distances in Stockholm.

63
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Here you and I live five to ten minutes apart by bike.

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,880
- Yes, and it is not close with Örebromät measured.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,720
- No, then we still live a bit from each other.

66
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,280
- Yes exactly.
 Like different area codes, so to speak.
 - Really!

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,960
- That you want to be social, you want to go and meet and start talking to people.

68
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,080
You start hanging out on everyday evenings and just "we should go home and play cards" or whatever type.

69
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,080
- Yes, it gets so spontaneous and so fun!

70
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,280
- It's so close too, student life.

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,840
Type everyone lives at the university so it really becomes this community.

72
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,840
- It's so fun!
 Me and my friends talked about this the other day.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,520
You have your family in your hometown, but then you have created your own family here in Örebro.
