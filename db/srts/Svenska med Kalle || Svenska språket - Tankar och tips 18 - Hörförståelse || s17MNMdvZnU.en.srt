00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Hello everyone

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,280
Who trains Swedish

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Today

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,480
I thought

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,500
give a small example of

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,860
or at least attempt

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,680
Give examples of

8
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19,540
How I talk

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,400
If i do not

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,700
are teachers

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,120
in Swedish

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
In my classroom

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,460
Or on Youtube

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,340
It's a little hard

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,280
When I don't talk to a person

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,720
But I was going to try

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,700
so i was going to tell you a little about

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,880
What I have done today

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52.220
and what to do later in the day

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
so let's see

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Today I have evening course

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
on sfi so i'm free

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,480
in the morning

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02.760
And then I always clean up

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
and vacuuming, dust dry

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,240
maybe carry out the recycling and go to the sopage center and so on

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,520
And today I have also listened to a speech book at the same time

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,780
So I listen to a book called "The Power of Habit"

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,400
which deals with how our brain is largely guided by

30
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,460
controlled by habits

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
so it deals with both individuals and groups

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,660
and how habits form our behavior so it was very interesting

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,280
But now I have finished listening to it

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,040
and it is ten o'clock in eleven

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,480
As soon as I will go to work

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,040
First I have ... I have my usual SFI group

37
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,100
And then so

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,260
Then I'll have my evening course then

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
But between the evening course and the usual course

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,680
so i usually take a little walk

41
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,100
And sometimes I go to the library too

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,620
And read a little

43
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,540
To get a little break

44
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02.660
It gets pretty late when you have evening course

45
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05.420
So it's nice to get out a bit and get fresh air

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Yeah, so my day looks about

47
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,640
On the tram I might answer a bit like this

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,280
Some comments

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,880
on the workout Swedish or youtube or so

50
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,040
and i hope this was a little taste test

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
on how I sound when I speak more relaxed

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,460
and not

53
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,440
thinking about talking slowly

54
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,340
okay

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,920
I don't know if this was easy to understand

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,720
Or difficult

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
It is not meant to be mean

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,460
without

59
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,220
I think it's important that we think about

60
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,160
How important the hearing comprehension is

61
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,100
and that it is

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,020
For most people I think

63
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03.040
that this is what we need to practice most at

64
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06.620
And it is both about understanding

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,420
Fast Swedish, fast talk

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
But it is also about

67
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
To understand huge words

68
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,760
both more formal words

69
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,180
And hose

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,760
For in Swedish

71
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Just as in all other languages

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
so there are many expressions

73
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,180
we use

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
and then one must try

75
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
learn as many as possible

76
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
In order to understand better

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,460
Feel free to ask

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,980
Words I use or things I say

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Comment, discuss

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
The intention is that these videos

81
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,220
shall become a way of thinking

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,940
What is important to practice when training Swedish

83
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,320
and what is difficult and how we can get better

84
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,140
so

85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Feel free to write something in a comment

86
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,560
and will be seen soon again

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,540
Take care, bye.
