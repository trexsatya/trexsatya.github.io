1
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.400
Report Week on the Stockholm Stock Exchange has been pretty bleak

2
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.880
and then the last reconciliation of the portfolios in KomxS30

3
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.480
the share index OMXS30 has collapsed by 5 %.

4
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.920
It has also reflected in the competition participants' portfolios.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.480
Last week, ten of the 13 participants were on Plus.

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.920
Now no one does.
 Most recently is Jonas Olavi, who is thus a new leader.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.760
This is how Olavi described his workshop -heavy portfolio at the beginning of the competition.

8
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.320
This is a portfolio with a little lower risk

9
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.560
But it includes companies that are in a fairly strong momentum separately.

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.680
So these ones they stand and go beat on fine

11
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.440
And has managed to parry economic turmoil so far.

12
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.680
Olavi's tactics have paid off well, none of his shares have lost significantly.

13
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.440
For the cows from Sparreholm, it is time to question the share skills.

14
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.600
They cable a lot down in the last place.
 The explanation for the poor outcome is

15
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.720
That they managed to prick the two shares that lost the most: SBB and Kinnevik.

16
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.640
It remains to be seen if it could be a "Komeback".
