1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:06,523
- Welcome to the research circle in the skeptic track.

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:13,757
The skeptic track is a track within "Digitally first with the user in focus".

3
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:18,199
It is a competence lift for library staff in the country.

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,258
At the beginning of the project, one of the development leaders came to me and said:

5
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:32,452
"Have you thought that we would have a skeptic track?"

6
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:38,611
We had all possible tracks, but no skeptic track.

7
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:51,187
What a good idea, right? That you have to ask the shaky questions.

8
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:58,290
It ended in a research circle together with Södertörn University.

9
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:06,510
There are four groups that will discuss this.

10
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:12,251
It will be a book for the Book Fair this fall.

11
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:18,893
Not everyone has to disclose their texts, but you have to do it.

12
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:26,999
It will also be a pod, which is already on Digiteket.

13
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:35,513
Those who do not attend the course can follow the course aisle. You can work in small groups on your own.

14
00:01:35,616 --> 00:01:40,477
If you dare not work together with supervisors.

15
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:43,555
But then you miss the whole supervision.

16
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:48,294
It is there so you know what we have for us.

17
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:56,078
The courses themselves will be in group rooms in Digiteket.

18
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:59,789
Now we will start with our first lecturer.

19
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:06,928
Jonna Bornemark, well -known speaker. Professor of philosophy, associate professor at Södertörn University.

20
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:11,385
You will talk about the immatable library.

21
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:14,448
Welcome forward. - Thanks.

22
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:25,140
Great fun that we do this, and to start the skeptic track.

23
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:34,657
What I will talk about is based on my book, "The Renaissance Renaissance".

24
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:41,466
It is in many ways a skeptics' look at the contemporary.

25
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:47,915
I try to formulate a contemporary and cultural criticism.

26
00:02:51,914 --> 00:03:04,764
The criticism that I perform there, and will place the libraries in,

27
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:09,648
Had I not been able to do without empirical material.

28
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:17,608
A contact with the contemporary similar to what you will do.

29
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:25,813
That is, to be in close contact with practices and core business.

30
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:32,249
For us at the Center for Practical Knowledge, it is about school, care and culture.

31
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,365
People from there are our education.

32
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:48,886
What is interesting about that material is that we are looking for concrete stories.

33
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,756
We want to start in concrete and shaky situations.

34
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:03,624
Like here and now. Now I do not know how much you are driving.

35
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:08,796
I try to describe the material in the book, not exactly what you should do.

36
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:18,974
We want first person, singularis, present, to stay here and now.

37
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:23,083
I teach so too many different groups.

38
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:27,815
At one point I had under and nurses in the group.

39
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:35,153
The nurses were recent graduates and had their education in the body.

40
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:39,222
They had a hard time writing "I".

41
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:45,608
It became "man", and hovered away in abstractions.

42
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:52,127
The nurses had no problems with it.

43
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:57,928
However, they spelled as rakes, but it was easy to do something about it.

44
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:05,056
It is interesting to see what our education does to us,

45
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:10,108
And what perspectives we get worse at.

46
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,484
But that does not mean that it is uneducable.

47
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:19,390
I will talk more about why it is important to get close to the concrete.

48
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:30,250
You can get better at that. It is not in contrast to education.

49
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:38,478
All these stories told me a lot about our time.

50
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,945
The problem with our time is that there is so much that is obvious.

51
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:48,138
It is difficult to be critical when you are in the middle of something.

52
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:54,426
The fish find it difficult to see the water. You have to contrast it.

53
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:06,689
The second source of the book is the Renaissance philosophers.

54
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:14,970
Nicolaus Cusanus from the 15th century, Bruno from the 16th century, and Descartes from the 17th century.

55
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:29,744
The whole point is what we are going to do with such memories.

56
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:36,891
Why should we read historical texts? Well, to be able to relate to our time.

57
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:43,807
At Cusanus I find things that are very different to the contemporary.

58
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:51,303
This meant that I could see things that are otherwise forgiven.

59
00:06:53,183 --> 00:07:00,442
The function of being able to throw a critical look at the time needs a distance.

60
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:09,886
We try to work explicitly with the relationship between proximity and distance.

61
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:15,393
To be close in concrete situations and then be able to distance themselves.

62
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:21,373
Read their own text as if someone else has written it.

63
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:31,569
See what it really is about, and take the help of philosophical scientists.

64
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,994
I'm not going to delve into it now, but it had to do with it.

65
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:44,746
Just so I have worked when I formulated this social criticism.

66
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:53,595
What I discovered at Cusanus was our relationship with not knowing.

67
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:02,836
When I talk about it you wonder "Why shouldn't we know?"

68
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:11,530
Modernity is about creating knowledge. It is knowledge that is the whole point.

69
00:08:14,013 --> 00:08:22,859
Cusanus says that knowledge is important, but we do not understand it unless we have a relationship with non-science.

70
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:29,857
There I began to think about how we think about not knowing in our time.

71
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:40,157
We rarely have relationships with a large non-science.

72
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:43,044
Instead, we have something we do not yet know.

73
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,166
It becomes clear when writing a research application.

74
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:54,057
Then you have to talk about everything you know, and extensive what we do not know.

75
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:58,933
And then I'll talk about exactly how to find out.

76
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:03,450
I have acquaintances who got the noble because they did not talk about

77
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,309
Exactly in which magazines to publish what they do not yet know.

78
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:13,886
I have to know a lot for not knowing exactly that.

79
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:22,590
Few researchers feel comfortable with it, because this is not possible.

80
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:29,639
It would not be research if it went so.

81
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:36,182
Here Cusanus becomes extremely liberating to think with.

82
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:42,979
It is from this perspective that non-knowing becomes relevant.

83
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,895
What is non-knowing for Cusanus?

84
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:53,912
It is the horizons around all human existence.

85
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,834
Here a philosopher starts to feel at home.

86
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:05,496
These are the five -year -old's questions.

87
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:11,963
Where does the universe end? What happens after death?

88
00:10:11,963 --> 00:10:22,823
What is the meaning of life? All infinity issues are here.

89
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:34,067
What was interesting was that there was also at Cusanus in the least.

90
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:38,010
Here I want to talk about concrete situations.

91
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:48,264
In the Middle Ages there was a vocabulary to talk about the concrete, the least.

92
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:52,437
Here you can endure a philosophical turn.

93
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:57,594
It is easy to understand that with the biggest, the words are not enough.

94
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:06,347
The concept of God in a medieval understanding is what man cannot encompass.

95
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:10,687
We can't define it, because we can't say what it is not.

96
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:17,409
It is "be", which is one of our biggest concepts.

97
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:21,592
It is a word that does not mean anything in the end, because it is boundless.

98
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,320
It is easy in relation to the biggest issues.

99
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,730
In the Middle Ages there was a relationship with the smallest,

100
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,647
Where the language is similar in a similar way.

101
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:38,999
Language is always based on generalities. On what is the same.

102
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:46,845
Blue yesterday, today, for you and me. So we have the concept of "blue".

103
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:52,375
Cusanus we mean missing something if we only live in the generalites.

104
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:56,089
We also live in the situation unique.

105
00:11:58,147 --> 00:12:03,554
It is perhaps easiest to understand if we talk about love.

106
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:09,677
Vascular to a child, who is just this child.

107
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:15,839
My child may be worse than yours, but it doesn't matter.

108
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:23,332
I love this child, and cannot formulate how it differs from yours.

109
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:32,893
But I love this. There is a specificity that words do not reach.

110
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:40,652
If I want to write a list, it will be too general.

111
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:48,842
There is something here where we must have another responsiveness.

112
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:56,506
When we talk about professional judgment, there are situations unique in a different way.

113
00:12:56,506 --> 00:13:01,330
There are situations and groups.

114
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:10,918
If I as a teacher come into a class that I know well

115
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:15,008
May I have a responsiveness for where they are now.

116
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:19,466
If the conflict between you has escalated, I must meet it.

117
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:30,269
How is the situation with the child with anxiety that has it tangled at home?

118
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:43,386
What we should talk about today, how does it fall into this group?

119
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:47,883
That's what we call judged, being able to feel here and now.

120
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:52,384
Everyone who works in interpersonal professions knows what it is.

121
00:13:55,155 --> 00:14:05,519
Some of you certainly have administrative tasks, and others meet visitors.

122
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,965
What do you have? User.

123
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:24,908
Attention is a topic that never ends.

124
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:31,231
How do I do with this person? With the category "Fylo" I do exactly like this.

125
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:40,039
In this particular situation, I have to face this way.

126
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,090
Here are horizons of non-knowing.

127
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:53,962
I cannot create a complete manual with concepts.

128
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:58,340
It is to be in relation to horizons of non-scientific,

129
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:04,909
For every situation is always richer than the generalites that describe them.

130
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,278
Somewhere is Cusanus.

131
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:17,173
The point of the horizons is that they do not exclude knowledge.

132
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:25,845
Knowledge always inserts that we can find out things in relation to the horizons.

133
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:28,929
The horizon concept is great here.

134
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,515
There may be an island over there on the horizon.

135
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:39,663
I can get to that island, and create knowledge about it.

136
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,975
But at the horizon there is a new island.

137
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,773
Then I can row there and create knowledge about it.

138
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:49,897
But the horizon is still there.

139
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:55,425
So Cusanus thinks. It is horizons of non-knowing.

140
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:58,753
It never excludes knowledge.

141
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:02,350
This is the situation we can create knowledge in.

142
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,557
I have some medieval and mystic interest.

143
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:14,768
Science is focused on the fact that there is an island where you can create knowledge.

144
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:22,521
In the next application I want to write I see an island that I want to investigate.

145
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:30,647
The mystery is interested in what it means to live in relation to horizons of non-science.

146
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,960
That the horizon is never exhausted. What does it mean for human life?

147
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:44,973
Science and mystery are not in conflict with each other.

148
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:53,979
Modernity is good at creating opposites. Magic or science.

149
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:57,719
Cusanus shows how they are connected.

150
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:04,088
They are two sides of human knowledge process.

151
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,701
I hope I come to the libraries.

152
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,882
In relation to the horizons of non-science, we can create knowledge.

153
00:17:15,882 --> 00:17:18,486
For that matter, we have reason.

154
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:23,710
By reason I mean what we use when creating knowledge.

155
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:29,189
With Cusanus I have a greater concept of reason.

156
00:17:29,497 --> 00:17:32,914
Cusanus talks about two concepts.

157
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:37,328
One is "Intellectus" and the other is "Ratio".

158
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:44,418
"Intellectus" is the ability to stand in relation to horizons of non-scientific

159
00:17:44,418 --> 00:17:48,007
And there capture what is important.

160
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,856
In that classroom, for example.

161
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:55,790
What is important here? What do I need to face?

162
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:04,272
A lot happens in a class, but everything is not important to deal with.

163
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:07,324
What do I need to catch up?

164
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:12,486
Then I deliver down what-the-races to a ratio

165
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:19,283
that organizes, systematizes, arranges, measures, counts.

166
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:29,219
The point for Cusanus is that we cannot have an order without knowing what is important.

167
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:32,156
We could always measure and count more.

168
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:36,284
There are infinitely things to measure in this room.

169
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:41,804
But what is relevant to measure?

170
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:47,369
These are different types of abilities.

171
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:53,883
Catching what is important requires judgment.

172
00:18:54,197 --> 00:19:02,169
In art and literature it is about knowing what is important.

173
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:08,771
You are not passive, but also not active and just capture things that are important.

174
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:15,325
This is a long discussion. If it is incomprehensible, then ignore it.

175
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:21,636
Pactivity means I take over something and make it mine.

176
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:24,447
You have to be passive and active at the same time.

177
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:33,706
I capture things and systematize and arrange.

178
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,688
Here we can measure, because there is objectivity.

179
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:44,867
This is the big example.

180
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:48,987
When Trump said there were more on his installation than on Obamas.

181
00:19:49,617 --> 00:19:53,900
There began the discussion about alternative facts.

182
00:19:55,364 --> 00:20:07,252
Journalists showed photos of insight. There were more at Obama's installation.

183
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:15,196
The Trump administration said it was alternative facts.

184
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:21,202
Intellectus is a subjectivity.

185
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:26,514
Only a subjectivity can capture what is important.

186
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:32,137
No computer can, I want to claim that.

187
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,420
But it does not exclude objectivity.

188
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,631
That doesn't mean Trump can say there were more.

189
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,794
And for a very simple reason.

190
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:53,656
We agree on the time.

191
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:58,928
We agree on the site.

192
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:02,626
And we agree on how to count heads.

193
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:08,668
It does not matter if we have different definitions of what a person is.

194
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:17,211
I would have been impressed if they had said that everyone at Trump's installation was pregnant.

195
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,345
So there are twice as many as you can see.

196
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:22,011
At least it had been an argument.

197
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:34,287
Once we have defined our concepts, there is an objectivity.

198
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:43,808
We are good at creating dichotomies, and say that you should be objective.

199
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,888
So we put them in conflict with each other.

200
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,496
The point is that they can only work together.

201
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:57,956
Through subjectivity we can know if it is important to measure.

202
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,531
But that does not mean that there is no objective measuring.

203
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,140
Objectivity means that when we have defined our concepts, we can count.

204
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,722
It doesn't matter who counts.

205
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:15,102
Background, sexual laying, skin color.

206
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:21,401
It doesn't matter as long as we have the same definitions.

207
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:27,636
I take this up because they are so often put into conflict with each other.

208
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:31,043
One of Cusanus's main points is that this does not happen once.

209
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:35,239
In a healthy culture, it happens all the time.

210
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:38,851
We have to capture democracy.

211
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:41,965
Do we know what democracy is today?

212
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,653
It is a concept that we structure our world around.

213
00:22:45,986 --> 00:22:50,763
We have a definition of citizens, what the media does and so on.

214
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,922
But I don't know if we know what democracy is today.

215
00:22:56,397 --> 00:22:59,548
It is a concept we would have to capture.

216
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:05,579
For a while not know what it is, to capture what is important.

217
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:12,456
What we need to recapture, and new dimensions that we need to formulate.

218
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:15,351
And what may have passed.

219
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:17,626
It is an intellectus work.

220
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:24,559
When we take it down, maybe democracy, citizens and media become something else.

221
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:26,922
So it gets a little messy.

222
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:33,482
I hope you understand that people always have to have a ratio.

223
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:39,655
We have an order, a language, a culture. It is included in the ratio formation.

224
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:44,745
But it is always a bit messy as long as it is healthy.

225
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:54,631
Here I release Cusanus and do a contemporary criticism.

226
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,135
I mainly use Max Weber.

227
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:02,850
Modernity carries this movement with it.

228
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:13,981
In modernity, we do not perceive horizons of non-science, but see it as a wall.

229
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:17,100
Christianity is not without the advancement here.

230
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,103
On the other side of the wall we have a god and a heavenly.

231
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,715
A lot of things we can't know anything about.

232
00:24:23,715 --> 00:24:28,315
On this page we have the world, which we can create knowledge about.

233
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:35,345
The modern man says: “Why should I relate to what we can't know?

234
00:24:36,462 --> 00:24:45,412
I stand with my back against the horizons and look at knowledge production.

235
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:55,606
In this world - nature, what can be measured.

236
00:24:58,856 --> 00:25:05,655
Weber says that modernity is the time where we do not care about non-scientific.

237
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:18,119
The relationship between the wall and a horizon can be considered for a long time.

238
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:24,546
When we focus on ratio, intellectus does not disappear.

239
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:32,597
In our privacy, we have to think about what is important.

240
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,395
But we no longer understand that kind of practitioner.

241
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:45,545
There will be a ranking between activities with more ratio character

242
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,998
And less of those with intellectus character.

243
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:58,099
Here we see the ranking between objectivity and subjectivity.

244
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:02,149
This will be reason, that becomes a feeling.

245
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:05,095
This is faith, here is knowing.

246
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:17,941
Culture is society's foremost practice to think about what is important.

247
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:28,966
Today when we are in a collective crisis to the environmental issue, the art is there and pondering.

248
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:33,767
What is it to be human?

249
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:40,194
It is there and examines at once.

250
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,918
The culture becomes incomprehensible.

251
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:52,326
After we arrange the world, it is nice with flute games.

252
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:00,068
Or it becomes culture for health.

253
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:04,228
There is always a risk that culture will be an instrument for something else.

254
00:27:04,228 --> 00:27:08,718
We do not understand the Intellectus activities.

255
00:27:08,718 --> 00:27:14,076
It is the same with the relationship between science and the humanities.

256
00:27:14,076 --> 00:27:19,922
The science has the intellectus practice. You think about what is important to measure.

257
00:27:20,562 --> 00:27:25,319
But I get a little dark when I meet some scientists

258
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:33,689
Who does not ask the question, but looks at what is best measured.

259
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:39,519
What kind of measuring material do we have? Then we ask questions about it.

260
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:43,678
Then there will be very little intellectus business.

261
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:48,393
I was shocked that so many people think so.

262
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:51,233
Among other things, the economy.

263
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:56,026
Now I dissected a whole discipline.

264
00:27:58,616 --> 00:28:07,419
The most flimsy of sciences have their focus here.

265
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,197
To capture a concept.

266
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:15,580
We have a doctoral student who raised the patient concept.

267
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:20,285
What is it when dialysis care for kidney disease looks like this?

268
00:28:20,285 --> 00:28:22,857
Then the concept of patient does not work anymore.

269
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:32,482
Then we have to examine the word and then bake.

270
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:40,689
We can see a ranking in relation to this.

271
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:45,172
This has a lot of consequences. Things happen to the intellectus.

272
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:55,356
One thing that happens is that hedgehogs are created.

273
00:29:01,287 --> 00:29:09,747
Hedgehogs are those who have the intellectus practice, but where it gets stuck in those rooms.

274
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:15,184
I got it illustrated to me when I was at the Royal Academy and talked.

275
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:23,588
They described how the male professors looked at the students' works.

276
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:35,378
So everyone else rangs a week to interpret the humming.

277
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:38,040
So they thought the practice looked.

278
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:40,353
It's a hedgehog.

279
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:47,809
It is a person who has competence, but it is stuck there.

280
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:54,143
It is high status groups that have the opportunity to be hedgehogs.

281
00:29:54,162 --> 00:30:02,063
Nurses cannot talk about their judgment without being overrun.

282
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:09,533
Doctors are also criticized for having a trapped intellectus business.

283
00:30:09,814 --> 00:30:16,767
They feel that they must be hedgehogs, otherwise they will be overrun.

284
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:42,997
What happens to the ratio is that when we cut off we strive for a simpler, pure ratio.

285
00:30:43,139 --> 00:30:50,021
There we can measure and have simple relationships between the different parts.

286
00:30:52,923 --> 00:30:59,529
All totalitarian states start by cutting away the intellectus operations.

287
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:07,814
The artists, the journalists, the intellectuals, because they tangle for it.

288
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:16,545
They are skeptics, argue and think new.

289
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:20,846
It is uncontrollable with Intellectus operations.

290
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:28,672
We never know where it goes. That's the whole point.

291
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:36,322
If you remove it, we have pure, simple ration.

292
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:57,889
When making something into a market, there is a built -in professional skepice.

293
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,745
A criticism for perceiving doctors as hedgehogs.

294
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:06,535
Other professions have no status to begin with.

295
00:32:07,722 --> 00:32:14,529
They do not understand the rational way of organizing care.

296
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:24,081
You have not brought with you the professionals when organizing New Karolinska.

297
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,353
We do not have time to go through exactly what is happening.

298
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:48,545
One problem is that we think that knowledge should be in paper and not in reviews.

299
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:54,072
In manuals, guidelines and routines.

300
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,498
When one thinks the knowledge should be in the papers

301
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:09,794
And every situation is new, it will be a fantastic administration.

302
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:13,542
The "documentation monster" they talk about at the Teachers' Union.

303
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:20,699
The criticism has begun to be formulated seriously.

304
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,605
This is completely measurable. That's right, but we'll know why.

305
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:35,108
We can measure how much administration has grown during the 2000s.

306
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:43,334
The administrative class is getting bigger and bigger.

307
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:49,507
The administration has gone about the dear business in healthcare.

308
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:57,704
How much administration can we have on how little core business?

309
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:06,334
At New Karolinska, they discovered that you had more managers than care places.

310
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:13,571
Is this effective resource use?

311
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,188
It was sold as financially and efficiently.

312
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:23,127
How effective is it to believe that all knowledge should be in the papers?

313
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:27,868
No knowledge should be found with the professional business.

314
00:34:29,186 --> 00:34:35,429
It is not effective, and what is worse is the core business's professional remote controlled.

315
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,390
They should only do as it says in the papers.

316
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:45,813
It has a variety of unpleasant consequences, and we end in a banal evil.

317
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:52,499
I can't take responsibility, because I have done as it says in the papers.

318
00:34:52,810 --> 00:35:13,134
The focus has been shifted from the core business to doing as it says in the papers.

319
00:35:13,891 --> 00:35:19,548
A colleague of us was the manager in the elderly care when this was introduced.

320
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:24,483
She was at a conference where they went through the quality registers.

321
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:31,080
The last powerpoint said: "Whatever you do, care for your quality registers."

322
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:34,296
And that was exactly what happened.

323
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:40,233
The quality registers are there for the care of the elderly to be better.

324
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:45,756
But we have seen that the purpose of the purpose carries more with it.

325
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:51,243
It has become more important to care for the quality registers than the elderly.

326
00:35:51,243 --> 00:35:58,280
We care for the elderly to enter the right figures in the documentation monster.

327
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:03,555
It is a clear displacement that is harmful.

328
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:13,035
At the Health Care Association, they say that those who think the papers are important are those who can remain.

329
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:21,571
Those who focus on healthcare are moving from there.

330
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:24,328
It is a dangerous system.

331
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:31,173
Teachers and nurses are the shortcomings, and that is not because we educate too few.

332
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,972
That's because they don't want to stay.

333
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:42,915
What they trained for is not there. The job has been to feed the paper monster.

334
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,167
It is a concrete experience for many.

335
00:36:48,526 --> 00:36:54,025
In this situation, something is haunting.

336
00:36:54,032 --> 00:36:59,196
What is the reason when it is a ratio without intellectus?

337
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:02,760
That's exactly the reason the computer has.

338
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:08,650
Partly it is one and zeros - things either are or are not.

339
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:18,900
A computer is either or in the basic structure.

340
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:23,104
It fits well into manual thinking.

341
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,869
While a human being can think analogously in sliding scales.

342
00:37:30,175 --> 00:37:36,027
With a sensitivity to another side of the language.

343
00:37:36,027 --> 00:37:40,908
Imagine the poetic, which tries to be close to the concrete.

344
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,569
Computer logic has become an ideal.

345
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:53,902
People also have a ratio, because we have made the computers.

346
00:37:55,498 --> 00:38:03,415
Where we have feelings and values, we try to get rid of it.

347
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:11,256
We want to get rid of the human factor so that we only have the objective ratio.

348
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:20,879
Computer reason has become the metaphor for a proper way to be human.

349
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:29,489
This is one of the central issues in AI research.

350
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:35,298
Have you heard of the stamp collector?

351
00:38:38,828 --> 00:38:51,584
I have the best AI ever and I want the finest stamps.

352
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,225
I put in what is important: stamps.

353
00:38:55,225 --> 00:39:05,657
So it manages to solve problems much better than me as a human being can.

354
00:39:05,657 --> 00:39:10,727
In the end, I have the most valuable stamps in the world.

355
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:17,327
But the computer is not done, but starts gathering all the stamps.

356
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:23,577
Then it buys the paper industry and starts making stamps.

357
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:28,047
Finally, it starts to make pulp of my children.

358
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:35,808
The computer cannot see that what was important yesterday is not important today.

359
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:43,286
What is important? The computer has no judgment.

360
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:53,374
We try to make it more nuanced, so that the computer should be closer to reality.

361
00:39:54,684 --> 00:40:01,412
You can take this as a quick picture from Cusanus.

362
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:07,450
If reality is like this, then our concepts are always hearing.

363
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,843
The computer is also always based on hearing.

364
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:22,181
This allows the computer to come close but it remains a hearing.

365
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:30,269
Therefore, the rationality of the computer is never fully enough.

366
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:42,607
Human language is hearing, but the intellectus's competence is to be in contact with the round.

367
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:48,498
I think it is clear why the concrete is important.

368
00:40:48,498 --> 00:40:58,578
When we enter the concepts, it is easy to become pure fool production.

369
00:40:59,964 --> 00:41:07,635
This school's key words - the student at the center, respect, learning.

370
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:11,647
We throw out clichés, and so it will be no more.

371
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:20,495
Teachers talk about respect, but not about who should have respect for what.

372
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:25,231
It just becomes a word you hit each other in their heads.

373
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:32,234
Floskel production becomes our way when we do not understand the intellectus business.

374
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:55,306
In the skeptical thought apparatus, one should lift yourself from the contemporary ration that exists.

375
00:41:57,454 --> 00:42:04,240
If we know all the time, we can't see anything else.

376
00:42:04,379 --> 00:42:12,226
Allow yourself not to know to capture something new and let it meet our ration.

377
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:26,790
Of course, this is also the role of libraries.

378
00:42:27,617 --> 00:42:40,109
We have the libraries as memory, but also as resources for citizens.

379
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:53,330
In a democracy, everyone must have access to intellectus practitioners.

380
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,637
This is where you capture what is important.

381
00:42:56,637 --> 00:43:02,632
Where are we going, and where do we come from? Who are we"?

382
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:12,610
If we do not have practices, we have no democracy.

383
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:25,840
If we think it is to submit alternatives in a ratio system, we have missed something.

384
00:43:26,298 --> 00:43:45,133
We must investigate and develop, and then the libraries must be understood as a base.

385
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:47,693
There I quit, otherwise I will not be able to get comments.

386
00:43:56,659 --> 00:44:02,535
I want comments, questions, protests.

387
00:44:03,781 --> 00:44:06,086
- Questions from the audience.

388
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:15,235
If you want to look at your picture and see the role of the library.

389
00:44:16,329 --> 00:44:24,306
Is the universe intellectus, the library Ratio, and "digitally first" the squares?

390
00:44:24,306 --> 00:44:31,093
-I think the library carries intellectus practitioners.

391
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:35,692
- The skeptic track must be found in Intellectus. - Absolutely.

392
00:44:35,692 --> 00:44:40,621
Being able to move in it.

393
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:50,181
The skeptic is the one who throws a new look at what is.

394
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:58,168
The step then is to redo what is, and that may not be the task of the skeptic.

395
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:01,862
- Everyone here has an important role in any case.

396
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:14,965
- Do you have any comment on the Library Act? Is it something you know?

397
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:29,323
The libraries should be responsible for opportunities, and there are expressions such as "cultural activities in general".

398
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:36,454
There are opportunities to link it to what you are talking about.

399
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:43,365
- A great comment. I have discovered that in several areas.

400
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:52,977
Often the legislation is good. It has an openness to this.

401
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:58,931
Pedantification has been done in recent decades, and the laws are older.

402
00:45:58,931 --> 00:46:07,288
Everything was not better before. What we see today is answers to problems that existed.

403
00:46:09,278 --> 00:46:15,675
When we catch up, can we ask "have we forgotten this?"

404
00:46:15,675 --> 00:46:21,172
What does this mean today, and what are we not fulfilling?

405
00:46:21,172 --> 00:46:28,943
If the libraries are depleted, we cannot carry out the core business.

406
00:46:30,137 --> 00:46:34,436
Often the law can be used today.

407
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:40,204
You have a mick on the entrance.

408
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:50,368
-In the libraries we fight with the ratio requirements.

409
00:46:51,147 --> 00:46:53,454
More and more of the business will be measured.

410
00:46:53,454 --> 00:47:02,320
It will be the language we can use to be respected.

411
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:15,489
We are an intellectus business, but that language has lower status.

412
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:32,056
That is why we reduce a lot to numbers, and it goes very fast.

413
00:47:33,138 --> 00:47:38,094
This was interesting and strengthening.

414
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,219
- I'm out talking a lot about this.

415
00:47:42,219 --> 00:48:04,980
What you said says the entire non -profit sector, including the church.

416
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:12,849
Save the Children has gone a long way in such an idea.

417
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:22,161
They discovered that they had made a manual for how to help in a certain way,

418
00:48:22,161 --> 00:48:25,825
And it sometimes worked and sometimes not.

419
00:48:25,825 --> 00:48:31,217
It was the same manual, and should get the same results.

420
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:42,202
In care, school and care you say the same thing.

421
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:57,463
There is no neglect for existential issues because they cannot be measured.

422
00:48:58,642 --> 00:49:05,990
What we should be able to measure is the well -defined.

423
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:19,797
Empathy, judgment, education are words that belong to the Intellectus activities.

424
00:49:19,797 --> 00:49:25,906
They cannot be measured if we do not find indicators.

425
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:37,412
It makes us distort the phenomenon, and start chasing what can be measured.

426
00:49:37,412 --> 00:49:43,036
We may miss the basic phenomenon altogether.

427
00:49:43,471 --> 00:49:55,072
It is pseudoscience. It is not rational.

428
00:50:01,526 --> 00:50:14,027
Catch the words that describe the core business, and think about how much you have to show.

429
00:50:14,027 --> 00:50:19,281
Today we have to show everything up and out.

430
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:24,705
Is it the most important task of the business?

431
00:50:24,705 --> 00:50:28,493
Or is the most important thing to do good core business?

432
00:50:30,272 --> 00:50:40,158
We spend resources showing off, and forgetting the quality work.

433
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:54,705
We will show that much of what is being done is not about increasing the quality of the floor.

434
00:50:54,705 --> 00:51:00,105
It's about showing off. It's something else.

435
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:06,740
Words like "ensure" I think we should dismay.

436
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:11,104
It's almost always a lie.

437
00:51:11,106 --> 00:51:18,627
At Södertörn, they said they would ensure that no abuse happens again.

438
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:25,188
How should you do then? Lock everyone in each room?

439
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:31,530
Many things cannot be ensured, and then it becomes spasmodic.

440
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:36,525
We will work qualitatively with such issues.

441
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:45,795
It will be like a safety hub. The measurement becomes a cutting -edge.

442
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:55,117
We can measure, and we will measure, but in a wise way.

443
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:05,206
- It made me think a lot about the steering document concept.

444
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:18,244
As soon as there is something measurable and sent down, we end up in the ratio thinking.

445
00:52:18,244 --> 00:52:24,311
Then there is no proximity to the reality for those who take it further.

446
00:52:25,729 --> 00:52:31,134
Perhaps the best steering document is a number of questions.

447
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:41,389
The philosophical aspect disappears, and we are not encouraged to have a philosophical concept.

448
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:46,520
- I agree, and have seen it so many times.

449
00:52:47,758 --> 00:52:52,712
At the Healthcare Association, they have provided that professional skill is important.

450
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:55,315
Then they mean judgment.

451
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:08,434
They tried to encourage an intellectus business, and we couldn't handle it.

452
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:13,549
We have grown this thinking as the only rational.

453
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:22,140
There is research that points to exactly the same movement in the Bologna process.

454
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:41,253
The Bologian documents are interesting, but at every step it becomes pedantified.

455
00:53:41,545 --> 00:53:48,870
It is the way of our time to believe that we can do it in a rational way.

456
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:55,876
We have lost respect for the concepts that existed, and are starting to look for indicators.

457
00:53:56,756 --> 00:54:05,570
Today, many people think about how we create environments for judgment.

458
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:16,601
These calls are located either at the fool production apparatus or the coffee apparatus.

459
00:54:17,276 --> 00:54:20,522
Those that happen at the coffee apparatus are most interesting.

460
00:54:21,547 --> 00:54:26,688
There you capture the shaky.

461
00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:30,832
The structure you describe we must become aware of.

462
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,348
Only then can we respond to it, because people are wiser than that.

463
00:54:36,658 --> 00:54:40,380
Computers are at a level very stupid.

464
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,414
We have to recycle what people can, and that is exactly this.

465
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:49,330
Without judged, we would not be able to live our lives.

466
00:54:50,218 --> 00:54:54,175
- Thanks so much. You should get a small memory.

467
00:54:54,175 --> 00:55:04,210
It is KB's own lla paper monster, which is found in all aspects.

468
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,786
- Thank you very much.
