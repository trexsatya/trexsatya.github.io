18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Don't start, you'll get lungcancer.

41
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm sorry but you can't be doing this.

42

(Takes his cigarette) Thanks!

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,360
Give me the rest as well, let's throw them away.

44
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,620
Give that to me.

45
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,900
I'm going to break it.

46
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,560
Why?

47
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
You shouldn't smoke.

48
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,220
Can't you be cool about it?

49
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,840
Absolutely not, we're cool that we don't let you smoke.

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Throw it away.

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Let's throw them at the same time.

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,340
1,2,3!

53
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,340

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,180
What?

55
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
It's easier if you inhale at the same time.

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Is it lit?

57
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,360
You need to suck on it, are you going to smoke or not?

58
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,580
Can you light my cigarette?

59
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Do you got a lighter?

60
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,780
You can light it.

61
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,780
Why do you want to give me a lighter?

62
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,180
You can borrow it.

63
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,920
But why..I'm a minor.

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Why do want to give a lighter to a minor?

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,960
Oh.

66
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
How old do you think I am?

67
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,040
I have no clue, don't got time for this.

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,260
Are you stressed?

69
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,760
Yeah.

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,260
How old do I look?

71
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,160
You saw the cigarette in my hand.

72
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Yeah, so?

73
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,500
You got a lighter for my cigarette?

74
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,780
Excuse me?

75
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
You got a lighter for my cigarette?

76
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,420
You kidding me?

77
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,420
Do you approach a police to ask for for a lighter?

78
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,140
Don't got one, ask somebody else.

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,660
I need to light my cigarette.

80
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,680
Actually you or me shouldn't smoke, but you get it anyway.

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,400
Thanks.

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
You got a lighter for my cigarette?

83
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,620
You going to smoke little man?

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,700
You going to smoke? Awesome!

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,020
Light it, if you want too.

86
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,780
Why did you give me a lighter?

87
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,640
Because, you shouldn't smoke.

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,880
I've been smoking since I was 11, it's hard to quit.

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,500
How does that stop me from smoking?

90
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,760
No..that doesen't make you quit, but..

91
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,140
If I was to be nice, I wouldn't let you smoke.

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,920
We're shooting a social experiment.

93
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
Oh, okay.

94
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
How old do you think I am?
