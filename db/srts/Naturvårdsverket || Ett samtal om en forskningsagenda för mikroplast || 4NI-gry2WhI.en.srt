00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:05.632
Welcome to a conversation about a research agenda with a focus on microplastics.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.960
As we have recently published on our website.

3
00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:12.288
We have put the link in the description during the film.

4
00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:15.616
It is interesting reading this research agenda.

5
00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:19.456
We want you to download it and that you take your content.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.088
And with me here today to tell you more about the research agenda so I have

7
00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:26.368
Åsa and Julia

8
00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:27.648
-—-—-

9
00:00:27.904 --> 00:00:29.440
Tell us a little more about what you work with

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.280
Yes my name is Julia Taylor

11
00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:35.072
And I work at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency

12
00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:39.424
With our national plastic coordination where I work mostly with

13
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.192
Microplastics

14
00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:47.616
And then I am Åsa and I also work within the national coordination where I coordinate the issue internally

15
00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:48.640
About microplastics

16
00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:51.968
And then I work some with environmental monitoring of microplastics.

17
00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:57.344
My name is Henrik Löwenhamn and I am a communicator at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.

18
00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.672
Yes but then we start with

19
00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:05.792
What is a research agenda for something and why is it needed in the microplastics area

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.424
We saw that in our work on developing instruments and action had

21
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.288
Large knowledge gaps in order to perform our work in a good way

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.408
And that's why we saw that a research agenda was needed as

23
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.760
Calls in the areas where we need more knowledge for

24
00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:26.528
Be able to

25
00:01:26.784 --> 00:01:30.112
Perform our work to better reduce emissions.

26
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:34.464
Do you have examples of areas or what could be for something

27
00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:41.632
Yes but we have we have divided the research agenda into different areas partly then

28
00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:46.240
Microplastics overall, what is needed.
 Which areas

29
00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:49.568
Or so ... we need

30
00:01:49.824 --> 00:01:52.896
Knowledge on an overall plane since then we also have

31
00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:59.808
Divided into the agenda after the largest sources.
 So it's road and tire wear

32
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.928
Littering that is treated rather overall

33
00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:06.464
Textile wash

34
00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:08.256
Artificial green

35
00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:12.352
Who is it to read this

36
00:02:12.608 --> 00:02:14.144
the research agenda, which do we want

37
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.424
Shall take it to

38
00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:20.800
But it is really everyone who works to develop knowledge

39
00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:22.080
So it can be

40
00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:25.920
Research funders, it can be scientists

41
00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:30.528
There may also be different product developers who work to

42
00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:34.368
Develop new products or improve existing products.

43
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.696
Åsa, how do we want it to

44
00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:40.000
be used in concrete terms

45
00:02:40.768 --> 00:02:44.096
But we want it to be used as an inspiration, we think.

46
00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:45.376
That it should like

47
00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.168
Point out the direction forward

48
00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:48.704
Where we see that this

49
00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:52.544
Here you need power -gathering efforts

50
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.312
-—-—-

51
00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:57.664
The microplast area is very wide so we have identified

52
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.272
The areas where we see this we need to prioritize the efforts in order to this way

53
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.624
When we make power collections together we can take big steps

54
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.160
In knowledge acquisition

55
00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:10.208
Instead of it happening

56
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.488
Slightly

57
00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:14.048
A little onto the pö that makes it difficult to

58
00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.376
Simply collect knowledge

59
00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:19.680
-—-—-

60
00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:24.800
What do we want as well as in the longer term what do we want it to lead to then, what do we want to

61
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:28.128
happen if several years or in even longer term

62
00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:33.504
Yes but it is just to get a better

63
00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:36.832
Knowledge ..., a better foundation

64
00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:42.976
For us that we can use when deciding on different instruments and measures

65
00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:49.632
And we know that there has been a lot of research in this area in recent times

66
00:03:49.888 --> 00:03:56.032
But just because it is a fairly new research area so it is

67
00:03:56.288 --> 00:03:58.080
Still quite large knowledge gaps

68
00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:02.432
As we are tamped with so when we are going to make our decisions

69
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.552
-—-—-

70
00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:08.832
If I

71
00:04:09.344 --> 00:04:10.368
Works with plastic

72
00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:13.696
But perhaps not just directly related to research

73
00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.232
What do I have to pick up in this research agenda

74
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.024
Why should I read it

75
00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:23.679
I think that if, for example, you work with product development or innovation

76
00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:24.703
At a plastic company

77
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:29.567
So it may well be good to read our agenda and see, but where are there

78
00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:36.479
deficiencies in products or what to say but what can you contribute to developing sustainable products

79
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.527
that makes that

80
00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:41.599
Microplastic emissions decrease

81
00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:44.671
It can be within a huge number of different areas

82
00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:47.999
As such as within the road and the tire industry

83
00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.815
There maybe there is the opportunity and we have

84
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:57.727
As we said with artificial turf for example where we see that there will be a lot of microplastics from both rubber

85
00:04:57.983 --> 00:04:59.007
granules and from itself

86
00:04:59.263 --> 00:05:00.287
Artificial grass

87
00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:02.847
There you might be able to find new methods to

88
00:05:03.103 --> 00:05:04.895
Make better durable

89
00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:06.175
Products

90
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:12.575
Yes exactly.
 It can be, for example, alternative materials for infill

91
00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:19.743
Or construct the artificial green and so that the beach does not release

92
00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:24.863
As much or if one then takes Åsa's example with the tire wear

93
00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:27.679
Thus tires that are worn less for example

94
00:05:29.727 --> 00:05:31.007
We have already talked about

95
00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:32.799
-—-—-

96
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:36.639
What do you know about the biggest sources.
 Who are them and

97
00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:39.455
Can you develop more about it

98
00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:41.759
what is it that

99
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:42.783
Spreads microplastics

100
00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:45.087
In nature

101
00:05:46.623 --> 00:05:52.767
Yes but we have worked a lot on mapping different sources we had two different government assignments where we have

102
00:05:53.023 --> 00:05:54.559
Looked at that.

103
00:05:54.815 --> 00:06:00.959
What we have seen is that it is very difficult to put an exact figure on how much is spread

104
00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.263
But the biggest sources

105
00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:07.615
It is littering, road and tire wear

106
00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:13.759
Synthetic textile fibers and artificial green and also to some extent pellets.

107
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:17.087
And different intentionally

108
00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:17.855
added microplastics in products.

109
00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.719
What do we know

110
00:06:22.975 --> 00:06:23.743
What happens later

111
00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.767
These

112
00:06:25.023 --> 00:06:25.535
the microplastics

113
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:31.167
So if it ends up in nature and waterways and maybe finally also the sea.

114
00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:33.727
How much do we know and what do we know about

115
00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:35.007
What is happening there

116
00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:37.823
But you know that it is after all

117
00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:39.359
Huge amounts that are released

118
00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:44.479
It is at least 150 million tonnes and that it

119
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.831
Increases by every year and plastic use has increased enormously

120
00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:50.367
So it is being built up

121
00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:53.951
In the seas and the breakdown of plastic occurs very slowly

122
00:06:54.719 --> 00:07:00.863
So even if we stop the supply of microplastics today or within a few years, the formation of microplastic articles will

123
00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:03.935
continue for a long time as there is already so much plastic outside

124
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:05.215
In our waters

125
00:07:05.727 --> 00:07:09.055
And we have a problem too in that we ...

126
00:07:09.823 --> 00:07:11.871
It is very difficult to clean away microplastics

127
00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:13.919
Once it is in the environment

128
00:07:14.943 --> 00:07:16.479
So we know that after all

129
00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:17.247
But then how

130
00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.015
Dangerous

131
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:22.367
Microplastics are for human health and for our nature

132
00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.671
There are still great knowledge gaps

133
00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:32.863
So there we still see the need to develop or expand our knowledge in that area so it needs more

134
00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.655
Research within that for

135
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:37.471
To get better knowledge really.

136
00:07:37.727 --> 00:07:38.239
-—-—-

137
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:39.519
But we know that

138
00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:40.543
Microplastics are spread

139
00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:44.383
And it remains in nature.

140
00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.479
And then it is and then the content of microplastics increases and then you can think

141
00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:51.551
They may not be at that level right now

142
00:07:52.063 --> 00:07:58.207
Some areas may be a health hazard directly without, but they can have a very effect on the ecosystem level, for example.

143
00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:00.511
They do not disappear ...

144
00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:01.279
No

145
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:07.167
There has been research that we said we have just finished

146
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:08.191
an effort.

147
00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:09.215
Can you tell me a little

148
00:08:09.727 --> 00:08:10.751
What happened there

149
00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:16.895
Yes exactly we have just finished a perennial microplastics

150
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:18.687
Research effort.
 Locking word.

151
00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:24.063
And there the researchers looked at

152
00:08:24.575 --> 00:08:30.719
Slightly different areas and it was partly about method development in order to be able to

153
00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:33.535
Using improved methods in environmental monitoring

154
00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:37.375
But it was also about nanoplasts

155
00:08:37.887 --> 00:08:44.031
Mapping different flows in urban environments

156
00:08:44.287 --> 00:08:47.615
And microplastics in freshwater

157
00:08:48.639 --> 00:08:52.991
And also just this with effects and health

158
00:08:53.247 --> 00:08:53.759
Health effects

159
00:08:57.087 --> 00:09:01.695
It is just completed and it was a performance conference in January

160
00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:06.559
If you want to see those presentations, we can link to them in the description here as well

161
00:09:08.351 --> 00:09:09.887
And those reports

162
00:09:10.143 --> 00:09:10.911
Will well come soon?

163
00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:15.775
They are now fully written by the researchers.

164
00:09:16.031 --> 00:09:19.871
So that they will soon be published on the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency's website.

165
00:09:23.455 --> 00:09:23.967
-—-—-

166
00:09:24.735 --> 00:09:26.271
And as we always do when we talk plastic on

167
00:09:26.527 --> 00:09:30.367
The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.
 I would like to remind you of the roadmap we have for a durable plastic use

168
00:09:30.623 --> 00:09:31.391
-—-—-

169
00:09:31.647 --> 00:09:33.695
It is a lot to find if you want to

170
00:09:34.463 --> 00:09:35.231
Help Sweden to

171
00:09:35.487 --> 00:09:37.023
Reach a durable plastic use

172
00:09:39.327 --> 00:09:40.095
And so I want to say that

173
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:42.655
Are you not already with the national plastic coordination

174
00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:44.191
Do you think I will

175
00:09:44.447 --> 00:09:44.959
Join

176
00:09:46.751 --> 00:09:51.359
There you can keep up to date on what happens in both microplastics and macro plastic and

177
00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:52.127
-—-—-

178
00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.431
And what happens at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency when it comes to plastic

179
00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:56.735
But also you already get on a lot of what is happening in

180
00:09:56.991 --> 00:09:58.015
Sweden

181
00:09:58.271 --> 00:09:58.783
And internationally.

182
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:05.695
Do I have something more to add to say that we send out these letters.

183
00:10:05.951 --> 00:10:10.047
There you can keep up to date through them and then we have a lot of information on the site

184
00:10:10.303 --> 00:10:13.887
And if you are in the coordination, you also get the chance to participate in

185
00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:16.703
working groups and reference groups if you are interested in it

186
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:22.335
Is there anything more you want to add about the research agenda more than I think

187
00:10:23.615 --> 00:10:25.919
Are you interested in plastic and above all microplastics

188
00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:27.455
So think one should read

189
00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:31.807
I as a layman

190
00:10:32.063 --> 00:10:33.599
As a communicator

191
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:34.879
Can take me it

192
00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.927
It is easy to read, it is easy to

193
00:10:37.183 --> 00:10:37.951
Understand

194
00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:41.279
Download and read

195
00:10:42.047 --> 00:10:44.351
Something more to add ,, Julia and Åsa

196
00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:47.935
No yes i agree with you that it is

197
00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:53.055
It is divided into different categories as well so that you can choose to go directly

198
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:54.079
In the area you are

199
00:10:54.335 --> 00:10:56.383
Interested in one can look at it at an overview

200
00:10:56.895 --> 00:10:59.455
Not read it in its entirety unless one wants to

201
00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:06.111
It's not a huge thickness either, it's really easy to do.

202
00:11:07.647 --> 00:11:09.183
If one has questions about

203
00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:11.231
the research agenda, it is ok to contact you then

204
00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.791
Yes of course

205
00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:15.071
Yes but what good

206
00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:17.375
Then I want to thank you

207
00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:18.911
To thank you for looking.

208
00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.447
And then you hear from you

209
00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:21.727
If you have any questions.

210
00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:23.007
Thanks

211
00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:24.031
Thanks
