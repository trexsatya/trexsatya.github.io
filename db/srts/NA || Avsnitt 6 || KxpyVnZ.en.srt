00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.640
In tonight's section of Ifs, the question of all culture in Sweden:

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.640
She's here, she's there, she's everywhere - Petrina Solange.

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.520
Flying Kurden from Lund, Alanbaloo.

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.800
The Persian humor cat from Husby, Melody Farshin.

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.680
Youtube juggling Momo Alikar.

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.360
Sweden's most fun Chinese, Evelyn Mok.
 Greek from Alby, Thanos Fotas.

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.520
The Greek from Rinkeby, Alexandra Pascalidou.

8
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.040
The champion's champion and Botkyrka's Finest, Michel Tornéus.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.880
The man with big A and even bigger B.

10
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.080
Up with our hands, because now we want to see Ahmed Berhan!

11
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.360
IFS is back.
 My name is Ahmed Berhan.
 Behind me we have Theresa ...

12
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.320
... Anton, and at orange color: Erika.

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.080
This competition goes like this: You choose one in the panel to talk to -

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.880
- You should decide whether the panelist is lying or not.

15
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.160
- We start closest to Therese.
 --Theresi-a!

16
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.280
--Theresia?
 -Oh really.
 So.

17
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.640
Suddenly it is important to pronounce people's names correctly.

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.440
-Exactly.
 - Pluden is important, Theresa.

19
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.280
--Theresia.
 --Theresia.
 Who do you choose?

20
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.520
- I am a little curious about Alanbaloo.
 --Alanbaloo.
 Najs.

21
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.680
- It is clear you are.
 -Alan ...

22
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.400
Baba Nu-El is Santa Claus, though in Arabic.
 Habibte.

23
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.840
But he gives no presents, he gives "Bengs".

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.600
- He gives no presents, but money?
 - Bengs.

25
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.280
-Exactly.
 Santa Claus in the Middle East.
 - That comes with Bengar.

26
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.720
Theresia, she learns quickly.

27
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.320
-No.
 - The plot does not pass the Middle East?

28
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.040
No, it is unlikely.

29
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.640
She just: "He can't leave the wagon anywhere. They will turn the reindeer."

30
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.160
You say it's false.
 You choose not to trust Alan.

31
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.840
Unfortunately, Theresia, no Christmas present for you.
 It's true.

32
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.760
-Baba Nu-El is Santa Claus in Arabic.
 - I told you: Trust me.

33
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.360
Did you know that the real plot comes from Turkey?

34
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.360
-Please!
 -Please!

35
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.720
- It's Thanos cousin.
 - The germs react at once.

36
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.760
-What?
 Saint Nikolaus was Greek?
 - He was Greek.
 Bravo.

37
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.920
Alexandra, give them a history lesson.

38
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.280
Nikolaus gave gifts to the poor, no one else received gifts.

39
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.600
- So working class plot?
 -Yes exactly.

40
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.800
- Type Robin Hood.
 - Long before Robin Hood.

41
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.960
Robin Hood has been spinning from the Greeks.

42
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.400
- Plice everything is from Greece.
 -Thanks for the information.

43
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.840
Bravely tried.
 Better luck next time.

44
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.120
Anton, I'm curious ...

45
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.880
I heard that you were looking for Idol 2020 as a fun thing.
 How far did you get?

46
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.640
- No one.
 I had to turn in the door.
 - In IFS you are always welcome.

47
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800
Fun to have you here.
 Who in the panel?

48
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.680
Yes, there should probably be no other than Evelyn.

49
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.000
-Hello Anton.
 - We should run a picture question.

50
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.960
Based on self -confidence, jewelry and women:

51
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.880
Sweden's first gangsta rapper.

52
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.040
No, but Anton ... this is actually -

53
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.080
- Nordic adopted person, simply.

54
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.040
Okay.
 It could be.
 Absolutely.

55
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.680
Looked a bit like a record cover from Kanye West, maybe.

56
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.240
No, I don't think it's true.

57
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.760
- You choose not to trust Evelyn.
 -Unfortunately.

58
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.160
It is not unfortunately, because it just gave you a point.
 Congratulations, Anton!

59
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.800
It's false.
 The painting represents the first Chinese in Sweden.

60
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.960
-Choi A-FUK.
 - It's a real name.

61
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.160
He came in the 18th century.
 He spoke Swedish on a peculiar ...

62
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.400
He came in the 18th century and they have the stomach to complain in his Swedish?!

63
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.720
- There wasn't SFI then, exactly.
 - But we saw the same picture?

64
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.800
-Yes.
 - I thought he looked black.

65
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.480
There are blacks in China.
 I should not come up with race biology.

66
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.680
- I thought you cut Petrina.
 - I thought so too.

67
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.480
Petrina: "When did they take that picture of me?"

68
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.240
- Erik, time for you to shine.
 --Let's go!

69
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.680
- Good energy.
 Who do you choose?
 - I want to choose Petrina.

70
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.760
Because it's gay.

71
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.440
You can give her points right away.

72
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.840
Walla, I'll check if I have ...

73
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.240
This is because the Prophet Muhammad thinks that one should not be blamed.

74
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.440
Do not wear silk, gold and stuff.

75
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.280
So it's like a Muslim variant of the Jantelagen, type.

76
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.560
Spontaneously it sounds reasonable.

77
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.720
Otherwise, I don't know what the reason would be.

78
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.360
- Because it's gay.
 - But the best things are gay.

79
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.520
Yes ... no, I think it's true.

80
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.800
-It's true?
 Congratulations, Erika.
 True.
 -Yes!

81
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.240
The Prophet should have said that men who are dressed in silk lack character -

82
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.560
–And you should not flase wealth.
 No gold, no silk.

83
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.040
Therefore, Mom calls me her third daughter.

84
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.040
--Theresia, I believe in you.
 -Good.
 I think Thanos.

85
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200
Thanos ...

86
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.880
It means...

87
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.600
–... masturber.
 -Yes.

88
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.120
Runkare.
 Jerk Off.
 Otuz Bir in Turkish.

89
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.440
No, it's bullshit.
 One hundred percent.

90
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.600
- You don't think so?
 -No.
 I know what that means.

91
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.640
- You know what that means?
 - Yeah!

92
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.880
I have a mechanic who is Greek, and he says Malaka all the time.

93
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.240
Malaka ...

94
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.280
Theresia ... seriously ...

95
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.880
You should have trusted Thanos.
 Change mechanics, because it is true.

96
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.880
Are you kidding?

97
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.120
Malaka is Greek hose for jerks, Wankare.
 Dear action has many names.

98
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.640
"Idiot" is what he has told me.

99
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.920
It is a word that has it ... thus, the academic translation ...

100
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.240
- Pascalidou.
 - Let the Greek that can answer.

101
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.840
Everything Thanos says is true.
 Idiot is a Greek word.
 But Malakas is -

102
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.080
- A antique Greek word used about everything and everyone, for all jerks.

103
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.280
-Sick.
 --Thanos, are you a malca?

104
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.120
If I'm a malca?
 Eh ...

105
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.760
I have the same answer as my friends when asked if they are Muslims:

106
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.120
I identify as Malaka, but I'm not practicing.

107
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.400
Unfortunately, no points this time.

108
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.360
- Anton, who do you choose?
 -Michel.

109
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.600
In 1975, Sweden defeated Chile in tennis during the Davis Cup in Båstad.

110
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.840
The Chilean stuck with the Swedish wife.

111
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.960
No, the Chilean cod and became a shit.

112
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.240
He threw the racket on the judge and pissed on the pitch.
 Temperament.

113
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.440
Terribly stupid to choose the sports guy when I can't do anything about sports.

114
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.800
But it sounds reasonable.
 I had done it too.

115
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.000
Was that so you left Idol?
 "Fuck you!"
 KSSS ....

116
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.400
- You think it's true?
 -Yes.

117
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.840
- It's false.
 There will be no point.
 - Skit too.

118
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.480
The reason why the match has been remembered is that about 6,000 protesters-

119
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.360
- Tried to stop the match to mark against Chile's military dictatorship.

120
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.320
- Chileans - everything becomes political.
 - Viva La Revolución!

121
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.520
Hoola Bandoola Band made a song called Stop the match.

122
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.720
- So, in Swedish?
 - Hoola Bandoola is a Swedish band.

123
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.880
Well!

124
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.920
Did they let go of the match song during the match?
 It was a little late.

125
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.960
Fat bad to play it when the match is over.

126
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.600
Unfortunately, Anton.
 No point.
 - Erika, now we drive.

127
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.160
Eh ... I'll take melody.

128
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.480
- Melody, you should get a picture question.
 -Okay.

129
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.640
If you see this can of a family with a foreign background ...

130
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.120
Secrets about how to Islamize Sweden.

131
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.400
- In Knew it.
 -No.
 Honestly...

132
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.600
Our parents are the most unconscious environmentally friendly citizens.

133
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.800
They refuse to throw something that can be reused.

134
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:30.280
They wash out of freezer bags.
 Turkish yogurt can-your new food box.

135
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.280
Danish cookies will then be your forever and ever syllabus.

136
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.480
Yes exactly!

137
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.960
It is standard in any grandmother or grandmother too, so ...

138
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.080
I thought spontaneously when I saw it: "Ah, sewing things."

139
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.560
So I hope it's the same for everyone.
 I think that's true.

140
00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.200
You think it's true.
 Absolutely right, Erika.
 You got one more point.

141
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.680
The Danish Cookie can is unofficial sewing can in many immigrant homes.

142
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:13.040
Theresia, this is the third round.
 Your last chance to try to get points.

143
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.400
I believe in you.
 Forget your mechanic.
 We solve this together.

144
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.760
And this is not my jerk hand.

145
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.200
- Who do you choose to talk to?
 - Momo.

146
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.440
YES!
 I didn't want to say that before, but Theresia makes me embarrassed.

147
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.120
She is very beautiful.
 It gets a little ...

148
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.760
Theresia should move to Hjulsta?

149
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.680
-Warm welcome!
 - A video question.

150
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.640
An order for 22 pizzas.
 Why did he think it was a joke?

151
00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.160
Because the Swedish Democrats received 22 % in the municipal elections -

152
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.320
–And they wanted 22 pizzas to celebrate their blah-blad-blah success.

153
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.840
You produced your Swedish Swedish to talk about SD.

154
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
-I had to.
 -What are you saying?

155
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.560
22 % did they convert to 22 pizzas?

156
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.800
SD wanted to celebrate with pizza.
 Yes or no?

157
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.080
I'm in that.
 Absolutely.
 What good that you talk very ...

158
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.480
- I talk a little fast.
 - Very Swedish too.

159
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.200
Okay.
 I have said falsely twice, so I say false again.

160
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.240
Third time lucky.
 I say false again.

161
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.440
- Congratulations, you get your first point!
 - Tank you!

162
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.720
It's false.

163
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.080
The clip was from 2021 when there was a hostage frame at the Hällbyanstalten.

164
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.280
The perpetrators first demanded a helicopter and a lot of money.

165
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.920
However, the ransom was negotiated down to 20 pizzas.
 - Anton, your turn.

166
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.280
Yes.
 Alexandra.

167
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.200
Explosives.

168
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.520
No, honestly Andonis ... you also have a Greek name.

169
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.960
Thanos: Oh-hoo!

170
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.480
Congratulations.
 It must carry very much luck.

171
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.720
"Anton comes from Greek Andonis."

172
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.320
It's not my fault.
 But back to Alfred Nobel and Rinkeby.

173
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.640
It is quite obvious.
 No one may have missed that the last 30 years -

174
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.240
–Have Nobel Laureate Welling to Rinkeby -

175
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.800
- To meet students at Rinkeby Library.

176
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.560
I don't know how many Nobel award winners I met these 30 years.

177
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.840
Maybe 29 or something like that.
 So that's the reason.

178
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.240
Yes ... I have no idea about this, but ...

179
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.080
Yes, it feels like they need some literature, huh.

180
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.760
Do you say that to a writer from Rinkeby?!
 Here we have another!

181
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.240
Momo, forward with the hand grenade.

182
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.160
I am not afraid of the sixth member of the Babblarna, so it is quiet.

183
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.280
What happens?

184
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.960
--Andonis ... —si, yeah ...

185
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.720
What are you saying?
 Is it Alexandra said true or false?

186
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.080
- It is clear that it is true.
 - You think it's true.
 In order to?

187
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.280
Because it feels good.

188
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.400
Heavy you are, Anton.
 Congratulations, you got a point!

189
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.120
True.
 The Nobel Laureates in Literature visit Rinkeby Library.

190
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.680
They get a booklet with the children's impression of their work.

191
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:06.240
Theresia, you got a point, but unfortunately you will not go to the next round.

192
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.560
Erika, you have a question left, but as you can see, all panelists consumed -

193
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.000
- What means that your last panelist will be ...

194
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.760
Thanos, what is a shishko?

195
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:37.320
A Shishko is what suburban men become when they get married and have children.

196
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.120
It's a thick.

197
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.880
- A thick?
 -Yes?

198
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.200
- you eat a lot of shish kebab, so ... - you become a shisko.

199
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.520
It's not an expression I've heard before, so I just get free.
 Eh ...

200
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.240
I think that's true.
 It would have been fun if it was true.

201
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.440
It would have been fun.
 You know what?
 Always bet on the fun.

202
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.040
It just gave you one more point.
 You got a full pot!

203
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.880
Shishko is a hose for thick and comes from Turkish.

204
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.320
Theresia, thank you for joining.
 Your trip ends here.
 A large applause.

205
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.520
And a large applause to our finalists Anton and Erika.

206
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:30.040
In the final round it goes like this: it is about -

207
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:36.600
- To come first to five points.
 The score goes over if you answer wrong.

208
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.600
Erika, you start.
 Who do you want to talk to?

209
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.600
I like Evelyn's dress, so I choose her.

210
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.480
Poland's national anthem has a unique connection to Sweden.
 How?

211
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.960
It praises the RUT deduction.

212
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.760
No, but this is how it is ... Poland is the only country in the world -

213
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.240
- As mentioned in Sweden in its national anthem.

214
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.520
They do that because they are still varnished that we invaded them -

215
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.800
- Type a hundred trillion years ago.
 So they eat it in the song.

216
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.360
It feels like they are getting revenge now, because now they are taking over our construction industry.

217
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.120
- The name, that is, that is the answer.
 -Okay.

218
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.440
It feels strange to bring another country in their national song

219
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:35.120
- So the question is whether they have it just to fuck.

220
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.400
- So we say it's true.
 - You say it's true ...

221
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:46.160
... that Poland has added a dissate to Sweden in its national anthem?

222
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.360
-Yes.
 - It's true, Erika.
 Congratulations!

223
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.400
It is the only country that mentions Sweden in the text.

224
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.440
Sweden does not even mention Sweden in its national anthem.

225
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.920
But it is a dissent for a conflict for a long time.
 "We remember."

226
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.680
- Anton.
 - We run Thanos.

227
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.400
–OKay, Frank.
 Let's do this.
 –Thanos ...

228
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.120
If you have Thai parents, what do you learn early on your feet?

229
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.400
You will learn that.
 You can do happy ending with them.

230
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.440
You who have got Thai massage know that they use your feet in massage.

231
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:39.240
They learn that their feet can be a tool for healing people.

232
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.480
Okay...

233
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:47.800
- A tool for making money?
 - No, to heal other people!

234
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.800
- Like other people?
 Okay.
 - Thai massage, they ...

235
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.480
-No.
 -Okay.
 You need!

236
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.840
I know.

237
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.800
- Cok tense.
 - I have never heard of that.

238
00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.160
It may well be true, but we drive on false.

239
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.480
You drive that it is false.
 Awesome work, Anton, you got a point!

240
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.560
It's false.
 They learn to the underside of the feet -

241
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.120
- Is a dirty body part and it is ugly to show the soles of the feet to others.

242
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.480
- It will be happy ending for Andonis.
 - Should you give it?

243
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.800
Should I give it?
 No, I'm not very good at Thai massage.

244
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.800
It's my job.

245
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.160
- ERIKA.
 –Mm ...

246
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.760
- I choose Michel.
 - Michel ...

247
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.240
Iranians do it because it is the best way to get rid of body hair.

248
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.440
No, the body cleanses from everything bad that has been during the year.

249
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.840
You skip, and then you become reborn.
 New Year.

250
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.880
I'm saying true, I'm pretty sure I've heard it.

251
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.240
- And that sounds good.
 - That's why you skip fires?

252
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:28.400
- I could have done it.
 Absolutely.
 -You know what?

253
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.120
Congratulations, one more point, Erika!

254
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.600
It's true.
 And the fire party usually takes place the day before the spring equinox.

255
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:43.040
Several cultures celebrate Nouruz in different ways: Persians, Kurds, Afghans and others.

256
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.840
Listen...

257
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.120
We might be an elite jump ...

258
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.880
... but we jump in high heels.

259
00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.920
Michel, Melody actually has SM records in long jump in high heels.

260
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.560
Anton, should we see if you manage to level out the scoreboard?

261
00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.640
- We choose Petrina, I think.
 - A picture question.

262
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.000
What the fuck?

263
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.760
This means that you text with the king.

264
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.360
No, there are different countries' crisis codes.

265
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:31.320
Depending on where you are, the crisis code is different.
 There are three different countries.

266
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.800
The first thought was that there are different ways of laughing, in different languages.

267
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.200
It can be really tacted.
 I don't think it's crisis codes.

268
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.440
You say it's false.
 Congratulations, Anton, you got one more point.

269
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:54.240
You not only got one more point, now the fucking nailed the answer.

270
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.800
It is how to laugh online in different languages.
 Arabic: h-h-h-h!

271
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:05.200
Portuguese: K-K-K-K!
 And Ukraine and Russia: r-r-r-r-r!

272
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.360
Why am I not surprised-

273
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.440
- The Russian laugh sounds like an automatic weapon.
 Rada-rat ...!

274
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:23.360
Ukraine has changed laughter now.
 They don't drive in the Russian anymore.

275
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.240
- What have they switched to?
 - Brrrr!

276
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.440
- They don't want Russian laughter.
 - Yes, we understood that.

277
00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.640
Welcome to "Two Greeks and one conversation".

278
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.760
Wait, a dialogue.

279
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.960
Dialogue comes from Greek's Diálogos.

280
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.480
You get to compensate for every time you got to play Turk.
 Now the Greek arrived.

281
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.120
Anton, you smooth out the point.
 - Erika, can you take back the lead?

282
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.800
I take Alexandra.

283
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.800
If Syrians say "I'm going to my girl and drinking coffee", what do they mean?

284
00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.480
So this ... It's a code word if you are gay.

285
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.760
Because homosexuality is so incredibly charged in some cultures -

286
00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.000
- So they have code words.

287
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.120
Then they say: "I'll be home to my girl and drink coffee."

288
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.800
If you are gay, you understand what will happen there.

289
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.560
But if you are straight-

290
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.760
- So you think they should go to their girl and drink coffee.

291
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.000
They say, "I'm going home to my girl and drinking coffee."

292
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.960
"No, I'm going home to my girl. What? Don't you think I have a girl?"

293
00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.720
Erika ...

294
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:58.040
A good code word.
 And cute.
 I want it to be true, but say false.

295
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.200
You want it to be true, but choose falsely.

296
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.440
You are doing absolutely right.
 Congratulations, you've got one more point.

297
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.960
It is not code for homosexuality.

298
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.240
This means the guy's family goes to the girl's family -

299
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.200
- To ask about the daughter's hand.

300
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.200
- We continue with you, Anton.
 - We run on Momo now.

301
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.600
Momo ... FB may be abbreviation for Facebook -

302
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.800
- But what does the abbreviation FB mean in the resort?

303
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.360
Okay ... FB is feminine ...

304
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.240
... and KB is masculine.

305
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:43.240
You describe people as a pussy carrier and cock carrier -

306
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.920
- But don't want to say it, because it is ugly to say so.

307
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.880
For example, FB here.

308
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.120
And here's my KB.

309
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.320
–My fucking kb.
 -Exactly.

310
00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.800
- What do you say, Anton?
 - You feel very credible.

311
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.160
But you feel too credible, so I think it's a spectacle.

312
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.640
You say it's false.
 This means you got one more point.

313
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.160
FB, as we all here in the audience hear for the first time -

314
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:26.160
- Detects insurance fraud.
 A very dishonest and illegal act.

315
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.000
Like water injury their computer to get a new one.

316
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.160
- ERIKA.
 -Yes.
 I choose Catlady Melody.

317
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.840
Melody, at an Indian wedding, the bride is probably painted with henna.

318
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.520
-Why?
 - It's like a written contract.

319
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.720
There you promise to never sell your sari-

320
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:53.800
- To a white woman who is going to a Halloween party.
 Never ever.

321
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:59.680
No, quite frankly ... It is so that the bridal couple stay apart -

322
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.520
- Including the wedding night.
 Henna has a strong scent - a fantastic cockblock.

323
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.360
Mm ... no.
 I'm pretty sure I've seen a program om-

324
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.400
- That it should be some kind of story.

325
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.120
- You don't trust a Fellow Catlady?
 -Unfortunately.

326
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:26.320
You did that right in, Erika.
 It's false.
 You got one more point.

327
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.360
Henna, a.k.a.
 Halal Tattoos, given to the bride -

328
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.680
- As a sign of good health and happiness.

329
00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.080
- Do you mark what it says?
 - I see what happens.

330
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.400
Everything is at stake.
 If you answer wrong, you don't just lose the round ...

331
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.560
--... without the whole game show.
 - Jajemans.

332
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.520
-Here we go.
 -Here we go.
 Dad Baloo.

333
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:56.080
Alan, the word Aina who is a slang for police comes from Turkish Aynasiz.

334
00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.240
-What does it mean?
 - It means pig with a gun.

335
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.120
In Turkey, they give their pigs guns at a very young age.

336
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.880
Skåne: No, I'm just kidding.

337
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.960
The name, Aynasiz itself means "without a mirror" -

338
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.480
- For the police cars before in Turkey only had a side mirror.

339
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.680
One on the left side, no one on the right.

340
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.200
It is meant that the police cannot see themselves in the mirror.

341
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.520
I do not believe that.
 That sounds stupid.

342
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.800
It's Turkey.

343
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.040
Anton, you say it's false.

344
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.240
Aynasiz means "without mirror" in Turkish.

345
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.560
The term refers to the fact that police officers cannot see themselves in the mirror.

346
00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.720
It's true.
 The point goes to Erika.

347
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.720
Erika, you have won not just one point, but the whole game!

348
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.160
Congratulations, Erika.

349
00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.000
-Here you have received an IFS diploma.
 - TACKS.

350
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.920
-A nice stop match-t-shirt.
 -Thanks so much.

351
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.400
A warm applause for the winner, our competitors, the fantastic panel -

352
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:14.760
- Our wonderful audience.
 To all of you at home, see you again soon.

353
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.520
