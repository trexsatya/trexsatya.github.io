Hello all viewers

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,980
Tonight I just want to give a simple tip or suggestion

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,060
It's Monday night

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,700
So it's a whole week left

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,420
And the most important thing in order to get forward with the language

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,960
is to work out every day

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,960
It is also called continuity

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,140
continuity. I can write it in the description

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,360
Continuity is something you do all the time, keeps doing

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,620
and the most important thing to move forward with the language is that you

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01.440
have continuity and you exercise every day

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,700
So my suggestion is to tonight or tomorrow

13
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,960
So do a little planning for your language training

14
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,900
If you haven't already done so

15
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,360
In a calendar or just make a small list or something

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,460
Decide a few different things to do to train Swedish and ...

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,240
Write about when to do it

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,660
You can plan a lot if you have a lot of time or you can plan a little if you do much else

19
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,920
but it is very good to have decided some

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:56,020
Some moments a week when you know that you, or have decided that you should train Swedish

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,020
or any other language

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,400
But I think if you look at this channel then it's probably Swedish you train

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,140
so

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
It is my suggestion simply

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,400
Decide some times when you are going to work out and ...

26
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:19,840
and promise yourself that these moments, then it is Swedish that applies

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,420
Then I will read, or listen or look at something

28
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,400
so will you get some more continuity

29
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,520
a little more, that you work every day

30
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,960
And your Swedish will be better

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,900
I can almost promise that

32
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,180
and I think about it is something I say that you don't understand

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,220
so please feel free to ask in a comment so I can explain

34
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56.560
If I talk quickly for example

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,280
and if you want to tell me what you are planning

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,000
Or how you plan to train Swedish today so you can also write it in a comment

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,500
It can be interesting for both me and others to read

38
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,520
So we'll see you again soon. Have a good one. Bye.
