00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.480

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.160

Wishing everyone's friend

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.140

15
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.740
Aaaa, it was to you

16
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.120
Yes, it was huge and crisp to get here

17
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.520
How is it going

18
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.160
Thanks so much

19
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.800
Open Open Open

20
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.880
Oops, here were a lot of things

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.980
Look at this

22
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.260
Yeah

23
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.700
Yes, now I understand what everyone's friend has thought that we should do that we should do

24
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.260
Do you understand I do not understand

25
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.980
Neither do I

26
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.000
Nose here stands like this ...

27
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.540
Well, you just do as I say then it will be fine

28
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.380
Okay...

29
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.840
This is joseph

30
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.640
He is engaged to Mary

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.180
She is expecting children

32
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.500
One day Joseph was told he had to travel

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.540
from the city of Nazareth, where they now lived

34
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.560
to the city of Bethlehem, to tax

35
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.540
This was something that everyone at this time must do

36
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.560
They traveled all the way to Bethlehem

37
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.780
Mary was allowed to ride on a donkey

38
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.120
When they arrived, they searched a place to sleep on

39
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.360
They knocked on at several shelters

40
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.240
So type hotel

41
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.400
But everything was full

42
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.440
So they got to sleep instead in a stable

43
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.020
There Mary gave birth to his son, Jesus

44
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.180
At the same time on a meadow near the stable

45
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.440
were there any shepherds guarding their sheep

46
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.680
Then mittyjall, the whole sky was lit up in a strong glow and they became scared

47
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.080
An angel said:

48
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.020
Tadaa

49
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.980
Don't be afraid, I come with super good news to you

50
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.860
and to the whole world

51
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.080
Tonight the God's own Son has been born

52
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300
He is your rescuer, Messiah

53
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.020
And he lies wrapped in a crib

54
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.600
and, yes, you will find him there

55
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.360
Glory be God in height and peace on the whole earth, Jo

56
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.020
The shepherds wandered to the stable and praised the newborn Jesus

57
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.120
In another country there were some star interpreters

58
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.740
Some show men simply

59
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.760
They had discovered a new big star in the sky

60
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.500
and they knew it meant that a new king had been born

61
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.140
They went away, followed the star

62
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.340
and came on the way to King Herod

63
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.800
They asked him if he knew where the newborn king was

64
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.480
He got angry

65
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.960
because there would be no other king than he

66
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.380
He secretly planned to kill the new king

67
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.040
and told the wise men:

68
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.580
"When you found the king, then come and tell me that

69
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.600
so that I can also pay tribute to him ”

70
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.240
The wise men nodded

71
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.040
and continued to look for the new king

72
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.980
They finally found the stable and gave presents to Jesus

73
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.400
They gave gold, incense and myrrh

74
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.700
In this way was born and celebrated Jesus

75
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.760
And that is why we celebrate Christmas

76
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.080
In short, it's Jesus' birthday

77
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.260
But what happened to herod then

78
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.340
Well, an angel said to the wise men

79
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.920
Not to tell Herod

80
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.020
So he never found Jesus

81
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.180
Okay

82
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.680
Well then it was clear!

83
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.020
Like that, now we have got our memories refreshed

84
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.200
about why we celebrate Christmas

85
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.540
Good work

86
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.640
And merry christmas all viewers

87
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.580
Merry Christmas

88
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960
Jooo
