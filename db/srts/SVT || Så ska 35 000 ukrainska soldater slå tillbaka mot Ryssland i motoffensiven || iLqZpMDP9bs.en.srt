1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Several Russian oil depots have been knocked out by Ukrainian drones.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,280
In Bachmut, Ukraine accuses Russia of using phosphorus bombs.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,720
And 35,000 Ukrainian soldiers are ready to attack.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,120
When will the counter -offensive come?

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,120
The war this week - about the latest news development in the Ukraine war.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,440
Russia has carried out a series of attacks against civilian goals around Ukraine.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,880
In Odessa, in Chenerson, in Charkiv and here in the capital Kiev-

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,960
- If several houses have been razed and civilians injured after drone attacks.

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,240
Oscar Jonsson, you are a doctor in Russian warfare.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,200
Why does Russia go on these civilian goals?

11
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,200
Russia has since October had a strategy to bomb civil targets -

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59.720
–And civil critical infrastructure. It fulfills several purposes.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,160
One is to make life miserable, one is to terrorize them so that they can give up.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,000
It also sets a military dilemma.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,400
Ukraine can either protect the most important big cities -

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,600
- Or the front line, which will be extra important for the counter -offensive.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,800
We have heard that Kiev has good air defense - yet the drones manage to get through.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27.560
How to explain it?

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,400
An air defense is never 100 percent, but consists of different systems-

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,400
- From short-range to medium and very long-range.

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,360
The Russian robotic attacks are often a mix.

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,720
First it can be exercise robots without explosive charge -

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,680
- Or drones, to saturate the air defense systems.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,400
Then you strike with cruise robots with the explosive effect.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,960
An air defense is never 100 percent. And the drones that cost 200,000-

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,120
- Don't want to knock out with air defense robots for two million.

27
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05.080
Even Ukraine has performed a number of drone attacks -

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,480
- Especially against oil depots, including here at Russian -cooked crime-

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,080
- But here too, here and here.

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,720
Why is Ukraine on oil depots in this area?

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,280
These are those closest to the shooting range.

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,640
Oil depots are important goals. The armed forces depend on fuel-

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30.560
- In particular, when the counter -offensive starts -

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,120
–And Ukraine quickly trying to break through some of the Russian lines -

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,840
- And Russia must move its associations to meet the counter -offensive.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,840
If you have a lack of fuel, their ability to respond.

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,360
We have also heard about sabotage against the railway -

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,480
-Here in the Brjansk region north of Ukraine.

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,120
How important is the railway for the Russian military?

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,120
The railway is very important, a supporting part of all Russian military logistics.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,520
Assessments before the war from the total defense research institute SA -

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,160
- That Russia can carry out offensive operations the railway plus 30 miles.

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,640
This is about where the invasion ended after the first few weeks.

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Then you had logistical problems.

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,160
We move on to Bachmut, where fierce battles have been going on for about nine months.

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,120
How is the situation there right now?

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,360
It is extremely tense. Russia continues to take a few blocks a day.

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,120
They have control over about 80 % of the city.

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,040
They try to get a pinch maneuver here-

50
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,320
–When you cut off the Ukrainian livelihood to the city -

51
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,960
- And force the Ukrainian forces to retreat before being completely surrounded.

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,840
- For these roads are vital? -Exactly.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,760
And there Ukraine this morning conducted a counter -offensive against this road -

54
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,720
- Where you try to interfere with Russia's plan to cut off Bachmut.

55
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,120
- How important is the advance? - It's important.

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,080
If you can disturb the pound maneuver, one can maintain the livelihood of the city -

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,760
- What makes the defense of the city much stronger.

58
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,800
In focus this week is phosphorus bombs.

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,600
Russia is accused of using such in Bachmut.

60
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,240
These pictures are said to show just that, according to Ukraine.

61
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,760
We pause there. How can we be sure that this is a phosphorus?

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,960
It's hard to know in this event -

63
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,600
- But there is some form of fire combat, termite, e.g.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,760
It is extremely warm fragments. It gives the fireworks -like effects.

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,680
They have the ability to burn through even buildings-

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01.560
–And causes very severe burns to humans.

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05.040
It is war crime to use such indiscriminately.

68
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,760
Why does Russia use this type of bombs?

69
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,200
It's a way to beat over a fairly large territory -

70
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,480
- When the Ukrainian defenders are in the city of Bachmut where they are fortified.

71
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,200
You do not know exactly where they are.

72
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,880
But you can use such to knock out people in buildings.

73
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,040
Over 1,500 armored vehicles and 230 tanks

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,080
has been delivered to Ukraine's counter -offensive.

75
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,800
According to the Financial Times, 35,000 Ukrainian soldiers are ready to attack.

76
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,200
If we take the Russian -cooked area - what could a counter -offensive look like?

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,400
The most important thing about a counter -offensive is that it also generates a political victory -

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57.560
- As the Russian leadership in Moscow affects.

79
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,160
What could really do it is an attack in this part -

80
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07.640
– There Ukraine would attack towards Melitopol -

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,200
–To cut off the railway connection in particular down towards the Crimea -

82
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,720
- As you depend on for logistics.

83
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,080
Russia, then, what does their line of defense look like?

84
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,880
Since October, Russia has actually dug several layers in stock -

85
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,880
–A of minefields, shooting boars and tanks -

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,480
- To make the Ukrainian offensive more difficult.

87
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,600
You may not stop it, but you buy time -

88
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,240
- For Russian reinforcements that may come where Ukraine breaks through.

89
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,520
Here it is also important to remember that the Ukrainian counter -offensive -

90
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
- Can be several counter -offensives who see where you break through.

91
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,840
If you break through in one direction you can continue there towards different goals.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,640
But most important is to break the supply that goes all the way to Crimea.

93
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,200
- The railway then? -Yes exactly.

94
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,720
When does the counter -offensive come, then?

95
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09.120
To some extent, it has almost already begun.

96
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,520
Ukraine has started some minor attacks.

97
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,200
Then maybe you can see that it really starts when the tanks come.

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,600
But in principle, the Ukrainian forces are ready.

99
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,120
The last clay will disappear within one to two weeks-

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,400
- And the conditions then be the best for this.

101
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,440
Thanks, Oscar Jonsson. We're back next week.
