1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Resist false rumors

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,640
Here you get five good advice!

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,240
Listen and read carefully

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,280
There is a great risk of misunderstanding

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,749
and make your own interpretations

6
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:14,040
If you do not read or listen carefully to what is said.

7
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:15,880
To just read headlines,

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,840
loose -made sentences and listen with half an ear

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,000
can make one misunderstand what is said

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,280
And then contribute to false information being disseminated.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,240
Ensure to double -check claims

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,440
that seems excessive or unlikely

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,400
with sources that can be trusted.

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,998
A reliable source is independent, factual, neutral

15
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:40,800
And can report where the information comes from.

16
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:44,080
An example of reliable sources is authorities.

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,800
We humans are more emotionally entitled than we think

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,160
and have a tendency to start from our feelings

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,080
Instead of facts when we value information.

20
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:58,880
"It feels like it's this way .."

21
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:03,040
We are extra vulnerable when something frightening occurs,

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,600
Fear makes us more uncritical.

23
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:09,120
We react instinctively and want to get into security

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,040
And do not think about critically reviewing the information.

25
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:16,520
No one is completely neutral.

26
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,640
We have all preconceived sentences

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,760
That affects us and our worldview.

28
00:01:20,986 --> 00:01:22,960
Confirmationbias, for example

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,200
They mean we have a tendency to look up information

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,440
Who confirms what we already believe and think.

31
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:32,600
And unconsciously chooses things that go against our beliefs.

32
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,191
It is important to constantly exercise

33
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:39,120
on having a critical approach

34
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,280
And constantly question what we see, hear and read.

35
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,600
Especially at dramatic events

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,480
Is it easy for rumors to start spreading.

37
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:49,520
Follow up the claims and find out the facts,

38
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,160
It is important not to be drawn and spread false rumors.
