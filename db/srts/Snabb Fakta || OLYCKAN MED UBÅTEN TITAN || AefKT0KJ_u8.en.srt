1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08.833
It was on Sunday 18 June

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:12,600
2023 approximately 740 kilometers off the island

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,133
Newfoundland in Canada as the submarine Titan,

4
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:21,083
Built by the company Oceangate began its descent into the sea.

5
00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:25,216
On board were five people and the goal was to dive down to the wreck

6
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:29,566
of Titanic, which is at 3800 meters depth.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,933
On board was Oceangate's founder

8
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:38,600
and CEO Stockton Rush, 61 years Shazada Dawood, 48 years,

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,116
A Pakistani British businessman and his son Suleman Dawood, 19 years,

10
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,750
Hamish Harding, 58 years, a British businessman, pilot and space tourist,

11
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:55.816
and Paul-Henri Nargeolet, 77 years, member of the French Institute for Marine Research

12
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:57.016
And director for

13
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:01,516
underwater research for E/M Group and RMS Titanic Inc.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04.800
He was on titanium as a guide.

15
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:10,166
The descent itself would take 2 hours, but after 1 hour and 45 minutes

16
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:15,300
Had been lost suddenly Titan all communication with the crew on the surface.

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,266
A few days later,

18
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:21,050
June 22, you could confirm that one found

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,866
wreckage from titanium near Titanic

20
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:28,883
And most likely all five people had on board.

21
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:31,016
Died.

22
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:34,316
The cause is believed to be an implosion.

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,100
What was Oceangate for companies?

24
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,966
How was the submarine Titan constructed and what risks were there?

25
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:48,916
What really happened and what is an implosion?

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,700
We will find out today.

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,616
Titan was built by the company Oceangate

28
00:01:55,616 --> 00:02:00.600
which was founded in 2009 by Stockton Rush and Guillermo SÃ¶hnlein.

29
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06.016
The company offers, among other things, diving tours down to the Titanic wreck.

30
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:09.866
Titan actually made his first diving down to Titanic in

31
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:13,583
July 2021 and a total of at least ten

32
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:17,100
Various diving between 2021 - 2022.

33
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,666
Each diving consisted of a pilot, a

34
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,850
Guide and then three paying guests.

35
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:28,816
The cost per person for a ticket was 250 \ H000 \ HDolls,

36
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:32,850
which corresponds to approximately SEK 2.5 \ hilmins.

37
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:36,316
The submarine itself

38
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:41,150
Titan was 6.7 meters long and 2.8 meters wide.

39
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,150
It weighed about 10.4 tons and

40
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,150
was made of carbon fiber and titanium.

41
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:50,600
It was equipped with four electric engines,

42
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:54,566
Two vertical and two horizontal.

43
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,000
These could steer the boat forward, backward,

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02.333
up and down and rotate it.

45
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05.850
The maximum speed was 3 knots,

46
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,850
which is about 5.5 km/h.

47
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:13,400
Oxygen to the entire crew would last for 96 hours if something

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,900
Would go wrong and it was built to cope with a depth of 4000 meters.

49
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:23,316
The pilot steered the entire submarine with a modified wireless game control.

50
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:26,183
A Logitech F710.

51
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:30,166
The boat was equipped with cameras externally that led to screens

52
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:34,350
Inside on board so that the pilot and crew could see the outside.

53
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:38,816
The submarine also had a window at the front that you could look from.

54
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:41,250
Because GPS

55
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,866
not working underwater so sent the crew on the surface

56
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:49.016
instead text messages down to titanium about their position

57
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:52,283
via a so -called ultra short baseline system.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,416
What risks were there then with such a scuba diving?

59
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00.533
To begin with, everything happened out on international water

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,166
Which meant that you did not have to have any special security rules.

61
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09.466
Titanium was not approved as seaworthy by any authority or organization

62
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:14,250
And all passengers on board must also sign an agreement

63
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:19,633
where you confirm that you are aware of all risks, that it is all an experiment

64
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:22,766
and that it can result in physical harm,

65
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,666
trauma or death.

66
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,666
The agreement briefly gives the Oceangate back free

67
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:31,633
If something would go wrong.

68
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:36,750
One of the founders, Stockton Rush told in an interview from 2021 to quote

69
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:41,950
I have violated some rules for building titanium, carbon fiber and titanium.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,950
There is a rule that you do not do that way, but I did.

71
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,533
End quote.

72
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:52.916
In 2018, David Lochridge wrote the then head of Oceangates

73
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:58,283
marine operations, a report in which he expressed his concern about titanium

74
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:02.033
He wanted the submarine to be inspected and be certified

75
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:05,450
by an authority, but Oceangate did not want it.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08.850
They refused to pay for such an inspection.

77
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,216
Another thing he expressed in his report was that the window that was on titanium.

78
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:17,716
was just certified and approved for a depth of 1300 meters,

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,150
About a third of the depth required to get down to Titanic.

80
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,900
Oceangate did not like Lochridge's statements so they sued him and kicked him.

81
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:29,700
Then we have to

82
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,866
Also talk about the choice of material for titanium,

83
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,566
Carbon fiber and titanium.

84
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:41,900
Carbon fiber is an extremely strong and lightweight material that is known for its high

85
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,516
tensile strength. Thus, the ability to withstand forces that pull the material apart.

86
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:52,283
However, it is not as strong when it comes to pressure strength

87
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,250
which is the ability to withstand the power that compresses the material.

88
00:05:56,783 --> 00:06:00.566
At extremely high pressure that one encounters down in the sea

89
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Can carbon fiber based structures crack.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,783
Titanic, on the other hand, is known for its high compressive strength,

91
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:13,216
Which makes it a good choice for vehicles that will dive far below the water.

92
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,116
But it is much heavier and more expensive than carbon fiber.

93
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:20,266
To combine titanium

94
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:23,416
and carbon fiber may seem like a good idea to take advantage

95
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,650
of both carbon fiber's ease and titanium compressive strength.

96
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,850
But at these extreme pressure down in the sea, the parts can

97
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:36,683
Two materials meet. When titanium and carbon fiber meet -

98
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,750
It can be a weak point.

99
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,616
If it is not carefully designed and constructed, this may lead to a disaster

100
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,550
And this is now we have to talk about water pressure.

101
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:55.016
Up at the surface, the pressure is what is called an atmosphere.

102
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:59,700
When you dive below the water surface, the pressure on the body increases

103
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:03,166
And this depends on the importance of all the water that lies above it.

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,350
For every tenth meter you dive down

105
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,350
so the pressure increases with an atmosphere,

106
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,166
so at 3800 meters depth is the pressure

107
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,616
380 times larger than at the sea surface.

108
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,816
This never can handle a human body because one would die

109
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:24,900
immediately and hence we need something that can protect us from the pressure,

110
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,883
For example, a submarine.

111
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:32,366
But then it is important that the submarine is designed to cope with the pressure.

112
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,400
At 3800 meters depth the pressure is so great that the submarine is pressed together

113
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,516
From all directions and edges with a force corresponding to about 10 \ H000 tonnes.

114
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:48,716
It's like having the weight of the Eiffel Tower pressing against the submarine,

115
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,583
But not just from above but from all directions.

116
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:57,200
Back to June 18, 2023.

117
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00.416
When the time is on its way down to Titanic

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,300
When 1 hour and 45 minutes had been lost Titan contact

119
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10.016
With the crew on the surface and now a fight against the clock began.

120
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:13,366
No one at this point knew what had happened.

121
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:16,733
Titana had the following security system on board.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,116
It was equipped with different sensors that senses how the hull

123
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:25,516
affected by the pressure when it dives further and further down, which would warn prematurely if

124
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:31,466
The hull was cracking and then you could interrupt diving and return to the surface.

125
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,516
It also had fire extinguishers and smoke machines

126
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:37,516
to everyone on board in the event of a possible electric fire.

127
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:41,850
It also had ascent aid in the form of an air balloon that could be inflated

128
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:45,083
And you could also manually release weights

129
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,083
to help the submarine return to the surface.

130
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:53.033
There was also a special material on the outside designed to be dissolved

131
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:59.033
In the salt water after 10 hours and release sandbags from the underside of the submarine,

132
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:02.366
which would help return to the surface.

133
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:06,683
So this system works even if all on board were unconscious

134
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:11,066
If time had received a power outage that cannot be remedied

135
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,666
So they knew that the crew had 96 hours of oxygen left.

136
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:19,883
But if the submarine has no power, it cannot be heated internally.

137
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,900
Water temperature outside which is around 1 to 4 degrees

138
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,716
Celsius would quickly cool down the submarine and probably

139
00:09:27,716 --> 00:09:32,716
everyone in the crew would die from the cold before the oxygen ended.

140
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:37,500
However, since found wreckage of titanium near Titanic

141
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,633
so is the most likely explanation that the pressure based on

142
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,400
Got the hull to crack and the entire submarine imploded.

143
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:53.066
And what is an implosion?

144
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:55,800
It is the opposite of an explosion.

145
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,366
An explosion means that energy is released outward,

146
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:03,750
which often results in a pressure wave and material being sent outwards.

147
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:07,133
An implosion occurs when the pressure from the outside

148
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:11,850
of an object exceeds the pressure inside, which gets the object

149
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,850
to quickly collapse inward.

150
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,516
Look at this clip where a

151
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,516
Implosion takes place with an oil tank.

152
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,516
Note how fast it went.

153
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:31,616
This is thus the pressure from the outside that compresses the thought, which has a vacuum inside.

154
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:35,216
And this is just the pressure from our atmosphere on the surface.

155
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:38,516
Thus, the pressure from only one atmosphere.

156
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:42,766
Implosion that happened for the crew inside the titanium

157
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,900
was exposed to 380 atmospheres.

158
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:49,366
So you can only imagine how fast it went.

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,400
They never even got to react to something happening,

160
00:10:54,616 --> 00:10:57,616
Which might be just as good.

161
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,416
It was a brief summary

162
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,900
by the company Oceangate. The accident with titanium ..

163
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:06,316
And the dangers down to the depths of the sea.
