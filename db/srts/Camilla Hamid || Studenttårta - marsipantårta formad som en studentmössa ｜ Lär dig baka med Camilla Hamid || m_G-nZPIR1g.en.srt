Hello

2
00:00:00.981 --> 00:00:04.160
Today I will show you how to bake a student cake

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:13.778
[Vignette]

4
00:00:14.684 --> 00:00:17.430
I have pulled so much to record this video

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.516
Because I really don't want to tread on any toes,

6
00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:21.790
On the contrary, just give inspiration, joy

7
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.000
and the feeling that one can treat yourself

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.578
A delicious student celebration anyway.

9
00:00:26.578 --> 00:00:28.438
But I still want to take the opportunity to complain,

10
00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:30.235
For all of you who take the student this year,

11
00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:33.166
But don't get the chance to celebrate the one you want.

12
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:37.247
So damn boring hopefully you can take it again soon.

13
00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:40.185
Anyway, I'm here today to show you

14
00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:42.513
How to bake your own student cake.

15
00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:46.792
No matter how to be celebrated, there is nothing that stops a

16
00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:49.443
from baking a really good cake

17
00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:52.306
and celebrate with their loved ones.

18
00:00:52.306 --> 00:00:55.883
The student cake I will show you how to bake today,

19
00:00:55.883 --> 00:00:58.521
will have the flavors of a white lady.

20
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.226
White Lady is a variant of princess cake

21
00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:04.266
consisting of vanilla cream, raspberry compote

22
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.944
And chocolate truffle of milk chocolate.
 How good?

23
00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:11.407
This cake will be formed and decorated,

24
00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:14.978
So it looks just like a student cap.

25
00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:16.575
Very fun, a little funny.

26
00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:19.605
Probably this video will be quite tall,

27
00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:23.015
But that's because I really want to show you step by step,

28
00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:27.103
From scratch, how to bake your own student cake.

29
00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:29.664
What I start with is the cake base itself.

30
00:01:29.664 --> 00:01:31.269
For it you need ...

31
00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:36.140
Eggs, powdered sugar, wheat flour, cornstarch or potato flour,

32
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.080
vanilla sugar and baking powder.

33
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.799
What I start with is whisk together powdered sugar and eggs

34
00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.112
Really white and puffy, with an electric whisk.

35
00:01:44.112 --> 00:02:01.440
[Background Music]

36
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.218
So there

37
00:02:02.218 --> 00:02:05.604
Now that the batter is wonderfully white and fluffy,

38
00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:08.911
Then it's time to aim down the dry ingredients.

39
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.750
And those dry ingredients are wheat flour,

40
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.880
potato flour or cornstarch,

41
00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:18.720
vanilla sugar and baking powder.

42
00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:23.719
To just have a starch in the batter for his cake base,

43
00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.492
Make it extra soft and fluffy.

44
00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:32.160
How to gently turn this together into a smooth batter with a lollipop.

45
00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:33.988
Make sure to scrape off the edges and get all the ingredients.

46
00:02:40.258 --> 00:02:44.009
I feel the batter how fluffy it is

47
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.016
And how good this cake base will be.

48
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.483
So I bring out my lined spring form,

49
00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:54.497
I have shown this in many videos before, so I think I don't show it.

50
00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:58.240
Then just pour the batter into the spring shape.

51
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.123
Now this cake base should be baked in the lower part of the oven

52
00:03:02.123 --> 00:03:04.917
at 175 degrees for about 40 minutes

53
00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.858
Or until it is simply packed.

54
00:03:07.858 --> 00:03:10.254
Again, it is super important to remember that

55
00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:12.168
All ovens are different.

56
00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:16.197
Time statements in prescriptions, whether it is mine or others,

57
00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:18.000
is just a guideline.

58
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.628
One must get to know one's own oven

59
00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:21.437
and simply take a little look at the cake,

60
00:03:21.437 --> 00:03:23.172
to know if it is finished or not.

61
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.548
While my cake base is both baked and swallows,

62
00:03:26.548 --> 00:03:28.984
I take the opportunity to make my fillings.

63
00:03:28.984 --> 00:03:31.890
After all, there are three fillings in this cake,

64
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.890
But don't let it deter you,

65
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.327
Because there are three super -simple fillings

66
00:03:36.327 --> 00:03:39.242
Which does not require much effort at all.

67
00:03:39.242 --> 00:03:41.584
First out, we have the vanilla cream.

68
00:03:41.584 --> 00:03:43.040
To make it, do you need:

69
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.524
Whipped cream, milk, powdered sugar,

70
00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.835
cornstarch or potato flour,

71
00:03:47.835 --> 00:03:50.416
an egg yolk, vanilla powder and butter.

72
00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:53.624
What I start with is to have in all ingredients

73
00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:55.223
In addition to the butter, in a saucepan

74
00:03:55.223 --> 00:03:57.797
let it heat up and thicken on medium heat,

75
00:03:57.797 --> 00:03:58.968
Before I have in the butter.

76
00:04:18.408 --> 00:04:20.155
And when you heat on this vanilla cream,

77
00:04:20.155 --> 00:04:22.904
is it super important that you heat it on

78
00:04:22.904 --> 00:04:25.421
low to medium heat and stirring all the time,

79
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:26.817
So it does not burn.

80
00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:51.128
And now it's time for filling number two,

81
00:04:51.128 --> 00:04:53.116
which is a raspberry compote.

82
00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:56.599
This raspberry compote will balance up with

83
00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.124
A lot of lovely acidity, against all this cute in the cake.

84
00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:04.386
What you need to make the raspberry compote is:

85
00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:07.616
Frozen raspberries, powdered sugar, agar agar powder

86
00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:09.134
or any other gelding agent

87
00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:11.631
To help the raspberry compote to thicken,

88
00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:14.504
And the juice from a lemon.

89
00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:17.261
This raspberry compote, it is at least as easy to do,

90
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:18.585
Like the vanilla cream.

91
00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:20.839
One only has in all the ingredients in a saucepan

92
00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.309
And then we heat this until the sugar crystals have melted.

93
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.839
Now is the time to do the third and final filling,

94
00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.753
Namely milk chocolate truffle.

95
00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:55.984
To make it, you only need three ingredients:

96
00:05:55.984 --> 00:05:58.586
Milk chocolate, butter and whipped cream.

97
00:05:58.586 --> 00:06:01.492
What I start with is to chop the milk chocolate.

98
00:06:01.492 --> 00:06:01.992
That's how

99
00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:06.177
Then just have in the milk chocolate in a heat -resistant bowl

100
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.400
And together with the milk chocolate, I also have the butter.

101
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.112
Over this I will pour hot whipped cream.

102
00:06:14.112 --> 00:06:17.256
I pour the cream into a saucepan,

103
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.098
It's not so much cream,

104
00:06:19.098 --> 00:06:20.487
So you really have to be on guard,

105
00:06:20.487 --> 00:06:21.947
And don't go away and do something else.

106
00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:25.727
You just heat this just until it's about to start boiling,

107
00:06:25.727 --> 00:06:27.525
Then you remove the saucepan from the heat.

108
00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:47.732
Now also my milk chocolate truffle is ready,

109
00:06:47.732 --> 00:06:50.548
It should stand and cool at room temperature.

110
00:06:50.548 --> 00:06:55.037
If you set it in the fridge, it will not stay creamy and spreadable at all,

111
00:06:55.037 --> 00:06:58.492
So we can fill the cake with it, but instead get pretty firm.

112
00:06:58.492 --> 00:07:01.207
As soon as it has cooled I will split my cake base

113
00:07:01.207 --> 00:07:05.163
and fill my cake with all these three lovely fillings,

114
00:07:05.163 --> 00:07:06.500
cover with whipped cream

115
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.089
And then we will make this cake look like a student cap.

116
00:07:15.963 --> 00:07:20.084
Now my cake base has cooled and I will divide it into three parts.

117
00:07:20.084 --> 00:07:23.751
The easiest way I think you can split a cake base on,

118
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:27.792
is to first mark so you know that they will be about as thick.

119
00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:30.738
Then I start on the top mark

120
00:07:31.066 --> 00:07:34.150
and gently cut towards the center.

121
00:07:35.703 --> 00:07:38.388
The knife should only be moved back and forth

122
00:07:38.388 --> 00:07:40.701
while rotating your cake base.

123
00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:43.788
Try to keep it as straight as possible,

124
00:07:44.392 --> 00:07:46.769
to get as straight as possible.

125
00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:00.630
The lower part of the cake base,

126
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.092
I shovel it over on a cake dish,

127
00:08:03.092 --> 00:08:05.348
Because I don't want to serve the cake on a grid.

128
00:08:05.348 --> 00:08:09.064
The first layer filling, it is raspberry compote.

129
00:08:10.038 --> 00:08:12.614
I just click out the raspberry compote like this.

130
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.802
Next in turn we have the lovely homemade vanilla cream,

131
00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:32.205
Which you just click on top.

132
00:08:56.124 --> 00:08:59.466
Then just go on with the next bottom.

133
00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:06.949
Make sure they lay edge to edge, around the whole cake.

134
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:10.999
Next in line we have this dreamy milk chocolate truffle.

135
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.104
Then just put on the last layer of cake base,

136
00:09:33.104 --> 00:09:35.101
on top of the milk chocolate truffle.

137
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:37.697
Make sure it settles edge to edge.

138
00:09:37.697 --> 00:09:40.603
I was forgetting a super important thing.

139
00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:43.957
Because this cake is to be formed into a student cap,

140
00:09:43.957 --> 00:09:47.839
So it is important not to place the cake in the middle of the cake dish,

141
00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:49.576
Without a little more to the edge,

142
00:09:49.576 --> 00:09:52.190
so we can fit with a small cap screen

143
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.000
to this student cap.

144
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.209
Now I am happy with the foundation

145
00:09:56.209 --> 00:09:59.799
And what remains now is whisk really fluffy cream,

146
00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.298
As we will cover the cake with,

147
00:10:01.298 --> 00:10:03.161
before we go in with the marzipan.

148
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:07.416
The secret behind a really fluffy whipped cream,

149
00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:09.670
is that it should be a refrigerator shell

150
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.012
And preferably of as high fat as you can only find.

151
00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:16.053
Then you start whisking at a little lower speed,

152
00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:18.536
Then when you see that it is getting really bubbly and foamy,

153
00:10:18.536 --> 00:10:22.661
Then you can increase the speed a little until you get soft tops.

154
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.042
This is what I mean when I say

155
00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:40.825
That the whipping cream should have soft tops.

156
00:10:40.825 --> 00:10:44.134
It should be compliant, glossy, not at all grainy

157
00:10:44.134 --> 00:10:48.000
Because if it is already grainy and a little firmer when you have whipped it,

158
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.017
then you don't have much margin at all to work with

159
00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:52.816
When to cover the cake with whipped cream,

160
00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:55.177
Because we will be doing it even more,

161
00:10:55.177 --> 00:10:57.760
And then it becomes like stirring in the cream.

162
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.029
Now I will cover the cake in whipped cream

163
00:11:01.029 --> 00:11:04.645
And usually when making, for example, a princess cake,

164
00:11:04.645 --> 00:11:08.968
Then you want to get that dome -shaped cake,

165
00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:09.793
We don't want that today,

166
00:11:09.793 --> 00:11:12.041
Because it should look like a student cap.

167
00:11:12.041 --> 00:11:14.397
So I will work a little more after the straight look,

168
00:11:14.397 --> 00:11:16.833
but we will shape it even more

169
00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:20.961
to a student mice look, then when the marzipan is on.

170
00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:23.263
But now we do not want to have the dome itself,

171
00:11:23.263 --> 00:11:25.474
Without more a straight surface.

172
00:11:25.474 --> 00:11:27.716
The easiest way, I think,

173
00:11:27.716 --> 00:11:30.346
is to shovel on a bunch of cream

174
00:11:31.252 --> 00:11:32.525
on top of the cake.

175
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.286
I'll see if I need the rest late,

176
00:11:35.286 --> 00:11:36.295
But we start like this.

177
00:11:36.798 --> 00:11:42.898
Slowly but surely you scrape whipped cream on the edges of the cake.

178
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.996
For when it comes to both White Lady and Princess Cake,

179
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.301
So you don't want much whipped cream all around,

180
00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:56.270
However, at the top, it may be a generous layer.

181
00:11:56.807 --> 00:11:58.002
But it is also personal.

182
00:11:58.002 --> 00:12:00.472
If you want to be a little more sparse when it comes to the cream,

183
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.110
So you can definitely be.

184
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.287
Now this cake should stand in the refrigerator to sit down,

185
00:12:34.287 --> 00:12:35.812
The cream should be a little more firm,

186
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.058
While we roll out the white marzipan,

187
00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:39.636
that will cover the entire cake.

188
00:12:39.636 --> 00:12:42.000
The excess cream all around,

189
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.322
we don't have to worry about right now.

190
00:12:44.322 --> 00:12:46.835
As soon as it has been in the fridge and become a little firmer,

191
00:12:46.835 --> 00:12:48.901
Then you can much easier to dry it,

192
00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:51.040
than now, when it's just beaten.

193
00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.765
Now it's time to roll the white marzipan.

194
00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:58.986
I know that rolling of marzipan may be a bit of a concern for most of them,

195
00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:01.791
But with the right material and the right technology

196
00:13:02.463 --> 00:13:04.685
So there are no wonder.

197
00:13:04.886 --> 00:13:08.665
First, you need to have more marzipan than you need

198
00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:10.346
to cover the cake itself.

199
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.488
Because if you have much more than you need,

200
00:13:12.488 --> 00:13:14.895
Then you can pull out the marzipan a little and smooth it out,

201
00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:16.939
Without the marzipan cracking.

202
00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:23.732
My second tip is to knead the marzipan properly,

203
00:13:23.732 --> 00:13:28.478
Before you roll it out, because then it becomes much more flexible and compliant.

204
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.545
And to get as smooth rolling on his marzipan as possible,

205
00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:34.829
So I have two tips.

206
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:37.230
The first is to get one of these Kavling's mat.

207
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.232
You know that I am not much for gadgets in the kitchen.

208
00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:42.880
But if there is something that I actually think you should buy,

209
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.328
Then it is such a rolling rug.

210
00:13:44.328 --> 00:13:46.831
It facilitates something huge.

211
00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:50.696
Partly it has sizes,

212
00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:52.539
So you know how much to roll,

213
00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:54.739
so you don't roller too large or too small

214
00:13:54.739 --> 00:13:57.644
Because it gets so hard then when turning on the marzipan over the cake

215
00:13:57.644 --> 00:14:00.021
[Camilla with distorted and funny voice:] "Oh no, if I only had two inches to"

216
00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:03.125
Then it is so that when you roll on such a rug,

217
00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.511
Do not need to lift the marzipan with your hands later

218
00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:08.920
Without you can only lift the entire carpet and turn it over the cake,

219
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.255
So the marzipan goes off in a neat way without cracking.

220
00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:16.531
Of course, I put a link to such a rolling rug in the description,

221
00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:18.387
If you are eager to get one yourself.

222
00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:24.147
My second tip is to use cornstarch when rolling

223
00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:25.686
Do you use icing sugar,

224
00:14:25.686 --> 00:14:28.739
Then the icing sugar will eventually melt and it gets sticky.

225
00:14:29.007 --> 00:14:33.364
While the cornstarch, the marzipan and the rolling are dry.

226
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.283
I have some cornstarch on the rolling mat

227
00:14:36.283 --> 00:14:38.080
And on the marzipan itself.

228
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.346
Then I roll in different directions,

229
00:14:40.346 --> 00:14:43.279
Make sure to turn on the marzipan all the time,

230
00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:45.146
so that I don't roll in just one direction

231
00:14:45.146 --> 00:14:48.212
and gets a thick side and a narrow side.

232
00:14:50.763 --> 00:14:52.483
As soon as you feel it starts stuck,

233
00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:54.000
Can you have more cornstarch.

234
00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:58.081
When you roll the marzipan you can sometimes get small air bubbles

235
00:14:58.349 --> 00:15:00.000
You should not leave them.

236
00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:03.552
Go in with a toothpick, grill stick or a needle,

237
00:15:04.022 --> 00:15:05.596
or something else vassly you have at home

238
00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:07.909
And crack them before continuing to roll.

239
00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:12.997
Then I think it is very important that the marzipan is not too thick.

240
00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:15.400
The worst thing I know is eating a marzipan cake

241
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.601
With far too much marzipan.

242
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.289
I usually say that about three to four millimeters are just right,

243
00:15:21.893 --> 00:15:23.169
No more than that.

244
00:15:41.674 --> 00:15:44.108
At the end I usually only take a few lightweight rods

245
00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:46.722
where I do not give any pressure on the rolling pin itself,

246
00:15:47.293 --> 00:15:49.732
but only to even out the surface itself.

247
00:15:49.966 --> 00:15:51.112
Before I have on the marzipan,

248
00:15:51.112 --> 00:15:57.039
Should I just make sure to wipe away excess whipped cream on the edge.

249
00:15:57.744 --> 00:16:01.154
So this is such a nervous moment, silicone mat or not.

250
00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:04.081
You just want it to be good.

251
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:07.585
Okay ... three, two, one, drive

252
00:16:10.773 --> 00:16:14.080
I was aiming a little oblique, I do this ... so

253
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:20.825
Now we take one corner at a time, smooth out, pull.

254
00:16:20.825 --> 00:16:28.976
Smooth out, pull.
 Until the whole cake is covered,

255
00:16:28.976 --> 00:16:30.976
Without a lot of creases.

256
00:16:30.976 --> 00:16:32.976
Will be messy now, but as I said, we wipe it up later.

257
00:16:32.976 --> 00:16:34.976
The focus now is to get to the marzipan nicely.

258
00:16:34.976 --> 00:16:37.365
Press it around the entire cake,

259
00:16:37.365 --> 00:16:42.174
You want it to attach properly.

260
00:16:42.174 --> 00:16:45.670
Let this take time

261
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.062
And make sure to have completely dry hands when you do this.

262
00:16:47.062 --> 00:16:49.649
For will moisture on the marzipan,

263
00:16:49.649 --> 00:16:50.333
Then it will be sticky.

264
00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:51.980
Now you can take the opportunity to shape the cake a little.

265
00:16:51.980 --> 00:17:01.740
Really straight sides and a slightly flatter surface.

266
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:09.362
Then you go in gently with a pizza slicer or knife

267
00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.090
And just cut off the abundance.

268
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:16.472
I don't usually go too close to the cake from the beginning,

269
00:17:16.472 --> 00:17:17.810
Without me starting quite far out,

270
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.100
And run the finer later.

271
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:21.764
Just cut where you see.

272
00:17:21.764 --> 00:17:42.560
The worst thing is if you happen to cut too much, because you thought you saw.

273
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.807
And as you may understand, be theres, done that.

274
00:17:46.807 --> 00:17:51.170
Finally I usually go in with a sharp knife

275
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:56.814
And just push in the edge, which I dare not cut away, at risk that it will go out a lot of cream.

276
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.427
So now we will make this look like fabric,

277
00:18:01.427 --> 00:18:03.336
And my best tip for getting to this,

278
00:18:03.336 --> 00:18:08.266
is to make lots of small holes, along the upper edge of the cake.

279
00:18:08.266 --> 00:18:12.000
There are tools to buy to do this in a slightly more efficient way.

280
00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:15.604
But then quite honestly, take a barbecue stick, it works great.

281
00:18:15.604 --> 00:18:17.265
I don't usually do along the whole,

282
00:18:17.265 --> 00:18:20.751
Without I start somewhere behind.

283
00:18:22.597 --> 00:18:26.554
So you make small small holes, preferably densely tie each other.

284
00:18:26.554 --> 00:18:28.855
So it looks like a stitch simply.

285
00:18:40.802 --> 00:18:43.463
Then I want to week it a little

286
00:18:43.463 --> 00:18:45.762
because a student cap is not straight,

287
00:18:45.762 --> 00:18:48.000
Because then you look like ...

288
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.989
What is the name of that cartoon figure with a round helmet

289
00:18:49.989 --> 00:18:51.172
Anyway...

290
00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:53.429
We'll make this look like a real hat.

291
00:18:53.429 --> 00:18:55.764
Then I do, with the help of different kitchen utensils,

292
00:18:55.764 --> 00:18:57.388
with different cutlery and so,

293
00:18:57.388 --> 00:18:59.584
So I only do like little folds.

294
00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:06.964
It is important to do this while the cake has not gone into the fridge again.

295
00:19:06.964 --> 00:19:09.696
Because as soon as you put the cake into the refrigerator

296
00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:11.697
so the marzipan will start to solidify

297
00:19:11.697 --> 00:19:13.429
And then you can't do this.

298
00:19:14.906 --> 00:19:16.518
So little random folds,

299
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:23.785
Rather that it is irregular as a student cap actually looks,

300
00:19:23.785 --> 00:19:27.109
than to do exactly the same on both sides.

301
00:19:27.109 --> 00:19:28.985
It should be a bit asymmetrical.

302
00:19:45.329 --> 00:19:47.079
Now the cap has to stand and the side.

303
00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:48.913
I will actually not put it in the cooler,

304
00:19:48.913 --> 00:19:52.121
Until I am completely clear, if I would like to change the shape somewhat.

305
00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:55.040
But what it's time for now is to use Smartt ...

306
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.000
[Beep]

307
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.640
Smartt ..

308
00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.697
Black marzipan, to make a strip around the whole cap,

309
00:20:00.697 --> 00:20:02.529
And also to make a cap screen.

310
00:20:02.529 --> 00:20:04.529
Wonder if it's called so

311
00:20:04.529 --> 00:20:08.139
So I hate black marzipan, it has such a strange texture.

312
00:20:08.139 --> 00:20:10.713
It is because they need to have so much color.

313
00:20:10.713 --> 00:20:12.000
Just black marzipan

314
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.745
I usually use a lot of cornstarch

315
00:20:15.745 --> 00:20:17.208
Before I can even roll it out.

316
00:20:17.208 --> 00:20:18.537
So check out how you look on your hands ...

317
00:20:20.013 --> 00:20:23.265
But it is for it to be much more manageable

318
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.774
than when it looks like this.

319
00:20:25.774 --> 00:20:28.000
So now we go with lots of black ...

320
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.751
[Beep]

321
00:20:28.751 --> 00:20:29.832
[Camilla laughs]

322
00:20:29.832 --> 00:20:31.329
May starch here ...

323
00:20:32.537 --> 00:20:33.772
Pretty much indeed.

324
00:20:36.457 --> 00:20:37.990
Then I roll it out.

325
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.904
This strip needs to be

326
00:20:40.904 --> 00:20:44.962
Much longer than the perimeter around the cake.

327
00:20:45.432 --> 00:20:49.141
And now we add another layer of marzipan on the cake

328
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.215
I who don't like a thick layer of marzipan ...

329
00:20:55.425 --> 00:20:56.640
I prefer...

330
00:20:57.234 --> 00:20:59.392
... to have this as thin as possible.

331
00:21:00.174 --> 00:21:04.454
First cut away this uneven side

332
00:21:04.454 --> 00:21:06.215
Then I think it might be

333
00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:09.707
a little wider than one centimeter.

334
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:22.390
I just had to wash away all the color from my hands

335
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.234
So I don't scratch the cake.

336
00:21:24.737 --> 00:21:27.610
But I won't dry my hands completely dry

337
00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:30.000
because one needs some water

338
00:21:30.525 --> 00:21:33.085
to make the black strip attach.

339
00:21:33.085 --> 00:21:37.914
So I iron some moisture on the marzipan with my hands

340
00:21:38.462 --> 00:21:40.204
Then I just take this strip ...

341
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.087
Starts from the front

342
00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:50.423
And gently puts it along the entire cake.

343
00:21:51.094 --> 00:21:51.594
That's how

344
00:21:51.594 --> 00:21:57.358
I try to attach the ends a little neatly with each other at the back

345
00:21:57.693 --> 00:21:59.458
and there the strip is ready

346
00:22:00.297 --> 00:22:03.192
And now it's time to make the screen itself.

347
00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:06.939
Now the idea is to just roll out this

348
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.610
to an arbitrary form

349
00:22:09.979 --> 00:22:11.654
that have a little width and a little height,

350
00:22:11.654 --> 00:22:14.412
for we will not cut to this one

351
00:22:14.412 --> 00:22:18.560
until yes put it next to the cap itself, on the barrel.

352
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.607
But what I will do now is that I cut a little bent.

353
00:22:25.745 --> 00:22:27.269
There somewhere I want it.

354
00:22:28.444 --> 00:22:32.825
So just press so it follows the shape of the cake.

355
00:22:33.126 --> 00:22:35.604
Then you cut to a small cap shape.

356
00:22:40.974 --> 00:22:43.728
And now we come to the final decoration

357
00:22:43.728 --> 00:22:44.857
This little one ...

358
00:22:45.194 --> 00:22:46.724
What is it called

359
00:22:46.724 --> 00:22:48.533
Yes but this little thing with ...

360
00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.080
that is round and have different colors

361
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.516
Depending on which program you go in.

362
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.365
Anyway, we start with a yellow circle

363
00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:59.557
I roll it a bit in this cornstarch bath

364
00:22:59.557 --> 00:23:01.460
As I have arranged here on my table.

365
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.548
So, a little moistened fingers and type where the middle is so I put some water

366
00:23:23.548 --> 00:23:27.499
So I just press the yellow circle there.

367
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.164
Then we take the blue color and you just need it

368
00:23:31.164 --> 00:23:32.635
Pytte

369
00:23:32.635 --> 00:23:33.840
Pot a little.

370
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.840
That is mini, mini, minimal,

371
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.760
so small, you see

372
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.333
Takes some more water on your finger,

373
00:23:40.635 --> 00:23:46.103
Place it in the middle of the yellow circle

374
00:23:46.103 --> 00:23:49.600
And then just push the blue ball there,

375
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.955
So that it gets a little flat.

376
00:23:52.626 --> 00:23:53.843
Don't take too much water,

377
00:23:53.843 --> 00:23:57.256
If you do that, there is a risk that it will just be lousy and fall off.

378
00:23:57.256 --> 00:23:59.216
It really is a delicate boundary between moisten

379
00:23:59.216 --> 00:24:00.537
and make something wet.

380
00:24:09.424 --> 00:24:11.060
Is there even someone who has checked this far

381
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.686
And that has remained, to see the final result.

382
00:24:14.686 --> 00:24:19.079
If you are one of those who look all the way to the last second of the video,

383
00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:22.406
So you have to write it down in the comments section.

384
00:24:22.406 --> 00:24:27.866
But this is how the final momentary cake looks like.

385
00:24:28.302 --> 00:24:29.150
How nice?

386
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.876
You can make it how spicy and how simple as you just want.

387
00:24:32.876 --> 00:24:34.507
This is a very simple look.

388
00:24:34.675 --> 00:24:37.417
But if you want to add marzipan roses,

389
00:24:37.417 --> 00:24:40.519
write with chocolate, just go bananas

390
00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:41.904
No matter how you do,

391
00:24:41.904 --> 00:24:45.103
So you will find the link to the recipe down in the description.
