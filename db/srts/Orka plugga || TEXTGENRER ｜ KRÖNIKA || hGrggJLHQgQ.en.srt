00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,280
A column is a short newspaper text 
where you share your own opinions.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,200
An op-ed piece is fact-based, 
but a column should be personal.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,840
Personalise the text by including 
your own thoughts and experiences.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,720
A column should cause a reaction 
in the reader.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,720
These days, columns are 
frequently shared on social media.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,040
Keep this in mind 
when you're writing a column.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,600
It's a personal text, so include your own 
interpretations and opinions.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,160
What do you think? 
What's your take on a certain event?

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,280
What was it like? 
How did it make you feel and think?

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,120
Argue your side of the issue.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,000
Address possible counterarguments 
before anyone has presented them.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,720
Make phrasing decisions 
based on the target audience.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,080
Use metaphors and similes - if they're 
relevant to both the text and the reader.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,520
Don't be afraid to be funny 
as well as serious.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,080
Using humour to approach tough subjects 
can be very effective.
