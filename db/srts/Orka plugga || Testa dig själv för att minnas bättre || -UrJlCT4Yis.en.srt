1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,320
When I plug into a sample or homework interview

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,080
So I usually read the text once.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,280
And then I write down questions

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,080
on what is the most important thing to remember.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,320
Then I close the book and tell myself

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,440
Or for someone else what I read.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,640
When to plug in a sample or homework interview

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,000
can be used by a method that

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,160
is about testing yourself.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,280
While learning something new

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,800
Should you test yourself on how much you remember what you read.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,600
The advantage of plugging this way

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,160
is that it strengthens the memory and causes the knowledge to get stuck

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,440
in a more effective way by forcing the brain

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,600
To directly pick up what you have learned.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,480
If I only read the text, it is difficult to remember the important thing.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,960
Therefore, I answer my own questions about the text,

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,320
Then it is easier to remember when I write a test.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,560
It also becomes clearer to me

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,160
If I remember all the facts I need

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
When I answer my own questions.

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,960
Then I notice if I understand and remember.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,720
If you read a text several times in succession

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,760
so will you recognize a lot,

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
And it feels like you will remember everything.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,160
But then when you sit on the test

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,920
Maybe you still forgot a lot of what you read.

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,000
Researchers have discovered that one learns better and remembers longer

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,280
If, instead of just reading a text several times

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Tests on the content.

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,240
So it will be easier for you to remember

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,440
If you summarize what you learned.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,760
And then test yourself

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,560
For example, by answering your own questions.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,280
Then you test your brain on what you remember!

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,160
When I will then plug in the test at another occasion

37
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,240
So I start by answering my own questions.

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,760
Then I know what I remember and what I need to plug in more!

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,720
And when I plugged clearly,

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,960
So I summarize to myself what I read

41
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,920
And what is important to remember.

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,520
Then it becomes easier to remember when I sit on the test!

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,480
When you summarize and answer questions

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,200
Do you practice picking up the information from the brain.

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,080
It will then be easier to find the information

46
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,040
If you have already trained to find it.
