00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How to resist false rumors. 
Here are five pieces of useful advice.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,120
Listen and read carefully.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,600
The risk of misunderstanding or making 
your own interpretation increases-

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,040
-if you don't read or listen carefully 
to what is being said.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,120
Just reading the headline, 
sentences out of context-

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,840
-or only half paying attention 
can make you misunderstand-

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,600
-and subsequently contribute 
to false information being spread.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,800
Use reliable sources to double-check.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,440
Always double-check claims that seem 
exaggerated or unlikely to be true-

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
-using sources you can trust.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,800
A reliable source is always independent, 
factual, neutral-

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,000
-and can show you where 
its information comes from.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,960
The authorities are one example 
of reliable sources.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
Trust facts, not feelings.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,160
Feelings have more control over us than 
we think, and we tend to trust feelings-

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,200
-over facts when we assess information. 
"I feel like this is true."

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,840
We are especially vulnerable to this 
during a frightening event.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,960
You see, fear makes us less critical. 
We react instinctively, seeking safety-

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,320
-and don't remember 
to assess information critically.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,560
Keep your bias in check. 
Nobody is completely neutral.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,760
We all have preconceived notions 
that affect us and how we see the world.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Confirmation bias, for instance, 
means we have a tendency-

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,480
-to look for information that confirms 
what we already believe to be true-

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,120
-and unconsciously disregard 
information that goes against our beliefs.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,080
Think for yourself. It's crucial to practice 
assessing information critically-

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,400
-and to constantly question 
what we see, hear, and read.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,560
During dramatic events, 
rumors are particularly likely to spread.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,640
Follow up on any claims 
and find out the facts.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,800
It's important not to get carried away 
and spread false rumors.
