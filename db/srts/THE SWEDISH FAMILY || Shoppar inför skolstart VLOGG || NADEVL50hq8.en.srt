1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,700
- Brrr, how cold it is.
 - Yes.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,020
- Great cold.
 - You have to jump a little in the trampoline so you get hot.

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,120
Yeah!

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,900
Alma!

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,880
Sorry for the mess we are rebuilding.

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,680
No, we clean clothes.

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,680
It is a positive thing that it has become a little colder outside, that you grab such things.

8
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,840
The children have grown as flowers this summer.

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:08,780
All of this is an outgrown and should be left to the Stockholm City Mission ... charity.

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
- Hello.
 - Hello.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,580
- Your bag is packed.
 - Yes.

12
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,660
How luxurious?

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,100
- What should you do?
 - I'll sleep over with a friend.

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,100
Mm.

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,320
We'll drive you into town.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,960
- Two nights you should sleep away.
 - Yes.

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,720
- You have never done that before.
 - Yes.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,020
- Have you?
 - At Tanja.

19
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,740
But...

20
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,320
It's a pretend grandmother, so that's another thing.
 This is a friend-friend.

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
Buddy buddy.

22
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:55,480
Along the way, we should actually stop and look for some new clothes, because we have to supplement before school starts.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,420
You don't like jeans, so you need a little more type of tight stuff I think, huh?

24
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,740
- Yes.
 - A little cool things.

25
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,640
Harry likes jeans, but he needs a little more soft pants and stuff.

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,300
- Yes, he has a lot of jeans.
 - Yes.

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,960
We will see what we find so that you are good looking and nice, because if less than two weeks start ...

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,560
- School!
 - No!

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
It's true.

30
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,780
School is fun with all friends, but ... So, it's not so ...

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,140
It is more fun to have summer vacation.

32
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,120
A lot ... a lot ... a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,120
We have a collaboration with Stadium so we will go to their store in Nacka Forum ...

34
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,300
... to see if they have the stuff we are looking for for the kids.
 And I would like to buy some new workout clothes myself.

35
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,380
And I would like to look at a pair of new shoes.

36
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,220
After all, I am one such mom who goes dressed in workout clothes most evenly, whether I exercise or not.

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,300
- Yes, that's actually true.
 But now you don't.
 - No, for once.

38
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Yes.

39
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,420
Hunting them!

40
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,180
He chases us!

41
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,020
The best thing is to pick up some and then go and test.

42
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,380
- I want one like this.
 - Good idea.

43
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,780
Oh, oh wow.

44
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,800
- What do you do?
 - This is our secret place.
 Don't tell anyone.

45
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,780
No, it's just ours.

46
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,140
Spring.

47
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,460
Spring.

48
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,820
- Just our place.
 - Just our place.

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,420
Now dad comes, hide!

50
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,140
- Where are the kids?
 - I have no idea.

51
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,140
I saw some light calufs that disappeared here.
 Hello there?

52
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,400
What a good hiding place.

53
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,660
I feel like the worst Christmas tree, now we have to go and test clothes.

54
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,360
Check out, here you can buy tents.

55
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,340
- Do you get hungry?
 - Yes, very suck.
 Tent in the garden.

56
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,680
- I won!
 - I won!

57
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,020
Welcome in.

58
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Oh!

59
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,640
So there.

60
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,720
Thus, my God.
 There are too much cool children's clothing here.

61
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,460
Check this out.

62
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:15,160
She can't stop dancing because she has such a cool dress.

63
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,840
Should we put down everything we should buy in that one?

64
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,220
- Yes!
 - Okay.

65
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,840
- Then the idea is that you and I should find stuff too.
 - Yes exactly.
 Then the children have to look at something while we are looking.

66
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,640
Now I'm also a Christmas tree.
 I go in and try a little.

67
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:53,360
For real, I am amazed at that stage for both children and adults has such a good mix of exercise and ...

68
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,540
- Street?
 - Casual.

69
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,400
Casual!
 Exercise/casual.

70
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,360
How do you translate it into Swedish?
 "Free"!
 Exercise and free.

71
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,220
God what strange all this became.
 I go and try.

72
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:16,900
We are finally ready to choose clothes and Alma has got a job as a cashier.

73
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,460
It smells good.

74
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,680
Yes.
 It makes it not smell so bad in the summer when sweating.

75
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,480
You can fold this one.

76
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,080
- Here's another alarm.
 - Yes!

77
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,820
Where.

78
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,840
- Is it fun, Alma?
 - Yes, giant.

79
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,060
So there.

80
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,840
- Alma, you don't say "thank you"?
 - Thanks!

81
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
You are welcome.

82
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,120
- How good you were at checkout.
 - Thanks.

83
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,980
- Is it hard to wear?
 Should I take it?
 - Yes.

84
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,640
- That went well.
 - Yes.

85
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,300
Great.

86
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,900
We have a little while before we leave Alma to her friend, so we will go to our address in town.

87
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,720
Yes.

88
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,500
Me, Joanna and Harry plan to go out and sail for a few days.

89
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,880
In order for us to live and sleep on the boat, we must have sleeping bags, so we will see if we find our old ones.

90
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,740
In our storage room.
 After all, the apartment is still rented out.

91
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,840
I guess Harry will have a Bamse sleeping bag, because that's the only thing I and Harry have.

92
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,520
- I want to bring my superhero costumes.
 - They are up in the apartment, I think.
 Or are they in the store?

93
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,360
- We have to check.
 - Yes, we have to look.

94
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,320
- How do you think it feels to be on our street?
 - It's nice.

95
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,580
Come, Gullis.

96
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,440
- How do you think it feels?
 - Great and nice.

97
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,740
There are several who have asked when we will get our apartment back.

98
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,480
It is not quite clear yet when we are moving back home.

99
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:40,240
Those who rent would like to rent longer, and we have some plans for the winter that are not really 100 percent set.

100
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,640
But soon.

101
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,440
- And then we promise to tell on the channel.
 - Yes exactly.

102
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,460
Do you find any sleeping bags, then?

103
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,880
Maybe here in.

104
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,600
No.

105
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,440
No, do you know what that is?
 There are even more grown clothes that we should give away.

106
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:13,200
I think they are in this old backpacker back.

107
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,620
Check!

108
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
Sleeping bag.

109
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,520
- To me and to Harry.
 - Yes, to you two.

110
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:29,100
And sleeping bag for dad.
 Old, from the seventies, but works great.

111
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,920
And last but not least...

112
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,520
Supermodern sleeping bag for mom.

113
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,740
My superhero costumes are not in here.

114
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,500
- What an osis.
 - Yes.

115
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,600
Can we go to the school yard for a little while?

116
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,620
Yes we can do that.
 And then we can test our new clothes and take some pictures for Instagram.

117
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,240
- Yay!
 - Yay!

118
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
Yay!

119
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,320
- Check out what nicely, we match.
 - Look!

120
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,920
Here!

121
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
Oh!

122
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,060
Come then, try to take it!
 Alma and Harry.

123
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,700
A completely natural situation.

124
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,840
So here we always lie.
 Don't all families do it?

125
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,460
- The kids feel relaxed ... - But hello, stop with that!

126
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,820
- Wow, the worst thumbnail.
 - Yes, I say so!

127
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,000
Do you feel ready for autumn and school and preschool?

128
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,440
No.

129
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,560
So, I say no because I have thought that the summer holidays have been too short.

130
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:33,740
Do you feel ready for the fall?
 Comment below.
 Below...

131
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,800
Now I'm going to swing a little.

132
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,440
Harry wants to swing himself, he says.
 I can't swing him.

133
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,800
(Alma) I taught him to swing myself yesterday.

134
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,520
Nice, Harry!

135
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,180
- May I put?
 - Yes.

136
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,820
We have answered some questions in this vlog already, but we take a question of today ...

137
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,740
... that is associated with that basketball.

138
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,540
Ebbe Petraeus wonders: "What activity should Alma and Harry go on this fall?"

139
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,360
Good question.

140
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,320
I'll go to riding school and then I'll go to basketball.

141
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,140
- That's what Alma wants to do.
 - No, I'll be.

142
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,780
Okay.

143
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,780
- And Harry continues with football, huh?
 - Yes.

144
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,220
I'll train as I already do.
 Springer, yoga and strength trainers.

145
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:53,820
I am looking to build my physics more professionally so I will see if I can find a good PT.

146
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:00,360
Thanks for watching this video!

147
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,780
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

148
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,340
Recommend, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

149
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,780
Bye!
