1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,540
- It's so cold.
- Yes.

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,700
Go jump on the trampoline to warm up.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,060
Yay!

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,660
Alma!

5
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,600
I'm sorry about the mess in here.

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,700
We are going through clothes.

7
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,680
A positive thing about the colder weather
is that you get around to doing these things.

8
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,840
The kids have grown
like flowers this summer.

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:08,820
All these clothes are too small for them now so
we will give them to Stockholm City Mission... charity.

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,380
- Your bag is packed.
- Yes.

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,380
How luxurious?

13
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,880
- What will you do today?
- I'm going to a friend's house for a sleepover.

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,100
Mhm.

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,300
We will drive you to the city.

16
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,880
- You will sleep away from us for two nights.
- Yes.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,680
- You have never done that before.
- Yes I have.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,880
- You have?
- At Tanja's.

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,780
But...

20
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,320
She's like an extra grandmother, so that's different.
This is a friend-friend.

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,940
A friend-friend.

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,880
We will make a stop on the way there to look for some
new clothes. We need a few items before school starts.

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,760
- You don't like jeans, so you need pants like these, right?
- Yes.

24
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,680
Something cool.

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,360
- Harry likes jeans, but he needs more sweatpants.
- Yes, he has lots of jeans.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,940
We will see what we find so that you both look nice,
because in less than two weeks it's time to go to...

27
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,560
- School!
- No!

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
It's true.

29
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,620
School is fun with all
my friends, but I mean...

30
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,000
Being on summer break is more fun.

31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,060
Much, much, much, much, much...

32
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,340
We are collaborating with Stadium
so we are going to their store in Nacka Forum.

33
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,900
We will see if they have
what we are looking for for the kids.

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,380
- I would like to buy some new workout clothes myself.
- I would like to look for new shoes.

35
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,420
I'm one of those moms who is dressed in
workout clothes even if I'm not working out.

36
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,380
- Yes, but not right now.
- No, for once.

37
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,300
Yes.

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,420
Chase them!

39
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,880
He is chasing us!

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,680
I think that the best way to go about this
is to grab a bunch of clothes and then try them on.

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,400
Good idea.

42
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,780
Oh, oh wow.

43
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,760
- What are you two doing?
- This is our secret place. Don't tell anyone.

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,900
No, this is just our place.

45
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,240
Our.

46
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Our.

47
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,920
- Only our place.
- Only our place.

48
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,640
Daddy is coming, hide!

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,140
- Where are the kids?
- I have no idea.

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:05,140
I saw a blonde head of hair
disappear down this hole. Hello there?

51
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,720
That's a good hiding spot.

52
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,660
I feel like a Christmas tree,
let's go and try these on.

53
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,520
Look, they sell tents.

54
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,540
- Do you want one?
- Yes, I really do... camp out in the backyard.

55
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,680
- I won!
- I won!

56
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,220
Welcome inside.

57
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,220
Oh!

58
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,620
There we go.

59
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,860
Oh my God, there are too many
cool children's clothes here.

60
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,440
Look at this one.

61
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,320
She can't stop dancing
because she's wearing such a cool outfit.

62
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,860
Shall we put all the things
that we will buy into that basket?

63
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,140
- Yes!
- Okay.

64
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,840
- The plan is that you and I will find things as well.
- The kids will watch something while we look around.

65
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,600
Now I'm also a Christmas tree.
I will go and try these on.

66
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:53,540
I'm surprised that both the kids and adult section here at
Stadium has such a good mix of workout clothes and...

67
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,640
- Street?
- Casual.

68
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,440
Casual!
Workout/casual.

69
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,260
How do you say that in Swedish?
"Ledigt"! Workout and "ledigt".

70
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,240
This is getting so strange.
I will go and try these on.

71
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:17,300
We are finally done choosing our clothes
and Alma got a job as a cashier.

72
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,480
It smells nice.

73
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,640
Yes. It makes it not smell so bad
in the summer when you sweat.

74
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,620
You can fold this one.

75
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,800
- Here is another security tag.
- Yes!

76
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,440
This one goes in here.

77
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,720
- Is it fun, Alma?
- Yes, very.

78
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,260
Here you go.

79
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,900
- Alma, are you not going to say "thank you"?
- Thank you!

80
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,480
You are welcome.

81
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,040
- You did so well at the register.
- Thanks.

82
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,020
- Do you want me to carry the bag?
- Yes.

83
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,640
- That went well.
- Yes.

84
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,340
Great!

85
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,860
We have some time before we will drop off Alma at her
friend's house, so we will go to our address in the city.

86
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,680
Yes.

87
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,520
Joanna, Harry and I plan
to go sailing for a few days.

88
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,940
To be able to live and sleep on the boat we need
sleeping bags, so we'll see if we can find our old ones.

89
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,660
In our storage unit.
The apartment is still rented out.

90
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,880
My guess is that Harry will have a Bamse sleeping bag,
because that's the only one Harry and I have.

91
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,460
- I want to bring my superhero costumes.
- I think they're in the apartment. Or are they in storage?

92
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,360
- Let's check.
- Yes, we will search for them.

93
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,460
- How does it feel to be on our street?
- It's nice.

94
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,760
Come, cutie.

95
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,520
- How do you feel about being here?
- Very good, it's nice.

96
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,800
Several of you have asked us
when we are getting our apartment back.

97
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,400
It's not decided yet
when we will be moving back.

98
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:40,240
The people renting it want to stay longer, and we have
plans for this winter that aren't 100% determined yet.

99
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,780
But... soon.

100
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,720
- Then we promise to tell you about it on our channel.
- Yes, exactly.

101
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,500
Have you found any sleeping bags?

102
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,900
Maybe in here.

103
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,640
No.

104
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,420
No, that's even more outgrown clothes
that we will donate to charity.

105
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,240
I think they are in this
old backpacker backpack.

106
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,420
Look!

107
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,380
Sleeping bag.

108
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,420
- For me and for Harry.
- Yes, for you two.

109
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,340
And here is an old sleeping bag for daddy.
It's from like the seventies, but it works great.

110
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,060
And last but not least...

111
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,560
A super modern sleeping bag for mommy.

112
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,880
My superhero costumes aren't here.

113
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,540
- What a bummer.
- Yes.

114
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,560
Do we have time to go to
the school playground for a bit?

115
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,580
Yes, sure. Then we can also try on our new clothes
and take pictures for Instagram.

116
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,420
Yay!

117
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,320
- Look how nice, we are matching.
- Look!

118
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,820
Pass it to me!

119
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
Oh!

120
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,700
Come here, try to take it from me!
Alma and Harry.

121
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,660
A completely natural situation.

122
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,820
This is how we always lie.
Don't all families do this?

123
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,500
- The kids are feeling relaxed...
- Hey, stop that!

124
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,620
- Wow, that's a good thumbnail.
- That's what I said.

125
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,220
Do you feel ready for fall
and school and preschool?

126
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,620
- No.
- No, I think the summer break has been too short.

127
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:33,780
Do you feel ready for the fall?
Comment below. Below...

128
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,860
I will swing some more now.

129
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:53,780
- Harry says he wants to swing on his own. I can't push.
- I taught him to swing on his own yesterday.

130
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,460
Nice, Harry!

131
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,120
- Can I push?
- Yes.

132
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,240
We have already answered some questions,
but we will answer a Question of the Day.

133
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,740
It has to do with that basketball.

134
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,500
Ebbe Petraeus asks:
"What activities will Alma and Harry do this fall?"

135
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,380
Good question.

136
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,340
I will go to riding school
and play basketball.

137
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,120
- That's what Alma wants to do.
- No, I will.

138
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,780
Okay.

139
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,940
- Harry, you will continue to play football, right?
- Yes.

140
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:45,100
I will continue to work out the way I already do.
I run, do yoga and strength train.

141
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,780
I'm looking to build my physique on a more professional
level so I will try to find a good personal trainer.

142
00:13:53,960 --> 00:14:00,380
Thank you for watching this video!

143
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,960
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

144
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,460
Recommend, ask questions
and take care until next time.

145
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,820
Bye bye!
