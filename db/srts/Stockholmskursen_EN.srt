1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,900
"Every year, 20,000 people move to Stockholm".

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,500
"Many of these feel that they have difficulty fit in".

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
"That is why we have created the Stockholm course".

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,020
Well! It is I who lead the Stockholm course. I'll teach you to fit in.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,720
"We teach you to change your behavior through exercises".

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,780
What do you work with, then?

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,800
Stop. Why do you direct your attention?

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,280
Nice.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,780
Go and sit down.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,300
"And we learn to communicate properly".

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,660
Either you are from the south or from the north of Stockholm ...

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,360
You also learn how to speak Stockholm

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,740
For example: "Excuse me, may I go by?", Will be: "Move you".

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,020
Women voice: How do you translate "I was wrong"?

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,480
What does it mean?

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,200
"On the excursions you will learn from really sharp situations".

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,020
It is more difficult to get past if you stand in the way.

18
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,020
It is easier if you are not in the way.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,320
A bit like that.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,300
How to do if someone is like this?

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,860
You pass by?

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,420
No, we're not heartless

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,880
Cocking: No! We move the person off the bike lane so people can get by. So!

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,460
"There is also time for question time".

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,720
Men's voice: Do you think Stockholmers that you are better than everyone else?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,540
No absolutely not. We know we are.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,080
Women's voice: Isn't that a little over?

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
Cocking: She says that with the ugly sweater!

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,400
"Now search as a successful Stockholmers with us".

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,860
They are so j*vla left

31
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,620
I'm not palleting this course

32
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,860
You can go home, because it's over.
