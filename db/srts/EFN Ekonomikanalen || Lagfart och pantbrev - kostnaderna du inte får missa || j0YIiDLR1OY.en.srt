1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
Four million, six million, ten million ...

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.360
Yes, it's a lot of money.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.960
Probably the housing purchase is one of the biggest investments you make in your life.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.320
We will find out what you need to keep track of, what fees are added

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.800
before standing there with the keys in your hand.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.280
We start with the most basic.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.640
You have to find out everything yourself.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.720
It is important to avoid surprises.

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.720
Erik Berglöf has bought and sold several houses and knows what he is talking about.

10
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.160
The better prepared you are, the smoother it goes.

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.520
Some costs you may not miss when buying houses

12
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.120
are they for law and mortgage deeds.

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.320
Team speed, once meant "Law Faren".

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.520
One had received a purchase verified, registered

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.040
or in some way confirmed by the legal apparatus.

16
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.560
Then they registered their purchase contract with the court or the thing.

17
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.400
So it has continued, but the business has been transferred to the Land Survey

18
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.440
which has the property register.
 Pant is as it sounds.

19
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.560
This is something that you pledge for something.

20
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.960
It is often a debt or borrowing money.

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.880
My name is Mats kind and I am the manager of innovation at Lantmäteriet.

22
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.040
Yes, it costs a lot to register teams and mortgage deeds.

23
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.280
What did he say is it very expensive?

24
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.000
Yes, it costs a lot to register team quotes and mortgage deeds

25
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.640
People think normally.
 One forgets that the whole cost-

26
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.680
Consists of slightly different things.

27
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.320
One is that you pay for the procedure to register a law enforcement.

28
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.080
Then you submit an application for the property enrollment at the Land Survey.

29
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.760
It's a job.
 One controls the documents, that it goes right to

30
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.600
And that the right formalities are fulfilled.

31
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.840
It is the same with the pledge.
 There shall be a pledging registered

32
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.720
When you have mortgages.

33
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.960
It is easy to believe that just because you have reached a final bid and got to buy

34
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.920
that it is the final payment for a property purchase.

35
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.160
If a private person is to register a law enforcement

36
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.880
you have to pay 1.5 % in stamp tax.

37
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.760
It all weighs into the cost of buying a property.

38
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.560
It is calculated on the purchase price, so it will be a fairly large amount.

39
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.440
It is 2 % on the mortgage amount.
 Do you want to pledge the property

40
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.880
And there are no mortgages, you have to take out a new mortgage.

41
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.480
It can also be quite a lot of money.

42
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.560
That which often bursts in panther and mortgages

43
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.040
is that you may not know how much you have pledged the property for.

44
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.280
There are mortgages registered with amounts in the property register.

45
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.080
But the debt may be lower than what is registered in the property register.

46
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.920
I have bought several houses, so it is very careful about this.

47
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.640
If you do this homework from the beginning, there will not be much problem.
