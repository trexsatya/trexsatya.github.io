1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.680
The dull and production -inhibiting summer is finally over

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.200
And EFN stock exchange lunch is back.
 Today Monday 12 August we have plenty to talk about.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.280
Come along.

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.320
Heavy the CEO, a turbulent outside world

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.880
And two lead -heavy guests in the studio.

6
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.200
Welcome Fredrik Skoglund and Mattias Eriksson.
 Has summer been good

7
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.840
Yes I think so.
 -giantbra.

8
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.320
But the stock exchange wasn't the top?
 -Very volatile.

9
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.480
No further report period either.
 -You have some pictures.

10
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.080
We have technical problems.
 The resolution was too low on Mattia's summer pictures from the mine.

11
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.160
But we will talk about it and much more.
 First to ABB.

12
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.080
Today's big news.
 -Absolutely.

13
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.600
Great for ABB, boring for Sandvik.

14
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.120
The course graph shows today's stock exchange reaction.
 I have not figured out how much he is worth.

15
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.000
There must be a few billion.

16
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.600
Does the market count in too much?
 -No, too little.

17
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.920
Too little?
 -Annatly di.se doubles the course now.

18
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.880
So then 4 % seem stingy.

19
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.560
Surely it was Gardell who thought so?
 -Yes.

20
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.120
Finally there is hope for ABB.

21
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.000
The company is right in time with energy efficiency, automation

22
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.480
Digitization ... Now there is expertise in ABB.

23
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.920
ABB is too big, loud, bureaucratic and official control ...

24
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.880
But all that Björn Rosengren can change so that it becomes a completely different company.

25
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.280
Less, more focused, better and more shareholder friendly.

26
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.120
Over to the next course graph before Fredrik takes over.

27
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.360
It shows both shares since Rosengren took over in Sandvik, in November 2015, I think.

28
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.760
What do you think about ABB, Fredrik

29
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.800
Should one wait and see how the spin -off of Power Grids goes

30
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.800
They have a lot that lies in time, as I said.

31
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.200
But the structure is completely wrong.
 Björn Rosengren grew up in Atlas decentralized environment ...

32
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.520
He made Wärtsilä more decentralized.

33
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.400
Sandvik as well.
 He is really the right person for ABB.

34
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.840
ABB is too big and needs to be split up.

35
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.120
May ABB be so sluggish that not even our foremost business leader can fix it

36
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.840
No, you can solve.
 But it costs some during the journey.

37
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.240
Restructuring ... but will surely be good in the end.

38
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.480
A worthy challenge for him.
 -Sandvik, then?

39
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.840
Sandvik is probably in good condition when he chooses ...

40
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.720
The fact that he chooses to leave Sandvik is probably not a sign that the company is in poor condition.

41
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.600
He feels he is done and wants a new challenge, I think.

42
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.120
Sandvik flags for some concern in the report.

43
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.920
The business cycle, as Mattias said earlier.
 Q2: the orna were bad, q3s get worse

44
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.360
Generally in industry.
 Drawings, dismissals ...

45
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.920
We are well on our way into a cyclical fatigue.

46
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.200
Nice to jump off then stop at the top.

47
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.720
Sandvik would be like Atlas to resist the recession.

48
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.520
But it has not been tested.

49
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:58.760
But the businesses are cyclically sensitive.
 The cutting tools, as well as the mines ...

50
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.200
If SMT seems to be different opinions, according to the press.

51
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.920
Should they get rid of what they are finding out.

52
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.120
It may have affected his Belut.

53
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.920
More VDBETTER.
 Håkan Buskhe resigned from Saab.

54
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.560
He wants to get a new operational challenge in his career.

55
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.560
That's why he gets off.
 -For Saab has not gone as well.

56
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.440
No ... good order book, but worse margins, and above all worse cash flow.

57
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.200
Despite the new issue, the money does not flow into the company.

58
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.480
There may be reasons for greater concern.

59
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.600
But the money flows into an Austrian dog -year government bond.

60
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.240
The graph was previously shown in one of our programs, but I want to show it again.

61
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.240
Fascinating.
 Everyone wants to place money in the Austrian state paper

62
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.920
While the stock exchange goes like this at the end of summer.

63
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.200
Some reflection you are both moved ...

64
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.960
Is it to 2117?
 -Yes, a hundred year old.

65
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.880
Very exciting.
 -Fascinating.

66
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.600
Really.

67
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.640
Concern on the stock exchange ...

68
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.920
Mattias has a bouquet of safe paper.

69
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.440
Companies that perform well regardless of the business cycle.

70
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.120
No one is completely immune to cyclical changes

71
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:52.040
But companies with structural and perhaps even company-specific driving forces-

72
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.840
Can do well even in worse business cycle and troubled times.

73
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:04.000
Essity ... Swedish match I look directly in the picture.

74
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.440
Yes.
 Essity has the headwind now after long headwinds

75
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.000
And can ride that wave for another time.

76
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.400
An almost unique company for the Stockholm Stock Exchange with its stable products.

77
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.080
Toilet paper, diapers ... It is difficult to find similar products on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

78
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.960
Attractive.
 Grows steadily over time with a marginal improvement trip ahead.

79
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.800
Pay expensive for quality on the stock exchange

80
00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.000
So it is on the stock exchange at the moment.
 Some "Compounders" ...

81
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.840
Essity may not be that expensive, but some compounders are swindling.

82
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.240
While the cyclical companies get "whip" when there is concern about the brandy cure.

83
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.480
So will we continue with compounders

84
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.440
Or should the cyclical ...?
 Maybe there is a valuation bottom.

85
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.520
The hope is that when the stock market drops for various reasons ...

86
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.040
Economic turmoil, Trump tweets ...

87
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.680
When everything goes down, you can pick up quality companies at a low valuation.

88
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.800
Those who are usually traded quite high.

89
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.440
In Georgia, around 200 employees at Evolution Gaming are dissatisfied with their salary.

90
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.840
They earn around SEK 1,500 per month.

91
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.800
Is it a real problem for evolution gaming

92
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.280
In Evolution Gaming, the corporate culture seems to be strong.

93
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.400
They are good at product development, mainly the culture ...

94
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.400
In the figures you can see that much is done right.
 The company is growing and is successful.

95
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.960
Surprisingly, they suffer a strike, it is still serious.

96
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:59.120
We will see what reasons are behind it and how big it gets.
 A warning signal.

97
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:06.840
Over to our summer portfolios that were launched last spring.

98
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.680
Many competitors have had the reason with the return.

99
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.640
Even today's guests.
 First to yours, Mattias.
 I don't want to sound negative ...

100
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.440
Fantastic companies ... -But it's not over yet ...

101
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:29.560
August 15.
 -Billerud has not had it so easy.

102
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.280
Although the report was good.

103
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.600
The stock exchange is frustrating ... the companies ...

104
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.720
Humana reports on Friday.

105
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.080
The share has gone stable over the summer and also the company's development, I believe.

106
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.000
We'll probably see it on Friday.
 Both Munters and Billerud

107
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.440
Have performed better than I expected during the summer.

108
00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:02.040
Especially Billerud with cardboard machine 7 which I looked at now during the summer.

109
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.440
Pictures can be found on Mattias Twitter feed.
 -The fantastic movie ...

110
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.000
It has rolled up, as expected.

111
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.280
A long process remains to full capacity.
 I think they do 2022 ...

112
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.560
But it rolls on properly.

113
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.640
Sales of the forest, the mountain weight access ...

114
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.200
... got better than expected.
 A cash flow of SEK 8 billion, I think.

115
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.000
A lot of money in, good balance sheet ...

116
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.040
They have done everything right and the case is that Billerud goes from a negative cash flow

117
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:49.080
at 2.6 billion last year to 2 billion plus 2020, and 2.5-3 2021 ...

118
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.040
... feels reasonable.
 -What is the market dislike?

119
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.360
I do not understand it.
 -What do you think?

120
00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:01.040
I agree with.
 The transaction was more than people had believed

121
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.960
And then the courses rose in all forest -related paper.
 But now they are below the level-

122
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:11.240
When the transaction came ... substantial height has been taken for the economic mat.

123
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.880
They are cyclic ... -They talk about price pressure ...

124
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.640
... on some types of cardboard.
 Possibly that turmoil ...

125
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.320
A little odd considering the government bond we saw ...

126
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.040
Forest is stable, it also stands for hundreds of years.

127
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.360
It should be valued as a bond.

128
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:36.280
But the stock exchange does not make that interpretation of these papers.
 At least not yet.

129
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.480
Over to your summer portfolio.

130
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.720
This is what it looks like.

131
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:49.760
First to Stillfront.
 The next graph shows the price development for the shares.

132
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.360
Stillfront has backed a bit.

133
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.800
It has gone well for a year, but the summer was not advantageous.

134
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.240
Strange, because they bought the Canadian company Kixeye

135
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.120
That raises EBITDA by 30 %, according to Stillfront.
 The effect can be even greater-

136
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.640
on EPS.
 They have again raised money to make more acquisitions.

137
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.040
During the autumn there will probably be more acquisitions.

138
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.320
At the end of 2020, they may earn SEK 30 per share.

139
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.880
On rolling forward -looking ...

140
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:34.160
And it stands in around 230. Stillfront still does everything right.

141
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.400
Surprisingly, it did not gain momentum during the summer.

142
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.440
How is it valued?
 -Ev/ebit around nine times.

143
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.480
The cash flow generation is very strong.

144
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.200
Soon the net box will be positive.

145
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.880
They will make acquisitions that drive growth.

146
00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.400
They are cheaper than THQ and other acquisition machines in the gaming industry.

147
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.640
THQ has received too much attention.
 Lars Wingfors has done well, but ...

148
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.600
Does Stillfront miss a Lars Wingfors?
 -No.

149
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.280
Jörgen Larsson is at least as good.
 -He may not have the same ...

150
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.360
He is an old consultant originally.
 He was CEO of a consulting company.

151
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:27.280
He says what to do and delivers.
 He is good to have in an acquisition strategy.

152
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.560
He has clear rules on the way of working and what acquisitions they should do.

153
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.360
He is not Lars Wingfors.

154
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.680
Lars Wingfors may have the roots more ...

155
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.120
Jörgen is very clear and delivers.
 Both are good.
 They are different.

156
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.200
Can you speculate on what THQ does that stands out is it a matter of charisma?

157
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.720
Perhaps.
 Then they have a different ...

158
00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.760
The stock market has a harder time valuing browser and mobile-based games, I think-

159
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:08.040
Compared to other games.
 There is a discount on the browser and mobile games at present.

160
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.120
Interesting.
 You also like this company.
 -Absolutely.
 Very.

161
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.280
You like Husqvarna too.
 They were in your portfolio and have not had any dream summer.

162
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.200
In the Q2, they guided a little weak for the robotic lawnmowers.
 Otherwise it was totally okay.

163
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.920
I like this partly because I think robotic lawnmowers are beating in the US

164
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.320
the next three years.

165
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:37.360
The conversion from fossil fuel to battery -powered machines is very good

166
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.920
for demand, but also in a stock market perspective.

167
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.760
Husqvarna learns to get high ESG points.

168
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.840
Then you have the capital market day September 15.

169
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.400
There they will come with new goals for the next five or three years.

170
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.000
They will probably raise the marginal targets and be generally more positive.

171
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:04.520
Husqvarna, regardless of the business cycle, is a good share in the next few years.

172
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.920
One last reflection ... Munters was on your list.

173
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.760
No huge disasters, but still courageous.

174
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.240
The company is doing well.
 The share went up 14 % on the Q2 report.

175
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:22.600
Since then, Nordic Capital has gone down ownership, so now you have an overhang in the share.

176
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:29.840
But if you look at it until 2022, when the options

177
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.160
As the acting CEO even today ...

178
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.480
Klas Forsström starts today, and also the CFO Annette Kumlien.

179
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.040
Johan Ek and the Chairman of the Board Magnus Lindquist

180
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.000
Has options that expire August 31, 2022.

181
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.200
The strike price is SEK 45.

182
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.440
It will stand well over SEK 45 in 2022.

183
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:57.960
Then comes the overhang from Nordic Capital ... I hoped they would keep their share.

184
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.920
But now they have shown that they want a lower proportion, maybe down to zero.

185
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.840
Then it becomes a difficult technical overhang.

186
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.800
But the company itself performs better than expected so far.

187
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.520
Another misunderstood jewel.

188
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.880
So Munters, Stillfront and Husqvarna we put in the portfolio.

189
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.640
How should we top this, then

190
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.280
We do this tomorrow with Carl Armfelt and Oscar Karlsson

191
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.040
And when Karl is here, viewing questions usually tear in.

192
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.160
So go to Twitter and ask your questions or email us.

193
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.160
Gabriel, I missed something

194
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.920
Tomorrow 11.45, as usual.
 Have a good time until then.

195
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.240
Fun to be up and running again.
 Finally
