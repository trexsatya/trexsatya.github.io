1
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.720
c. sound mobile signal "Crazy Frog"

2
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.640
It's Leif.
 Tjena, Micke!

3
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.440
Well.
 Shouldn't they be in the hunting team anymore?

4
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.520
It was damn nice of you.
 Yes, but that would be nice.

5
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.240
We say so, Micke.
 See ya.

6
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.000
It was Micke.
 Now we are in the hunting team again.

7
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.600
I don't understand why we can't hunt as we have always done.

8
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.120
Have you seen our chips?
 Not a moose devil!
 We have thinned out.

9
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.400
- I have shot three, so animals are available.
 -Three Invalid Rims, Billy.

10
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.720
"My name is Billy and I am so good who has shot handicapped moose."

11
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.840
- I had shot them if I wanted to.
 - Yes, but you tried.
 And missed.

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.400
I shot warning shots to drive them away.

13
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.800
How do you think it looks if they run around and multiply?

14
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.040
We get the forest full of piss.

15
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.240
You get a tie mask only if you see the moose you shot.
 It is called wildlife care.

16
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.720
If they want to see the licenses we are smoked.

17
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.120
God damn!
 We have laser printers.
 We can print what we want.

18
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.760
You are good at "Paint", so just print a license.

19
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.760
Then I'll take Tony's damn last year's record of three moose.

20
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.600
Did you hear that the wolf took two sheep at Matsson?

21
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.480
Soon you dare not release the kids.

22
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.720
- What the hell, have you invited them here?
 -Quiet.
 I owe Leif a favor.

23
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.520
- And we need people for the hunting team.
 - You know how they set for me.

24
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.400
- Micke, damn what a wonderful to be with!
 - Rocko!
 How big you have become.

25
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.120
- Hunting license - do you have it, right?
 - Yes, what the hell do you think?
 It's done.

26
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.960
- We are probably no fucking amateurs.
 - Yes, that's good.

27
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.080
- Hold still, then.
 - But what the hell, let me go!

28
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.200
- Does anyone start to be afraid of competition?
 -No.

29
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.280
We will shoot other than hedgehogs.

30
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.360
There are none, but you may have received the license on "9-Eleven".

31
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.800
Sharpen.
 Now we hand out the passports and then we run.

32
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.320
- Check, a hedgehog!
 Are you going to run?
 -Have you become a standup comedian?

33
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.440
Okay, are you on the passports?

34
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.440
C.Teletext.urfjarran - JO.
 - Yeah.

35
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.640
Yes.
 Leffe Öhman is in position.

36
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.840
-Ready.
 -Fine.
 Then I go with Rocko.

37
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.120
C. soundlord

38
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.120
C. soundstigmer animal sound

39
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.840
Wait.
 Something fucking sound here.

40
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.840
c. sound imitates animal sounds

41
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.040
C.Teletext.urfjarranet Anyone where the sound comes from?

42
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.680
I sound like a brown moose, so the cows get a little spiked in the berry.

43
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.320
Leif, shut up when you're on a pass!
 You don't know anything!
 You sound disturbed.

44
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.480
The dog gets completely confused.

45
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.280
Who the hell brings a confused dog that does not see a difference between man and moose?

46
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.040
That's enough!
 Run again!
 Leif, keep quiet if it confuses.

47
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.840
Well, okay.

48
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.240
Damn people don't know how to hunt.

49
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.280
c. sound imitates animal sound

50
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.360
Okay, calm and nice.
 I will release you.

51
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.600
Go for it!

52
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.080
The C. sound dog barks

53
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.280
Rocko has got track.
 Seems to move towards Billy.

54
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.480
C.Teletext.urfjarranbilly, pass up.
 He's coming to you.

55
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.960
c. sound imitates animal sound

56
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.800
C. sound rifle shot

57
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.160
C.Teletext.urfjarranbilly here.
 Shot a moose calf.
 Located 75 meters in front of my pass.

58
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.160
Cursed!

59
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.920
C.Teletext.urfjarranden lies.
 Over and out.

60
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.720
YES!

61
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.600
- Good, Billy!
 Nice shot.
 - was damn good.

62
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.440
- Congratulations, Billy!
 - thank you, Ronny.

63
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.360
Have we started shooting moose children now?
 Good, Billy.
 No rifles are needed.

64
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.920
It had been enough with a dart arrow.
 We have to find the mother who is feeling bad.

65
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.000
- Good, Billy!
 -Stop.
 It is an annual calf you see well.

66
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.000
It looks like a harmless turkey.
 Not worth a twig.

67
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.080
Good job, Billy!
 Really nice.
 You have inherited your dad's hunting genes.

68
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.160
-Do you think?
 -Absolutely!

69
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.680
The brother has inherited the mother's genes and fades like a girlfriend.

70
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.600
- A twig you should have!
 -Thanks so much.
 It sits well.

71
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.080
We get help to take this out and we will have lunch later.

72
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.920
There you have a racker too.

73
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.760
Cheers for Billy!
 First moose this year.
 Learn to become more.

74
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.080
- With such speed you hit my record.
 -We'll see!

75
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.800
Where is Leif?

76
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.480
"It's a last year's calf."

77
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.440
Don't you think I see it?
 But should you get a twig ...

78
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.040
C. sound rifle shot

79
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.440
Satan!

80
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.520
What do you say now?

81
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.320
160 meters, sneaky and fucking, but I "snapped" into his eyes.

82
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.760
- Fantastic, damn how good you are.
 - Thanks, Tony.

83
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.840
How?
 Time for the twig to Leffe Öhman?

84
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.040
Are you completely stupid?
 For real?
 We are on moose hunting.

85
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.040
You know what a moose looks like.
 That is a Tjäder.

86
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.080
If we can shoot moose children, can we count on this one?

87
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.320
Right?
 It is almost as big as the turkey he shot.

88
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.160
Still a moose.
 It's a bird.
 Just do I think it's strange?

89
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:34.040
This is not Stockholm with customs fees and trams and 7-Eleven.

90
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.440
It's the forest!
 Here the animals run freely and you shoot what you see.

91
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.840
- It's the whole point of hunting.
 - Tony is right, Leif.

92
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.200
God damnit!
 You can't shoot a Tjäder now.

93
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:56.120
If you had come home with such a nice tether, I would have given you a twig.

94
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.920
Yes, I don't know ...

95
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.520
Happ!
 The Skanenjägarn was right!
 He won, we drive it.

96
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:19.800
How long should you be sipping - all day?
 Fy fuck.
 You can email when you are ready.

97
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.680
Well, it's time.
 We're running.
 Cheers, Billy!

98
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.600
Bowl!

99
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.880
Cursed.
 Hell.

100
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.240
Leif, do you want to run your sex sounds or what it was?

101
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.240
My God, you can just get started.
 I don't have my whole life.

102
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.280
Then you save them for next time.
 I release Rocko, then we drive.

103
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.880
So, run away!

104
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.680
C. sound dog shell

105
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.600
Rocko has got some track.

106
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.280
Leif, he's on his way to you.

107
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.200
Closer.
 Come on, your fat bastard.

108
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.840
C. sound imitates moose

109
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.480
Cursed!

110
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.640
Billy, don't shoot!
 He is mine!

111
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.560
Billy!

112
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.800
Billy!

113
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.200
Fy Satan!
 YES!

114
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.080
- What the hell are you doing, Leif?
 -Move!

115
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.400
Leif, what are you doing?

116
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.520
Leif!

117
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.000
- I ... - put off!
 You've shot enough today.

118
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.640
This is mine.
 Yes, Leif Öhman here.

119
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.560
I have taken it, at Billy's passport.
 I shot, so he's stone dead.

120
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.920
Damn!
 Nice, Leif!
 Really nice.

121
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.400
I heard how Billy missed, so I ran after and shot the fanfare.

122
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:06.360
Now is the time for the twig, huh?
 The big hunter should get the trophy.
 Tony?

123
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.000
Say like it is instead, Leif.

124
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.320
Fy damn what a fucking ...

125
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.120
There we have it, the twig.

126
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.800
You know?
 You can get this one instead.
 You can just run and pick it up.

127
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.240
As you drove on the moose, we do not need a dog.

128
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.360
- What the hell are you mingle about?
 - Billy shot, I saw it.

129
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.640
You ran around like Rambo.
 You shot, Billy.
 Right?

130
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.320
Well, it was, actually.

131
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.400
It is no more than fair.
 It goes to you.

132
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.880
- Here we have the real hunter!
 -Thanks.

133
00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.360
Come here.

134
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:04.440
Leif, to shoot a tether I can agree to, but ...

135
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:11.200
... to twist a trophy in that way.
 It is not OK.

136
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.040
Bill pan!
 Bill pan!
 Bill pan!

137
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.560
- bowl for the king!
 - Yes, bowl for fucking.

138
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.920
Billy should come along the next time we go out and look for a wolf.

139
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.680
Leif can also come along.
 He may be able to attract the wolf with his lure calls.

140
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.600
Or sound like a wolf!
 Leif!

141
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.840
Run that goose or whatever it was, it was nice!

142
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.040
It sounded so alive!
 For real!

143
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.120
Come on now, we hear!

144
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.320
- I go and piss.
 - Now he got angry.

145
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.920
C.TELETEXT.Sangc.sanghelan goes C.Sangsjung Hopp Faderallan Lallan Lion

146
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.840
C.Teletext.sangc.sanghelan goes C.Sangsjung Hopp Faderallan lion

147
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.640
Idiots!
 Sound like a wolf ...

148
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.080
C. sounded animals murmur

149
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.760
It's the Wolf Devil!

150
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.240
And then the old man said: Hi, I had no legs.

151
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.640
- Bill for Billpan!
 -Bowl.

152
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.800
C. sound rifle shot

153
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.400
What the hell was that?

154
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.720
Do you know what this is?

155
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.280
The weapon I murdered the wolf devil with!

156
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.680
- What the hell are you talking about, Leif?
 - Do you hear badly?
 I murdered the wolf!

157
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:41.520
- Did you take the wolf devil?
 - Yes, yes, yes!
 The wolf pussy is dead.

158
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.920
- We must see that.
 - Yes, go and watch.

159
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.840
Damn, how dark it is.
 I don't see a shit.

160
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.960
Light the lamp, Tony.

161
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.840
Who is the big hunter now, huh?

162
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.840
c.kudleif Ylar like a wolf

163
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.120
- Oh, go to hell ... —Fy fuck, damn village!

164
