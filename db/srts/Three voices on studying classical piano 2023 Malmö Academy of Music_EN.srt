1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,709
Playing classic piano is really one of the most rewarding activities you can do.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,607
My name is Francisca Skogh and I am a piano teacher at Malmö School of Music.

3
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:20,000
I teach my students how to interpret a score and how to improve technically,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,671
And how to handle their appearance on stage.

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,667
Another important aspect of teaching is to help students find their own artistic voice;

6
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:37,197
Something that I think is important; Being able to interpret the great masters,

7
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:41,602
Both living and dead, by the great repertoire of classic piano.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,727
My name is Tuija Hakkila and I am a guest professor at the Malmö School of Music.

9
00:00:51,198 --> 00:01:01,644
I think it is very important that the students get different input

10
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:09,070
From different teachers at this stage when they have professional studies.

11
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,070
Come on, test!

12
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:25,463
How did it feel?

13
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:35,340
For me it is also important to create more collaborations between Scandinavian

14
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:41,930
Music schools, because we all live so close to each other.

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,902
And for me it is interesting to get to know the students who come to Masterclass,

16
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:56,372
But which I can't just meet once. Here I can meet them maybe four times a year.

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:08,429
The Malmö School of Music is very interesting because, although it has a small piano department,

18
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:19,174
If all students are very eager to learn, and I think the atmosphere is good.

19
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:25,349
They come to common lessons and listen to masterclasses.

20
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,650
It sounds good!

21
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:44,864
My name is Julia Isaksson and I study classic piano at the Malmö School of Music.

22
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,760
After my studies in London at the Royal Academy of Music,

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,556
I decided to apply for the diploma program here in Malmö because I wanted to study for Francisca Skogh.

24
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,760
Our class here in Malmö is quite small but still very international

25
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:20,000
And the school offers lots of exercise opportunities as well as fantastic instruments.

26
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,480
I feel that you really get the help and support you need to find

27
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:36,340
its own artistic identity, as well as explore and learn new repertoire

28
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:44,920
And prepare for competitions. As well as meet fantastic guest professors.

29
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,060
As a diploma student here

30
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,420
Do you have the unique opportunity to act as a soloist with a professional

31
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,455
Symphony orchestra, which is just a fantastic opportunity for young musicians.

32
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Welcome to the Music University in Malmö.
