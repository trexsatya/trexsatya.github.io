1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,320
Time for another exam.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,680
Do you feel like you've forgotten
everything you knew last night?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,720
Then you should use an exam strategy.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,760
Be full and well-rested.
Old news, sure, but it really does help.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,120
First, read through the whole exam
to get an understanding of what is in it.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,600
That way, there won't be
any unpleasant surprises at the end.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,520
It's helpful to highlight all the verbs.
What do they expect you to do?

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,480
There could be more than one question
in each task. Number them.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,000
If you don't quite understand
a question, ask your teacher.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,400
They can elaborate and use
different words to describe the task.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,200
That way, you'll know you're answering
the question at hand.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,400
Ask your teacher to tell you the time
at regular intervals.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Then you won't need
to keep track yourself.

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,400
A really useful part of this strategy
is to leave a bit of time at the end.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,440
Use it to go over your answers again.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,680
That way, you can spot any errors
before your teacher does.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,000
Make a habit out of these steps
every time you take an exam:

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,840
Read through the whole thing, number
the questions, highlight the verbs-

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,120
-ask questions, keep track of the time-

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,080
-and go over your answers
before handing them in.
