1
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.440
-Hell!
 What happens, Leif?
 -I do not know.
 Take it easy.

2
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.240
What the hell...

3
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.880
The name, who do we have here, then?
 Little Billy and Thick-Leffe.

4
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.080
Hello, Damp-Janne.

5
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.640
It seems to be going pretty well for you.
 New house and everything.

6
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.320
Where did you get the money from?

7
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.680
Reply when I talk to you, fat!

8
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.960
Yes, we have ... saved some, so ...

9
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.880
Well, you've saved?

10
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.880
How good you are.
 But I thought of a thing.

11
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.040
It's a bit strange that while someone steals 700,000 from us -

12
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.360
- So you buy this piss truck.

13
00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.640
Yes, as I said, we have actually taken care of and saved some.

14
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.440
I think there are more Billy called Billy here in the areas ...

15
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.760
There is one down in Sörbyn, I know.

16
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.440
Damn...

17
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.040
No ... oh, no, no, no!

18
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.120
Little fucking rat!
 You turned money from us.

19
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.280
-Stand on you.
 Not a word.
 - Known!

20
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.760
- Make something, Leif!
 - Billy, don't say a word!

21
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.960
Good, Billy.

22
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.040
Thick-Leffe, your little pig ... it was you like ...

23
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.320
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
 We were.
 Or, Billy found them and twisted them.

24
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.200
Then we bought houses for all money.

25
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.760
So you gave 700,000 for this fucking piss?

26
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.080
- How fuck should we solve this?
 - We do anything ...

27
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.760
Oh, no, we do anything.
 Janne, whatever!

28
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.960
You will have to pay!

29
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.920
- Snip, we do anything!
 - Done fucking pissluder!
 Fuck!

30
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.160
Janne, Janne ...

31
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.560
Quiet.

32
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.720
- What the hell is that?
 - AMPETAMINE TO THE NORTH NEXT WEATHER ...

33
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.480
Last time we did business with them they blew us.

34
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.920
- We send the thicknesses.
 - Delivering the thick?

35
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.320
Exactly.

36
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.400
You are absolutely right, Jimmy.
 Get the bag.

37
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.000
- Now you work for me, your fucking.
 -We do anything, Damp-Janne.

38
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.880
You will deliver half a kilo of amphetamine to Stockholm for me.

39
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.280
And then you will make sure to get the money from the store, to me.

40
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.360
If you fuck this up, I cut off Little Billy's small knees here -

41
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.320
- And make minced meat of them, which you will be allowed to eat then.

42
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.760
You have 24 hours on you.

43
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.560
Now we are at risk, I can say.

44
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.640
God cursed.
 Better to kill yourself and settle in the family grave -

45
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.120
- Entry to have such leather bumps on the neck.

46
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.800
- Attempts be a little calm, Leif.
 -How?
 With that shit in the house!

47
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.960
We can try to think a little more positively about it.

48
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:26.280
Positively?
 Why have I not thought about it, that you can think positively?

49
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.360
Then we can go down with Lill-Volvon and take the opportunity to go on Gröna Lund.

50
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.880
Then we can eat sugar candy and go shopping for clothes in Ullared.

51
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.760
- What a good idea!
 Now I get calm.
 - You look, it works.

52
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.840
God damn!
 What happened to your skull when you got out of your mother's vulva?

53
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.280
It became one fucking chromosome error.
 Did you crash the fontanel to the floor?

54
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.680
Think, damn!
 We shall deliver death -gossip -

55
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.000
-To some mafioso leader in Stockholm from some fucking league.

56
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.160
And you sit like a bird's nest and want to think positively?

57
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.120
We have to go.
 Dress yourself, you can't look like any small chubby session.

58
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.520
Put on your leather pie from the student.
 Now it's sharp, boy.

59
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.960
Do you think they can do it?

60
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.960
If not, we may move abroad.
 Then we are driven.

61
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.680
- The league never lets us down then.
 -We have no choice.

62
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.840
--Hm.
 I go there and monitor it.
 - Fan, are you snappy?

63
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.200
Make sure it doesn't hurt.
 I stay at a distance.

64
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.520
- Why do you smoke?
 - All criminals do.

65
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.280
It shows power and a "I am not afraid of death" attitude.

66
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.480
-Attitude?
 -Yes.

67
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.760
Yeah?
 You fuck with me, yes?
 You see these motherfucking killer eyes?

68
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.720
If you fuck with my relatives and provoke me, I'll kill your relatives.

69
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.600
Yeah, I'm the devil.
 - Do you understand?

70
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.840
Test!

71
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.240
Yeah!

72
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.200
You ... you little ... you are stupid.

73
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.840
I hate you!

74
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.600
-You ... you want to fuck with me?
 -Oh my God.

75
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.400
God cursed, Billy.
 You can't look like that and behave.

76
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.840
You get to practice on the way down.

77
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.040
Yeah, you like fucking?
 You fuck me first, then I fuck you.
 Okay, deal?

78
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.960
You know what I'm gonna do with you?
 Be Afraid, because I'm Billy the ...

79
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.720
-Satan!
 –... Fuck Machine.

80
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.520
Silent, Billy!
 Dun!
 They have certainly had a spark on us.
 Satan!

81
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:23.560
It will be imprisonment for 25 years, I promise.
 Sit and rot in some fucking cell.

82
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.040
Satan!

83
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.760
Satan in hell, now it's run!

84
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.560
- oh, fuck ... - hell ...

85
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.760
-What are you doing?
 - Imagine.

86
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.440
-Positively?
 - I don't think positively!

87
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.920
What do we do with the drug?
 Having it in the car is too risky.

88
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.360
We have to do in some other way.

89
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.080
It was near the eye, Billy.

90
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.840
- "Knotty with a taste of licorice."
 - The girls like when I have such.

91
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.320
- The package was unopened.
 - I may use one a week.

92
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.000
- "Extra small, best before" ... - but God damn ...!

93
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.520
Hold in. So, pour in here.

94
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Satan ...

95
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.480
- Don't spill.
 Try to hit the hole.
 -I try to!

96
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.440
So.
 It will be fine.

97
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.600
Satan ...

98
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.800
So.
 Swallow it.

99
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.040
- I don't like licorice.
 -We have no choice.

100
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.800
If we come across a dog patrol, then this is the safest way.

101
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.320
I have to push it up from the other side.

102
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.520
Not in the car.
 Out here.
 Do not hold on to the car, the filth.
 Out!

103
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.680
Quiet.

104
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:47.160
Now they are soon in Stockholm, but they have something fucking fuffens for themselves.

105
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.560
Satan, it is not possible.
 Was your less?

106
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:59.120
Jump into the car now.
 You may swallow it as other people.

107
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.240
- Billy, hurry up now!
 - It's not possible, I'll come.

108
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.880
I don't know if I can do this ...

109
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:48.440
If you have entered the crime, you have to run the line.
 It's fine.

110
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.320
- Come again now, the brother!
 -We'll fix it.
 C.Lndelif's stomach mudders

111
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.040
- Fan, I think a condom broke.
 –Wa?

112
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:09.200
c. soundbilly's stomach rumble

113
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:09.200
Hell, what it was burning to.
 I think a burst with me too.

114
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.280
- How long have you had the condoms?
 - Yes, they are not purple.

115
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.440
-What happens?
 The whole stomach burns.
 - Yes, what do you think happens by death?

116
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.400
- Her God ... I'm starting to feel effect.
 - Now it gases on, I can say.

117
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.280
- I feel dry in the gums.
 - It's like I should give birth to children.

118
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.840
- Fan, what a nice!
 - I have never felt this way!

119
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.800
- Who wants to argue with "The Druglords"?
 - i'm gonna fuck you right up the ass.

120
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.080
- Fan, what horny and cool I am!
 –You Wanna Fuck With Us?

121
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.200
It presses!

122
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.080
I feel like a brown deer!

123
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.120
We go there, shit out the drug, get the money and go home.

124
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.840
-Good!
 -Okay.
 Now damn ...

125
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.280
- Well!
 - Yeah, who do we have here, then?

126
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.440
Damp-Jan's new running boys?

127
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.520
So he was too cowardly to come today too, the little thorn?

128
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:50.720
And what does he send?
 Two semi -fat bonn lips.
 Where the hell is my jacket?

129
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.680
Yes, now maybe it has become a small incident here that we can probably solve ...

130
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.040
The drug you are talking about, we have been inserted into the intestinal tract.

131
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:08.000
We smuggled it in condoms, and then one ... or two burst.
 Or all.

132
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.200
- We thought to shit it out.
 - What the hell are you saying?

133
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.080
He says the drug is in our anal holes.

134
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.360
I hear what he says, but this is no fucking game!

135
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.240
- Lugn ... –Okay, I understand.

136
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.160
Satan!
 Waoo!

137
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.000
Satan ...

138
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.480
You don't touch my brother, your damn anabolic pig.

139
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.200
Damn, it's going to hell.

140
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.880
Now you are not so cocky, the beard steak.

141
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.000
Are you going to sleep?
 Good night, sleep a little.

142
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.560
- Hi, Oops!
 How does this feel?
 - It's not over yet, damn Bonnläpp!

143
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:35.360
Let me do it.
 - Do you remember this bottle?

144
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.120
What the hell?

145
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.360
What the hell?

146
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.680
Fy damn, I have to shit.

147
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.080
Fy fuck ...

148
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.840
Satan ...

149
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.520
Satan ...

150
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.520
How's it going, Leif?
 Can I do anything?

151
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.720
Fy damn, I'm so damn bad.
 Oh my God.

152
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:50.360
I have to get mine out.
 I think I have internal bleeding, I don't feel good.

153
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.440
My God, Damp-Janne will kill us.

154
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.600
- I have to call him.
 - Do you really?

155
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.560
We have no choice.
 We have swamped the whole shit.

156
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.840
Cursed ...

157
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.440
- Janne.
 - Hi, it's Leif.

158
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.480
-How's it going?
 -It is quiet.

159
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:25.320
-How are you?
 Is everything cool?
 - It's like that.
 You know ... yes ...

160
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:31.520
A small thing has happened.
 We didn't really get the money ...

161
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:38.200
Shit in the money, we don't want any trouble.
 I heard what happened yesterday.

162
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.360
We don't want any problems.
 We hear, Leffe.
 Hello!

163
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.760
