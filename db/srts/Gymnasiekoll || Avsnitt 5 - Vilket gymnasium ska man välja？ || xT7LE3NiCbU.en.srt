00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03.328
Many programs can usually be read at several different schools.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08.448
Have you decided to read the community program but do not really know which school you want to attend?

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:13,824
Absolutely understandable. I will meet some high school students to ask why they chose their school.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,224
Come along!

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,824
Why did you just choose your school? Was it something that was extra important to you?

6
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,792
I chose the design gymnasium because I want to plug in design.

7
00:00:23,848 --> 00:00:27,792
Then the design gymnasium feels almost like the obvious choice.

8
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:30,292
And then I thought the situation very well at Kungsholmen.

9
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:35,692
I come from a school with over 1000 students. So coming to a small school felt very nice.

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,000
I chose my school because I heard about it through other friends.

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:45,376
And I thought it was nice to go into town and leave the schools where I have lived before.

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54.016
What is important here and the thing for me is that I see several cultures as well as from different countries.

13
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,624
And you can learn a lot from cultures and nationality.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,696
And in the language you can develop further.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06.660
Why did you just choose your school? Was it something that was especially important to you?

16
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09.990
I chose Queen Blanka Kungsholmen because it is close to me.

17
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:12,860
They have the direction that I am most interested in.

18
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,264
And I wanted to go to a small school.

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
So that you ...

20
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,360
You get community and you do not feel alone.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064
The most important thing for me was probably both the teaching and what I read.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,440
It was not much about where school was low or the food or so without it was the most

23
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
That I wanted to attend a good technology school.

24
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,816
As you understand.

25
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41.888
It is very individual what you choose to appreciate yourself.

26
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44.648
Try to think about what is important to you.

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,976
The situation, recommendations or how the teachers are.

28
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
One step closer to high school!
