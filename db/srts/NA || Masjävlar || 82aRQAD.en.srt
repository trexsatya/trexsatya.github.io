1
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960
You, I can't get in today.

2
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.760
I'm on my way to Dalarna.
 I'll pick up a lamp.

3
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.080
And then Dad turns 70, so I go up to not have to hear the nagging om-

4
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.560
-"That I never come up, not even on Father's Birthday."

5
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.080
Party, are you crazy?
 In my family you only eat cake. "Cake, cake, cake."

6
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.280
Hello!

7
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.840
I told Father that I heard the car, but he didn't hear any car.

8
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.360
Hello, mother.

9
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.320
-Have you changed car?
 -Yes, it's probably six months ago.

10
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.440
-Gruits, father.
 -Thanks.

11
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.080
-What can this be?
 -You have to open and see.

12
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.560
-How could it drive?
 -Good.
 I'm just a little tired.

13
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.520
We celebrated my promotion yesterday.

14
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.840
-But it was the worst!
 - Did you hear, father?
 -Yes.

15
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.080
-Do you not triggered?
 -I should remain on Ericsson.

16
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.240
But instead of programming, I should become something called a system architect.

17
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.600
That's really good.
 Much better salary.

18
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.480
In Bali, there I drank coconut.
 Can you understand?

19
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.160
They pick them directly from the trees.
 The men climbing 'the very highest up-

20
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.320
-And they threw down the nuts.
 It was fantastic?

21
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.920
Nämen Margot, now you have to open your mouth!

22
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.640
Father mine is celebrating years, so I was hoping to get away in time.

23
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.440
You and I usually help each other, right?
 Now you make me happy!

24
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.200
Right?
 Imagine how happy I was now!

25
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.680
Now she has finally found home!
 My little little sister!

26
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.840
Hi, Ida!
 How big you have become!

27
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.360
-So you look!
 Are you going to a funeral?
 -Thanks for that...!

28
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.600
I don't understand that black fashion.
 No one will be happier about it?

29
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Now you still stay for a few days, so we get raw about you?

30
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.800
I have to go tomorrow.
 Do we have to talk about when to go?

31
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.920
Is it fun just that I'm here?

32
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.480
Why don't you take a few days off?

33
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.640
Damn, let's do huh!

34
00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.880
-Do you follow down on society?
 -I haven't been able to eat yet.

35
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.200
You know, it's a children's party in the village cottage, so we will not come in until one.

36
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.080
-What will we do there?
 -Duka to the party.

37
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.240
Ida!
 Don't you play that song?
 - We lay stomach aid the whole family.

38
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.200
So Ida has done a song ... - Ida, tell Grandpa what it's called!

39
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.160
"Stomachflu".

40
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.360
I haven't heard anything about any party.

41
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.280
No, it's a surprise party.
 - Father, you haven't heard anything?

42
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.240
Ida!
 Play now!

43
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.880
-Gunilla.
 -Where fuck are you somewhere?

44
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:11.600
I'm just trying to get some file before going with the bus.
 - Health!

45
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.960
Mm.
 Bye.

46
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.200
I don't understand what Gunilla would to Falun and do.

47
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.600
She sits in a little second.

48
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.680
Tommy helped to put up shelves.
 Her children did not have time.

49
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.640
He said the kitchen was so small that you could barely turn to.

50
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.800
You had to back out of Dass.

51
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:48.320
What are you going to do with such a nice car, you who live in town?
 A guy car!

52
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.880
-Ericsson had a collaboration with ... -There is Ingvar!

53
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.800
-If!
 Where are you going?
 -If!
 Tracking an injured moose.

54
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:10.520
There is some fucking skull that has put two shots in the ass on.

55
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:16.560
You learn to go there and clean up after the boys ...

56
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.880
-It wasn't the day before you saw you.
 -Mor is so happy - the little girl at home!

57
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.960
If you are really kind to uncle-

58
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.160
-Im I make sure you get a couple of bags of moose meat to Tjockholm.

59
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.840
Mine he works Å. - Fucking idiot.

60
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
-Af.
 -Af.

61
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:57.160
Do you know where the flower shop is located?
 See you at Hemköp in 30 minutes then.

62
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.320
Hello on you, Olle.

63
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.320
-Isn't it Mia?
 -Yes.

64
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:22.640
-I am Eva's sister.
 Eva in your class.
 -Yes!

65
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:33.560
-Yes ... What about Eva, then?
 -Good.
 She got twins this spring.

66
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.760
She has four children now.
 And you?
 Have you got anything small?

67
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.920
-No.
 -No.

68
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.720
I work so much.
 And so I don't live with anyone.

69
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.880
So you can do too.

70
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.840
Thank you.
 - I am in a little hurry, because we should have a party for father.

71
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.440
-Yes, I heard it!
 -Yes ... Yes, greet Eva, then!

72
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.600
-Yes, have a good time now.
 -Yes, you too.

73
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:28.920
It took 30 minutes.
 The others had been hunting for several hours.

74
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:36.080
But I couldn't get there until I saw behind the barn.

75
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.240
So I shot, and then I went.

76
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.400
-Do you have coffee?
 -Yes please.

77
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.440
I meet 'Eivor and Mia.

78
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.400
-What did you like about the car hers?
 -Uj uj uj, it has to go well for'na.

79
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.840
-And condominium she bought Å. -A, FY FAN!
 It costs gold money.

80
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.480
Shouldn't you show the gift card?

81
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.760
-Where do you have Kerstin, then?
 -She well strokes the fine costume.

82
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.920
Surely that is what you have in love with?

83
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.680
Oh, fuck!

84
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.840
-Then the V -75 was finished ... -check there!

85
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.600
Isn't that Mia Sundin?

86
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:32.960
Mia!
 Do you pick up Gunilla at the station, then Ida and I go with Tommy?

87
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.600
But, but, but, but, but!

88
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.880
Oh, what a long time ago!
 How long ago is it I got to hug you properly?

89
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:55.800
-How is the job?
 And the new apartment?
 -Good good.

90
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.680
But oh, oh, oh, how good you are!

91
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.320
-You look like a TV personality!
 -Mia!

92
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.120
-Do you pick up Gunilla at the station?
 -Yes.

93
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:15.680
Look who I find '!
 My favorite girl.
 - Hurry to Gunilla now.

94
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.800
-So how are you doing?
 -With me?
 Great!

95
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.520
You, nice hat!

96
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.280
But for the hell, the mother.

97
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.120
You have to go to Bali sometime!

98
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.280
It was absolutely wonderful!
 Such an incredible experience.

99
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:56.720
I was going to go there when we were in Malaysia, but we stay 'in Singapore.

100
00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:03.080
I've never been abroad.
 Me and Håkan never went anymore than Norway.

101
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:09.800
Now I feel that such a sun trip you want to do every year.
 Right?

102
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.960
Yes.

103
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.880
Then you have to be happier.

104
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.480
-What's going to happen for shit today?
 -Mäh!

105
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:26.440
Surely it is so?
 After all, some shit has always happened on Kalle's birthday.

106
00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.360
-It's ten years ago today.
 -Don't talk about it.

107
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:38.760
-Why not?
 He is dead.
 -Barbro doesn't like it.

108
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:46.040
-When Tommy cut his hand?
 Last year?
 -No, it was two years ago?

109
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.480
Last year Ida got an allergy shock.

110
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:57.120
Yes, what she shift 'color!
 From red to blue in 30 seconds.

111
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.080
Arvid knew what he was doing when he shot himself on Kalle's birthday.

112
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.720
Otherwise, no one would have remembered his day of death.

113
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.680
But imagine what happy Kalle and Anna will be when they have brought home Mia.

114
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.840
I was at the grave.

115
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.440
-I ids don't go there, me.
 -Morsan, it's ten years ago.

116
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.920
Too bad about.
 It was a pity if.

117
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
He didn't belong here.

118
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.760
He didn't belong here.

119
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.920
-Hello!
 -Hello!

120
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.080
-How did it go?
 -Good.

121
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.240
Hello all happy!

122
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.400
Don't look, then!

123
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.320
Congratulations, father!

124
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.560
Flowers from Bali.

125
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:06.400
Can you understand?
 A little girl, no more than six years, sold them on the street.

126
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.560
And fool 'tourists to buy the shit!

127
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.560
Yes, it's Mia.
 Well!

128
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.720
Gunilla, do you want coffee?

129
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:22.480
Yes ... but you, they are in my computer.
 No, you don't need a password.

130
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:28.120
Mm.
 No, there is no danger.
 Just call if there is anything.
 Well.

131
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.280
You sound like a Stockholm fuck!

132
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.520
-Yes, I happen to live there.
 -But you happen to be born here.

133
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.680
Therefore, is it a bit strange that you suddenly speak some Marsian?

134
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.640
Try to be taken seriously when you give a presentation on a dialect-

135
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.200
-What makes people think they should play the prisoners at the fort!

136
00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.280
Then it is better with the Marsian - then they think they should go on a space trip!

137
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.360
Have you seen any celebrities in Tjockholm, then?

138
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.680
Yes, I saw Gunde Svan at NK.
 He try 'hats.

139
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.640
Oh, fuck!

140
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.520
But I just have fun with you!

141
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:28.760
-Where are you going, then?
 -To barn and pick up some stuff.

142
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:34.720
But can't you sit down a bit?
 Father and I have something to tell.

143
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.240
Yes, we thought ... Father and I, we talk 'this morning.

144
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.400
If you want the plot down by the lake you get it.

145
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.560
Yes, you can build something!

146
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.720
It doesn't have to be anything big, just a summer cottage.

147
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.000
Just so you can have something your own when you get up.

148
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
-If!
 -You don't have to decide now.

149
00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.400
-What people it was here, then!
 -Mia has got the plot by the lake.

150
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:21.640
Yes, Mia.
 Take the plot you and sell it to the highest bidder.

151
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.480
There are many speculators, you see.

152
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.120
Or what do you say, Eivor?

153
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.920
-Where are you going, then?
 -I go out in the barn.

154
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.760
Well, now it became quiet.

155
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.920
But was there any coffee, then?
 Huh?

156
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.800
Helena, tie the shoes!

157
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.240
Johan, do you help Ida with the drink?
 It gets too heavy for '.

158
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.400
Go before you.
 I'll come later.

159
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160
I want to be 'myself.

160
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.880
What are you doing here?

161
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.040
I thought I'd wait for you.

162
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.200
I want to be 'myself.

163
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.560
Eivor?

164
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.840
You can only tell you what it is.

165
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.120
Mia has got the plot down by the lake.

166
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.520
You...

167
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.280
Open now.

168
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.600
-We don't need any empty.
 -It's about our girls.

169
00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.000
Helena would have had it!
 It is so typical that they give it to mia-

170
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.160
-She who didn't even want to have it.

171
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.640
Eivor ...

172
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:40.960
Surely it would be fun if Mia wanted to build something?
 Then she comes a little more often.

173
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.400
You are as much help as usual!

174
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.120
Will you come, then?
 Surely the others shouldn't have to do everything?

175
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.120
There is Eivor's girls!

176
00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:02.360
-Dina, then?
 When are they coming?
 -Lasse is on course.
 Victoria is coming.

177
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.680
She sleeps with Håkan, she has said.
 You know, they are disappointed at me-

178
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.720
-To I split 'the family.
 But it will probably be good.

179
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.040
After all, I haven't asked how you feel!

180
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:25.480
It has happened so much.
 I never thought my life would be like this.

181
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:32.760
-Do you have any contact with Håkan?
 -"Menopics" he calls me.

182
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.920
But that's what you are, right?

183
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.840
-You seem to feel great.
 -Do you think?
 No, do you think so?

184
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.040
-Hello!
 -Gunilla, what good!
 Come and take hold!

185
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:07.400
-Hello!
 How's it going?
 -Good!
 I've made potato salad.

186
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.360
Hi Aunt!

187
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.040
-This is my boyfriend Johan.
 -Hello.

188
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.360
Who has picked up my old fur?

189
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.680
I thought it was mother's.

190
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.360
-Don't gloss to put it back.
 -No.

191
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.040
But how did you place the tables?

192
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:49.640
-Tomy and Ingvar, Blow balloons!
 -Stina, do you help me with the tables?

193
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:55.920
Have you seen these?
 I thought we could put them around Father's place.

194
00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.840
-Not you want to have pink flowers!
 -But they are so nice.

195
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:08.960
Yes, yes, you do as you please.
 But I don't think he appreciates it.

196
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.120
Have you set the potato salad?

197
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.640
It was fun that you would like to build.
 I did not believe.

198
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:35.080
-I just promised to look at it.
 -Yes, but that there was interest.

199
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:41.360
I did not believe.
 Fun - then maybe I can get help with mother and far-

200
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.520
-Now when Gunilla settled in Falun.

201
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:50.480
I like it so well!
 But you would have seen what flowers they had in Bali.

202
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:57.120
If you get the chance, go there!
 That's the best thing I've done.

203
00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:04.760
Some of us do not think it is so special to fly and danger.

204
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:11.520
-All may not have that need.
 -I have always had that need.

205
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:18.400
When we turned 18, no one asked if we wanted to plug abroad.

206
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:24.440
-I arrange 'it myself.
 -They had never released us!

207
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:32.120
But what the hell is this?
 That they put a dirty cloth in the cabinet!

208
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:37.120
In public spaces, people shit in everything.

209
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.720
-No, isn't that the feature?
 -Do you need help?

210
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:48.000
He couldn't piss for a week, there was a completely stop in the machinery.

211
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:54.760
After three days he squeezed out a fever drop.

212
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:04.000
-No, now that fucking ... -I can get a little warm?

213
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:09.320
-Iven cat skull ... -What is it for the phone that rings?

214
00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.560
Oh God!
 I bought mobile!

215
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:20.480
Is Barbro at home?
 - You, I just stick to Barbro for a little while.

216
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.320
Hello?
 Yes, hello.

217
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:29.280
Mia!
 Barbro has weight napkins.
 Bring them!

218
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:52.720
-Do you remember any Eva in my class?
 -Eva Bäckström?

219
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.840
-Was she with her front teeth?
 -Yes.

220
00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:06.320
-What was it with her?
 -Hene's sister came to me.

221
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:13.640
I didn't recognize.
 I didn't know who she was talking about.

222
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:19.840
It's not that strange.
 You haven't lived here in fifteen years.

223
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.440
Barbro, you should add underfloor heating.

224
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.440
I have done that in my hall.
 And in the bathroom.

225
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.520
Who was it that helped you with it?
 Any nice guy?

226
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:41.880
I have no guy.
 I'm just working.
 I don't have time with love.

227
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:47.520
Listen ... What about you, really?
 Huh?

228
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.400
It's been a bit much, just.

229
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.760
... no interest in taking care of the forest, they should just hunt.

230
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.880
-No children can come.
 -But Viktoria, then?

231
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:19.880
-The train ticket became too expensive.
 -I must have it known before?

232
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:26.200
Is it good that they have their own lives?
 Right?
 I think that is good.

233
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.440
-Where are you going now, then?
 -To dass.

234
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.080
Not cry.

235
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.240
Don't cry, not cry ...

236
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.720
You are strong.

237
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.720
You are brave.

238
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.880
You are good.
 You are good!

239
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.640
Barbro?
 Why are you always so kind to me?

240
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:31.840
Because you need it.
 Silent little girls who go for themselves-

241
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.800
-They you have to keep an extra eye on - even when they grow up.

242
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:47.240
You, no one has asked me anything.
 Not even mother and father.

243
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.800
But they talk a lot about you when you are not here, you should know.

244
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:03.720
It's just ... I don't even think anyone knows what I'm working on.

245
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:10.520
-But Eivor and Gunilla, then?
 -Are you kidding?

246
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:17.720
Eivor is not interested in something that happens outside the Rättviks limit.

247
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:30.040
But you must tell them what you do, even though they do not ask.

248
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.400
-So do everyone else.
 Grind on!
 -But isn't it sick?

249
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:42.800
My family doesn't know what I do.
 No one has been greeted me for several years.

250
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.880
Everyone is complaining about me coming here.

251
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:53.000
But if I moved here, they would be interested in what I work with.

252
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.960
Because that's all that counts, to live in Dalarna ...!

253
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.120
-Imorse I got the plot by the lake.
 -What are you saying?

254
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:12.080
You would have seen Eivors mine.
 For me, she is happy to take it.

255
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:18.040
-You can at least look at it?
 -But stop now, you should support me!

256
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.240
-But it is a nice piece of land.
 -Can Barbro ...

257
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.040
-Do you know what Mia has in the hall?
 -No.

258
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.600
-GOV heating.
 -Oh!
 Yes, it was the worst.

259
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.680
But you, you have to show Mia how nice you have done.
 Yes you have to.

260
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.200
Take out and show!

261
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:49.360
-But I'm not done.
 -I am used to doing it myself.

262
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.600
-What nice you got it!
 -Thanks.

263
00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.240
-Have you started hunting?
 -No, it's dads.

264
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.200
But you...

265
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.240
-Bore your girl here too?
 -Camilla?

266
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.400
No, we're not ... she moves'.

267
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.520
-Do you haven't gone through everyone in the village?
 -No.

268
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:42.320
-No will probably be left ...!
 -Oh really?
 You mean that?

269
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:55.680
You ... you always chatter about how important it was not to stay.

270
00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:03.640
It has not been a situation ... Dad died and the mother is getting old.

271
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.840
You are starting to get old.

272
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.840
Yes, but I might be one then.
 One that remains.

273
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.280
Damn, it's Eivor!

274
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.840
I am going out.
 I'll stick, see you later!

275
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.880
Is she pregnant?

276
00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:00.280
-I was out yesterday.
 -It was to be small.

277
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.440
You!
 Say nothing to Eivor.

278
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.760
Let's see how I do.

279
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.880
Do you know that Skagg is going to Africa and drilling wells?
 He does not get a buck.

280
00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.160
But he learns to get a huge tan.

281
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:27.120
If you are going there, you should go as a soldier.
 Hell, what they get paid.

282
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:38.360
-What is it for a bride who runs here?
 -It's Mia Sundin.

283
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:44.720
Do you come and help me in the village cottage?
 Eivor will bring Mia on a walk.

284
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:49.880
-She should show the plot.
 -What empty?

285
00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.160
-We could go together somewhere.
 -To bali then, or ...?

286
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.120
I will have to work a lot ...

287
00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:12.800
-But how do you really live?
 -Yes, a little different than you ...!

288
00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.920
-"You"?
 -Yes.
 You have a family.

289
00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:24.040
You never go to the pub.
 You are not moving further than Rättvik.

290
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.920
I have divorced and been to Bali.

291
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:34.200
Yes, but you married the first guy you got along with.

292
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:40.240
Yes, I married the first, best guy, and I am proud of that.

293
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:46.240
Because up here you do not get tired of your man.
 Here you hold together.

294
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.080
Here you stand out - this is what is called a relationship.

295
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.800
This is not a fucking green grove.

296
00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.560
This is love.
 Deep love.
 Love that costs a little.

297
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:06.520
If you dare not on such love, then you should not have any man.

298
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.560
Have you calmed down now?

299
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:30.960
So I should thank and receive the first best guy to show his interest?

300
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:37.160
And hang on with some sad old man half life, as Gunilla made-

301
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:43.520
-As to prove that probably fuck you stand out, because it is apparently love.

302
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.080
You probably run as soon as someone gets close?

303
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:54.280
-You don't really know me!
 -Nog I know you, you.

304
00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:01.160
You would see me one Wednesday night at three in the taxi from Stureplan-

305
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:07.800
-So damn drinking that I have to ask the driver to stop so I can vomit.

306
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.640
But do you think I'm naive?

307
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.640
If I could afford to take a taxi once or get full so I spit-

308
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.800
-Then I would have been damn happy.

309
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.400
You don't even know what I'm working on!

310
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.840
-But not so aggressive.
 -What do I work with?

311
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.080
-You work with data.
 -What "data"?

312
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.560
-Yes, you work with data.
 -"With Data" ...!

313
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.280
After all, it was fucking mature to be mimicked.

314
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:48.680
Yes, but I am apparently not particularly mature according to you.

315
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:54.640
You know nothing about my life, you just know.
 Not a shit!

316
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.680
You stand on the site, just so you know.

317
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:10.880
Oh really?
 You're going to throw now?
 But you can forget that!

318
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:16.120
-What the hell are you doing?
 Stop now!
 -Now you...

319
00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:22.080
If you mush me I'll fuck you kill you.
 If you don't let me go, your bastard ...

320
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.480
What the hell are you doing?
 What are you doing?

321
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:33.280
You should always help the person who is in the downside!

322
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:46.080
-Where are you going?
 -Ingvar's cabin and pick up the light trail.

323
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.800
-What the hell are you doing here?
 -I would pick up the light trail.

324
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:36.280
-Has something happened?
 -I had forgotten the lamps.

325
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:42.120
-The Kerstin is stomach sick, so I flee.
 -So she's not going to the party?

326
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:48.280
What the hell do you think?
 She spits!
 I must see if I find the light trail, then.

327
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.360
What was it with him, then?
 You, thank you for saving me.

328
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.840
What ... what do you think about the scooter, then?

329
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:07.200
-I got some money on the trot.
 -Yes, it's ripe with flames ...!

330
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:19.720
You have to have a hard time.
 Here they think there is something wrong if you live alone.

331
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:24.760
-Isn't that, then?
 -No!

332
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.440
Oh!

333
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.600
Well, we'll see you in the village cottage.

334
00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.000
Hello!

335
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.200
But dear someone, what frozen you look.

336
00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:02.600
Father, let Mia crawl into the bathtub and warm up, so you can jump in late.

337
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:08.520
-I's going well?
 -Eivor wants to do the last yourself.

338
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:43.200
Hello...?
 I thought you might want a drink?

339
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.680
Yes ... yes, gladly.

340
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.800
Then you should be at peace.

341
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.440
Haven't you changed yet?

342
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:32.400
-What are you sitting and pills with?
 -Forsan's clock.

343
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:40.240
-I thought I would get it started.
 -Yes, yes ... do you help me with the blouse?

344
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.280
Why did he kill himself?

345
00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:54.280
What kind of question is that?
 We don't have to talk about this when we are going to a party.

346
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.680
-But we never talk about.
 -There's nothing to talk about.

347
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.840
Dress up now!

348
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:11.240
-Open!
 I have to go in!
 -Can i take your black sequin bag?

349
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:20.080
-Eivor, have you seen my pants?
 -I stroked them.
 They are in the laundry room.

350
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:26.080
-Mother!
 I can't find it!
 -Dum kid!
 Open!

351
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.480
Then open!

352
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:36.440
Mother?
 Why was I so much lonely when I was little?

353
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.760
You wanted to be alone.

354
00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:53.720
Has father said that we are happy to help you if you want to build?

355
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.560
How nice you are, mother.

356
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.960
-If!
 -Like talkative as always ...!

357
00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.360
Hello Hello!

358
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.800
You say I don't know anything about your life.

359
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.480
-But you don't know a splash about mine!
 -Mother?

360
00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:58.440
Now I have said mine and you have said yours.
 And now it's Father's evening.

361
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:02.160
Mother!
 Grandpa is coming now.

362
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.440
He's here now!
 Is everyone here?

363
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:13.000
Can everyone stand here, so he sees us when he comes in?

364
00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.000
Yes please.
 Pour one for me.

365
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:22.120
-But where is Kerstin?
 -She is stomach sick.

366
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:28.080
-But what's the matter with her?
 -She is just a little stressed.

367
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:34.040
Try to have some nice yourself instead.
 It's a party!

368
00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:41.720
Yes, may he live, yes, may he live, yes, may he live in a hundred years!

369
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.200
Of course he shall live, of course he shall live

370
00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:52.160
Of course he will live in a hundred years!

371
00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:00.720
-I don't know what to say.
 -After a grogg you will probably come on something!

372
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:08.680
Well, then we have thought like this: you have to sit where you want.

373
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:16.040
We have the buffet here, and in the bar there are beer, wine and soft drinks to the food-

374
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.800
-And then you can get a grogg if you want.

375
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:30.160
There is a huge Clas Ohlson in Stockholm now, at Sankt Eriksplan.

376
00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.640
Do you know where Sankt Eriksplan is located?

377
00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:40.800
We glaze in the porch last summer, but it got so hot-

378
00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:46.920
-So I carpenter 'a new porch together.
 Now you can sit both inside and out.

379
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.880
Now I'm thinking about putting a roof on that veranda ...

380
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:59.000
... because then you could actually build another porch ... without a roof ...

381
00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:06.880
Then I have a glazed, one with a roof and a free porch.

382
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.080
Then you have everything.

383
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:25.880
Well ... I would like to bring a quadruple live for Kalle.

384
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.880
-He live!
 -HURRAY!
 HURRAY!
 HURRAY!
 HURRAY!

385
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.240
-The bowl, father!
 -Bowl!
 And thanks for the gift, Mia!

386
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:41.360
He received a gift card at Clas Ohlson of SEK 5,000!

387
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:48.240
I am a little buddy who gets so bad with food

388
00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.520
For the one I live with, for the one I live with, he is called Kalle

389
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.720
He gives me herring every da 'and I don't want that

390
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.880
I want red wine, I want red wine and gorgonzola

391
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.200
... a second of 53 square meters.

392
00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:57.200
In Furudal they have wolf all the way to the knot.

393
00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.360
Thanks for it, the government!

394
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:03.280
/ Phone signal/ Excuse me!

395
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.440
Do you have a glass of water for father?

396
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:12.400
He falls asleep well before the cake if he continues to drink at this rate?

397
00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:19.680
-What speed it was at Mia, then.
 -Yes, she has fun with his and none.

398
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:25.680
But dear!
 Haven't you put on the brewer yet?
 Oh oh oh!

399
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:31.640
Yes, it was a nasty afternoon.
 But now I have taken some groggers.

400
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:38.840
But you, I have to hang up.
 I have to check a thing.
 Yes, we hear.
 Well.

401
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.360
Kerstin wants to be separated.

402
00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.120
She said it this morning.

403
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:17.800
Damn women's hours, just have to mess up and think ...

404
00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.080
Is it something you have ...?

405
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:28.040
She said something before the summer, but damn, she babbles like all the lovers!

406
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.040
If you listen to half you get hurt in the head!

407
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.200
The livestock cottage belongs to her family.

408
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:43.120
-They she never forgives it.
 -You want to go home?

409
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.840
Oh!
 Here is the entertainment!

410
00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.680
Mia!
 Do you pick up more spirits?

411
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:05.400
It will be a surprise.
 Father doesn't know about anything!

412
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.040
-Ida ... -No!

413
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.880
-Get the violin now!
 Grandpa will be happy.
 -No.

414
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.840
Not now.

415
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Tommy!
 Do you pick up Ida's violin?

416
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:07.680
How nice that you could come, boys.
 You thank and bow.

417
00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.720
Have you got a snap, right?

418
00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:16.720
-You can't go in with that one.
 -Why are you so mad at me?

419
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:21.880
But you know how people are.
 They think they should be blind.

420
00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:27.840
-It wasn't what I mean '.
 -Jan-Olov, do you help Mia?

421
00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:48.920
-How do you have it at your table?
 -Good.
 Great.
 Will you have one?

422
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:08.880
Do you remember when you were in love with me?

423
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:15.320
Oh, what a good thing it was to have you after me all the time.

424
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.480
You could glare at me for hours.

425
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.920
-Stop!
 -I barely had to go on a dough.

426
00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.640
You, I was six years old.

427
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:31.920
I just thought it was exciting to be with someone who is older.

428
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.080
I'm still older ...

429
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:43.040
This is my family's gift.

430
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:12.680
A little snuff dash 'to me that you are single now.
 Are you?

431
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.520
You, concentrate on the spirits now.

432
00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:23.440
-They wonder where the spirits are.
 -We just should camouflage it first.

433
00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.960
-It's going well with the brides, I see.
 -In ...

434
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.200
There is a certain craving down the village.

435
00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:40.200
You mean that ...!
 Are you interested, then?

436
00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.320
I!
 No, for the hell.

437
00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.720
But ... are you single, then?

438
00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:51.880
-Where is the spirits?
 -It will.

439
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.840
-So you are single?
 -Yes.

440
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.480
But he, then?
 He who was up?

441
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:10.160
Who stood on the ass when he would try to go scooter?

442
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:15.440
-Do you not in law, then?
 -"In law"...!
 We hung for a while.

443
00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:19.280
-What is being called!
 Right?
 -Yes...

444
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.400
-Now he's fine, Dad your.
 -Come out now!

445
00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:30.360
-Where have you made of the spirits?
 -It was a damn ...

446
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.640
God, how nice he is!
 He's so nice.

447
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:40.440
-Jan-Olov?
 -No, the dark in the gaming crew.

448
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:46.240
Is not he?
 He could imagine, right?

449
00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.440
-Are you drunk?
 -No, my God!

450
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:56.000
Or, I'm well.
 But it does not depend on it.

451
00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.880
I can't be drunk to mother and father!

452
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:06.840
But Gunilla, you're actually an adult.
 Hold the funnel now, and I'll pour.

453
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.120
But I don't feel adult.

454
00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:27.600
I have to get a break from being an adult.

455
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.800
So that's why you parted?

456
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.280
He was unfaithful to me.

457
00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.960
I haven't told anyone.

458
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:47.920
-So I threw out ... -But why haven't you told you?

459
00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:53.440
You know how people talk.
 I don't want to hang out.

460
00:55:53.600 --> 00:56:00.120
The children would be disappointed on the '.
 It is better that they are angry with me.

461
00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.280
Stina and Helena will sing now.

462
00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:10.000
I blown in my pipe, then a little pigeon came forward

463
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:15.680
Her name was Rännar-Stina, I took in my arms

464
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.840
I was with one in Bali.

465
00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:27.840
Absolutely amazing guy.
 He was called Riffer.
 Do you understand what a nice name?

466
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:35.680
He was so positive.
 Such a really generous person.

467
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.120
He dare 'show emotions.

468
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.280
-Do you want to see him?
 -No, we take ...

469
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:55.400
-He came from where you plugged.
 -San Francisco?

470
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.400
As he touched me.

471
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.840
As if he liked my body.

472
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.560
Do you understand?
 He thought I was fine.

473
00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:29.520
Håkan never liked my body.
 I never think he did.

474
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:44.000
-How old is he, then?
 -Trettrettvå.

475
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.280
-What is it?
 -Nothing.

476
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:24.920
-Is it something with me?
 With us?
 -No, Tommy ...

477
00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:30.280
-Eivor?
 -I can't bear to talk about it today.

478
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.680
We'll take it tomorrow.

479
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:41.320
Next weekend we take the kids and skis and go to the hut-

480
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:47.280
-And we sleep there one night and fire and grill sausages.

481
00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.760
You know?
 Oh ...

482
00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:47.520
-What?
 -Oh, there was nothing.

483
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.280
Go out with the barrel!
 I take the bucket.

484
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:25.920
I love you, Mia.
 I've never said that.

485
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.240
Hi, Kerstin!
 It's Eivor.
 How are you?

486
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.480
You've always been so strong ... brave.

487
01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.360
You have managed yourself.

488
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:53.320
Then it will probably be easy to forget to say that.
 I love you.

489
01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.480
-You, do you want a beer?
 -Yes please.

490
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.320
Focus now.
 Get it together.

491
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:14.520
Ingvar!
 Ingvar!

492
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.320
-Now you should go home.
 -Is the party end?

493
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.400
-I have talked to Kerstin.
 -Iven love!
 I'm not going home.

494
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.560
But oh, oh ... how was this, then?

495
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.360
What the hell do you want?
 Why are you never satisfied?

496
01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:40.600
Why should you just look?
 Why can't you just live?

497
01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:47.120
-What are you talking about?
 -Iven egoists, that's what you are!

498
01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:52.640
And read weekly magazines about the lovers who have strangled their men ...

499
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.800
Now I do not understand...

500
01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:03.880
When you finally dare to make a decision, it was to leave your family.

501
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.800
Uh, uj!

502
01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.520
But Ingvar ...

503
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.080
I'm going to the hospital on Monday.

504
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.200
Whatever I do, it will be wrong.

505
01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:36.680
I try to do well, but it just gets wrong.

506
01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.640
And then I am called MES.

507
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:48.600
And now that I've finally taken hold of myself ...

508
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.600
... everyone thinks I'm an egoist.

509
01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:59.360
-Have you given up already?
 -Damn.
 The party has barely begun.

510
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:06.160
Now damn, Serru.
 Now it is time for someone to gain momentum on this liquid.

511
01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:12.400
-I just wanted to tell you.
 -It's clear that you should do it.

512
01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.560
-But ... -I don't know if I want to talk anymore.

513
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.400
Not ... Not right now, at least.

514
01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:26.880
Then we don't.

515
01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.800
Now that I've found myself ...

516
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:37.160
... then I'm just a man who people think is embarrassing.

517
01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.320
Nämen, God ... are you sitting here?

518
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.640
And here I stand crying.
 You can't do that at a party.
 Right?

519
01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:54.120
"Keep Smiling!"
 You know, everyone said in Bali - that I was so happy.

520
01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.200
/CHAIN SAW/

521
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.280
It wasn't a day too late.

522
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:19.480
-What the hell are you doing?
 -Yidy cat skull ...

523
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.320
Ingvar, now you let Helena drive you home.

524
01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.440
Then you talk and Kerstin tomorrow.

525
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.000
This does not solve any problems.

526
01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.960
Nothing gets better because you trap trees that actually belong to the village!

527
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:46.760
Fy damn, how sad you are.
 That's how the bells stop.

528
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.360
So damn unnecessary!

529
01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.640
Damn, now it went like that again!

530
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.320
How can you be so fucking cuddly?

531
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:10.280
You and Jan-Olov remove the Christmas tree tomorrow.
 And we take off the light trail.

532
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:28.320
-I don't really think you see me.
 -You, I see you very well.

533
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.800
-What do you see, then?
 -You dont want to know.

534
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:41.960
Stay here - and at home with mother ...!
 And not have your own family or child ...

535
01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.600
I see everything I don't want to be.

536
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.800
If you can't have children, then?

537
01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.840
The feature?
 When should you start hunting, then?

538
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:06.720
Say like it is - you can't tolerate see blood.
 Other things were with you.

539
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:12.320
I have to say, now on the 10th anniversary of his passing, that I am impressed.

540
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.280
Not everyone dares to shoot the hood.

541
01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.600
Mia, are you holding here?

542
01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.320
Come the mother, then we dance.

543
01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.320
Well, now I want a dance!

544
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:36.040
-I can not take it.
 -It does not matter.

545
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.200
I'll probably dance anyway.

546
01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.680
Mom, you're fine.

547
01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.360
Nice in the hair.

548
01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.920
CAKE.

549
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.600
It's time for cake.

550
01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.440
-Has anyone seen Ingvar?
 -Let he be.

551
01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:14.360
-You don't know why he's so there.
 -I know that.

552
01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:19.000
-He sat and bull on.
 -Is Ingvar sad?

553
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:25.240
Press down the lights now and we're no longer talking about it.
 He you dance 'with ...

554
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.960
-Bjernulf?
 -He is married and has three children.

555
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.720
You do not need to worry.
 Gunilla already has a guy.
 In Bali.

556
01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.240
An American.

557
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:44.720
-You can no English?
 -No, but it didn't matter!

558
01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:50.440
-Yeah.
 So you should move there now?
 -Are you crazy?

559
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.600
Press down the lights now.

560
01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:01.000
They can go to hell, those bastards ... fucking lovers ...

561
01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.720
Hello hope in the cabin '!

562
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.200
Nämen ... what the hell ...

563
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:36.200
Well, then shoot!
 Slide now!

564
01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.840
... then he should be shot, yes, then will ...

565
01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.680
The fjin, your little fjutt hell ...

566
01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.840
Well, shoot now!

567
01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.600
Well, what the hell ... Aim upwards so you don't destroy the wall.

568
01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.200
Damn amateur, shoot now!

569
01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.160
Shear!

570
01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.800
It's cake now!

571
01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.240
What are you doing?
 Huh?

572
01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.840
What are you doing?

573
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.800
I don't belong here.

574
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:49.400
-I'm like my dad.
 -You are not like him!

575
01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.720
-You are strong.
 -I'm not strong.

576
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.880
It's a shame about us men.

577
01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:05.160
-I am 37 and live at home.
 -You don't live at home.
 You have your own!

578
01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.480
You live here because you want it that way.

579
01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.640
But it's sick!

580
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.160
Sometimes you may want sick things.

581
01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:21.440
I can't even shoot myself.
 Dad dare 'at least.

582
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.720
It was a pity that he had to kill himself for someone to understand.

583
01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.880
But he dare '.
 He...

584
01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:38.840
He was not brave.
 He was so cowardly that he was allowed to kill himself.

585
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.800
It's lucky for him.
 If I had him here now, then I would kill him.

586
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:52.400
I would do it slowly, so he got to know what it is to live-

587
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.560
-and what it is to be dead.

588
01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:02.920
-Morsan, huh ... -din cowardly, pitiful, pathetic ...

589
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:09.600
... who would rather ruin the lives of others than deal with your own!

590
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.480
-What is Ingvar going with the rifle?
 -What the hell!
 Fucking Ingvar ...

591
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.800
-Is not I told you to go home?
 -The the thief would push the hood off.

592
01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:37.600
I'm not going to feel sorry for you for another minute after what you have done to us.

593
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:44.560
You dare not share with you, though I was there all the time.

594
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:51.080
I'm so tired of feeling sorry for you.

595
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:58.120
Your son believes that the only solution is to slap the skull into pieces.

596
01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:02.080
-NA, Barbro!
 -Shut up!

597
01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.720
And you?
 I'm so damn tired of hearing your whining!

598
01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:14.920
I am tired of hearing your nag and see you neglect each other-

599
01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:20.880
-As because you are so damn fucking stubborn.

600
01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:36.520
It's not a shame about you, Jan-Olov.
 It's not a shame about the men.

601
01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:42.960
It's just a little easier to think it was a pity for someone.

602
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.800
Then you don't have to be angry.

603
01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.560
Mom, I love you.

604
01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.880
Just as you know: Your sister is pregnant.

605
01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.000
Congratulations!

606
01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.200
It's not congratulations.
 It's crap.

607
01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.560
But what does he say, then?
 Dad?

608
01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:55.560
It's not a father.
 It is a 19-year-old with dreadlocks who is a DJ.

609
01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:01.080
He is the son of my boss.
 And he shouldn't be a father.

610
01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:07.480
-Do you think about having an abortion?
 -Yes, it's clear that I'm thinking.

611
01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.880
-Where are you going?
 -Go to bed.

612
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:19.840
So you're going to be throwing now?
 Mia?
 We must try to solve this together.

613
01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:26.000
Well, now will good Eivor help me too?
 What an honor...!

614
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:32.360
-This have you longed for?
 -You think I just want you badly.

615
01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:38.320
Not just me - you wish it goes to hell for Gunilla too.

616
01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.880
How can you say that?
 It is clear that I want you well.

617
01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.280
So you have supported Gunilla in her divorce?

618
01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:56.440
So you are happy that she finally got to experience really good sex in Bali?

619
01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.280
Been cheated and exploited, you mean?

620
01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:06.080
I am happy to be tricked and used if it is as nice as in Bali.

621
01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.240
I wish I was fooled evenly.

622
01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:28.920
Mia, you just know that ... I actually don't have it so easy.

623
01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:38.760
But how can you say so?
 You have family and children and someone to live with.

624
01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:45.000
-I just have myself.
 -But you don't want anything!

625
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.960
You don't want a guy.
 You don't want to do with us.
 And not children.

626
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:57.560
You are never prepared to bet.
 And if you don't bet - then you get nothing.

627
01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:03.040
-You, it's not that easy.
 -You spoken fucking kid.

628
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:07.960
I understand that you drink liquor, spit and go taxi.

629
01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.640
Can you imagine me on a Wednesday night-

630
01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:17.760
-When I lie and cry quietly in the wardrobe so as not to wake anyone?

631
01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:25.800
And I have such a fucking panic for everything - everything - hangs on me.

632
01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:32.000
Make sure mother comes to the doctor, calm father who is worried about Gunilla-

633
01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.160
-Help Barbro change curtains, chatter on Tommy about the car.

634
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.320
Don't demand, just exist, be ...

635
01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:43.560
But say no, then!

636
01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:50.480
There is no workplace where you can come and go.
 This - it's life!

637
01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:55.360
Why can't I like my work?

638
01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.720
I enjoy my apartment and the city I live in.

639
01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.880
Why can no one live in any other way than what you do?

640
01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:10.040
Listen to yourself!
 It's always "me, me, me".

641
01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:17.000
It is always your dreams that will come true.
 So it has always been.

642
01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:24.960
Your parents are getting old.
 When you have time with them, they learn to be dead.

643
01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:32.000
You cannot also be forced to dedicate life to our parents.

644
01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:38.320
I want to help, but I have to do it my way.

645
01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:49.360
It's not so easy to come here when you make me feel so useless!

646
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.800
Mia ...

647
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.560
I admire you.

648
01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.120
I want to say that you are good.

649
01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:29.800
But everything that comes out is just strange, hard, nasty words ...

650
01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.760
I...

651
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.320
I want to be close.

652
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.640
I want to be with ...

653
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.360
Eivor ...

654
01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.520
-Eivor?
 -Eivor?

655
01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:01.360
What is it?
 - Get Tommy!

656
01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.520
/ Shot/ Download Tommy!
 Hurry up!

657
01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.160
Tommy!

658
01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.240
Eivor has become bad.

659
01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.640
I shot it!
 The cat!

660
01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:27.240
I shot the fucking cat skull!

661
01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:31.120
-What the hell is she arranging the party for?
 -The doctor said it wasn't.

662
01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.720
Gunilla, we have to fry the sausage.
 And the beets?
 Where do you have them?

663
01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:41.120
Take it easy, mother.
 I'll bring them out.

664
01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:47.200
But they must have food!
 Gunilla, you have to help Tommy clean.

665
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.360
Of course I do.

666
01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.960
I make a mushroom pie, which Eivor likes.

667
01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.120
/Telephone signal/

668
01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.040
Yes, hello?
 Hi, Kerstin.

669
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.720
It was a heart attack.

670
01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.480
We may talk more another day.
 Hello.

671
01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.080
Yes, I have to go ...

672
01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:52.040
When should you be in the hospital?

673
01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.960
Gunilla tell '.

674
01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.280
Tomorrow.

675
01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.560
Is it ... Is it urgent?

676
01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:20.600
Then maybe you can help me make a mushroom pie?

677
01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:25.480
-Yes, is this you are?
 -I would just pick up the lamp.

678
01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:45.920
Have you thought about anything ... how to do with the child?

679
01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.920
I do not know.
 I...

680
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:58.800
At least I was going to contact him ... Yes, the guy.

681
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.360
I don't know more.

682
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.320
-In addition to what Eivor would have thought.
 -I have you never cared about?

683
01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:17.960
-How can you give up someone so close?
 -Debt do you place yourself now?

684
01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.720
No.
 I am only marveling at how you can be so customer.

685
01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.040
-No had nothing in common.
 -Yes, everything.

686
01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.600
She never did anything for you?

687
01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.880
-But she tried.
 -But what?

688
01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:44.760
It's just to remember as she was.
 Stubborn, bullshit ...

689
01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:53.360
...jaundiced.
 So damn ... she was hard.
 Sour.

690
01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:56.640
She was so damn much Dalarna.

691
01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:05.040
-As to have that folk costume ... -like a little leash.

692
01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:19.440
-I loved her.
 -I loved her.
 So much.

693
01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.200
But I couldn't say that.

694
01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.920
-Are you on your way?
 -Yes.

695
01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:07.800
You ... I was just thinking ...

696
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.400
I don't think I see you so well.

697
01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.680
I think I decided on who you are too long late-

698
01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:27.720
-And you know, it's hard to change when you have decided on something.

699
01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:35.840
It's strange how everything happens at once.
 You do not know what to believe.

700
01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:40.240
They called this morning ...

701
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:46.200
... and ask if I wanted to drill wells in Africa.
 There was some dropout.

702
01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.240
He wonders if I wanted to come along.

703
01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:06.960
I'm back in a year.
 Contact us if you are craving more.

704
01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:21.400
Do you hear what silent it is?

705
01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.320
