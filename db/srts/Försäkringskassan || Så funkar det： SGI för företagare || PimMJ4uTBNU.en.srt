1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02.870
SGI for entrepreneurs,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05.590
that's how it works

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,300
SGI, or sickness benefit -based income,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,640
is an amount that is calculated

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,010
by the Social Insurance Office.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,800
It is the basis of how much money

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,310
You can get if you get sick,

8
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,370
wobble or should be parental.

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,740
Your compensation from us becomes approximately

10
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,490
80 percent of your SGI.

11
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,660
How your SGI is calculated

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,610
depends on how long you

13
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,630
have had your business

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,290
And what kind of company you have.

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,380
If you have a business

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,270
as you registered

17
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:31,960
for less than

18
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,640
36 months ago,

19
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,940
can you, regardless of corporate form

20
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,140
be entitled to a so -called

21
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,420
structure.

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,310
It means we

23
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,370
Calculating your SGI

24
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,630
based on what an employee

25
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,980
with the same tasks,

26
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44.230
education and experience

27
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,790
would have received in income.

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,460
Keep in mind that you must have

29
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,590
started working in your business

30
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,590
In order to be entitled to

31
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,870
A structure.

32
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,970
After the build -up phase

33
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,740
SGI counts out different

34
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,030
depending on the type

35
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,150
by companies you have.

36
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00.080
Do you work in your own limited company

37
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,500
are you counted as an employee

38
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02.690
in your business.

39
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04.840
Your SGI is calculated on that salary

40
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:05,790
As you take out

41
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,140
from your business.

42
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,280
If you have a very low pay

43
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09.540
or no pay at all,

44
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,970
So do you have a low SGI

45
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,650
Or no SGI at all.

46
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,070
If you have an individual company,

47
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,140
trading company or limited liability company,

48
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,660
So we calculate your compensation

49
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,170
Based on your company's results

50
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,270
after deduction

51
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,530
And before tax.

52
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,840
It means that if your business

53
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,160
have a small surplus

54
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,860
or no excess at all,

55
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,400
So do you have a low SGI

56
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,010
Or no SGI at all.

57
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,860
If you both drive

58
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,140
private business

59
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,050
and have income from employment

60
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,080
So your SGI is calculated

61
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,010
both on your salary

62
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,020
and your company's results

63
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,450
after deduction and before tax.

64
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,770
