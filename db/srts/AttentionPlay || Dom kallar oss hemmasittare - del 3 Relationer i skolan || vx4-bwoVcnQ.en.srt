1
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,520
After all, there were staff I could talk to but.

2
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,359
And I had one after all

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,240
a support.

4
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,159
But what I brought up with her that she would take

5
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,920
Up with the teachers.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,320
The teachers did not really listen to her.

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,280
But we talked a lot and it was nice to have

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59.840
Like conversation therapy almost about school

9
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05.400
With someone who also works at school who knows what it looks like.

10
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:07.920
It was.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
I needed that support.

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,400
I just wished the teachers like to take her a little more

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,280
Seriously, I think.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,519
I would have liked the others in the staff also only saw that

15
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,519
I exist and maybe ask I felt and not that you are

16
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,480
Here when it suits you.

17
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,040
While I was home, I had contact, or my

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,400
Mom most had contact with the school.

19
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,400
But I had the most contact with a single person and it was

20
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,799
after all with resource teacher Roger that I wrote if I was sick

21
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,959
or if I was not able to go to school at all and he

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,799
Tried to pull me there.

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,000
He usually told me that you or that I just would.

24
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,319
I would not think so much, I would

25
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:49,959
Just do it.

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,000
At my old school I could sit in my place and so could

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,879
teachers come into the room without even looking in my direction

28
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,680
Or care as if I were there or not.

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,719
But then when I came to my new school it was always a

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05.560
Good morning and it was always positive stuff they said.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,120
And had you become ill one day they could write

32
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,759
to one directly.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,599
And how are you?

34
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,759
They play a greater role in young people's lives than they think

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,960
and what they do and say will affect more than what

36
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:19,680
They also believe.

37
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,080
What Maria did that was good, it was she she saw me and

38
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,639
Like almost took care of me.

39
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,000
Like I was one of her children.

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,879
It was like.

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,840
She.

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,039
Yes, she saw that I was among all others who were outgoing

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
And heard as well.

44
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,599
So she saw anyway that I existed

45
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,159
In a way he saw us was that he did not focus on that

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,280
We had arrived too late without us being there.
