1
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:15,100
It is so damn good looking.

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,123
And so the leather,

3
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:19,329
You just slide down, and then you sit down.

4
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,123
Mmm!

5
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:24,071
Oh, it's almost porn here!

6
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,405
BMWN is four -wheel drive.

7
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,071
BMWN is a damn old man.

8
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29.948
Yes exactly.

9
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:33,761
Audi, on the other hand. It's a "cock magnet"!

10
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:36,575
Now you got wet in your pants!

11
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:38,399
Some do not need a car for it.

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,145
Hörredu, don't forget who is the manager here!

13
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,771
Karin was that huh?

14
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:44,790
Yes?

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47.908
What do you say then? BMW or Audi?

16
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:50,398
I had BMW on the last job so ...

17
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:51.908
And there you see Ingrid.

18
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:56,162
That's right. It's a fucking old man.

19
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,869
Damn!

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03.402
Damn I think you will fit in well here.

21
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:08.045
Karin, she should relieve a little on administration.

22
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:11,557
While looking for a new head of department.

23
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:14,144
How nice!

24
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:18,144
No corner, it's Friday. We stop talking business right?

25
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,694
I was just thinking about K.Ö.N. the report

26
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:23,968
As we talked about yesterday.

27
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,496
I made me put the result in a chart.

28
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,808
It's pretty interesting ...

29
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,534
Damn too, sorry.

30
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,260
I had to leave in kindergarten.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,612
For you can apparently not do with prostate labels.

32
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:42,104
Well, how are AWN going then?

33
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:43,418
Good to say that.

34
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:46,694
Listen, we would need some who fix some snacks, a little small.

35
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:50,712
Who, anyone? Come on!

36
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55.241
I can do that. Absolutely.

37
00:01:55,241 --> 00:02:00.066
Nice, guys. Then you fix it. You made it really nice last.

38
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01.064
Yes indeed.

39
00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:02.908
Should we go and make some money then

40
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:05.266
So we can treat ourselves to be carried then.

41
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:08,300
Yes! Let's Get To Work Girls!

42
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,930
I would just like to say that you are doing a fantastic job.

43
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,379
You should know that I see it.

44
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,456
Thanks.

45
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:50,127
Yes, they should go out and burst beer before and well we can drink some wine?

46
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,497
Right?

47
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,349
Cheers on you old bone.

48
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:54,361
Bowl.

49
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:58,281
So, tell me about you know what?

50
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,694
What, what do you mean?

51
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02.163
The service, has she asked yet or?

52
00:03:02,163 --> 00:03:04,534
No, it won't go to me.

53
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06.305
Are you kidding me the old man?

54
00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:09.300
Everyone knows that it is largely you who control this place.

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,915
Sorry, but it's just that. You are most qualified.

56
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,556
I do not know.

57
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:17,808
Who else would get it? Henrietta then or?

58
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:22,790
"I'll just scratch myself a little between my legs and you will get the report then"

59
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,534
So, you are so horrible!

60
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:27,641
Otherwise, do you have to convince the boss?

61
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29.063
But uhh. In other words?

62
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:31,771
God gave us tits and ass old man.

63
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:33,281
We use it properly

64
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36.841
Isn't it actually we who are exploited, right?

65
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,456
I guess so.

66
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:44,182
You are so nice darling. You fix this. Trust me!

67
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:24,752
It was then a damn luck to take a support burger!

68
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:29,985
No, but this one with why men fake orgasms.

69
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:35,810
Nice you are guys!

70
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:43,908
The old man, in Wanna Dance!

71
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:23,896
This is take me the funniest bride I've met!

72
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:27,362
Did I miss something fun?

73
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:28,862
Pull it again!

74
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,028
It may not be so guilty.

75
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:33,353
No problem.

76
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,550
Okay.

77
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,512
Okay. An intelligent woman, an intelligent man and Christmas was out and about.

78
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:48,473
Suddenly they find a fifty on the ground. Who bends down to pick up the banknote?

79
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,276
I do not know.

80
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:54,257
The intelligent woman so clearly. The other two do not exist!

81
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59.701
You didn't get bad up huh?

82
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:00.300
No.

83
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02.012
It's just a joke.

84
00:06:02.012 --> 00:06:04,569
It was fun.

85
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:11,177
You should take me a comedian or something!

86
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:47,829
I guess you have heard that I will add a new department manager.

87
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:51,632
Mm, I've probably heard something about it.

88
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,281
I thought about you.

89
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:04.418
I mean you have absolutely the right merits and experiences.

90
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:09,144
Fun!

91
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:18,007
You have to be able to take in when needed.

92
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:22,201
  Don't be afraid of it.

93
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:26,730
Really grab things.

94
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,692
Dare to be…

95
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:34.908
... hard simply, when required.

96
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:55,793
I uh .. I think I'll start moving home actually.

97
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:59,877
It's been such a long day ...

98
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:02.310
It's been fun, very successful.

99
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07.819
We have to do this more often, really.

100
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:16,192
But see you on Monday.

101
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:59,056
Show the scrotum fucking cock!

102
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:26,123
I am absolutely convinced that you are the right person for this job.

103
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:27,220
Congratulations!

104
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,652
Thank you for the trust!

105
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,123
Hey, you! You! I'm going to a meeting here exactly,

106
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:39,830
You don't want this to the kitchen are you cute?

107
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,575
Mm, absolutely.

108
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,409
Great.
