00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, Elza here from Elzas Bokhylla. It's time to show you the books I hope and want to read during October.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'll be honest, I think I'm going into a reading slump.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
September has been hard. I haven't had as much desire to read or been in a reading mood.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When I do read, the books I thought were good have been sort of…

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I get stuck, and I pause a lot more than I usually do.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I actually put down 2-3 books in September.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I'm cautiously optimistic when planning my read for October, so you know.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,581
But there are a couple of books. We'll go through them and see what happens when it's time to do a wrap-up later.

9
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:57,244
We start with the books that are in my book  challenge "Dust off".

10
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:59,755
Where I read my unread books that I own.

11
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:03,000
A book that will be included is one from my September's TBR.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've started it, I've paused it several times.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I still want to read it, because I think about it and think it seems good and exciting so I haven't given up on it.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,023
So it will come along in October as well.

15
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:22,000
And that's Our Tragic Universe by Scarlett Thomas.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I still don't really know what it's about.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It should be about some kind of time lapse, perhaps, if you can live forever.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I haven't really grasped what the plot is.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll be honest, but it starts out really good.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
As I said, you see, I have started, I have read a couple of pages and will check how many I have read.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have read 38 pages.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I haven't given up on it, I'm still curious.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So I'm hoping to give it another chance this October.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I feel like I have a bit of a craving for classics actually.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A classic that I really want to read is A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm a Charles Dickens fan.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you heard a motorcycle driving by, apologies.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,581
I'm a Charles Dickens fan anyway.

29
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:12,000
And I think this is available as an audiobook.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is still a pocket, quite nice.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't know, but maybe I listen, read, listen and read. We'll see.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I would love to read this one.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Give it a chance because I have been curious about it for a very long time.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
World literature of the month.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was thinking of going to Japan.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Last month I was in South America.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I've been to India, I've been to Asia, I've been to Africa a lot over the summer.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But now I'm going back to Japan.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I thought I would read The Nakano Thrift Shop by Hiromi Kawakami.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I thought I would listen to it.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She's the one who made The Briefcase.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I like it very much.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And I want to give this one a chance too.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I want to listen and read it.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So it must be World Literature of the Month.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Japan. Yes, you know, I love Japan.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In my book club, we're going to read a horror story, since it's October and Halloween and stuff like that.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then we will read How to sell a haunted house by Grady Hendrix.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I have it as an e-book.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not sure what it's really about.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But it must be a girl whose parents die.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She goes back to her hometown and the house she grew up in and will try to sell it.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is it something like spooky and scary and stuff like that?

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't know more than that.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't want to know more than that.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I think this seems so exciting.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm a bit curious about his writing in general.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I actually have many of Hendrix books on my tbr overall.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So it will be fun and get to know him a little.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And in the book circle, I go to two different ones.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
One that I call the book club and one that I call the book circle.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In the book club we will read a horror story.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And in the book circle we will read On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are we beautiful on earth, yes.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm just unsure.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Here you have it.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I also have it as an audiobook, I think.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll give it a go as an audiobook.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So it will be very exciting to read it.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is about a person who writes letters to his illiterates.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
to his mother who is illiterate.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
About his childhood, about the escape, about life in the United States, about the memories.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So it will be, I've heard it's beautifully written.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I have heard that it is very difficult, but still important and wonderful.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It is a very blissful mixture.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It should hurt, but it should still be damn good.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I've been looking forward to this and reading it a lot.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So there we have it. I have the book circle, I have the book club.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have "dust off" times two and then we have world literature.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There is only one book challenge left and that is where I let chance choose which book I will read.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have the phone here.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We'll get started right away.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Lets see.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, 370.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Totally okay because I'm getting close to 800 books on my TBR on Goodreads.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
370, Let us see which book it will be.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Listen, this is amazing.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Testament of Nina Wähä.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And listen, this is actually a "dusty book".

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have this one here, in a second we'll see.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Here I have it, I have it.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I bought it a couple of years ago second hand.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That was two, two years ago, two years ago maybe.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Second hand, so I have this one.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's supposed to be a family drama.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
These are nothing but murder stories, right?

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Or yes, by all means.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It is much more than just that.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I actually don't really know what it's about.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All I know is that I saw it everywhere.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
People loved it.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It was insanely hyped.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It is a very popular book.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I'm finally going to read it.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Wait let me check when I put it in my tbr.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
On the first of April 2020.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
April 1st 2020, so three years ago.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So this is really a "dusty" book.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's quite a shelf warmer.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So nice, then I have three "dusty" books this month.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How fun that it ended up on this one.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Which I own and don't have to think about.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Book that I actually feel a little craving for.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's like pretty and stuff.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We'll see what I think.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If I think like everyone else.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Or if I think otherwise.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So there we have the books I hope to read during October.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Like I said, I'm a little cautious.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Optimistic.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,175
I'm not trying to…

122
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,826
It will be as it will be.

123
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,465
I'm not sure if there will be these books at all.

124
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:11,000
Because I think I'm getting into a reading slump.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't have the same urge.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What I want to do is to sit and watch something.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Very good TV series.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Devour TV series.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm actually very keen on that.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,361
For some reason.

131
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,000
So maybe I should take a break from reading.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And let things rest.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I do not know.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm still craving these books.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I do not know what to do.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We take one day at a time, we take one book at a time.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then we'll see how October turns out.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I am of course curious about which books you plan to read in October.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,628
tell me in the comments section and I'll see you there

140
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,965
Please give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel.

141
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:48,593
if you don't already

142
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,000
See you next week.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Take care bye!
