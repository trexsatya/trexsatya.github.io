00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi, Elza here from Elza's bookshelf.
 It's time to show off the books I hope and want to read in October.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm going to be honest, I think I'm getting into a reading.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
September has been difficult, it has been tough.
 I have not had as much reading or reading pleasure.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Once I read, the books that I thought were good have been like ...

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I get stuck, but I pause much more than I usually do.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I actually put away 2-3 books in September.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I'm careful, optimistic when planning my October reading, so you know.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,488
But there are a couple of books.
 We go through it and we'll see what happens when it's time to make a wrap-up then.

9
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,000
We start with "Damma off" challenge.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,767
Where I read my unread books that I own.

11
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:03,000
A book that is allowed to accompany from September's TBR.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've started it, I've paused it several times.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I still want to read it, because I think about it and think it seems good and exciting so I have not given it up.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So it can follow in October as well.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And it's our tragic universe by Scarlett Thomas.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I still don't really know what it is about.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It should be about some kind of time slope maybe, if you can live forever.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I haven't really grasped what the action is.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I should be honest, but it starts exciting.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That said, you see, I have started, I have read a few pages and will check how long I have read.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have read 38 pages.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I haven't given it up, I'm still curious.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So I hope that I will give it another chance now in October.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I feel that I have a little craving for classics actually.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
One classic that I really want to read is A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
After all, I'm a Charles Dickens fan.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Still, if you heard a motorcycle that drove past, apologize.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At least I'm a Charles Dickens fan.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And I think this is available as an audio book.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This one is still a pocket, pretty nice.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't know, but I may listen, read, listen and read.
 We'll see.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I would love to read this.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Give it a chance that I have been curious about it for a very long time.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Moon's world literature.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was going to go to Japan.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Last month I was in South America.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I've been to India, I've been to Asia, I've been to Africa a lot during the summer.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But now I'm going back to Japan.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I thought I would read Nakano's second hand shop by Hiromi Kawakami.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I thought I'd listen to it.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She has made Sensei's portfolio, it is well called.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I like it a lot.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And I want to give this a chance too.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I want to listen and read it.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So it may be the month's world literature.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Japanese.
 Yes, you know, I love Japan.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In the book club we will read a horror, as it is October and Halloween and so on.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then we will read how to sell a haunted house by Gradu Hendrix.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I have it as an e-book.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not sure what it is really about.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But it must be a girl who whose parents die.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She goes back to her hometown and the house she grew up in so she will try to sell it.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is there something that ghostly and terrible and so on?

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't know more than that.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't want to know more than that.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I think this seems so exciting.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I am a little curious about the authorship overall.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Many of Hendrix books I have on my TBR overall actually.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So it will be fun and get to know him a little.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And in the book circle, I go on two different ones.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
One that I call the book club and one I call the book circle.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The book club is terrified that we should read.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And in the book circle we will read for a while we are beautiful on earth by Ocean Voung.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are we beautiful on earth, yes.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm just unsure.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Here you have it.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I also have that as an audio book I think.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll give it a chance as an audio book.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So it will be very exciting to read it.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is well how the person writes a good letter to his illiterate.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Or to her mother who is illiterate.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
About his childhood, about the escape, about life in the United States, about the memories.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So it will be, I have heard that it is beautifully written.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I have heard that it is very difficult, but still important and wonderful.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It is a very blissful mix.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It should hurt, but it should be sick good anyway.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I've been looking forward to this one and read it very much.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So there we have it.
 I have the book circle, I have the book club.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have two days off and then we have world literature.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There is only one book challenge left and that is where I let random choose which book to read.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have the phone here.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We get started right away.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Lets see.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, 370.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Absolutely okay because I'm starting to approach 800 books on my TBR on Goodreads.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
370, we're running.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Listen, this is fantastic.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Testament by Nina Wähä.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And corner, this is actually a "dust off" book.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have this with me, in a second we'll see.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Here I have it, I have it.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I bought it a couple of years ago on secondhand.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It was two, two years ago, two years ago maybe it was.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
On secondhand, so I have this.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It should be a family drama.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is nothing but murder stories or yes.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Or yes, by all means.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's much more than just that.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't really know what it is about.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The only thing I know is that I saw it everywhere.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
People loved it.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It was sickly hyped.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It is very talked about and popular.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I'll finally read it.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know, I'll check when I put it in.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
First April 2020 I will learn it.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
1st April 2020, so three years ago.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So this is really a "dust off" book.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It is a very shelf heater.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
God what fun, then I have three "dust off" books.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What fun it ended up on this one.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Which I own and don't have to think about.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Book that I actually feel a little craving for.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It is like good looking and so.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We'll see what I think.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If I think like everyone else.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Or if I think something else.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So we have the books I hope to read in October.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That said, I'm a little careful.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Optimistic.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,314
I'm not trying ...

122
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:05,442
It must be as it becomes.

123
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not sure if it will be these books at all.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Because I think I am getting into a reading.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't have the same craving.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What I'm craving is to sit and watch something.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sick good TV series.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Devour TV series.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I am actually very craving for that.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,337
For some reason.

131
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:25,337
So maybe I should pause a little with the reading.

132
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:28,000
And let things rest.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,314
I do not know.

134
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:31,314
I'm still craving these books.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I do not know what to do.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We take one day at a time, we take one book at a time.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then we'll see how October will be.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Of course, I am curious about which books you plan to read in October.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,523
Tell me in the comments field and we will hear there.

140
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,266
Give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel.

141
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,744
If you don't already do it.

142
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,000
We will be visible next week.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,267
Take care bye!
