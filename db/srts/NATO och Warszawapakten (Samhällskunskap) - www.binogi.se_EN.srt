1
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:06,968
After the Second World War

2
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:09,621
Want the Soviet Union to increase its influence.

3
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:13,500
They install communist governments in several

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,549
Eastern European countries.

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,000
These countries are formally independent

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but hard controlled by the Soviet Union

7
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:24,205
They are Soviet satellite states.

8
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:28,800
In 1948, the Soviet Union crashes a democratically elected

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,600
government in Czechoslovakia and then cut

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,845
of the supply paths to the Democratic West Berlin.

11
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:38,600
The United States and Western Europe are starting to get nervous.

12
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:42,467
What is the Soviet Union's next goal?

13
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:49,076
In April 1949, foreign ministers meet from 12 Western European and

14
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:51,900
North American countries in Washington D.C

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,979
They sign an agreement where it stands

16
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:57,800
That an attack on one of the countries from eg.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,332
The Soviet Union will be considered an attack on them all.

18
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,300
The agreement is called the North Atlantic Treaty and

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,900
The countries that sign form North Atlantic Treaties

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,106
the organization or NATO.

21
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:16,400
Soon, contradictions arise between NATO

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,900
and the Soviet Union over Germany status.

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,000
Germany has been a split nation since

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,302
the end of the Second World War.

25
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:25,650
Americans, the British and

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,100
the French occupy different zones in western Germany

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,487
And in West-Berlin.

28
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:32,900
The Soviet Union controls

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,722
Eastern Germany and East-Berlin.

30
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:37,771
Now the Americans are beating, the British

31
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:40,300
and the French together their zones in order to

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,795
form a new country, the Federal Republic of Germany.

33
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:46,800
The Soviet Union responds by forming.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,300
German Democratic Republic in Eastern Germany, although it

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,189
is democratic by its name so everything is determined by it

36
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,000
East German Communist Party.

37
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,638
US and their allies want West Germany

38
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:03,798
forming a separate army and joins NATO

39
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,096
In this way they can help defend

40
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,634
Western Europe against the Soviet Union.

41
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,500
The Soviet Union does not like this idea at all.

42
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:17,805
They warn that if West Germany forms an army

43
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,334
and joins NATO,

44
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:23,000
So the Soviet Union will create its own defense alliance.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,076
Germany still joins NATO and begins

46
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:28,930
build up your own army.

47
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:33,671
So the Soviet Union does just that, they warned about.

48
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:38,722
In May 1955 the Soviet Union invites you

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,000
their satellite states to Warsaw in Poland to sign

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,640
Warsaw Treaty on Friendship, Collaboration and Mutual Assistance.

51
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,368
Warsaw Pact

52
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:54,318
Like NATO, the Warsaw Pact Countries are required to come to each other

53
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,800
defense if they are attacked by an enemy.

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,245
Pact also establishes a military headquarters in

55
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,662
Moscow for all signing countries,

56
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:07,282
The desire clearly signals that the Soviet Union decides.

57
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:10,588
When Hungary and later Czechoslovakia and Poland

58
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:13,073
trying to oppose the Soviet rule

59
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:18,119
Uses the Soviet Union troops from the Warsaw Pact to beat down the uprising.

60
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:21,938
The pact will apply to 1991.

61
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:28,300
NATO and W Arszawa Pact two agreements that bring together the Western

62
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,700
democracies on one side and the Soviet Union and its

63
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,600
Communist satellite states on the other although these

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,300
Alliances are not explicitly in conflict with each other is that

65
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,100
clearly that a dispute between two members from

66
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,200
opposite sides can easily escalate to

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
A much greater conflict.
