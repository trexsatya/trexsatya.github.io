1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,800
- I know a rascal when I see one.
- It's okay.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,500
I will get back at him
for making Harry so scared.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,060
Hey, hey!

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,840
- We are outside...
- Gröna Lund!

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,420
It's Halloween in there,
and Hussein is with us.

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:40,780
Remember when we tried on costumes?
A lot of you want to see Hussein in his, so here you go.

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,020
- Should I try it on here?
- What do you think?

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:52,240
- Yes, inside the park.
- Walk around and scare people with it.

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,640
- I don't think it's that scary.
- It's funny. It will look good when you are running.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,920
Yes, definitely.

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,860
We have heard that
Gröna Lund is very scary this year.

12
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:13,660
More horror houses, more ghosts,
more witches, more open attractions. Let's go!

13
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's go!

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,980
Look at that big spider, Harry.

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,120
Hussein went to the bathroom.

16
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:33,020
- Are you pumped to see him?
- You are jumping up and down.

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:46,720
- Should I walk around in this?
- Absolutely, it's amazing. Wait, I have to film this.

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,780
I think it's so funny!

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,840
It's so weird, and your
legs and feet go like this.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,080
- Welcome! Do you want some candy?
- No, one shouldn't eat candy.

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,660
- And you?
- Yes.

22
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,500
I hope you like it.

23
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,860
Today is a cheat day.

24
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,400
Look at Alma. Want to share?

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,440
- That's poison! You can't eat that.
- Oh God! No, no, no.

26
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Just come through.

27
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,380
I can't...

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,700
- The legs must go under it.
- Oh, sorry.

29
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,120
My legs hurt.

30
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,900
We aren't secured.
You need to get your legs under it.

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,220
Only the baby is secured.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:13,240
We are here for the press preview so there are
no queues, but I still didn't get a seat on this ride.

33
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,320
- Now we will go to the area for older kids.
- I took off my costume.

34
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,280
- You can't go to a horror house with a baby.
- No, especially not on it's shoulders.

35
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,800
- What is it, Harry?
- Up there!

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,020
The scary pumpkin.

37
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,980
Bye bye, nice side.

38
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:07,300
That's correct. We will now pass through the portal
to the more unpleasant and scary side.

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,300
Are those scary?

40
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,120
No, it can't move.

41
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,220
Come here, little ones...

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,080
Stop it.

43
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,140
Over there is the new
horror house "The Sect".

44
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,360
It's the scariest attraction
here at Gröna Lund.

45
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,560
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

46
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,200
- I'm just kidding, we won't go there.
- It's very scary and brand new.

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:49,660
The age limit is 13 years, 11 years with an adult.
It's a recommendation, you can enter if you dare.

48
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,500
- Do you dare, Alma?
- No.

49
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,700
- Me neither.
- You don't have to.

50
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,680
I dare to enter.

51
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,880
Myself, Axel and Hussein
will try "The Sect" later.

52
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,620
Definitely.

53
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,000
- We might have to find you a baby-sitter.
- Yes.

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,240
I know who - the two witches
who followed us last year.

55
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,860
- Oh, right.
- Oh, yes. One of them lost her nose.

56
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,200
They will be here soon.

57
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,280
- Oh, there's a fire show over there.
- Do you remember him?

58
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm scared!

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,640
- Are you scared?
- Mm.

60
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,700
- Why is that?
- It's scary.

61
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,900
What are you thinking?

62
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,140
Okay, strange.

63
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,000
Behind you.

64
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,900
Look at the teeth. Such scary teeth!

65
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,100
- Run!
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

66
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:28,060
He is just a regular person with makeup,
fake teeth and red contact lenses in his eyes.

67
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,480
You are all so quiet.
Aren't you happy?

68
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,700
I want happy people at my circus.

69
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,040
I know a rascal when I see one.

70
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,240
- Mom, maybe you should look behind you.
- Oh!

71
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,620
Come here, Alma.

72
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,680
Did it fall asleep?

73
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,140
- Do you want to shake its hand?
- No.

74
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,100
- Can I do it?
- Yes.

75
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,920
Harry, come. He is kind.
Look, he is kind.

76
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,840
Shake hands.

77
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,880
You are so brave!
Cool, buddy!

78
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,140
Look, it's so scary.

79
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,800
- It wasn't that bad, Harry.
- No.

80
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,640
- It was pretty nice.
- It scared you so much last year.

81
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,140
Yes.

82
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,460
Why the rush?
Don't you want to say hello?

83
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,480
She thinks she is safe behind the camera.
Oh, how wrong you are.

84
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,140
- Who are you?
- I will take care of you during your visit. Where to next?

85
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,320
Do you have any suggestions?

86
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:12,360
Go in there, "The Sect". There is a beautiful cemetery
with a coffin you can get nice and warm in.

87
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,060
I would rather not warm up in a coffin.

88
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:23,540
You have no choice if you go in there.
You give up your right to make your own decisions.

89
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,620
- Joanna, don't trust him.
- I don't.

90
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,480
- I feel like there are more scary beings here this year.
- Yes, definitely.

91
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,020
Now we will take a break from the horror
and ride "The Wild Mouse" instead.

92
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,700
Let's go, Harry.

93
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,120
This is good.

94
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,260
We will fall off!

95
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,080
There was someone scary over there.
What did he say?

96
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:26,220
- He told me to rest in a coffin, so Harry doesn't like him.
- Can we leave now?

97
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,160
- Where do you want to go?
- The witches are coming.

98
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,880
Oh, there is one.

99
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Look.

100
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,600
In here is where the clowns
get ready - the actors.

101
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,020
We will get to go "behind the scenes"
and take a look.

102
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,440
This is the secret door, turn around.
Super exciting!

103
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,680
- Will I meet any clowns?
- No, we won't meet anyone scary now. Look!

104
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,140
Here are scary clown costumes
with their names on them.

105
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,480
Here is one that Alma could wear.

106
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,620
- Isn't it too big?
- Yes, but it will be quite fun.

107
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,440
- Here is one that Harry could wear.
- Yes, it looks like The Joker's.

108
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,860
- Do you want to try them on?
- Yes.

109
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,760
- Gröna Lund is letting us do this, by the way.
- Can I get makeup like The Joker?

110
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,860
Yes, you can have makeup as well.
Just go upstairs.

111
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,640
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

112
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:59,100
- Do you two want to become scary clowns?
- Yes, me and Alma.

113
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,540
All right!

114
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,060
- Can I take off your beanie?
- Mm.

115
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,820
- I will start by painting your face white.
- Mm.

116
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,500
How scary?!

117
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,260
This will be the children's revenge on the ghosts,
circus ringmaster and clowns who have scared them.

118
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,300
Thank you for this, Gröna Lund.
So good!

119
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,180
Go!

120
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,120
Scare him, he's scared.

121
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:59,160
Now I'm going to scare the circus ringmaster.
I will get back at him for making Harry so scared.

122
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,920
What horrible creature was that?!

123
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,980
- It's dark outside, and it's time.
- Yes.

124
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,140
"The Sect".

125
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,040
Let's go, us three.
The kids are with a staff member.

126
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,820
- I will ride "The Wild Mouse" instead.
- No, no, no! Come here.

127
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,340
- This one will be scary.
- It's much scarier than last year.

128
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,180
It can't be compared.

129
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,500
SCARY

130
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,280
That's a real person.

131
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,340
HELP ME!

132
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,160
Help me! Help me!

133
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Over there.

134
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:49,380
We are outside the entrance again, Gröna Lund
has closed. It was only open for two hours today.

135
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,740
- What do you think?
- Fun.

136
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,880
Great fun, and scarier.

137
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,600
- Scary!
- So scary.

138
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,680
It was so scary this year!
I don't know if it came across, but it was so...

139
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,420
- Not for me, no one scared me.
- You scared some people.

140
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,280
Before you started scaring people,
was it not scary then?

141
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,180
- I scared people twice.
- Yes, but you also got scared.

142
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,800
- You got a little scared too, right?
- Yes.

143
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,580
- The circus ringmaster was the worst one.
- Yes, the absolute worst one.

144
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:33,060
We have already answered this Question of the Day,
but we keep getting it week after week:

145
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,160
"Where is Hussein?", "What is Hussein doing?",
"Where does Hussein live?".

146
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,680
What should I say... I'm studying.
I don't live with The Swedish Family anymore.

147
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,380
- Hussein has moved out, become an adult.
- Yes, exactly.

148
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,260
Mom, why did he live with us?

149
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:59,320
I needed a home, I didn't have one.
You found me, and I got to live with you.

150
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,560
- I'm so glad that we found you.
- Yes, we really are.

151
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,900
Me too.

152
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:10,520
I can't even describe - Alma and Harry saw Hussein,
ran towards him and jumped up on him.

153
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,740
- Alma was like "he is my brother" from day one.
- Super cozy! You have really been like siblings.

154
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,700
If you like me and are interested in what I'm doing,
follow my Instagram "HUSSEINGBA".

155
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,520
I might start a YouTube channel
after I have finished school.

156
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,940
- We really hope so!
- That would be fun to watch.

157
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,940
- Cross your fingers.
- If you help me.

158
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:41,260
Thank you for watching this video!

159
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,100
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

160
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,180
Leave comments, ask questions
and take care until next time.

161
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,840
Bye bye!
