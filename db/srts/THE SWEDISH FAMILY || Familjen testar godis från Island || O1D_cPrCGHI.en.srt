1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,273
Iceland, here we come!

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,000
- Laura, was it good?
- Ah... No!

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,105
Not my cup of tea.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,382
I think licorice tastes like burnt car tires.

5
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay, let's go!

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,560
Hey, hey!

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,200
Today we are trying candy
from Iceland!

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,920
We got this package a long time ago
from a very sweet viewer, named Freya.

9
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:41,913
Yes.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,762
- "Ouii!"
- Yes, it's full of "ouii"! (Candy)

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,800
It kind of got lost in the house.

12
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:53,960
Then we found it and was, like, "Let's do this!"
What did Alma and Harry say then?

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,800
- No.
- No.

14
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,600
It's only licorice, and we hate licorice.

15
00:00:58,718 --> 00:01:00,880
- It's not only licorice.
- Yes!

16
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:06,320
Let's be positive. How sweet is Freya
to have sent us this candy from Iceland?

17
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:10,240
- Very!
- Yes, of course, but it's just...

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,560
They're not feeling it, but heck, let's do this!
Are you ready?

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,614
Yes!

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,842
"Sterkur Draumur"

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:31,400
It's a chocolate candy
with a licorice rope inside.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,880
The rope inside is salty licorice.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,320
- How do you know that?
- It says so on the packaging.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,257
- Laura has already started. We need to catch up.
- Yes, let's go.

25
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:58,200
- He didn't eat it.
- You're cheating!

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,080
- You didn't eat it?
- No.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,560
- Try it, Harry.
- Was it good?

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,328
- Yes, it was good.
- Mm!

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,722
Laura, you seem to really like it.

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,676
- Exciting with a rope in the chocolate.
- Yes.

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,257
Exciting execution, you could say.

32
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,348
Alma was, like...

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,822
- What do you think?
- I mean...

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,964
Harry disappears.

35
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,960
I've had worse licorice.
This one wasn't that bad.

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,643
- I think the licorice was better than the chocolate.
- Mm.

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,000
- Mine!
- Okay, okay.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,205
- Laura seems to like it a lot.
- Yes.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,918
Not really my cup of tea.

40
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:55,216
How many points do you give it? 0-5.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
2 points.

42
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:59,320
I give it...

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,680
- Oh no, she's throwing up over here.
- ...an easy zero.

44
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:09,320
- Zero, zero, zero...
- Zero, superhero!

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,400
- Harry, did you notice what just happened here?
- No.

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,773
- She's, like, throwing up. Laura, was it good?
- Ah... No!

47
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:27,407
- I give it 3 points.
- I also give it 3 points.

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,987
♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me ♪

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,360

-  ♪ ...is all I need. ♪

"Old fashioned licorice"

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,200
It's soft licorice pieces.
They look like parts of a... licorice roll.

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:01,240
This will probably be the candy I like the least.
Pure licorice! Who eats this?

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,480
You're so negative.
Lots of people eat it. I eat it.

55
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,000
I thought we would eat this last.

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,960
It's not good that you've already seen the candies.
We normally don't do that.

57
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:17,118
- No.
- I can tell now that this was no good idea.

58
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,840
- Let's try it.
- Let's try it.

59
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay then.

60
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:26,263
Oh, sweet licorice.

61
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,800
Well... it probably is a bit salty.

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,587
It was good.
I'll have another one.

63
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,000
How can one dislike licorice that much?
Are all kids like this? No.

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,253
- No.
- No. Only you two are this silly.

65
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,200
Eww. No, I can't do this.

66
00:04:58,528 --> 00:05:02,480
- No, eww.
- You don't like it either?

67
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,670
"No, eww."

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,562
I mean...
Does Iceland have a lot of licorice?

69
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,200
We can throw out the question to those of you
who are from there, live there, or have been there.

70
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,605
- Maybe there are a lot of sweets from other countries there.
- Right.

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,080
Maybe the Icelandic candy
consists of a lot of licorice.

72
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,680
Hey, this is my seat!

73
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:34,240
Musical chairs!
How many points do you give it?

74
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
Zero, zero, zero, zero...

75
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,040
- Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero...
- ...zero, zero, zero, zero, zero...

76
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:43,014
- "Zeo, zeo!"
- "Zeo, zeo."

77
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,291
I love that you have a big zero
on your chest now too, Harry.

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,120
- Yeah, exactly. Here.
- ...zero, zero, zero, zero, zero...

79
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,200
"Zeo, zeo, zeo..."

80
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,800
Okay, the kids agree on zero points.
How many does Axel give it?

81
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,996
- I give it 1 point.
- I give it 2 points.

82
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,192
Don't forget to give the video a thumbs up
if you like when we try candy.

83
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,849
"Sambó Thristur"

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,800
It looks like an ordinary chocolate praline.

85
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:24,000
An ordinary chocolate praline...
with licorice in it.

86
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,159
- What?
- Mm.

87
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,254
- I don't really taste the licorice.
- Neither do I.

88
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:31,640
- That's because the last one was so strong.
- Neither do I.

89
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:35,462
Harry, eat it! Stop cheating.

90
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,481
- I like the texture.
- I also like the texture. It's very special.

91
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,960
- This one actually wasn't that bad.
- Like a mixture of chocolate praline and chewing gum.

92
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,000
Maybe now it's happening...
they're starting to like licorice.

93
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,246
- Exactly.
- No.

94
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,200
Iceland, here we come!

95
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,400
No, never. Never!
I think licorice tastes like burnt car tires.

96
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,802
- But you're for "Iceland, here we come!", right?
- Yes, I am.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,600
- Who doesn't want to go to Iceland?
- Good question.

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,120
Laura has put her pacifier in her mouth.
She doesn't seem too excited to try it.

99
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,004
Harry, how many points do you give it?

100
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,320
- 3 points.
- 3 points?

101
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,661
- A strong 3 points.
- Me too.

102
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,720
- Oh.
- Oh, wow!

103
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,778
- Me too.
- Me too.

104
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:31,614
Hey, now you have to stop that drum orchestra.
We all give it 3 points.

105
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,000
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go!

106
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,458
"Lakkrís Karamelluperlur"

107
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,600
Round chocolate pearls
filled with licorice.

108
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,003
- I think this one could be pretty good.
- Why do you think that?

109
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:53,767
Because... it's caramel.

110
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,400
Let's try it!
1, 2, 3.

111
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:03,226
Mmm...

112
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,440
Pretty good, Alma.
Pretty good.

113
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,897
The chocolate tastes like dust.

114
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,202
Or maybe it's the licorice
that tastes like dust.

115
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:26,465
- It almost tastes like alcohol, in some weird way.
- Yeah. Very adult and boring.

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,728
No, not fun. Not fun.
D*mn.

117
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,001
No...

118
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,658
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:41,106
This is like one of those candies that old people have
that never gets eaten.

120
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,000
God, I got all giggly.
This one was actually awful.

121
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, it was really boring. And I took another one.
I don't understand why I took another one.

122
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,477
Okay, mommy starts with:
Zero...

123
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
Zero.

124
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,200
Zerooo...

125
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,389
Zero!

126
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:06,945
Very nice! Very good!

127
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,600
- We take a break to answer today's Question of the Day.
- Yes.

128
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:14,983
It's from Freya, who sent the package.

129
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
"If Laura had been a boy...

130
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:21,098
- Uaua.
- Yes, exactly. Uaua.

131
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,458
...what would his name have been?"

132
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:28,757
- Very good question.
- Do you remember?

133
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,420
I don't think we had any names.

134
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,400
- Yes.
- Leo.

135
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
- Leo.
- No.

136
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:36,800
- Yes. That was Harry's suggestion.
- We talked about Eliott.

137
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,400
- Eliott was my suggestion.
- What was my suggestion?

138
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:43,320
Sten. (Stone)

139
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,238
I'm sorry to all the Stens out there,
but to imagine Laura as "Sten"...

140
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:54,092
- No, she's not a Sten. She's a Laura.
- Yes. Or a Pupita!

141
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,092
Pupita!

143
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,200
It looks like chocolate with bubbles.

144
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,256
- This is the first candy that doesn't contain licorice.
- Yes!

145
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:09,895
- Let's go!
- Yes!

146
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:19,040
- There weren't any bubbles.
- Yes, there's a wafer in there. Like little wafer bubbles.

147
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,004
Yes, okay.

148
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,560
The chocolate on the other candies
was so much better than this chocolate.

149
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:27,946
I agree.

150
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,920
- Is it good?
- Aha.

151
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,699
- That's good.
- Laura likes this one. How many points do you give it?

152
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,793
I give it 3 out of 5.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,352
- And Harry?
- 3 out of 5.

154
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
2 out of 5.

155
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,965
- Why are we saying "out of 5" all of a sudden?
- 2 points.

156
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,000
I give it 2 points.

157
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:57,400
- Do you need help getting up?
- Yes, please.

158
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,000
Ouch. Harry...

159
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,080
God, you guys are too weird.

162
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,539
It looks like an ordinary piece of chocolate
but with little bumps on the underside.

163
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:33,800
- I feel like we've eaten the same thing over and over.
- Yes.

164
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:39,240
- Chocolate with licorice in it.
- Yeah. It's getting a bit repetitive.

165
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:44,800
- This one had sweet licorice in it though.
- What? I think it's salty.

166
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:52,400
I seem to have a bit of a hard time telling if it's sweet or salty,
but... there's licorice in it.

167
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,244
- Tiny sticky squares.
- Yes.

168
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:04,435
I think this tastes like old Kinder Surprise Egg chocolate...
with burnt car tires in it.

169
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,416
I give this chocolate 1 point.

170
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,200
I give this chocolate... zero!

171
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,572
Zero!

172
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,800
Zero.

173
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,966
ZEROOO!

174
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,800
Zero.

175
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:24,807
Zero!

176
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:31,591
"Djúpur"
That is... white balls with licorice.

177
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,705
Eww. Oh, no!

178
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:52,190
It wasn't fun. It isn't fun.

179
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:56,663
It's very sandy. It's licorice sand.

180
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,001
Not fun.
But it wasn't strong or anything like that.

181
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:08,600
This is the worst licorice I've ever had.
It gets stuck in the teeth. You're like, eww...

182
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:16,000
You're picking your teeth.
There's like fine dust in the whole mouth.

183
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,320
He's pulling out his tongue.

184
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:24,800
Do you know what?
This was the last Icelandic candy.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,200
- YAY!
- YAY!

186
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:31,400
What do we think of Iceland? Good!
What do we think of Icelandic candy?

187
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,560
- Bad!
- Bad!

188
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:38,120
- No, this feels awful.
- Maybe Iceland's licorice...

189
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,103
Yes, exactly!
What do we think of Icelandic licorice?

190
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,000
But...

191
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,400
I feel a little guilty for Freya who has been so kind
and bought and sent us candy.

192
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes, that was so nice.
It's just that Harry and I really don't like licorice.

193
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
- No.
- No.

194
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,490
It's not our thing.

195
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,400
Is it your thing, you guys at home?
Is licorice your thing?

196
