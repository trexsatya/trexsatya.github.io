1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,273
Iceland, here we come!

2
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:02,960
!

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,000
- Laura, was it good?
 - Ah ... no!

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,105
It was probably not in my taste.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,382
Licorice tastes like burnt car tires, I think.

6
00:00:13,837 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay then, we drive!

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,560
Hello Hello!

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,640
Today we will test candy from ...

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Iceland!

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,920
We got this package sent to us by a very nice viewer, called Freya, a long time ago.

11
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:41,913
Yes.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,762
- "OUII!"
 (Candy) - Yes, full of "ouii"!

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,800
Then it actually disappeared a little at home.
 We lost it in the house.

14
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:53,960
Then we found it and just, "Oh! We'll do this!"
 And what did Alma and Harry say then?

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,800
- No.
 - No.

16
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,600
It's just licorice, and we hate licorice.

17
00:00:58,718 --> 00:01:00,880
- It's not just licorice.
 - Yes!

18
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:06,320
Now we will be positive.
 How cute is not by Freya to have sent a lot of candy from Iceland to us?

19
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:10,240
- Giant!
 - Yes, of course, that's cute.
 But that's so ... BLA.

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,560
They have not been sucked, but now seventeen in me we drive!
 Are you ready?

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,614
- Yes!
 - Yes ...

22
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:20,914
- (Axel) Woho!
 - (Harry) "Ouii!"

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,842
- "Sterkur draumur" - (Alma Harry laughs)

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:31,400
It is a chocolate candy with a licorice bar inside.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,880
It is a brine bar that is inside.

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,320
- How do you know that?
 - It's on the package.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,257
- Oh, Laura has already started.
 We have to catch up!
 - Yes, now we drive.

28
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,266
- (shoulder) mm.
 - (Joanna) etc.

29
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:55,291
(Harry) etc.
 (laugh)

30
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:58,200
- But he hasn't eaten it!
 - You have cheated!

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,080
- Haven't you chewed?
 - No.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,560
- Take now, Harry.
 - Was it good?

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,805
- Yes, it was good.
 - (Joanna) etc.!

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,722
- (Laura) Mmm.
 - Laura, you really seem to like it.

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,560
- Exciting with a bar in the chocolate.
 - Yes.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,800
- Exciting version, you could say.
 - (Alma, Slot) AA ...

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,348
Alma just, aa ...

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,822
- What do you think?
 - In other words...

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,964
Oh, he disappears.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,960
I've tasted worse licorice, and this one was not so horrible.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,825
- I think the licorice was better than the chocolate.
 - (Joanna) etc.

42
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:42,000
- My!
 - Yes yes, okay.
 Sorry.

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,205
- Laura seems to like it a lot.
 - Yes.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
It was probably not in my taste.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
- (Laura) eww.
 - (Harry) eww.

46
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:55,216
What points do you give from 0-5?

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,673
- I give 2. - ooh!

48
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,320
I give...

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,680
- Oh no, she vomits here.
 - ... a light zero.

50
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:09,320
- Zero, zero, zero ... - zero, superhero!

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,400
- Harry, did you notice what just happened here?
 - No.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,341
- She vomits type.
 Laura, was it good?
 - Ah ... no!

53
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:27,407
- I give this a 3rd.
 - I also give a 3rd.

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,880
  Gimme, Gimme, Gimme Some Time to Think I'm in the Bathroom, Looking at Me

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,360
- Are you ashamed of me a little?
 - (Harry) ... is all in need.

56
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,779
  Gimme, Gimme, Gimme Some Time to Think I'm in the Bathroom, Looking at Me

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,442
"Old -fashioned Lakrids"

58
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,160
There are soft licorice pieces.
 It looks like it's parts of a ...

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,200
Oops!
 ... licorice strap.

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:01,240
This will probably be the candy I like the least.
 Pure licorice!
 Who eats like this?

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,480
So, you are so negative.
 Lots of people eat it.
 I eat it.

62
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,080
I thought we would eat this last!

63
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:12,960
Meh.
 So, it is not good that you have seen the candies since before.
 We don't usually do that.

64
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:17,118
- No.
 - I notice now that it was not a good idea.

65
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,840
- But now we drive, I think.
 - Here we go!

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay then.

67
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:26,263
Oh, sweet chalk.

68
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,800
Or, well ... it was probably a little salty anyway.

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,587
That tasted good.
 I'll take one more.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,000
How can you dislike licorice so much?
 Does all the kids do that?
 No.

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,253
- No.
 - No.
 Only you are so stupid.

72
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,200
(Alma) eww.
 No, I can't do this.

73
00:04:58,051 --> 00:05:02,480
- (Laura) No, Blä.
 - You don't like it either?

74
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,670
"No, blow."

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,480
But then ... is there a lot of licorice in Iceland?

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,200
We can throw out the question to you who come from there, or live there, or have been there.

77
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,605
- There may be a lot of sweets from other countries there.
 - Right.

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
But just the Icelandic candy may be more licorice.

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,680
Hello, this is my place!

80
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:34,240
Musical chairs!
 What points do you give?

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,160
Zero, zero, zero, zero ...

82
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,040
- Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero ... - ... zero, zero, zero, zero, zero ...

83
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:43,014
- "Noj, noj!"
 - "Noj, noj!"

84
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,291
I love that you have a big zero on your chest now too, Harry.

85
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,120
- Yes exactly.
 Here.
 - ... zero, zero, zero, zero, zero ...

86
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,200
"Noj, noj, noj ..."

87
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,800
Okay, the kids agree on a zero.
 What does Axel give?

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,996
- I give 1 point.
 - I give 2 points.

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,080
Don't forget to push thumbs up if you like to see when we test sweets.

90
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,849
"Sambó Thristur"

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,800
It looks like a very common chocolate praline.

92
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:24,000
A very common chocolate praline ... with licorice in.

93
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,159
- huh?
 - mm.

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,254
- I don't feel the licorice.
 - Neither do I.

95
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:31,640
- It's because the previous licorice was so strong.
 - Neither do I.

96
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:35,462
Harry, eat!
 Stop cheating.

97
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,481
- I like the texture.
 - I also like the texture.
 It is very special.

98
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,960
- This one was actually not so horrible.
 - Like middle of a chocolate praline and chewing gum, type.

99
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,000
Look, maybe it's happening now ... They start to like licorice.

100
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,246
- Yes exactly.
 - No.

101
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,200
Iceland, here we come!

102
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,400
No never.
 Never!
 Licorice tastes like burnt car tires, I think.

103
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,802
- But "Iceland, here we come" can you still press yes?
 - Okay, I can press that.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,600
- Who doesn't want to go to Iceland?
 - Good question.

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,120
Laura has put in the pacifier, and doesn't seem so hungry.

106
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,004
Harry.
 What points do you give?

107
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,320
- A 3rd.
 - A 3rd?

108
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,661
- A strong 3rd.
 - Same here.

109
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,720
- Well.
 - Oh oh oh.

110
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,778
- Me too.
 - Me too.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,614
Hörrudu, now you have to stop with that drum orchestra.
 Everyone gives a 3rd.

112
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,000
- Yes.
 - Okay then, we drive!

113
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,295
(Harry screams)

114
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,458
"Lakkrís Caramel Superbrees"

115
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,200
(The others laugh)

116
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,600
There are round chocolate beads filled with licorice.

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,003
- This one I think can be quite good.
 - Why do you think that?

118
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:58,400
- No, but then, because it is caramel.
 - Aah ... then we drive!
 1, 2, 3.

119
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:03,726
(Shoulder) mmm ...

120
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,440
Quite good, Alma.
 Pretty good.

121
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,897
Chocolate that tastes dust.

122
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,400
Or I don't know if it was the licorice that tastes dust maybe.

123
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,465
- It almost tastes spirits, in some strange way.
 - Yes.
 Very adult and boring.

124
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,728
No, not fun.
 Not fun.
 Fy f*n.

125
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,319
No but...

126
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,658
Sorry.

127
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:41,106
This is such a candy that is at home with a pensioner and who never gets eaten.

128
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,000
God, now I got a laughing attack.
 This one was actually horrible.

129
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes, it was very boring.
 And then I took another one.
 I don't understand why I took another one.

130
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,477
Okay, now Mom starts with: Noooool ...

131
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
Noooool.

132
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,200
Noooool ...

133
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,389
Noooool!

134
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:06,945
- (Laura) NNNNNN ... - (Alma, in English) Very nice!
 Very good!

135
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,600
- We take a break to answer today's question.
 - Yes.

136
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:14,983
And it comes from Freya, who sent the package.

137
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
“If Laura had been a boy ...

138
00:09:18,496 --> 00:09:21,098
- Uaua.
 (Laura) - Yes, exactly.
 Uaua.

139
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,640
... what would he have been called then? "

140
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:28,757
- Great question.
 - Do you remember?

141
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,420
I don't think we had any names.

142
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,400
- Yes.
 - Leo.

143
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
- Leo.
 - No.

144
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:36,800
- Yes.
 That was Harry's proposal.
 - We talked about Eliott.

145
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,400
- Eliott was my suggestion.
 - What was mine, then?

146
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:42,911
Stone.

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,238
Forgive everyone named Sten out there, but to imagine Laura as Sten ...

148
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:54,092
- No, she's no stone.
 She is a Laura.
 - Yes.
 Or a pupa!

149
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,092
Pupita!

150
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,771
"Nóa body"

151
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,200
It looks like chocolate with bubbles in.

152
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,080
- This is the first candy that does not contain licorice.
 - Yes!

153
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:10,000
- Woho!
 - Let's go!

154
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:19,040
- There were no bubbles.
 - Yes, there is biscuit chocolate in there. Like small biscuits.

155
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,004
Yes, okay.

156
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,560
The chocolate on the other sweets was so much better than this chocolate.

157
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:27,946
I agree with.

158
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,920
- Is it good?
 - Aa.

159
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,699
- How nice.
 - Laura likes this one.
 What points do you give?

160
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,600
I give 3 out of 5.

161
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,352
- And Harry?
 - 3 out of 5.

162
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
2 out of 5.

163
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,965
- Why did it become "of 5" all of a sudden?
 - 2 points.

164
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,000
I give 2.

165
00:10:53,849 --> 00:11:00,000
- Do you need help up, right?
 - Yes thank you.
 Ouch.
 Harry ...

166
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,080
God, you are too snappy.

167
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:08,363
(Alma Harry) I am a poor peasant boy, but I still live

168
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,800
"Lakkrís Rjómasúkkulaði Með Lakkrísbitum"

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,971
(The others laugh)

170
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,539
It looks like a very common piece of chocolate stuck with small tubers on the underside.

171
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:33,800
- It feels like we've eaten the same thing now and time again.
 - Yes.

172
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:39,240
- Chocolate with licorice in. - Yes.
 It is getting a little tedious.

173
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:44,800
- This one had sweet chalk in anyway.
 - huh?
 I think it tastes salty.

174
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:50,960
I seem to have a little trouble with that with sweet and salty, but it's licorice in.

175
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,244
- mm.
 Small type sticky squares.
 - Yes.

176
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:04,435
I think this tastes old cheek egg chocolate with burnt car tires in.

177
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,416
I give this chocolate 1 point.

178
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,200
I give this chocolate ... noooool!

179
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,572
Noooool!

180
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,800
Zero.

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,966
Nooooool!

182
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,800
(Laura) NOJ!

183
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:24,807
Zero!

184
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:31,591
"Djúpur" There are white bullets with ... licorice.

185
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:38,600
(Shoulder sighs)

186
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,705
(Alma) eww.
 Oh no!

187
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:48,440
(Alma Harry screams and spits and laughs in the toilet)

188
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:52,190
It wasn't fun.
 It's not fun.

189
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:56,663
It is very sandy.
 It's licorice sand.

190
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,001
This one wasn't fun.
 But it was not strong or so.

191
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:08,713
This is the worst liquorice I've eaten.
 It like stuck in the teeth.
 You just, uää ...

192
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:16,000
You cleanse your teeth.
 It became like a fine -grained dust throughout the mouth.

193
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,320
He stands and pulls out his own tongue.

194
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:24,800
You know what?
 This was the last Icelandic candy.

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,200
(All the kids) Yeah!

196
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:31,400
What do we think of Iceland?
 Good!
 What do we think of Icelandic candy?

197
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,560
- Bad!
 - Bad!

198
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:38,129
- No, this feels awful.
 We must not be so awful.
 - Iceland's licorice maybe ...

199
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:43,466
Exactly!
 So we can say.
 What do we think of Icelandic licorice?

200
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,000
But...

201
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,400
I get some bad conscience here for kind Freya who has bought sweets for us and sent us.

202
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes, it was so nice, but ... It's just that I and Harry really don't like licorice.

203
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
- No.
 - No.

204
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,400
It's not our thing.

205
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,400
Is it your thing, at home?
 Is Lakrits your thing?

206
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,203

207
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,200

208
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,920

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,120

210
