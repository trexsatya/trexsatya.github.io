1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,800
Do some heat exercises now when it's a break.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes exactly.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,480
My name is Kaula, I did the basic education as a shooting group manager.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:22,200
And what it really means is that you are the leader of 6-8 people.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,600
So then I am the manager of them, you can say.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29.640
Hi, my name is Edward. I did my military duty as a airport security soldier.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34.560
Our task is to protect the Air Force's assets, aircraft, staff.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,720
A little brief.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,000
And today we will answer some questions that you have asked about the military duty, simply.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,240
And they will come in this iPad and we will get them up and we will see when they come.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,400
What prejudice did you have about the Armed Forces before you did the military duty?

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,600
What prejudice did you have?

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01.920
Yes, but it is this classic that there are many men, many guys -

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,240
- And it's hard, it's tough. These are the prejudices I was prepared for.

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,680
And once we started, it felt like, okay these prejudices were feuding out -

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,280
-after a while.

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,000
Because you got to know each other in a better way and you got to learn -

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,720
- Keep the Armed Forces, as an activity in a different way when you entered it.

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,920
We are a uniform and no matter how different we are -

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,480
- So we still work well because we focus on ourselves ...

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,000
Everyone focuses on one and the same thing.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Yes, but I had a bit the same prejudice, so there were many guys -

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,840
- And that it was fragile men who were built as houses.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,320
And that it was really hard work and they were the only ones who managed them.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,520
But also this that everyone who was soldiers was a bit like robots.

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,920
That they could not do wrong. They went like robots.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,040
And they were programmed to make zero mistakes

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00.640
And it was also something that feuded a little under the military duty.

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,080
You saw their commanders make mistakes, it eased a bit on the pressure.

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07.800
They were seen as human beings. Yes exactly, you thought like this -

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09.960
–If he can make mistakes, I make mistakes too

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,640
Then we are equally anyway, somehow.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,440
And above all, be able to dare to make mistakes, because there is not somewhere there

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,440
You can succeed everywhere and have the hard press on yourself.

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,440
Without, dare to make mistakes and that was the way like this

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,720
The prejudice began to disappear.

37
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
Dare to make mistakes, because then you will learn.

38
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,960
If you do not make a mistake, then you will never learn.

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,760
Now let's see, now we got one here.

40
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,280
Why did you do military service?

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Do you want to start Kaula?

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,520
I made my own application, so I voluntarily applied for.

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,880
I already had a permanent employment, and felt that I was in a place in

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,800
Life where I didn't know what I wanted to do.

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,200
So I felt, this was the right alternative and so I really tested.

46
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,200
I just did the tests so I came in that way.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,000
And you?

48
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,240
I was obliged, so I got this pattern base home and

49
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02.400
Really wrote that I didn't want to do the military duty.

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,320
Okay.

51
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,360
But I was obliged anyway and I am very happy now

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,680
In retrospect, actually.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,520
Now another question came here!

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,760
Let's see.

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,560
What did your family and your friends think when you were moving in?

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,680
No but I had no support from family, but I have always flagged for

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,240
Because I want to do basic education at some point.

58
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,000
And once I ...

59
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,600
... it's a little funny story indeed.

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,440
Because once I got enrollment ... what to call it?

61
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,760
The enrollment order as it is called, or summons.

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,600
The message itself then?

63
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,120
The very message, the decision that I would start my undergraduate education so

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,120
I was forced to invite my mom to a restaurant.

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,800
- Because she would not flip out. -Okay!

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,440
For I knew if I had told her this to her at home, so had

67
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,320
She has become very ... ... she is very so, a little dramatic.

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02.720
- So it was to calm the pressure a little? -Just!

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,920
So I thought if I invite her out somewhere she won't create ...

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,160
Chaos?

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,200
Yes, chaos at the restaurant, because she is very sensed in that way.

72
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,160
Then when we got home, then it was, then we had already talked about it so it resolved.

73
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,120
Okay, now let's see here.

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,600
What characteristics are good to have when doing a military duty?

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,240
I think you should ...

76
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
... collaboration is important, so have the ability to help,

77
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,840
Of course, this is very important. But leadership is very good,

78
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,080
so have you been for example ... ... if I compare to myself

79
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,360
So I have been a gymnastics leader, or a leader in any association.

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,120
So it, I really had to use that.

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,240
Yes, because you were the group manager too.

82
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,080
-Just! - You still had a leadership role.

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,080
And that was not the point from the beginning, I had searched as something else -

84
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,120
–But the commanders looked through it and peppered me to search to -

85
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,880
- or switch to group manager.

86
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03.720
And it was great, but I didn't think so myself.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07.240
Without me thinking "yes, I will never succeed with"

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,760
Or I don't want to lead others.

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,560
But you have a little ...

90
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15.560
... if you are interested in IT or technology then you will be even better at it.

91
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,880
I had these prejudices, at least, when I began the military duty to -

92
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,040
- Good properties to have are fitness and strength.

93
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,120
And it is definitely something that helps but it is definitely not -

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,960
- So vital or as important as I thought.

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,480
Because one starts at such a fairly basic level -

96
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,960
- When it comes to those parts.

97
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,800
And so you build on, so it never gets too much.

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38.560
Without you build up to it.

99
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,200
And I still had a pretty physically demanding position.

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,680
So that, when I went from, when I got my role then I came out and searched -

101
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,160
- What it was like for something and saw that it would be very busy.

102
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52.840
So I thought "this will never go" I'll come there, I'll come -

103
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,000
- Bli sent home at once. But I managed great!

104
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
And it's without some kind of ...

105
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00.680
... I might be out running a little before

106
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,400
But really no more training than the one I got from doing the lump.

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09.400
Thinking that I should try to keep the same position, so it does not appear that you cut.

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12.560
Did we get a new question now?

109
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
Yes, now another question came here.

110
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,080
Is it the toughest physically or mentally to do basic education?

111
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,800
From me, I would say that it is a ... combination of physically and mentally.

112
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,240
It is partly this thing about being above to march.

113
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,080
You are above carrying heavy and walking for a long time.

114
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,400
You may be used to walking and gym, then it is heavy for a short period.

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,920
But for a long time, having to go with packing and do such things.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
It can be hard at first.

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,920
Just

118
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,360
And I think I had a commander that said early ... We had an info meeting -

119
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,560
- I don't know if you had it too? - Yes we had.

120
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,320
Before starting your first day.

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,440
Then he said like this

122
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01.960
"The better trained you are the easier it will be mental"

123
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,000
Because then you have time to think, then you are not as exhausted.

124
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,400
So it is, absolutely!

125
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,680
I remember one of the mental things like me -

126
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,920
- In the beginning, during the undergraduate education anyway.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
It was special when we were out in the field.

128
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,720
That when you were done for the day and would go to the tent site

129
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,880
You didn't really know what to do, because it's so new everything.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,440
But this is what will be obvious later. We had a lot ... you can help mentally too.

131
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,040
Just asking someone "How's it going?", "How are you?" “Do you have clean socks?

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,520
"Do you want a pair of socks?".

133
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,720
Only something like that can make a huge difference to someone's well -being.

134
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,240
Okay, then we'll see!

135
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,840
Is it a lot of peer pressure and freezing?

136
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,040
So, I would say that the commanders are really good at seeing through that.

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,200
And what I have experienced is in that case

138
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,520
That someone has flagged for it.

139
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,280
And said well in advance, "now someone is really naughty here"

140
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,920
And then they have put their foot down immediately.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,960
And then it becomes a completely different dynamic, because then it comes from the commanders.

142
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,560
Yes, I remember once from the basic education.

143
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,320
It was the first time we were in the forest. And everyone was tired and ...

144
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,040
This is what you didn't really know what to do.

145
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,000
So one was mentally tired and physically tired, the time was late

146
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,240
and we would finally be allowed to go to bed

147
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,120
And we were twenty people asleep in one tent.

148
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,640
Such a big tent.

149
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,480
But we only had two headlamps and it was carbon black outside.

150
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,600
Everyone would go and pick up their sleeping mat, but no one saw anything.

151
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,360
I ended up in the biggest quarrel with a guy about a headlamp.

152
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,880
And these are those small things that can be very busy.

153
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,600
Then we actually solved it in the field. Then I went back and said "sorry".

154
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,400
Then he also said that,

155
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,880
"I've also thought, sorry." "It's just a headlamp, you can take it."

156
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,360
- "If you borrow it first, I'll take it later". - God what nice!

157
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,720
You end up in conflict, but it is usually resolved quite easily.

158
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,120
Now one came to question here.

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,640
What does diversity look like?

160
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
Do you want to start it?

161
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00.120
Still, I thought when I started to mix.

162
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,480
After all, people came from all over Sweden, in principle.

163
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,600
And I had my own prejudices before I started undergraduate education,

164
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,360
that I will be lonely girl. I was almost prepared to be.

165
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,960
But when I started, we were still four girls in my platoon.

166
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,920
And I was partly a girl, but also the lonely Arab girl,

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,680
Which I felt I missed anyway.

168
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,440
I missed that any other girl came from another country

169
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,840
Or that someone else in my group came from another country.

170
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,720
Because then you have this community and you can connect with someone

171
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,280
differently.

172
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,960
I missed it.

173
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,240
And that's something we need to get better at in the Armed Forces, I think.

174
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,360
To increase diversity and increase interest in more, because I felt I really wanted to

175
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,120
Have this ... See another girl who also came from another country.

176
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,680
And look partly, as we talked about before, what do the parents think about it?

177
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06.600
What do your parents think, what did your parents say?

178
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:14,960
Because it is always a thing that I can answer if I meet someone from another country.

179
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,880
"What did your parents think?" "Did they make chaos?"

180
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:25,200
Then it is, yes okay, then you have it together. But that's important, I think so.

181
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,600
How was it for you?

182
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,240
We still had a pretty good spread I think ... in our group.

183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,480
Partly on guys and girls, but also in Sweden you came from.

184
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,080
And it was great fun to see ...

185
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,400
The dynamics. It becomes a whole dynamic when-

186
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,280
- Not everyone is exactly the same.

187
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,600
Yes, you get more perspectives.

188
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,000
Exactly and that's what you learn from. You learn from other people's knowledge.

189
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,960
People have different backgrounds and know different things.

190
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay, then we'll see here.

191
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,680
Can I do basic education if I am a vegetarian?

192
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,240
My direct answer is, yes.

193
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,240
We had three vegetarians in my group I know, or in the platoon - the large group.

194
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,960
And it was really no problem ever.

195
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,800
Do you have to be good at being out in nature?

196
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,480
What are you saying?

197
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,440
No, really not.

198
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,840
Was you someone out in nature a lot before the lump?

199
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,880
Absolutely not,

200
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,120
I liked walks and such so I wasn't

201
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,880
urban man in that way.

202
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,760
But my interest in nature grew after basic education.

203
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,480
To think it's fun to hike and so on, it comes from basic education.

204
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51.560
So before that I have hardly been out in nature.

205
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,920
I don't think you need it, you learn.

206
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,760
I've always been a bit of a country-man.

207
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,080
It was just nice to have, but definitely not something you need.

208
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07.800
Those who had never been out in nature, they were at least as experienced

209
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09.360
In the end like everyone else.

210
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,920
What happens if you get sick? Do you go home?

211
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,560
We had sick bodies.

212
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,560
Lodging is the room where one is sleeping in

213
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,720
And there you had to be if you were sick, so you would not infect the others.

214
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,520
So we had no one who went home. Without there you got to be, you got food and drink -

215
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,000
- So that you would do well and you stayed there for as long as you needed

216
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37.560
and got to rest.

217
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,520
I am very familiar with them unfortunately.

218
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,200
I had a little bad luck with Corona under the lump.

219
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,960
So I had to lie there for a while, and it worked great.

220
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,640
Then it was just ... you told their commander "I'm not feeling well, I think maybe I'm sick"

221
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
Then they just said "go to rest you, write when you start feeling better -

222
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,960
- So we come and look at you that everything is well, so maybe you can come back ".

223
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,920
We also had defense health, which is like the Armed Forces health center.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09.040
- A small hospital. - A little hospital yes!

225
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,000
There you had to visit the doctor.

226
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,200
I know I had sometimes -

227
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,840
–Heelne inflammation from marching, and then they realized that

228
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
"Okay, but then maybe you need to have soles"

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And then they put it in. And it got much better ...

230
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,440
... and solved the problem.

231
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,120
So there are doctors to visit ...

232
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,840
... and you get to flag them if it is something you feel bad about.

233
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,040
Okay, the next question!

234
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,600
Do I have to do military service if I don't want to?

235
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,280
The short but simple answer is yes.

236
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,640
If you are called to military service, you have to implement it.

237
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,480
Yes.

238
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,600
And if you are not called, you can make your own application.

239
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,520
If you want to do basic education.

240
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,840
You had done that huh?

241
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,040
Just...

242
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,920
... it was not mandatory in my time. So I made my own application.

243
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,840
Thanks for this call,

244
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,760
Thanks!

245
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,760
It was great fun to hear your own experiences ...

246
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09.840
... and we thank you for your questions.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,320
- Ha it's fine! - Thanks so much, Hello!
