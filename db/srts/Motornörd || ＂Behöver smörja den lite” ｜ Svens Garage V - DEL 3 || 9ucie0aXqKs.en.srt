1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07.936
I probably need to lubricate it a little maybe.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,420
It's not my knees but the saddle.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,340
I just have time to go from here so you have ...

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,836
Yes, I couldn't help but now I have put that cover there.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
I have made new screws.

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,465
After all, it was small screws here before that were worn so damn.

7
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:35,246
So now I have turned on hex-screws in stainless steel as I have taken down a bit

8
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,576
So that they can lie along more.

9
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:39,156
They stood out too much.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,026
Also removed this exhaust valve Pys Valley

11
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,326
Because it sat on the handlebars up here.

12
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:51,585
But it was so damn ugly with that handle so I have this.

13
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:54,380
I sat there a cover there instead.

14
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,479
It only worked a 350 so it works.

15
00:00:58,529 --> 00:01:03,220
Then I also got there on the other side when it is finished here.

16
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09.319
The switches in there even then the adjustment.

17
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,269
Here you see that it is moving here now.

18
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:16,250
It is what densification you should have so everything is done.

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,945
So really it's just to plug the generator now to the battery

20
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:24,136
and pull power up to the lantern to the power switch

21
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,139
And some cables to the taillight and a little.

22
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,996
I also got twelve volts ignition coil and this is a regular coil for car

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,950
So this is not a motorcycle really.

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,055
They are usually a little smaller.

25
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,059
But this one got a seat here so it had to be it.

26
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,706
And there we have a ignition cable that is from that

27
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,669
I had to my HD from 1920.

28
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:48,826
It looks a little old and thought it was good looking

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,255
So it gets a seat here.

30
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:54,349
I have also made a slightly better oil stick.

31
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:59,629
With a handle on a bud.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is how you can see how much oil in.

33
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:09.516
Before was only a steel wire that they had made a loop on

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,445
And stopped into the hole there.

35
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:14,029
Now I have done so that it is a bit dense there too

36
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,986
And then it gets a little nicer.

37
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,126
There are no original stuff, but the cycle is not original

38
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,195
So that you must not be too stingy.

39
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,279
It is a bicycle to be used.

40
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,986
I got where I had to do the reflector inside with then in

41
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,466
and with me to have 12 volt lamp and then I thought

42
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,550
That then I want some H4.

43
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:36,440
Now there is no H4 glass here though.

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,005
I changed holders in the back, solder a new one and there will be good light picture in it

45
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,089
So it will work.

46
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:47,975
But an H4 is no problem to get hold of either.

47
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:51.820
Those 6 volt lamps that sat original on this one in.

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54.845
It does not grow on trees.

49
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:58,929
There is no mack that has any such H4 there are in most places.

50
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,496
No, this is going to be more functional

51
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,729
Now with 12 volt system and that.

52
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08.369
The taillight also came with more modern 12 volt lamps.

53
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,550
Then you can also have them.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15.046
Parking light.

55
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,126
It's LED.

56
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,496
Such a small lamp.

57
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,255
It never breaks.

58
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:23,949
It has not mounted it in the lamp but it should sit there later.

59
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,626
And actually shines very well.

60
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27.809
And this ...

61
00:03:31,164 --> 00:03:32,410
They work well.

62
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,759
He shines at least as well as a regular incandescent lamp

63
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,315
And this one does not draw any power either so if you stand

64
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,315
With the ignition on the lamp lights.

65
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,046
It doesn't matter.

66
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45.909
But you do not have power so he empties the battery.

67
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:49,529
You can have some such modernities when you have 12 volt stream.

68
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52.330
For six volts he had never worked.

69
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,736
And there is hardly anything.

70
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,589
LED is not something 6 volts what I know.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02.526
Sometimes you can be lucky that a lamp also works

72
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,983
at 6 volts, but that.

73
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:06,545
It's pretty hard to get hold of.

74
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,520
This is how it is moving forward.

75
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:13,085
Now we have looked at some sections of the old.

76
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,649
We have recorded and now it is done.

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,295
It is a small, small thing that bins a little neighbor,

78
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22.305
But now I have actually managed to get hold of it.

79
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,335
When you switch so inside the gearbox there is a spring that is bent.

80
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,980
They think it goes up so and so and so it goes down

81
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:38,089
And it should, like putting the change so that it settles.

82
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:42,209
Back then in the center if you say.

83
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,285
But where it was.

84
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:47,399
Someone has found their own or made their own.

85
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,529
Certainly even sometime in a while.

86
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,230
So it didn't work so I had to make my own then.

87
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,700
Got to it pretty well, but sometimes I'm a little fat.

88
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01.265
But now I have seen that it is possible to buy the new ones actually.

89
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,190
It is probably the only spare part for Sarolea.

90
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09.369
But as I said, this gearbox was also sitting on English motorcycles

91
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,940
So that's probably why it exists then.

92
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,279
So it should be purchased.

93
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,410
So that's probably the only thing left to do on the bike.

94
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,855
Otherwise he goes now.

95
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,365
It is possible to switch and so, but sometimes so hooked up a bit.

96
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27.809
Then you get a little on the gear lever and in the end it works.

97
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,395
And the package holder is finished.

98
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,145
Yeah, I had this part but no attachment

99
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35.529
So these brackets here.

100
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,619
I have had to do them myself then.

101
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:43,000
And then I had to cut out and put this chrome strip in place

102
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,480
And even those stakes are also on the right and left side.

103
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:54,282
I have had to do and these brackets front and rear.

104
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:58,191
So now, now you are stable on it.

105
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03.105
I still haven't done any pillow or the seat itself there

106
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05.459
Without there we will see a little what it becomes of it.

107
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08.540
I have foot sticks with if anyone wants to go with.

108
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,485
I haven't had to push yet so that's why it has

109
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,570
not become a pillow there.

110
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,275
But it is quickly done and then you just do

111
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:20,775
a piece of wood with foam rubber and then dress with leather

112
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:24,029
And then you make a little heel so it remains here.

113
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,335
It fulfills its function now anyway.

114
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,010
And then I replaced the entire electrical system.

115
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,140
Put up the charging lamp and there are high beam lamp.

116
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:37,905
Then I took such a red lamp.

117
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:42,829
Then there is a blue diode lamp in there which shows that the high beam is on.

118
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
I also found a list.

119
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,350
What you could have for the front screens here.

120
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,835
Now it is a little, a little narrower than the original,

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,545
But the screen is also not original so this is similar to the original

122
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00.165
Can you say then.

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:07.291
And the handbrake had this bolt where they only took a m6 bolt,

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09.915
cut a skull and then welded it.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13.309
But it was just that that welding flea was so small.

126
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,725
It did not hold for anything the first time

127
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:19,299
I slowed down here in the garage when I rolled it went off.

128
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,105
I have a damn lucky I didn't ride any motorcycle

129
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,190
For it rattling properly.

130
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,790
So this is now completely reduced so that it really should hold.

131
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:36,320
Now there is a recessed screw on the inside which is also hard solder.

132
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,470
It will never come off.

133
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:45,995
Now this is not a thunder good brakes but you have to think about, preferably 5 minutes

134
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,595
Before you start to slow down.

135
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,365
What was it Christer said?

136
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51.945
Theoretical brakes! Yes, there are theoretical brakes.

137
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:54,799
No it was the back brake I got a little better actually.

138
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57.715
It's almost the one you use the most.

139
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:01.070
Then it was these rubber pads then.

140
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02.605
There was someone funny.

141
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,350
I don't know how they made that form, but it didn't fit anything

142
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,375
And then the screws were for long and large skulls.

143
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:12,875
So I have done that in order now and then the rubber lies

144
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,959
A little bit away.

145
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,085
Because it is against here it lies and scraps a little on the color.

146
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,809
So I made it a little from the thought.

147
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,859
Plus you don't know these screws.

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,100
These you want to be a little careful about.

149
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32.306
This is something that cannot be obtained.

150
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,835
Don't think I.

151
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,250
Those gums I am glad that they are as the whole as it is.

152
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,316
It is safe to cast them into something other than plastic or something,

153
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,140
But should it be rubber then it should be rubber.

154
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,966
No, and then that was the support.

155
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,496
It was wrong.

156
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,190
This was quite absorbed here so then you have welded about it.

157
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:57,678
It was just that this record he stood so

158
00:08:57,678 --> 00:09:02,549
He was resting on this edge only and then you can never put him on.

159
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:06.265
It is not even going on asphalt because then the entire motorcycle sinks

160
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:08,460
Down in the asphalt and he finally overturns.

161
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:13,710
So there I had to pick this up, cut off everything, extend it a little and so.

162
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:18,659
So now he lies completely flat so now he stands firmly.

163
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,940
The carburetor was a problem, it flowed over for me.

164
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,496
I couldn't understand.

165
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,169
I sanded the needle and this, but then it was.

166
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,200
Then everything was due to that one.

167
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,110
It's probably something they themselves have done.

168
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,176
The stick, you flow it with.

169
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,260
You push down the float.

170
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:41,325
It was just that it was a millimeter too long so float

171
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:44,789
could never get up far enough to clog.

172
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,535
So I sat on the gasoline that ran all the time.

173
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:52.709
So it was really just taking you off the lid,

174
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54.809
Grind off a little neighbor on it.

175
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,656
Then it works.

176
00:09:56,739 --> 00:10:00.046
Or so this has come from any other carburetor

177
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01.515
with another type of float.

178
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,559
I don't know, but it was too long anyway.

179
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07.236
What have I done more?

180
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,776
Yes, it was the lamp there.

181
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:12.869
I had to redo that so I could get an H4 there.

182
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,419
Because there will be 12 volt system now that I changed the generator.

183
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:22,280
So it became a 12 volt generator.

184
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,760
And it is absolutely no disadvantage to 12 volts.

185
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:31,750
But you have to change all the lamps and stuff. I also had to change the ignition coil.

186
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,936
This is not original stuff so I've got to do

187
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,250
Some special locks that keep it.

188
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,677
It is.

189
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:47,566
It ends up so then you screw at it

190
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:49,210
So it locks.

191
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:54,039
So here I have had to redo.

192
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,726
Yes, everything.

193
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58.809
So I get room with one.

194
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:03,086
But that is where the disadvantage is that H4 they stand out

195
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:08,150
so it doesn't get room in here so then I have had to bend out them

196
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,676
and put such separate ones.

197
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,830
This bracket is taken from one.

198
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15.909
Golf reflector.

199
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,289
This is the reflector that sat in from the beginning with you.

200
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:21,476
It works.

201
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,570
It will actually be very good light picture.

202
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26.309
We see if we can get it together again.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38.510
Then it sits there.

204
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,416
No, now it works.

205
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Has a main switch.

206
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,150
It is easy to turn off that.

207
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,820
And when you turn on the dice, well then the parking is also on.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And then you have it.

209
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01.312
There you have whole and half a highlight dipped beam.

210
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,476
Then we'll see.

211
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05.559
You get started on the first.

212
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:10,630
Then you have to flow a little on the carburetor so that you get some gasoline.

213
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,330
Then this is such an engine that would like to kick back.

214
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
About so yes.

215
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,361
Has barely begun.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,009
He goes very well at idle.

217
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:52.059
It's so low idle so he doesn't even charge.

218
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,359
Gases the smallest.

219
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,425
He starts charging.

220
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,950
There you would really have the idle.

221
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
I think it's a little too loud.

222
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:16,869
And then I have brake lights on the Forpedalen but not on the handbrake.

223
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,869
It is most foot brake that you use.

224
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,046
Lovely sound.

225
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,130
Don't smell much either.

226
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,926
But it is this gasoline that makes it not those additives

227
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,010
Without them, they become very clean in the exhaust gases.

228
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,616
But then it is not appropriate to stand like this but ...

229
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:38,975
It's better anyway.

230
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:44,299
Surprisingly spiteful with to be a 350.

231
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:47,506
If you look at sales brochures and stuff like that

232
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:54,469
So there are as many horses in this 350 as it is in Matchless and BSA 500.

233
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,690
So no, he probably hangs with 500 a 1 stump

234
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:04.731
Fun to drive.

235
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06.446
Although you sit a little.

236
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09.969
I would have liked to have a lower saddle that went here.

237
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:12.869
You sit a little jerk.

238
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,030
It's almost like driving a moped it feels like.

239
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,782
I would have liked to have been sitting here so

240
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,657
Foot sticks sit far up and.

241
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:34,765
I probably need to lubricate it a little maybe.

242
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:36,929
It's not my knees but the saddle.

243
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,065
No. A fun bike.

244
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:46,510
That works.

245
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,630
May well try to go on this summer.

246
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,186
Yes, we have to.

247
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,440
Maybe we can take each hi and go to that animal's meeting.

248
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:55,676
Or go and have a snack somewhere.

249
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,782
Anything.

250
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,776
The most fun thing is to simmer on dirt roads and this one has

251
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:07,196
the suspension on me all around so it actually goes to

252
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,256
and with suspension in the saddle, which I don't really understand why

253
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,340
They have because they have suspension here.

254
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,270
Plunger I think it's called.

255
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,276
Swaying time when you go, but you don't sit still at some time

256
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,359
Without you floating forward.

257
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:24,849
Now I'm done with it now anyway.

258
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,926
Good work! Now i'm not going to do that much more

259
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,616
than that little spring there.

260
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,926
Maybe to the gearbox.

261
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,960
Then I was in the event that I would have repainted it.

262
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,729
Because one is the color, after all, is almost a little dull.

263
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:39,109
I don't know what I used for color.

264
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,559
It almost feels like it's powder coated.

265
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,830
If you compare this black and Willys, this one looks really matte.

266
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,679
But I have become accustomed to it now and I polished it a bit.

267
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,109
Well think it may be like you.

268
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:01.859
But again, this was not the project we would talk about either.

269
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:06,130
We've recorded or still record other stuff

270
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:08.809
So real stuff comes then.

271
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:10,455
Or, it sounds strange to say real stuff,

272
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,780
But what we have planned.

273
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,466
Yes, a little more advanced stuff.

274
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,549
Yes exactly.

275
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,036
That's how it is.

276
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,906
So it will come in the future.

277
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:23,219
It will probably not be this year, but we will kick sometime next year. Yes.

278
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,885
It will be quite long projects with so we may have to divide it a bit.

279
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:31,916
We'll see a little.

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,656
But what I have recorded so much because it happens

281
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,075
So much in this garage.

282
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,299
I just felt that I had to tie the bag together, sometime.

283
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:42,020
So we have tied the bag together with both Willys and Sarolea now.

284
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,496
So now we can move on.

285
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,536
And side wagon.

286
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:45,080
Yes exactly.

287
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,580
And side wagon.

288
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,205
After all, it will be.

289
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,289
It just goes on after all. Yes yes.

290
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,210
The one can happen to it for sure.

291
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,630
And even Willys can happen to happen if you are going.

292
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:55,616
Then we can say on reunion.

293
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Yes we're allowed to do that.

294
00:16:57,859 --> 00:16:58,359
YES! Hello!
