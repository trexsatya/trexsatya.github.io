00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Hello!

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,680
The time is ripe for yet another video blog in English.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,120
It's time to speak English in a whole video again!

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,600
Because there are obviously lots of non-Swedish-speaking people out there

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,680
Who likes to watch videos in a completely different language, with subtitles.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,000
You are not strange at all.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,080
But the thing is that every time I make a video in English I get so much crap.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,920
Let me tell me why. We start from the beginning.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,680
My dad, Graham Henry, was born and raised in England.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,760
(In Irish :) Both of his parents were from Ireland, and ...

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,440
His parents were Irish, but that is

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,600
Not the least relevant in this story.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,360
So when Dad met my Swedish mother, they moved to Sweden.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,520
And then they got me.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,840
So when I was born, Dad couldn't speak Swedish at all,

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,700
So he only spoke English with me.

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,680
And he talked like this.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,040
My dad is very British and very proud of it.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,360
Type once when we were in England and would buy lunch, so this happened:

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,320
- Hmm, I want the tomato soup, thank you!

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,460
: O: o: o: o

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,260
- What?!

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,940
(British dialect :) - Tomaaaaat soup!

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,120
In other words: I have been raised to become a British.

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,580
I have slowly been brainwashed to think that everyone who talks to American dialect is a little left behind.

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,580
On the other hand, my English is not perfect at all.

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,580
But! And then I don't mean "men".

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,800
In Sweden, almost everyone talks to American dialect.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,300
American is right.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,120
Everyone speaks American, because everyone in the movies speaks American.

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,420
While British sounds ridiculous.

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,420
No one in movies speak British,

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,680
In addition to fairy tales, Harry Potter,

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,900
And all sexy women in all action movies ever.

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,400
So when I speak the English that I have learned, I get comments as type:

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,520
- You try too much.

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,200
- Stop believing that you are British. Because you are not.

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
- What is the fake dialect?!

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,880
British English is just like Gothenburg is for Stockholmers.

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,300
You sound stupid when you talk, so heavenly cute

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,920
But I'm Swedish. Clearly my dialect is fake.

42
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,300
I was born and raised in Sweden. No wonder I don't have perfect English.

43
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,760
It would have been strange if I had it.

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,800
And it would have been even stranger if I had spoken American English.

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
Is strangely called "Stranger" in English? I do not think so.

46
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,000
It's like telling people from SkÃ¥ne to stop believing that they are Danish.

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,000
But I try to sound like my dad, I try to mimic my family

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,400
And I've always done it because that's how people do.

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,280
People want to sound genuine.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
And I'm sorry to crack your bubble, but your American dialect is also fake.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,920
Your American is probably more fake than mine.

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,060
And mine is fake as the hell.

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,240
Unless you are American.

54
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,860
In that case, good job.

55
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,640
Your dialect is legit.

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
And that's what I wanted to talk to you about today!

57
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,200
I mostly just wanted to make an English video because I don't remember when I last did it.

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,160
Take care of you, and ... (SMS signal)

59
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,360
Jaw.

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
... so we'll see you as usual next Monday!

61
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Bye!
