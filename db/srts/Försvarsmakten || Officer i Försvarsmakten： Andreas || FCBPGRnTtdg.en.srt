1
00:00:01,562 --> 00:00:03,315
The first day I was very nervous

2
00:00:03,376 --> 00:00:06,369
When the first time would lead aircraft at real

3
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:09.107
And not just in a simulated environment.

4
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:12,182
Then you had to think of extra much when it is for real,

5
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:17,228
Then one's decision and actions have real consequences.

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,972
What drives me is the tasks

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,880
Which I find rewarding and developing.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,460
We have a good community here in the workplace.

9
00:00:27,522 --> 00:00:30,280
Leadership for me is to work in such a way

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,480
that one gets out as much effect as possible

11
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:36,072
of the group's common resources.

12
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,650
My name is Andreas.

13
00:00:37,716 --> 00:00:43,042
I work as a specialist officer and air combat leader at Såtenäs.
