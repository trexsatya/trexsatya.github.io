1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,520
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:19,000
Before we do anything else we want to
thank all of our viewers for helping us reach...

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,240
One hundred million views!

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,100
Party hat!

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,860
It's a crazy number!
It's almost hard to comprehend, right?

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,000
Bang, bang!

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,580
In today's video we will
be reacting to our old videos.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,380
Yes! Many of you have wanted to see that.
We are doing the videos you suggested.

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
Don't forget to give this video a thumbs up
if you think that this is fun.

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,100
- Let's answer a Question of the Day before we start.
- Yes.

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,520
Thomas Leijon asks:
"For how many years have you been doing YouTube?".

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,680
2.5 years.

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,160
Oh my God!

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,840
We will start by reacting to our first vlog.

15
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,060
(- Alma, how do you feel?)
(- I'm nervous!)

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,120
You are so small!

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,880
(And I have a stitch.)

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,980
(- Harry, do you want to come with us?)
(- Mhm.)

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,320
Oh God! You were so cute, Harry!

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,760
- Baby Harry!
- Yes.

21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,180
You were both so tiny.

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,040
This was right before Christmas
and we were taking a train to Mora.

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,580
(Fast!)

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,880
(- Did you get all that energy from your new swimsuit?)
(- Yes.)

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
(It's so nice and energizing.)

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,500
- How funny.
- You were so small!

27
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,320
- And cute.
- Yes, adorable!

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,980
And the vlog was so long!
I would never edit like that today.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,060
I edit our videos and back then
I didn't know how to.

30
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,260
- No.
- It's the longest video in the world.

31
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,900
- No, it isn't. I think it's really short.
- You do?

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,900
- It's really short.
- It's 20 minutes long.

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,900
20 minutes is really short.

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,600
- Vlogs aren't usually 20 minutes long.
- No.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,240
- Do you think a 20 minute vlog is long, or not?
- Leave a comment.

36
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,200
The next vlog is from 3 months later
and the first time we went to Malaysia.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,600
Welcome to Malaysia.

38
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,680
Oh, the water.

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,980
(Can you spit on the lens?)

40
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,840
(- There is a turtle over there.)
(- It's huge, Alma! It's as big as you.)

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,680
(Almost, or as big as Harry.)

42
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,460
(There it is!)

43
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,520
(- Can you see it, Harry?)
(- Yes. It's huge!)

44
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,800
(Put on your swimming goggles, Alma.)

45
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,440
- Ouch, it bit you.
- Yes, it bit her.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,600
(It thought you were a squid.)

47
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,840
- How cool?
- That was so tough.

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,700
You continued to swim around
even though you just got bitten by a turtle.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,820
Well, what can I say? It was fun.

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,960
Alma was 4 years old on this trip, about to turn 5.
Harry was 2.5 years old.

51
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:56,200
- The next video we will react to is filmed at this cabin.
- Yes. It was our first summer on YouTube.

52
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,880
(This is our pool. It's a bit dirty.)

53
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,200
- Our pool!
- Where is the water?

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,320
Alma, your style!

55
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,540
- Look at my glasses, they are completely round.
- Yes.

56
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,840
(- Hey, I like your sunglasses.)
(- They aren't sunglasses.)

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,180
(- What are they?)
(- They are regular glasses.)

58
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,420
(I see.)

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
(Hi!)

60
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:33,060
Can we take a moment to talk about
what this house looked like inside.

61
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,640
- Yes.
- Oh my God!

62
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:43,500
- New fridge and freezer, different table and sofa.
- There's not even a wall, everything is different.

63
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,440
Oh, the windows!
That wall used to have windows.

64
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,340
Sometimes we feel like nothing happens with our
renovations of this house, so it's good to see this.

65
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,380
- Was this one year ago? Or two?
- Two years ago.

66
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,680
(This is our living area slash kitchen.)

67
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,200
(A few months ago we didn't have a kitchen
and now it's halfway done, like a lot of things here.)

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,340
(This is the master bedroom.)

69
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,820
That's your bedroom now.

70
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,000
It was so cramped.
It was a pain to sleep in there.

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,180
- Look, we covered the window with a wooden board.
- We did that for a very long time.

72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,900
(Harry is our biggest fan.
He is watching our own YouTube videos in bed.)

73
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,360
- What was I watching?
- You were watching yourself!

74
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:45,100
(He got tired and wanted to watch something in bed.
It's so weird that he is watching us.)

75
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,700
(Yes, it's quite funny.)

76
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,000
(He has this thing where he
twists his hair when he's tired.)

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,060
(It's good because that way
we know when he's tired.)

78
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,980
- Is that our lawn?
- Yes.

79
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,880
Oh, help.

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,840
It's awful. That we even coped with staying here!

81
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,780
It was a nightmare.

82
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,140
- Yes, but it's good motivation.
- Yes.

83
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,160
- Because it looks quite good now.
- Yes.

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,900
Next up is our first visit to KolmÃ¥rden.
(a wildlife park)

85
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,880
(- Didn't you dare to cuddle the wolf?)
(- No, I want to cuddle with you.)

86
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,700
(I love to cuddle with you.)

87
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,980
(- I want to cuddle with him.)
(- Do you?)

88
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,060
(Go ahead, he wants to give you a hug.)

89
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,980
(He was so cuddly!)

90
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,340
(It's good that you dared.)

91
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,260
- Oh, Harry.
- "Cuddly".

92
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,720
"He was so cuddly."

93
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,560
- Little mini Harry.
- Little brother, our little brother.

94
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
So cute!

95
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,100
We ended that day at the dolphin show.

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,660
(Oh, God... The show has ended
and we are moved to tears.)

97
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,240
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

98
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,840
I vividly remember
how it touched my heart.

99
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,860
By then we had been doing YouTube for about 6 months.
We didn't have a lot of viewers.

100
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,460
Then we posted this video, and suddenly
a lot of people came to our channel.

101
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:59,040
It stirred up a lot of emotions. This was kind of
our first video where viewers began to find us.

102
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,840
Yes.

103
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,720
Now we will watch
our most viewed video.

104
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,760
Mommy is a bit more like herself.

105
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,960
It's called "Hospital VLOG".
Alma got her tonsils removed.

106
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:21,020
(- Will they cut my tongue?)
(- No, they will use a tool to keep it out of the way.)

107
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,920
(They will cut with the scalpel
and then burn the area to stop the bleeding.)

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,760
(What will I dream of?
I want to dream that I'm riding a skateboard every day.)

109
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:39,380
(We are not allowed to film now.
I will see you after the operation.)

110
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,340
(Wave, wave.)

111
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,260
Cutie pie!

112
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,860
I was so nervous.

113
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,000
- You look like you have seen a ghost.
- Mm.

114
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,220
(- You look like you have seen a ghost.)
(- I'm incredibly worried.)

115
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,020
- I don't remember that.
- Me neither.

116
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,960
(She's on the operating table now.
There are four people in the room.)

117
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,900
(Two anesthetists, a nurse and an ear, nose and throat
doctor who is performing the operation.)

118
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,800
I remember it like it was yesterday, it makes me tear up.
I was so nervous about the anesthesia. It was awful!

119
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:31,400
I don't like this vlog because I think I'm so strange.
It feels like I'm acting, but it's because I'm so worried.

120
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,420
I even have a strange voice.

121
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,780
I do!

122
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,240
I haven't thought about that.
I will have to watch it again.

123
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,500
- It was such a relief that it went well.
- Yes, indeed.

124
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,540
- That was so scary.
- You slept so much better after the surgery.

125
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,500
It was absolutely silent in her room.
She used to snore and stop breathing during her sleep.

126
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,140
Very loud, Harry couldn't even sleep.

127
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,180
- The next video is our very first challenge.
- Yes.

128
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,940
(This is the next item.)

129
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,220
(Don't peek.)

130
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,500
- Look, he is trying to cheat.
- Yes, he has always been a little cheater.

131
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,480
He's scared.

132
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,760
The box is quite big.

133
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,460
(Is it difficult?)

134
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,620
(Harry, no. Now you are cheating.
You should guess what it is.)

135
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,820
(What do you think it is? You can't look!)

136
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,400
(- Hey... Do you see now what it is?)
(- What is it?)

137
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,260
(It's a little monster!)

138
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,900
A little monster...

139
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,920
- Stop it, that wasn't nice.
- No. This was mean.

140
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,980
- Yes, I agree. We are sorry, Alma.
- Harry got a stuffed toy.

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Look at your reaction.

142
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,700
- You were really feeling through it.
- I tried to see what it was.

143
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,920
- What could it be?
(- Ouch.)

144
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,860
(No, I give up.)

145
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,660
(Do you give up?
Try to really think about what it could be.)

146
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,160
(No, I give up.)

147
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,620
(A crayfish.)

148
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,260
- Oh, Alma!
- That wasn't nice of you.

149
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:41,800
- You were terrified of that stupid crayfish.
- We are sorry, we really owe you an apology.

150
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,180
- We are sorry, we really tested you.
- Alma, I can give you 1 SEK (10Â¢).

151
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,960
- Will you give her 1 SEK?
- Mm.

152
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,060
- That's kind, Harry.
- Yes.

153
00:11:52,180 --> 00:12:01,280
Next up is a video from when our channel was one year
old and we went on a ski trip. We had 20k subscribers.

154
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,360
- It was so much fun! I want to go there again.
- Me too. It was a ski trip in Sweden.

155
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,580
- Me too.
- I love... I love snow.

156
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,460
It was your first time skiing
and you learned very quickly.

157
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,860
[Ski school]

158
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,580
(- Have you had a good time?)
(- Yes.)

159
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,720
(- What would you like to do now?)
(- Go into the ski lodge.)

160
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,980
(Okay.)

161
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,960
(It's time for lunch.)

162
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,980
(Mommy's vegan sausages.)

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,600
Oh God. It's like a fire with a grate on top.
What am I doing?

164
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,380
- Sune's dad!
- I'm like Rudolf.

165
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:50,320
- Oh God, they will burn to a crisp at any moment.
- I know, I got a really burnt one.

166
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,340
Oh God!

167
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,120
Note that Axel said "Perfect!".

168
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,380
(- This is a burnt sausage without the skin.)
- That's the one I got.

169
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,600
(- Do you want it?)
(- Never!)

170
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,660
I remember that I had to peel it.

171
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,600
(- Why not? It tastes great!)
(- It looks disgusting.)

172
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,540
(Oh, stop it.)

173
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,120
- Look! You guys were so good.
- Yes, wow!

174
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,180
- Did we ski like that?
- Yes.

175
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,400
- I went under those rings.
- Yes.

176
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,080
Now that we have laughed at daddy Axel
I think it's time to laugh at me.

177
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,400
Long before we started doing YouTube
I worked in TV.

178
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,380
And I have found an old clip of me.

179
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,780
- What?
- Yes.

180
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:01,020
This is from the TV show "Efterlyst" (wanted) in 2006.
How long ago is that?

181
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,140
- That is... 13 years ago.
- Yes.

182
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm sorry about the quality and the format,
but that's how it was back then.

183
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,120
Anyway. Mommy Joanna is in London
to report about Jack The Ripper.

184
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,980
(The mystery around Jack The Ripper
has haunted people for over a century.)

185
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,080
(He murdered and cut at least
five women in London's East End.)

186
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,720
Oh God.

187
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,400
(He was never caught, and to this day
no one knows for sure who Jack The Ripper really was.)

188
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,520
Oh look, that's mom!

189
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,140
It was a short clip, but I wanted to show it.
Imagine what you can find in YouTube's treasury!

190
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,300
- That was really fun.
- Did you see Jack The Ripper?

191
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,460
No, I did not see Jack The Ripper.
Jack The Ripper died many years ago.

192
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,280
- And he is very dangerous.
- Yes, he was.

193
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:04,380
We have hundreds of videos on our channel
so we could do this again - if you think it's fun.

194
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,280
Yes.

195
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:12,160
- It's important that you let us know what you think.
- Wait, I have an idea! We can react to our slime videos.

196
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,960
- No, preferably not.
- I have started following people who make slime.

197
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,280
You can make slime videos
on your own channel.

198
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,380
- Yes.
- Am I right?

199
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,220
Thank you for watching this video!

200
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,820
Leave comments, subscribe, ask questions,
and take care until next time.

201
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Bye bye!
