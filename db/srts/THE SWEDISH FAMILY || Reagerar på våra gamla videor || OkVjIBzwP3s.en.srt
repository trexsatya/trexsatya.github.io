00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,520
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:18,900
Before we do anything else, we just want to thank all our viewers who have helped us to reach ...

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,400
Hundreds of million views!

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,100
Party hat!

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,860
It's crazy!
 It's almost difficult to take in, right?

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,020
- Air shot!
 Bang!
 - Ah!

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,520
Today we will react to our old videos.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,380
Yes!
 There are many who wanted it.
 We are going through your desires now.

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,620
Don't forget to push your thumb up if you think this is fun.

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,280
Before we start, we should take a question that fits.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,100
Yes.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,520
Thomas Leijon wonders: "How many years have you had Youtube?".

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,680
Two and a half years.

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,940
Oh my God!

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,840
We will start responding to our first vlog.

16
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,060
(- Alma, how does it feel?) (- irritating!)

17
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,120
So small!

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,880
(And I've got some direction.)

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,980
(- Harry, should we bring with you too?) (- mm.)

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,400
Name God how cute you were, Harry!

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,940
- Baby-Harry!
 - Yes.

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,180
God what you were little.

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,040
So this was for Christmas and we would go by train to Mora.

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,580
(Quickly!)

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,620
(- Did you get so much energy from that new swimsuit?) (- Yes.)

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
(It's so energy-ig.)

27
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,500
- How fun.
 - So, you were so small!

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,320
- And cute.
 - Yes, super -puffy.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,960
And our vlog was so long!
 I would never cut like that today.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,060
It is I who cut our videos and at that time I couldn't cut.

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,120
- No.
 - It's the world's longest movie.

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,900
- Not the longest in the world, I think it is a huge card.
 - Do you think?

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,900
- It's a huge card.
 - It's 20 minutes.

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,780
20 minutes is a huge card.

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,600
- A vlog really doesn't be twenty minutes.
 - No.

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,240
- What do you think, is a 20 minutes vlog long or not?
 - Comment below.

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,200
Now we jump 3 months ahead to the first time we went to Malaysia.

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,600
Welcome to Malaysia.

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,680
Oh, the water.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,420
(Can you spit there on the glass?)

41
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,840
(- A turtle, in the water.) (- Oh, it's huge, Alma! It's as big as you.)

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,680
(Almost, or as Harry.)

43
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,460
(There it is!)

44
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,520
(- Do you see, Harry?) (- Yes. It's huge!)

45
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,860
(Put on the swimming goggles, Alma.)

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,340
- Ajajaj, it bit you.
 - Yes, the bet.

47
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,600
(It thought you were an octopus.)

48
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,840
- How cool?
 - Yes, that was tough.

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,700
That you continued to swim around even though you just got bitten by a turtle.

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,820
Yes, what can one say?
 It was fun.

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,960
Alma was thus four years on this trip, you would be five.
 Harry was two and a half.

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:56,200
- Now we are going to jump to the country place, where we are now.
 - Yes, our first summer on Youtube.

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,840
(Here's our pool, with a lot of scrap in.)

54
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,160
- Our pool!
 - Where is the water?

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,080
Alma, your style!

56
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,540
- Check out my glasses, they are round.
 - Yes.

57
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,840
(- Listen, what kind of sunglasses are you wearing?) (- They're no sunglasses.)

58
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,180
(- What is it, then?) (- only glasses.)

59
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,940
(Yeah.)

60
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,080
(Hello!)

61
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,940
Can we only take ten seconds and ponder what it looks like inside the house.

62
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,640
- Yes.
 - Oh my God!

63
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:43,500
- New fridge and freezer, other table, other sofa.
 - But it's not even a wall, everything is different.

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,440
The windows, yes!
 There were windows here.

65
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:54,340
We have been renovating this place for a long time and sometimes you feel that nothing is happening, so this is very good to see.

66
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,380
- Was this a year ago?
 No, two years ago.
 - Two years ago.

67
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,500
(This is living room/kitchen.)

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,200
(Last spring we had no kitchen at all, now it's half finished just like a lot of other things.)

69
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,580
( - Then we have our little Master Bedroom.) - This is your bedroom today.

70
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,260
So, that was so crowded.
 It was so hard to go to bed and sleep in that.

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:24,020
- Check out here, we have a wooden board for the window.
 - We had a long time.

72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,080
(Harry is our biggest fan. He is looking at our own clips in bed.)

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,920
Aah!

74
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,360
- What did I look at?
 - You looked at yourself!

75
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:45,040
(He got so tired so he wanted to lie down in bed and look at something. It's totally sick that he looks at us.)

76
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,700
(Yes, it's a bit of fun.)

77
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,020
(He has as a thing that he always pills himself in his hair when he gets tired.)

78
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,060
(It's very good, you know when Harry is tired, because he always starts to peel in his hair.)

79
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,200
- Is that our lawn?
 - Yes!

80
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,620
Oh help, oh help.

81
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,840
It is so terrible.
 That we could live here!

82
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,160
It was a nightmare, that is.

83
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,600
- Yes.
 But it's pretty good peep.
 - Yes.

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,100
- Because it's pretty nice here now.
 - Yes.

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,900
Now we arrive at the first trip to Kolmården.

86
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,820
(- Didn't you dare to cuddle with the wolf?) (- No-ä, I want to cuddle with you!)

87
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,440
(Yes ... I love to cuddle with you.)

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,520
(- I want to cuddle with him.) (- Do you want it now?)

89
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,360
(- Yes-a.) (- Do it, then. He stands there because he wants to hug you.)

90
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,220
(He was very nice!)

91
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,340
(What good that you dared.)

92
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,400
- Oh, Harry.
 - "Cuddly".
 (LESSPAR)

93
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,000
"He was very nice!".
 (LESSPAR)

94
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,880
Oh yeah!

95
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,580
- Little Mini-Harry.
 - Little brother, our little brother.

96
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
So cute!

97
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,100
We ended that day at the dolphin show.

98
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,660
(God ... The dolphin show is clear and we are very powerful.)

99
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,240
- Do you remember?
 - Yes.

100
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,840
I also remember very well how it took in the heart.

101
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,040
At this time we had had Youtube channel for about six months.

102
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,020
Not many people were watching the channel at all.

103
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,580
And then we posted this video, and flips a lot of viewers to our channel.

104
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,260
It stirred up emotions, this video.

105
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,040
You could say it was the first video where viewers started to find us.

106
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,840
Yes.

107
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,720
Now let's look at our most viewed video.

108
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,180
And then mom is a little more like herself.

109
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,060
It's called "Hospital Vlog".
 Alma would remove the tonsils.

110
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,900
(Will they cut into my tongue?)

111
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,020
(No, that's what they should not do. They have a tool that holds the tongue.)

112
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,920
(The knife cuts and then they burn the wound surface as well, so it doesn't bleed.)

113
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,760
(What will I dream about? I want to dream that I go skateboard every day.)

114
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:39,380
(We must not film. See you after the operation.)

115
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,340
(VINKI-VINK.)

116
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,260
Gull kid!

117
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,860
And I was sooo nervous.

118
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,000
- Look, you look like you've seen a ghost.
 - mm.

119
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,840
(- You look like you've seen a ghost.) (- Yes but I'm really rally.)

120
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,180
- Nämen ... I can't remember.
 - Neither do I.

121
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,700
(- She is on the operating table now.) (- Okay.)

122
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,020
(- There are four pieces in the room.) (- Okay.)

123
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,900
(Two anesthetists, a nurse and an ear-nose-throat doctor operating.)

124
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,980
I remember this as yesterday, I get teary eyed again.

125
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,800
I thought it was so nervous that you would be anesthetized.
 It was terrible!

126
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,700
And I don't like this vlog because I think I'm so weird, right through.

127
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,980
From the first box it feels like I'm playing theater, but it's just because I'm so worried.

128
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,480
I even have a strange voice.

129
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,780
I've got it!

130
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,240
I haven't thought about that.
 I have to look at it and ...

131
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,500
- But then, it was so nice that everything went well!
 - Yes indeed.

132
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,620
- This was so happy!
 - And what much better you slept after the operation.

133
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,500
It was completely silent in your room.
 Before that, she snored and had a breath break when she slept.

134
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,140
Very high, Harry couldn't even sleep.

135
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,180
- We go ahead and look at our very first challenge.
 - Yes.

136
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,680
(Here's next.)

137
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,220
(Not look, not look.)

138
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,740
- Oh, what a little cheat, he tries to watch.
 - Yes, he has always been a little cheat.

139
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,620
He is afraid.

140
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,760
It was a little big box.

141
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,620
(- Oh, was it difficult?) (- But Harry, no! You cheat, you should guess what it is).

142
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,460
(What is that? You must not look!)

143
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,400
(- Listen ... Do you now see what it is?) (- What is it?)

144
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,260
(It's a little monster!)

145
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,460
A little monster ...

146
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,280
Oh yeah ...

147
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,920
- Stop, that was not nice.
 - No, this was awkward.

148
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,980
- I also feel it was a bit awkward.
 Sorry, Alma.
 - Harry got a stuffed animal.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,880
Now look how you react.

150
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,700
- You really feel ... - I would look what it was.

151
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,960
- "What is that?"
 (- AJ!)

152
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,420
(- No, I'll give up.) (- Do you give up? Try, think a little, what could it be?)

153
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,460
(Ew ...)

154
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,160
(No, I give up.)

155
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,920
(A crayfish.) (*Alma screams*)

156
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,260
- Oh, Alma!
 - You were not nice.

157
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:41,800
- You were really terrified of that stupid cancer.
 - Sorry!
 We really owe you an apology.

158
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,180
- Yes, sorry for that.
 We really exposed you to a test.
 - Alma, I can give a crown to you.

159
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,960
- Are you going to give a crown to her?
 - mm.

160
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,060
- It was nice, Harry.
 - Yes.

161
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,420
Now we will jump to when we had had the channel for a year.

162
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,280
We went on a skiing holiday, and we had 20 thousand subscribers.

163
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,360
- It was so fun there!
 I want to go there again.
 - Me too.
 It is thus the Swedish mountains.

164
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,580
- Me too.
 - I Love ... I Love Snow.
 (I love snow)

165
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,460
You had never skied before we went up, and you learned very fast.

166
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,580
(- Has it been good today, Alma?) (- Yes.)

167
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,720
(- What do you want to do now?) (- Go into the heating cabin.)

168
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,980
(Okay.)

169
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,960
(Now it's time for lunch.)

170
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,980
(Mom's vegan drums.)

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,640
GOD GOD.
 It is the worst fire with a grid over.
 What do I do for something?

172
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,380
- Sune's dad!
 - Worst Rudolf.

173
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:50,320
- Nämen God, the sausages will turn into coal at any time.
 - I know, I got a really burnt.

174
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,280
- Nämen God!
 - That was mine!

175
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,120
Note that Axel said "Perfect!".

176
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,380
( - This is a burnt sausage without leather.) - And I got it, seriously.

177
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,600
(- Do you want it, Alma?) (- Never.)

178
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,660
I remember I had to scale the sausage.

179
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,600
(- What? It's really good.) (- I don't want a sn ** P anyway.)

180
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,540
(Nämen stop.)

181
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,120
- Check out what good you were!
 - Yes, wow!

182
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,240
- We used to go like that?
 - Yes.

183
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,940
- I went under those rings.
 - Yes.

184
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,200
Woho!

185
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,080
Now that we have laughed at Dad Axel, I thought you could laugh at me.

186
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,580
Because ... before we started Youtube - long before - I worked with TV.

187
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,340
And I've found an old clip on me.

188
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,780
- huh?!
 - Yes!

189
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:00,900
This is from the program "Wanted" in 2006. How many years ago is it?

190
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,600
- What will it be ... 13 years ago.
 - Yes.

191
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,940
Excuse the quality and how compressed the picture was, but then it was at that time.

192
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,120
Mom Joanna is in London anyway and reports on Jack the Ripper.

193
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,020
(The mystery surrounding Jack The Ripper has been raising people for over a century.)

194
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,080
(He murdered and cut up at least five women in London's East End.)

195
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,720
(Axel) Nämen God.

196
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,380
(... and even today no one can say for sure who Jack the Ripper really was.)

197
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,520
Nämen look, there goes mom!

198
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,140
It was a huge card, but I wanted to bid on it.
 Imagine what you can find in Youtube's treasure chamber!

199
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,240
- Yes, that was super fun.
 - Did you see Jack the Ripper?

200
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,460
No, I didn't see Jack the Ripper for Jack The Ripper died many hundreds of years ago.

201
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,280
- And he's deadly.
 - He was.

202
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:04,380
So here it is, we have hundreds of videos on our channel, we could react more - if you think it's fun!

203
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,280
Yes.

204
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:12,160
- Now it is important that you tell us what you thought.
 - Wait, I know!
 We can react to all our slime videos.

205
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,960
- No rather not.
 - I've started to follow people who make slime.

206
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,280
Yes, but you can do slim videos on your own channel.

207
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,380
- Yes.
 - Right?

208
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,220
Thanks for watching this video!

209
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,820
Comment, subscribe, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

210
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Bye!
