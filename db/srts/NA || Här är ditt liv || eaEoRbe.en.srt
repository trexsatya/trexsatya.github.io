1
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.040
- When will the party then, Lina?
 -Tomorrow night.
 Everyone should sleep over.

2
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.520
Sleep over?
 It's only 50 meters there.

3
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.000
You know how it is at those parties.

4
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.600
-No.
 What about those parties?
 - Yes, what about those parties?

5
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.600
- We talk, have fun ... you know.
 - No, I don't actually.

6
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.920
- You never tell.
 - Then I would never go!

7
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.720
- We have never forbidden you to go.
 -Yes!

8
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.520
You were eight years old and wanted to go to Bajsk beer party!

9
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.320
The upbringing is difficult.

10
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.480
We're talking about getting kids, but ... is it worth the trouble?

11
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080
No.

12
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.680
I'm kidding.
 You do not get the community you have with your children otherwise.

13
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.600
If you don't get a dog ... you get to sleep over if everyone else gets.

14
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.480
Good, then I don't have to ask Dad, huh?
 He never lets me go!

15
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.640
Now he just thinks about that match.

16
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.000
- This morning he trained towards my door!
 - Go up and tell him then!

17
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.800
No idea.
 I just have to stand in goal ...

18
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.600
- What is it for the match you are talking about?
 - Gustav's boys team has some anniversary.

19
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.800
C. Head talkum feels pretty good.
 Two quick C. Head talk drawings, past the defense ... goals!

20
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.640
- Tough resistance.
 Most of the green ... C. Head talk - it's important with preparation.

21
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.640
Where have you made of all the food?

22
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.840
C. Head talk - no danger, I ate up.
 - What are you celebrating?

23
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.440
C. Head talkative for exactly 25 years ago we played final C. Head talk to Backlura.
 Ha, what a match!

24
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.040
- It stood 2–2 at full time.
 - Gustav decided everything.

25
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:37.000
- He shot five meters outside the goal ... - How did you track all friends?

26
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.600
C. Head talk - is important you are happy to lie in!
 - All lives here in Vivalla.

27
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.880
The C. Head Tapers there is not really true.
 C. Head Precate Jalle went directly into the world.

28
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.000
C. HOVE PATERENW York, Tokyo, Paris ... C. HOVE PREPRAKERHAN KNOW how life should be lived.

29
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.400
- So he won't come ... C. Head talk - he has his life, a lot to do!

30
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.160
- Dad, I have to ask ... C. Head Tapers - Sen.
 I have to go out on my round.

31
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.720
What he is ambitious!
 Which round does he take?
 The light track?

32
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.720
He takes a lap around the square by car.
 He says it fans so nice.

33
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.720
He doesn't listen to me!

34
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.720
You know it's something he always listens to.

35
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.720
Fuss.

36
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.600
Have you never thought about becoming a professional?

37
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.520
C. Head talk, but I don't regret C. Head talk I chose the family.

38
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.520
-You're lying!
 C. Head talk - yes.
 I can't cope.

39
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.320
Should I set up the cones right away?

40
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.320
C. Head talk - no, I need some proteins.
 - I thought you would lose weight!

41
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:27.000
C. Head talk - I do.
 I only eat the cream.
 - Dad, I think you make the victory goal.

42
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.000
- Have you had something broken again?
 -No.
 We rarely praise dad.

43
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.400
C. Head talkative self goes and run push ups.

44
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.000
- Line, what are you doing?
 - I want to go to that party.

45
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.960
- Yeah ... it's just going?
 -No.
 I have to get to sleep over too.

46
00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.080
- Dad will say no.
 - It's just going in and saying it!

47
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.400
- He actually understands more than we think.
 - You are right, max.
 Thanks.

48
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.600
Idiot!

49
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.600
C. Head Tapers ... Twenty, twenty ...

50
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.760
C. Head Treaty ... Twenty -two, twenty -three, twenty -four ...

51
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.000
-Dad!
 C. Head talk --... Twenty -seven ... - Hello, old man!

52
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.800
- You have said that we should be honest.
 C. Head talk - beautifully.
 Did I say that?

53
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.680
On Saturday, Ulrika will have a small party.

54
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.880
C. Head talketetack, old man, C. Head talkature I have this match.

55
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:57.440
Listen!
 Everyone else should sleep over.
 I would also like to do it.

56
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:06.560
You know everyone!
 It's Jeanette, Sofie, Tobias, Marcus ... the usual ones.

57
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.080
C. Head talk - and Petter?
 - Why are you afraid of Petter?

58
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.440
C. Head talk at the back with you at Bion C. Head talk - I just don't like that!

59
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.640
How do you know we have been to the cinema?
 Do you spy on me?

60
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.400
C. Head talk - "Spy" has such a boring sound ... - Can I go or not?

61
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.400
C. Head talk - What does mom say?
 - It's okay if you like it.

62
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.800
C. Head Tapers Can I decide?
 C. Head talk, fuck ...

63
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.680
C. Head Tapers I decide ...

64
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.760
C. Head Tapers ... that you get to sleep over.

65
00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:00.480
C. Head talkative self is sometimes overprotective.
 If C. Head talkative self is to have fun, you should too!

Just you and me.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:17.560
- Feel free to take Jalle over on a drink.
 - First, he should see 1,100 slides ...

150
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.960
Yes, you want to show how nice you had it these years.

151
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.720
It is mostly short at Gustav at work.

152
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:37.920
C. Head talk, Jalle and I C. C. Head Torget Torget cruised.
 We planned the future.

153
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:44.000
C. Head talkative ideas!
 If we held together, C. Head talk we have gone as far as possible.

154
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:51.680
- He does not seem to be handicapped alone ... - and now you will get together again.

155
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.200
C. Head talkative an idea ... nothing strange.

156
00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:03.800
-What then?
 Europe's largest grocery store!
 - What is Göran talking about?

157
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:12.200
C. Head talk I got an idea Jalle hung on.
 C. Head talkative I thought we could do something new.

158
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:20.040
- As Europe's largest grocery store?!
 C. Head talk - do not hang up on the wording.

159
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:26.840
C. Head talkative - now it is a place to knit.

 Feel free to come over.

160
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.040
C. Head talkator will be coming in a couple of hours.

161
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:38.400
C. Head Tapers Bli not sorry if there is no C. Head talk department store.
 One must be realistic.

162
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:44.200
C. Head talk may want us to do something in the United States C. Head talk.

163
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.040
Is Petter there?
 Who is he dancing with?!

164
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.840
Ingela?!

165
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.840
Try to lock her in or something.
 On toa or something ...

166
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.640
I hurry as much as possible.

167
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:15.280
- Where is the maximum somewhere?
 - I thought he was in the kitchen with you.

168
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:21.080
Max!
 Come up from the basement.
 They are coming soon.

169
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:33.720
I don't want these clothes!
 It's Dad who has fixed them ...

170
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.320
- You don't look wise!
 -You look great.

171
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:46.320
You look like a successful dwarf.
 - Lina, put out the napkins.

172
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.240
I have to help Max with the fly.

173
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:57.240
- Hi, has he come yet?
 - Don't you read poetry?

174
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:04.640
No, I got so curious about Jalle.
 Does he have his own jet?

175
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.920
- Have you talked to Gustav?
 - No - Göran.

176
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:17.440
- That Gustav is best ice cream with one!
 - Yes, it is undeniably a mystery.

177
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:25.680
- You would leave them in peace!
 -I will.
 Did you bring the camcorder?

178
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.560
- No, really not!
 - Then I have to take this one.

179
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:37.360
- Now they come.
 - See how he looks - then you have to go.

180
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.560
Lina, pick up the standard.
 - Max, stand here!

181
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.560
And the text ... the melody is "SJ, SJ, old friend".

182
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.800
C.Sangjalle, Jalle, old friend C.Sang thinking that you are here again!

183
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.760
C.Sangåren goes, but you consist, c.Sangvår's very best friend

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.120
C. Head Taper Eat It!

188
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.400
Should we take the song again?

189
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:53.320
- But Gustav ... - are you very sad, dad?

190
00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:01.280
C. Head Tapers, Why?
 Everything I thought meant C. Head Taper when I was young was just air.

191
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:10.400
C. Head talkative self did not recognize him.
 When I was a beer in a beer, he refused.

192
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:17.360
C. Head talk - It wasn't good for the figure ... - It's true maybe ...

193
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.600
C. Head talkator was not interested in C. Head talk.

194
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:29.400
-That's weird!
 - What did he say when he saw the Amazon?

195
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:37.960
C. Head talk - he didn't see it.
 He has a driver.
 - This car is as nice as yours.

196
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:44.760
- What happened to it really?
 Unfortunately, C. Head talk - it disappeared.

197
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:51.520
- It went through the ice.
 C. Head talk - we were delayed and took a new road.

198
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.120
Dad tried to embrace over Vättern.

199
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:05.120
C. Head talk - What are you doing here?
 You miss the party.

203
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.640
C. Head talk is the only thing I'm good at.

204
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.640

 C. Head talk - As what then?

205
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.800
You can all Östergötland's postal code by the way.

206
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.960
I forgot to ask how it went.

207
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.560
C. HOVA PATERVI WON.
 3–2.
 I made the victory.
