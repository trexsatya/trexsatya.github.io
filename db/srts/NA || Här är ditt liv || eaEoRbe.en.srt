1
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.040
- When will the party then, Lina?
 -Tomorrow night.
 Everyone should sleep over.

2
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.520
Sleep over?
 It's only 50 meters there.

3
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.000
You know how it is at those parties.

4
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.600
-No.
 What about those parties?
 - Yes, what about those parties?

5
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.600
- We talk, have fun ... you know.
 - No, I don't actually.

6
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.920
- You never tell.
 - Then I would never go!

7
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.720
- We have never forbidden you to go.
 -Yes!

8
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.520
You were eight years old and wanted to go to Bajsk beer party!

9
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.320
The upbringing is difficult.

10
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.480
We're talking about getting kids, but ... is it worth the trouble?

11
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080
No.

12
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.680
I'm kidding.
 You do not get the community you have with your children otherwise.

13
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.600
If you don't get a dog ... you get to sleep over if everyone else gets.

14
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.480
Good, then I don't have to ask Dad, huh?
 He never lets me go!

15
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.640
Now he just thinks about that match.

16
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.000
- This morning he trained towards my door!
 - Go up and tell him then!

17
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.800
No idea.
 I just have to stand in goal ...

18
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.600
- What is it for the match you are talking about?
 - Gustav's boys team has some anniversary.

19
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.800
It feels pretty good.
 Two quick draws, past the defense ... goals!

20
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.640
- Tough resistance.
 Most the green ... - it's important with preparation.

21
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.640
Where have you made of all the food?

22
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.840
- No danger, I ate it up.
 - What are you celebrating?

23
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.440
Exactly 25 years ago we played final against Backlura.
 Ha, what a match!

24
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.040
- It stood 2–2 at full time.
 - Gustav decided everything.

25
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:37.000
- He shot five meters outside the goal ... - How did you track all friends?

26
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.600
- If it is important, you are happy to lie in!
 - All lives here in Vivalla.

27
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.880
That is not really true.
 Jalle went directly into the world.

28
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.000
New York, Tokyo, Paris ... He knows how to live life.

29
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:06.400
- So he won't either ... - He has his life, much to do!

30
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.160
- Dad, I have to ask ... —s.
 I have to go out on my round.

31
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.720
What he is ambitious!
 Which round does he take?
 The light track?

32
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.720
He takes a lap around the square by car.
 He says it fans so nice.

33
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.720
He doesn't listen to me!

34
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.720
You know it's something he always listens to.

35
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.720
Fuss.

36
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.600
Have you never thought about becoming a professional?

37
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.520
Yes, but I do not regret that I chose the family.

38
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.520
-You're lying!
 -Yes.
 I can't cope.

39
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.320
Should I set up the cones right away?

40
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.320
- No, I need some proteins.
 - I thought you would lose weight!

41
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:27.000
-I do.
 I only eat the cream.
 - Dad, I think you make the victory goal.

42
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.000
- Have you had something broken again?
 -No.
 We rarely praise dad.

43
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.400
I go and run push ups.

44
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.000
- Line, what are you doing?
 - I want to go to that party.

45
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.960
- Yeah ... it's just going?
 -No.
 I have to get to sleep over too.

46
00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.080
- Dad will say no.
 - It's just going in and saying it!

47
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:08.400
- He actually understands more than we think.
 - You are right, max.
 Thanks.

48
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.600
Idiot!

49
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.600
... twenty, twenty ...

50
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.760
... twenty -two, twenty -three, twenty -four ...

51
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.000
-Dad!
 -... twenty -seven ... - Hello, old man!

52
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.800
- You have said that we should be honest.
 - Awesome.
 Did I say that?

53
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.680
On Saturday, Ulrika will have a small party.

54
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.880
Thanks, old man, but I have this match.

55
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:57.440
Listen!
 Everyone else should sleep over.
 I would also like to do it.

56
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:06.560
You know everyone!
 It's Jeanette, Sofie, Tobias, Marcus ... the usual ones.

57
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.080
–And Petter?
 - Why are you afraid of Petter?

58
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.440
Sit at the back with you at the cinema - I just don't like that!

59
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.640
How do you know we have been to the cinema?
 Do you spy on me?

60
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:32.400
- "Spying" has such a boring sound ... - Can I go or not?

61
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.400
- What does mom say?
 - It's okay if you like it.

62
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.800
May I decide?
 Oh, damn ...

63
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.680
Then I decide ...

64
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.760
... that you get to sleep over.

65
00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:00.480
I am overprotective sometimes.
 If I'm going to have fun, you will too!

66
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.440
Svensson.
 Gustav Svensson.
 Postman, yes.

67
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.480
Jarl?

68
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.200
Jalle?!
 Is it you, Jalle?
 Where are you?

69
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:24.960
On an airplane?
 Do you come here for the match?
 - He comes to the match!

70
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.560
Good hotel?
 Never come to question!
 Silent!
 You will sleep here with us!

71
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:41.760
You get to meet my family.
 No, they have nothing else for themselves.

72
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.560
-What then?
 - My daughter jumps with joy.

73
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:56.400
Sure, Jalle.
 See you there, yes.
 For phase, Jalle.
 Hello then, Jalle.

74
00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.840
- Jalle, Jalle ... it was Jalle.
 - Yeah, it was Jalle ...

75
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.240
He is coming here.
 You get to meet your dad's best friend.

76
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.240
- But the party then?
 - Party it will be!

77
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.840
When Jalle starts - oh, oh, oh ...

78
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.200
Hello.
 Gustav, you have a match tomorrow.
 I was going to go out with Annika.

79
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.600
Will you or I tell you?

80
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.600
You!

81
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.400
Guess who sleeps on the couch tomorrow.

82
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.120
- You, if you arrive late home.
 -No.
 Jalle!
 Jalle Norén.

83
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:56.520
My BFF!
 He is on his way here.
 He called from his private aircraft.

84
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:03.120
-Perfect.
 Then I go out with Annika.
 -You do not understand...

85
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:10.320
Jalle should only stay for a day and must feel welcome.

86
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:18.120
- You think I should fit up with you.
 -No.
 He should meet my family.

87
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:26.120
- But you have time with the other, so ... - gustav, it's Annika's poetry evening.

88
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.720
- You don't like poetry?
 - I'll do that!

89
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:39.680
Understand me ... I want to show you!
 You are the finest I have.

90
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.240
So you said when you wanted me to repaint the boat too.

91
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:53.840
- Remember how nice it was!
 - I have friends I want to meet.

92
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.680
- Jalle is my best friend!
 - You haven't talked about 25 years.

93
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.080
This is what girls never understand!

94
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.400
We do not need to meet.
 Jalle and I have each other here.

95
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.400
- Heart sits on the other side ... —oroa not!

96
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:23.640
- I fix what needs to be prepared.
 - I haven't said yes.

97
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.040
You didn't do that when I freed either.

98
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.560
-What's that?
 -My Life.

99
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:42.120
Don't read anything more fun?

100
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:49.760
Here I have collected the best memories.
 What summer we had, Jalle and I!

101
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.760
Here we have just climbed into the neighbor's oak.

102
00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:01.960
- What madman.
 Hanging in one hand!
 - Where are you?

103
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.360
I had just lost.

104
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:13.960
It was the first summer we met - then we hung together every day.

105
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.680
Here Jalle turns fifteen years old.
 I was there evenly.

106
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:29.280
- There, down in the right corner, I stand.
 - Jalle was the girls' favorite?

107
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:36.880
I was not far behind!
 When the picture was taken we would meet some girls.

108
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:44.840
- Was that why you looked so happy?
 - No, I had just eaten.

109
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:54.680
Here's the pictures' picture!
 So we looked just before kick off at Backlura.

110
00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:02.000
–25 years ago ... then you were on top!
 - What you look young, and slim!

111
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:09.520
-It's not me.
 I'm sitting there.
 - Sensors that I didn't see the match.

112
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:16.240
- But you came on the banquet.
 - You offered beer in the dressing room!

113
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.120
Here!
 Look!
 Do you remember?

114
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:29.120
- My old Amazon, 57th.
 - Of course, I remember.

115
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:36.120
It was the nicest thing I knew when we went to Björkudden.

116
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.680
Just you and me.
 What memories ...

117
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.280
Yes, such cars are no longer made.

118
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:53.880
You look at pictures, and then the feelings and the mood come back.

119
00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:01.000
Okay.
 I ignore Annika's poetry evening.

120
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.800
Do you mean it?!
 What would I do without you?

121
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.320
Here.
 A list of everything that needs to be fixed.

122
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.960
I will help you if Lina is allowed to go to her party.

123
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.760
- Maybe she meets Jalle for a while.
 - You don't follow?

124
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.560
- Gustav ... - I promise.

125
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:39.760
19.00: Jalle's arrival.
 National anthem, followed by short welcome fireworks.

126
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:47.680
- Card Welcome Fireworks?
 - We save the big for the dessert.

127
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.760
Yes Yes...

128
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.720
I promise, I follow another time.

129
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:06.920
Your poems are very nice.
 The one about the tortoise and the tissue too!

130
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.720
Greeting Göran, and good luck!
 Hello.

131
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:17.520
- Hi, has Dad talked to you?
 - Yes, this morning.

132
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:24.920
I will serve from the right and not in a hurry when I show slides ...

133
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:31.000
I have to go when I'm done.
 Well, I will be half past two ...

134
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:38.640
I make sure you get away.
 It is a dinner in all simplicity.

135
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:46.840
Where should it stand - the friendship standard?
 We'll keep it up when they arrive.

136
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.400
Nämen ... does he have no sense of proportions?

137
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:58.200
Wait until you hear the welcome speech!
 - Are you ready?

138
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.600
FANFARE

139
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.280
The gods of the Olympics may be faded when Jalle ...

140
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.880
Turn off!
 Now you forget what Dad has said.

141
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:20.400
I'm going to make a nice dinner.
 Just be kind and pretty dressed.

142
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:30.320
-How is it going?
 Is everything ready?
 - You would help with the pictures.

143
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:37.680
- I and Göran have arranged one thing.
 - Pentecress Opera?
 Dancing bears?

144
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.680
Look out through the window.

145
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.800
Nämen look, an Amazon!

146
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:56.400
Yes!
 EN 57th.
 All original.
 Jalle will not believe his eyes.

147
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:04.200
- A friend of mine owns it.
 - I will take care of it as my child!

148
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.200
Göran, take the car and stick!

149
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:17.560
- Feel free to take Jalle over on a drink.
 - First, he should see 1,100 slides ...

150
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:23.960
Yes, you want to show how nice you had it these years.

151
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.720
It is mostly short at Gustav at work.

152
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:37.920
In such a thing where Jalle and I cruise around the square.
 We planned the future.

153
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:44.000
What ideas!
 If we held together, we would have gone as far as possible.

154
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:51.680
- He does not seem to be handicapped alone ... - and now you will get together again.

155
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.200
Just an idea ... Nothing strange.

156
00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:03.800
-What then?
 Europe's largest grocery store!
 - What is Göran talking about?

157
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:12.200
When I got an idea, Jalle hung on.
 I thought we could do something new.

158
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:20.040
- As Europe's largest grocery store?!
 - Don't hang up on the wording.

159
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:26.840
- Now it is a place to knit.
 - I have to go too.
 Feel free to come over.

160
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.040
We will be in a couple of hours.

161
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:38.400
Don't be sorry if there is no department store.
 One must be realistic.

162
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:44.200
He may want us to do something in the US instead.

163
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.040
Is Petter there?
 Who is he dancing with?!

164
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.840
Ingela?!
 !

165
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.840
Try to lock her in or something.
 On toa or something ...

166
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.640
I hurry as much as possible.

167
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:15.280
- Where is the maximum somewhere?
 - I thought he was in the kitchen with you.

168
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:21.080
Max!
 Come up from the basement.
 They are coming soon.

169
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:33.720
I don't want these clothes!
 It's Dad who has fixed them ...

170
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.320
- You don't look wise!
 -You look great.

171
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:46.320
You look like a successful dwarf.
 - Lina, put out the napkins.

172
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.240
I have to help Max with the fly.

173
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:57.240
- Hi, has he come yet?
 - Don't you read poetry?

174
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:04.640
No, I got so curious about Jalle.
 Does he have his own jet?

175
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.920
- Have you talked to Gustav?
 - No - Göran.

176
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:17.440
- That Gustav is best ice cream with one!
 - Yes, it is undeniably a mystery.

177
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:25.680
- You would leave them in peace!
 -I will.
 Did you bring the camcorder?

178
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.560
- No, really not!
 - Then I have to take this one.

179
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:37.360
- Now they come.
 - See how he looks - then you have to go.

180
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.560
Lina, pick up the standard.
 - Max, stand here!

181
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:48.560
And the text ... the melody is "SJ, SJ, old friend".

182
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.800
Jalle, Jalle, old friend think you're here again!

183
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.760
The years go by, but you consist, our very best friend

184
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.560
-HURRAY!
 -Look here!

185
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:17.360
- But where is Jalle?
 - On the way to London.

186
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:23.320
- He had some important meeting.
 - But dinner then?

187
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.120
Eat it up!

188
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.400
Should we take the song again?

189
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:53.320
- But Gustav ... - are you very sad, dad?

190
00:21:53.480 --> 00:22:01.280
No why?
 Everything I thought meant something when I was young was just air.

191
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:10.400
I didn't recognize him.
 When I offered a beer he declined no.

192
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:17.360
- It wasn't good for the figure ... - it's true maybe ...

193
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.600
He was also not interested in me.

194
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:29.400
-That's weird!
 - What did he say when he saw the Amazon?

195
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:37.960
- He didn't see it.
 He has a driver.
 - This car is as nice as yours.

196
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:44.760
- What happened to it really?
 - Unfortunately, it disappeared.

197
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:51.520
- It went through the ice.
 - We were delayed and took a new road.

198
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.120
Dad tried to embrace over Vättern.

199
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:05.120
-What are you doing here?
 You miss the party.
 - I can be here with you instead.

200
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.040
Don't feel you must.

201
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.040
-Good!
 - Max, where are you going?

202
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:21.120
Save the cake from Göran and Annika.
 - I put a little under your bed.

203
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.640
Eating is the only thing I'm good at.

204
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.640
- No, you know many things.
 -Like what?

205
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.800
You can all Östergötland's postal code by the way.

206
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.960
I forgot to ask how it went.

207
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.560
We won.
 3–2.
 I made the victory.

208
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:56.520
- Then you must have become a match hero!
 - They carried me on the shoulders around the square.

209
00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.240
- Did they orde it?
 -Yes almost.

210
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.760
They dropped me outside Consum.

211
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:13.560
Gustav, can you get to Björkudden now in the winter?

212
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:23.640
You and I can have an anniversary.
 You and I and an Amazon from –57.

213
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.800
Should we check out our old place, at the dock?

214
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:36.600
Lena, I like you.
 Hold the hat, Mrs. Svensson!

215
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.080
Hello, Lena ... - Gustav ...

216
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:49.920
I have something that can cheer you up.
 A poem that I would have read ...

217
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.520
Start!
 Start!

218
00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:00.000
The sun is rising - the morning red sea is resting, silver scrup ...

219
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.880
Start, your bang!

220
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.680
