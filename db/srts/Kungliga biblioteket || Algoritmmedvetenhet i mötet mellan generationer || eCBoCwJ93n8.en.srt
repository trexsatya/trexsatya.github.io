00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:14,311
Hi, my name is Lisa Olsson Dahlquist

2
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:17,154
and working as a teacher and researcher

3
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:22,902
In the Department of AVM and Digital Cultures at Lund University

4
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:26,160
at the Department of Cultural Sciences.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:36,000
This recording is part of the research square's digital program at the Book Fair this year.

6
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:42,192
What I will present today is a research project that I have done

7
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,169
together with my colleague Ola Sundin

8
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,600
On behalf of digitally first with the user in focus

9
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,232
which focuses on algorithm consciousness in the meeting between generations.

10
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:09.624
Although algorithms today are a very central part of our increasingly connected everyday life

11
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:17,661
so we still know relatively little about people's experiences, attitudes and conscious actions

12
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,585
in relation to algorithms

13
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:24,736
and how algorithms affect our digital information flows

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,576
The purpose of this project is to develop

15
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:33,188
an in -depth knowledge of what algorithm consciousness can mean

16
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:34,976
In the meeting between children and adults

17
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,084
In order to better understand people digital action and thereby create the conditions for

18
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,726
Librarians' digital skills development

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46.708
within the MIK area

20
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,033
ie the field of media and information skills

21
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
This means that

22
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55.968
This is research project

23
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:04,187
which can be put into a larger context of the research that has been conducted by our research group in Lund for many years

24
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07.744
that has a focus on just source and search criticism

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,560
and search in a digital everyday life

26
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12.096
Algorithms

27
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,697
and media and information skills in relation to

28
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:17,216
public libraries in different ways

29
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:24,763
At the end of this presentation I will also give you a list

30
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:32,086
over publications if one is interested in taking part in other research that we have also conducted

31
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,044
But this particular project is based on

32
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:41,280
What algorithm consciousness can mean from a user perspective

33
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:50,519
When we talk about it, we see it as an important part of media and information expertise today.

34
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
Because we have been interested in that

35
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,224
investigate how children and adults together reason and reflect

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04.247
About their digital everyday life we have done family interviews.

37
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07.422
We have done 14 family interviews

38
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:11,232
With a total of 40 participants in the families' homes.

39
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,888
Long conversations that have been about their digital everyday life

40
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:24,800
In the conversations, we have focused on questions such as how the participants experience

41
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,640
that algorithms affect internet use

42
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
What does source criticism mean

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35.808
For different generation, young and older

44
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,464
How to perceive one's information flows in social media

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,400
And how to look at the library in relation to media and information expertise

46
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:56,378
Among other things, we have assumed these issues in the talks.

47
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
A shorter summary of the results of the study

48
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:12,000
The results are presented in relation to the themes that appear in our report

49
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:23,679
It is clear in the study that Internet use characterizes both the children and the adults

50
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
everyday in a variety of ways

51
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27.519
from morning to night

52
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,615
Computers and mobile phones are used for work

53
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,479
school, relaxation, news on different occasions during the day

54
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:44,415
As for the time that Internet use uses

55
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
In the study reflecting on in

56
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
significantly higher

57
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51.071
than the younger participants do.

58
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,842
For several of the adults this is

59
00:04:54,842 --> 00:05:00.287
Something they mean takes too much time

60
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,310
They would like to reduce their internet use and then in particular

61
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09.759
when it comes to social media services like Facebook.

62
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:17,147
You also describe how, for example, the news reading on the Internet takes more time to

63
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,743
than one had thought from the beginning because one becomes

64
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,327
Recommended for new articles

65
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,572
continuously

66
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:30,495
and it can be hard to stop

67
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:37,274
Here appears that the algorithms and the various recommendation systems can contribute to

68
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:39.967
To create a sense of freedom.

69
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
They keep users

70
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
in the various services.

71
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52.026
When it comes to algorithms, many of the participants are

72
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:55,327
feel that they have hardly knowledge of what algorithms are

73
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01.215
But in the conversations, it turned out that you have knowledge of what algorithms do

74
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04.031
their consequences

75
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
It is about understanding how

76
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09.407
one's own internet behavior

77
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
affects what information and which ads

78
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
that becomes visible in one's flows

79
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,602
Here also a more critical and questioning view of

80
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:24,255
Internet's commercial business model

81
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,520
Among the adults than among the children.

82
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,823
This more critical view of the

83
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:36,543
adults are also reflected in the conversations in terms of questions about

84
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39.615
integrity and monitoring online.

85
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:44,680
The adults in the study seems more reluctantly accepting

86
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
a lost privacy

87
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
While several of the younger ones are more benevolent to, for example, targeted advertising

88
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
It emerges

89
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03.935
Still, there is a lot of uncertainty about how data tracks are stored

90
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05.727
and handled

91
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09.055
and that the services and technical infrastructure

92
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,103
lack of transparency

93
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
leads to a lot of speculation and guesses

94
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
And when it comes to the particular infrastructure, questions about how the Internet is controlled and controlled

95
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,439
Why certain information becomes visible and not another

96
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,863
So it appears that nothing has been discussed to a particularly high extent in the family.

97
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,343
It also becomes clear that it can be very difficult to put words on

98
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:44,639
And imagine the Internet's invisible information infrastructure and structure.

99
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:52,319
In many participants in the study, an interest in the questions is aroused

100
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
During the course of the conversation

101
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59.009
More and easily accessible knowledge is asked for the subject.

102
00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:04.863
In the conversations with the families, it also becomes clear

103
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06.911
that there are major differences

104
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13.567
between and within the families in how to relate to and reflect on

105
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,639
The information you get in different flows online.

106
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,400
What we call search criticism.

107
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,048
Like how source criticism can be understood.

108
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
It is clear that

109
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,470
Source criticism in meaning

110
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:36,760
What one can and cannot trust is something that is discussed to a much greater extent

111
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
than search criticism

112
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,239
that is, why information is presented to us

113
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44.031
That way

114
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
as it does.

115
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:52,215
In terms of library

116
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55.551
for all participants

117
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
Young as adults

118
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59.647
is a library

119
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02.975
to a large extent associated with that

120
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04.767
borrow books

121
00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:10,797
A challenge lies in the mission of public librarians

122
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,717
to educate in digital skills

123
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:17,311
towards users who are unconscious or

124
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22.531
about the library's educational assignment

125
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
Or simply uninterested.

126
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,572
The adults in the study that I mentioned earlier call for more

127
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Knowledge about the subject.

128
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
And preferably in the form of shorter

129
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
lecture activities.

130
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:45,727
Here we mean that the librarians' educational role as lecturer

131
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,836
could be made visible and extended further

132
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,523
The library can also help

133
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:56,479
Develop people's imagination

134
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01.343
In relation to the invisible digital information infrastructure

135
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:09.311
that in so many ways affects how we perceive and understand our surroundings today

136
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:24,200
Based on these results and conclusions, we give the following recommendations

137
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
To give continuous space ate

138
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,135
and create conditions for extensive skills development so that libraries

139
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:42,403
And librarians can rightly claim that they have knowledge of algorithms, digital source criticism

140
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
and other effects of the information's

141
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
infrastructure that is so central to human life

142
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
today

143
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,591
It is not just about technical knowledge

144
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59.711
Without a broader ability and critical knowledge

145
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04.846
that includes cultural, social and political aspects

146
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09.951
We also recommend that public libraries

147
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,327
developed into nodes for MIK issues in the local community

148
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,935
Here, librarians can work more with outward operations

149
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,720
primarily aimed at other workplaces and occupational groups

150
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:32,579
By conveying expertise to, for example, police, school, leisure activities, sports leaders

151
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,527
healthcare professionals and social services

152
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,623
so can the public library indirectly reach people

153
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
which they don't always reach.

154
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,351
But it is a role that must be credible and founded in expertise

155
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,959
It is a challenge to change the image of libraries and librarians

156
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Collected expertise.

157
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58.847
A way of working educational

158
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01.151
In direct contact with users

159
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07.551
may be to put a critical pedagogy into practice and thereby work

160
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09.343
both reading promotion and with mik

161
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:17,279
Here we advocate reflective conversations, for example within the context of

162
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18.303
circle business.

163
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:22,911
In this way, the focus may be to make aware

164
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,574
And critically reflect with each other.

165
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,138
Cultural forms of expression such as fiction

166
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:37,503
non -fiction or film could help make visible and act as

167
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,626
the basis for conversation about it many times

168
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,120
Invisible information infrastructure.

169
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
Finally

170
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,839
do we mean that in order to enable the librarian

171
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,703
to work more with outward-directed MIK operations

172
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01.823
But also with this type of reflective conversation in circle business

173
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:09,680
So also needs educational ability to be included in the continuous skills development.

174
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:15,600
Both these recommendations and the report

175
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,920
Will soon be published on digitally first website.

176
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,167
But for those who are already interested in that

177
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,720
read and these and related questions

178
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:41,118
So I have here a list of related publications about searching in a digital everyday life

179
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
About search and source criticism at school,

180
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:50,975
If the invisible information infrastructure and need to make it visible,

181
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
algorithms,

182
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00.703
