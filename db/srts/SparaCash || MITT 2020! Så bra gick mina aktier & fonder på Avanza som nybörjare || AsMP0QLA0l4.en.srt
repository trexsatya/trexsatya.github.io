1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Hey

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
In this video I was going to go through

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,096
My 2020

4
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,680
It is because Avanza has a summary of

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:15,244
How my and your stock and fund portfolio on Avanza have gone during 2020.

6
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:17,920
And you can easily go into it

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,712
If you look at the address here

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:24,064
So can you get an overview like the one I will show

9
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:27,648
How your investment has simply gone!

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
As a thank you for being so many subscribers here now on the channel so I think I should be a bit nice

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
Show up exactly how it went for me

12
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,192
To show that I am no lying ugly fish that

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Yes

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
Some other social media have

15
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:49,152
If you have been involved in following the stock exchange last year then you might have a clue to

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,717
The stock exchange got a small breed there in March 2020

17
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,761
when the pandemic arose

18
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,856
And then so recovered the stock exchange who was lucky

19
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,416
And the vast majority of us

20
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,464
That was in the whole of 2020

21
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:03,744
Who sat still

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,792
have probably earned quite a lot of money

23
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,656
The cut has actually made quite a good time with money and we will also see that now in this overview

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,496
But I think we jump into the first so my total value

25
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,380
How much it increased with

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,888
My total value increased by SEK 213,721

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,121
And hence we have deposits of SEK 41,500 then

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,236
We have a development SEK 165,000

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,496
And dividends of SEK 6700

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,792
And my strategy in 2020 it has simply been to just

31
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,676
Be still and not do much.

32
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,837
In the past you may have gone in and bought and sold

33
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
one has been satisfied perhaps after 10-20% return

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,696
But this year I have let the shares rush

35
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:53,152
And most people have actually done that, they have gone up sick a lot of shares

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
Moves on to the next picture so we see then

37
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,588
Yes but it went better for me than the average at Avanza

38
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
I think quite a few of us may have

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,951
had that lucky to be above the cut

40
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
Both more than index and more than the avanza section

41
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,604
If we have been sitting on these technology shares

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,069
Sustainability shares or similar.

43
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,472
So my development ended at 38.06%

44
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
Percent

45
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,080
But my main portfolio, the long -term portfolio went a little better

46
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:28,516
Around 39-40 % so it is probably the one that makes up a larger part of my total investment portfolio on Avanza

47
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
And you have to be satisfied with that

48
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
I am clearly happy with that

49
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
But it is in the long run that is the most important thing.

50
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,672
Hope it lasts too

51
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,976
This was a very magnificent year

52
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,414
So I may be very happy that I managed to beat both the stock exchange and the incision on Avanza

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,704
If we move on to my best stock market buddies as they call it then we see then

54
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,288
The best stock I have to thank is sink

55
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
that went plus SEK 104,000

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
Mycronic of SEK 38,000

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,743
And plea of SEK 35,000

58
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,552
Have you seen my video about shares for beginners then it's pretty funny

59
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
Because we have a pinned comment there

60
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
I have promised to keep Plejd for as long as I have patience to so we will see

61
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,632
But the losers then as I talked about in my loss video so we have besqab

62
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,722
that is the loser I chose to sell off

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,254
There I went minus - SEK 30,000 on

64
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,848
Castellum actually went down - SEK 2,500

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
And then we have Realty Income Corp

66
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
We move on

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,576
In this monthly overview, we see that November went best at plus SEK 93000

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,720
And in March I sat.
 on the hands and it was very hard psychologically but there you have learned something

69
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,704
Minus 57000 SEK I went there

70
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,969
And then we have these days that I think is quite interesting

71
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,680
And then you see March 12th

72
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
Then I was minus - SEK 34000

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
In a day!

74
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,616
It stings pretty much when you look at it

75
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
Then you have days like

76
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,480
April 23 plus 25000 kr

77
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,835
And November we have two days one at SEK 17,000 and a plus SEK 19,000

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
If you look at the overview shown here you see that it is Sweden that my majority of shares lie in

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,631
And then it is in the funds that I get a little more spread over the US and China

80
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,334
But I prefer to stay in the Swedish market, because I have the best control there now.

81
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,543
But I am thinking about widening a little more globally in the future.

82
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,199
So a total summation here now over the portfolio and it is then 2020 38 % as I said

83
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Plus 213 000 SEK

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,995
Best month was November and the best stock was sink

85
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
I am glad that I kept and that I

86
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Are still holding

87
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
We must see how long lasts in it

88
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,095
But yes it will be fun to see how 2021 degenerates

89
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,167
And i would very much like to know how it went for you

90
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
So please comment below how much you earned or how much your portfolio went up or down

91
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,479
And keep in mind that what I invest in should not see as any advice or recommendations

92
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
But it is

93
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
Entirely my decisions

94
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
You should take responsibility for your particular purchase

95
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
It is you who has to do your own research

96
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Before you choose to buy anything

97
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
Does not trust others

98
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,583
And yes I look sickly positive in the coming year and I think we are celebrating

99
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
Just this one

100
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Special

101
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,105
The special year with a small soda I actually think

102
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,847
I wish you a good continuation and hope it gets

103
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
A fantastic 2021

104
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Have it so good
