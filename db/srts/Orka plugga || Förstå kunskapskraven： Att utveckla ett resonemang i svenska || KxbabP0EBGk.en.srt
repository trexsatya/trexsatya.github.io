FORMING AN ARGUMENT

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,920
You form arguments in many subjects, 
and you can use those skills all your life.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,240
Think about how often you have to make 
decisions and weigh up pros and cons.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,680
To form an argument means 
to develop your thoughts and opinions.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,640
You can make a claim, like "meat 
consumption harms the environment"-

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,760
-but why is that true? 
On what do you base that claim?

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,920
An argument should always explain 
and give depth to your thought or opinion.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,840
To help you develop within a subject-

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,800
-teachers consult 
the knowledge requirements.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,400
These describe the different levels of 
knowledge and skills a student can have.

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,680
The requirements are also used 
to determine your grades.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,440
The requirements classify arguments-

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,520
-as either simple, 
developed, or well developed.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,840
Crystal clear, right? No? All right, 
I suppose we need an example.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,520
Let's use a book recommendation 
to illustrate a well-developed argument.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,280
Why do you recommend this book?

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
I really like this book.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,840
It's interesting and deals with important 
issues like courage and loyalty.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,560
It made me realise 
I shouldn't be judgemental.

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,120
Hang on. 
These are all thoughts you can develop.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,680
Explain what you mean by them. 
Why do you feel that way?

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,320
Offer examples. That will develop and 
improve the quality of your argument.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,280
You said the book was interesting. 
Why do you think so?

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,640
Hm... The story keeps growing, 
in unpredictable ways.

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,760
For example, new information 
is revealed about the protagonist.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,400
-What does that result in? 
-The protagonist grows as a person.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,880
I didn't like the person at first 
but ended up sympathising with them.

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,120
Great! You developed your argument 
by defining what you found interesting-

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,800
-and offered examples. You also said 
the book was about courage.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Elaborate on that 
by using different perspectives.

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,280
Saying "On the one hand/ 
on the other hand" shows-

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,800
-that you can look at things 
from different angles.

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,280
On the one hand, the protagonist is 
forced to make difficult decisions-

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,680
-like leaving a safe place 
to move to a new city.

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Making a fresh start is courageous. 
On the other hand-

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,000
-the person ran away from problems 
and left friends high and dry.

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,800
That's not very courageous. 
It won't make the problems go away.

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,480
You mentioned not being judgemental.

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,680
Why is that important, 
and what can judgement lead to?

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,960
Does the book send a message?

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,960
Having an open mind 
helps me understand other people.

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,960
It may introduce me to new situations 
or people I wouldn't have met otherwise.

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,920
If more people had an open mind, 
the world would be nicer.

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,520
In what way?

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,400
More people would make an effort 
to understand each other.

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,120
Ah! Now you told us 
what the book made you reflect on-

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,360
-and you used generalisation by showing 
what others may learn from the book.

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,440
The trick to forming an argument is 
to stick to one thought or claim at a time.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,840
Then develop your message by using 
the words why, how, when, and what.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,440
You can clarify your argument even more 
by using examples.

51
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,160
Use conjunctions 
to make your argument cohesive.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,440
You form arguments 
outside of school ,too.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,920
These tricks can help you 
get your point across to others-

54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,280
-and be a useful tool 
in developing your thoughts and ideas.

55
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,400
You can use those skills for other 
subjects, too, and in your spare time.
