1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,970
"The witnesses heard bang bang and someone collapsed"

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,939
"Of course it was my broski, he's shooting like an idiot" "

3
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:10,409
You'll find us in flashback for some crimes we did"

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,549
Reportedly he hadn't been at the address for a long time and was assumed be abroad.

5
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:24,553
He has several ongoing conflicts and one hypothesis was that he was involved in the murder of Einár.

6
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:36,229
and that he too, considering the murder that took place in Rinkeby a few days before (Dumlee) is subject to reprisals.

7
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:53,243
Scar, 23 years old, is a person with great capital for violence. From the beginning he was a bit more of a running boy in the Valley network, but pretty soon he had to be responsible for the protection at larger meetings and be the one who was armed at these.

8
00:00:53,243 --> 00:01:04,985
He appeared to be the one in the network responsible for handling and moving the network's weapons. Soon it was clear that he began to act as a perpetrator in serious violent crimes.

9
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:13,525
Something that he seems to find satisfying and also sees himself as a "sicario" (assassin).

10
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:25,168
Scar has also acted as a bodyguard for "The Greek", i.e. Mikael Tenezos. Both in Sweden but also when they went abroad.

11
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:38,145
Scar is said to have carried out acts of violence on behalf of his own network, but also carried out missions for payment and other services for other networks allied with the Dalen network, e.g. 23PCS.

12
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:50,588
As I said, Ildar is called "Scar", which, among other things, police officers have heard friends call him. He has also marked his slippers with it when he has been detained for various crimes.

13
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:58,161
The police authority's overall assessment is that Scar is part of a criminal network, Dalen, for organized crime.

14
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:11,872
Scar is suspected of being, in addition to himself, a target for attacks during the conflict with the Kurdish Fox and Foxtrot. A hand grenade is thrown into the gate of the address in Enskededalen that he and his family are written on.

15
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:20,412
In addition to that, "Scar" is also suspected of being an active actor in acts of violence against the opposing side.

16
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:25,916
After the attack on Scar, the conflict between Dalen and the Kurdish Fox is a fact.

17
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:39,527
When the conflict between the gangs has been in full swing for a few months, in April 2023 a 25-year-old man who is connected to the criminal network Foxtrot is shot in central Umeå.

18
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:50,836
The competing Dalen network is considered to be behind it and now charges have been brought for the attempted murder of Öst in the town of Umeå and the trial is ongoing during November.

19
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:59,810
The prosecutors bring charges in a case where eight people are charged involved in a case of, among other things, attempted murder, serious drug offenses and particularly serious weapons offences.

20
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:11,319
The police have singled out a 23-year-old man as the mastermind behind the shooting.

21
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:24,429
He is suspected of inciting attempted murder, serious drug crime and serious weapons crime. The incident is considered part of the incredibly intense and bloody conflict between Foxtrot and the Valley Network.

22
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:33,970
This is a deal within criminal circles. It is organized activity where they want to control the drug market in Umeå and Skellefteå.

23
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:44,945
According to the indictment, the business was controlled by the 23-year-old who stayed in Spain and the Netherlands before he was arrested in The Hague in the Netherlands.

24
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:55,053
He is suspected of having sent a person to Umeå to ensure that the shooting is carried out correctly. Of the eight defendants, seven are in custody and one person is at large.

25
00:03:55,053 --> 00:04:13,501
The 23-year-old who is suspected of being behind the shooting in Umeå is described by the police as driving a constellation that conducted drug trafficking in the city. When he was arrested in a pub at the end of 2022, he threatened both police officers and guards with violence.

26
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:16,610
- Say hello to the "police chief's name" that it's war now! he shouted among other things.

27
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,775
The 23-year-old man is linked to the violent Dalen network.

28
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:44,960
The man was charged in January with assault, attempted violence against an official, violent resistance, drug offenses and unlawful threats. But the trial never took place. According to documents from the Correctional Service, the man had gone abroad and stayed away.

29
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:53,199
On a picture in the preliminary investigation, you can see that he has published a picture of himself insulting the Kurdish fox and foxtrot.

30
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:10,947
17 April 2023. At 6:59 p.m., the police received an alarm call regarding a shooting in the Ost på Stan district near Hamrinsgatan in Umeå.

31
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:19,921
A witness states that he heard three sounds which the witness interpreted as gun shots, at the same time the witness saw a person collapse.

32
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:34,432
At the scene, Patrik is found shot with several shots and in connection with the incident, witnesses observe and film a person leaving the scene on an electric scooter in an easterly direction towards the Öbacka Strand area.

33
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:47,209
The victim is shot with three shots, one shot with the entrance opening on the right side of the abdomen, one shot in the back on the upper side of the right shoulder and one shot in the left hand.

34
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:53,180
The shooter has shot Patrik at the place between SunTan and a restaurant.

35
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:04,523
The victim then moved around the scene with several bleeding injuries, then stopped next to the garage where the paramedics found him.

36
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:16,966
In the parking lot, dog handlers found a knife. The knife was on top of an engine heater outlet and was of the model Morakniv with a black and red handle, the knife blade was quite rusty.

37
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:21,469
The knife was found approximately 38 meters from the crime scene.

38
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:29,276
When the victim is taken care of after the shooting, it is noted that he has SEK 5,390 in cash on him.

39
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:41,719
2 empty 9 mm Luger casings were found at the crime scene. A bullet was found in the victim's shirt and two bullets were removed from his body.

40
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:50,859
Information in the preliminary investigation states that the victim must have arranged a meeting with the counterparty "dsquared" and that the whole thing must have been about drug deals.

41
00:06:53,862 --> 00:07:03,436
During the same evening as the shooting, an electric scooter is noticed in a warehouse on Hoppets Gränd that is similar to the electric scooter that has been seen in connection with the shooting.

42
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:13,844
Overall, interest is directed towards a woman's apartment on Hoppets Gränd and just before 01.00 a house search is made in the woman's apartment.

43
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:21,817
Liam, one of the men's mothers and two other women are found in the apartment. All are arrested.

44
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:37,930
A few hours after the incident, Oliver "Sheisty" and Liam were arrested for suspected involvement in the incident, Sheisty is said to act as manager for the rapper "Chapo" under Sheisty's management.

45
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:44,735
as well as the shooter, Liam and the rapper Chapo together previously convicted of an attempted murder together.

46
00:07:44,735 --> 00:08:02,383
together and in agreement with three other men assaulted the victim and attacked him with several punches and kicks and in each case six stab wounds to the body. They were convicted of aggravated assault.

47
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:11,357
Chapo mentions the stabbing in Skellefteå and the shooting in Umeå in two different songs.

48
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:16,060
"The witnesses heard bang bang and that someone collapsed"

49
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,030
"Of course it was my broski, he shoots like an idiot" "

50
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,030
You will find us in flashback for some crimes we committed"

51
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:45,517
All are considered to belong to the local grouping in Umeå that is allied with the Dalen network . The victim in the shooting is connected to the Foxtrot network, a potential motive is that Oliver was abused by "some from the south" some day before the shooting.

52
00:08:56,526 --> 00:09:03,731
Shooter Liam and Oliver pose for a picture 33 minutes after Liam shoots the victim three times, leaving him to die.

53
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:20,945
The police carry out a number of house searches after the arrest and on April 18, a large amount of narcotics and several weapons are found on Bryggargatan and on Tegsplan in Umeå.

54
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:32,921
In connection with the investigative work connected to that case, a large number of phones are seized and in the analysis work of these phones, the police have identified a signal alias named "Don Svensson" who has a significant role connected to the investigation.

55
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:52,870
In connection with investigative measures regarding the attempted murder, the narcotics and the weapons, it has subsequently gradually become clear that the cases regarding the attempted murder, Bryggargatan and Tegsplan are closely linked to each other.

56
00:09:55,873 --> 00:10:03,779
Information has also emerged during the course of the investigation that several people in Oliver and Liam's circle have been involved in the acts in various ways.

57
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:14,287
Through the investigative measures, it has also crystallized an image that John, the 23-year-old, has had a leading and controlling position in the handling from abroad.

58
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:33,236
The victim described the incident as someone shooting him with a gun. The first shot is said to have hit in the stomach and the victim is said to have fallen over. Then there were two or three more shots in rapid succession and he is said to have then run (toward the witnesses) to get help.

59
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:45,212
The victim survived the attempted murder but in September 2023 he was arrested by the police task force.

60
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:54,686
He was connected to a drug bust linked to a large seizure at a workplace in Umeå worth SEK 600,000 in March 2023.

61
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:59,261
Large sums of cash were also found in his apartment.

62
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:07,763
The victim, Patrik, is sentenced to two years in prison by the Umeå district court for serious drug offences.

63
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:19,406
In questioning the accused shooter, who admits that he fired the shots, he described that he took a gun out of a jacket pocket from a distance of one meter to maybe two meters and fired three shots at the victim.

64
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:30,381
He described that he saw the victim fall "sort of backwards" after one or two shots, but that he himself did not know that either the first or the last shot hit.

65
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:40,889
He stated that he believed the gun broke because after the last shot the casing was not ejected from the gun. He could not fire any more shots after that.

66
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:54,934
He stated that he aimed at the lower part of the victim and did not believe that the first shot hit the stomach. When he subsequently learned that the victim received a gunshot wound to the hand, the shooter believes that the first shot hit the hand.

67
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:59,371
That the victim was then hit by shots in the upper body meant the shooter happened because the victim fell.

68
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:16,351
Oliver visits John aka Don Svensson on at least one occasion, in Spain before the assassination attempt, he is singled out as the leader and mastermind behind the assassination attempt.

69
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:32,697
There are several pictures from Oliver's stay in Spain in the phone. Among other things, there are pictures of a meeting with John, Robel and the rapper "Wafi" from Sundsvall, from the same occasion.

70
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:40,003
Rapper Wafi is linked to the Dalennävretnet's local and allied gangs in Sundsvall.

71
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:54,114
The police in Umeå have during the past year followed the development of violence in southern Sweden and at the same time worked actively to follow the development in Umeå linked to these conflicts and alliances.

72
00:12:54,114 --> 00:13:09,092
During the past year, the Police in Västerbotten have seen that local individuals in Umeå, who are involved in violence and drug-related activities, have socialized with individuals from Sundsvall and Stockholm, individuals who are connected to the Dalen network.

73
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:15,064
Through this, the police have made a collective assessment that these individuals are loyal to the Dalen network.

74
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:22,970
The conflict between these networks is primarily about controlling the drug market in Västerbotten.

75
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:29,442
In connection with the attempted murder on April 17, 2023, two witnesses filmed when the perpetrator left the crime scene.

76
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:40,718
The perpetrator was then wearing a black jacket. A similar jacket was later seized at his mother's workplace, in a locker.

77
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:53,861
After the shooting, the shooter fled to a nearby apartment. Among others, his mother was there. According to the indictment, she helped her son eliminate evidence, including by hiding his clothes in a cupboard at her workplace.

78
00:13:53,861 --> 00:14:08,773
The indictment states that police technicians found the shooter's DNA and gunshot residue in the form of detonator particles on the clothes in the cupboard at the woman's workplace. The police's view is that she tried to eliminate evidence.

79
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:15,045
the police have mapped how the mother moved during the night of the crime, including via her phone and access card to work.

80
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:21,164
The drugs found in this case were as follows.

81
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:27,988
amphetamine, 3-CMC, MDMA, cannabis resin, oxycodone, pregabalin, alprazolam, etc.

82
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,258
The defendants are:

83
00:14:31,258 --> 00:14:45,145
Liam, 20 years old, the acknowledged shooter is charged with attempted murder, aggravated weapons offense, extremely aggravated weapons offense, aggravated drug offense and violation of the Firearms and explosive goods felony.

84
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:58,212
Oliver aka "Shiesty", 21 years old, is charged with attempted murder, extremely serious weapon offence, serious drug offence, breach of the Act on Flammable and Explosive Goods, serious offence.

85
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:11,856
Liam and Oliver have together tried to kill Patrik by Liam arming himself with a semi-automatic pistol and shooting Patrik repeatedly in the body.

86
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:21,831
Oliver has been complicit in the alleged act by planning and organizing the shooting together with Liam during the period in April until the attempted murder.

87
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:28,770
They have been in contact with John, who ordered the deed, Oliver has relayed the mission to Liam.

88
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:39,779
Oliver and Liam have subsequently reported to John that they completed the mission by contacting him after the shooting took place.

89
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:51,288
John aka Don Svensson, 23 years old, is charged with extremely serious weapons crime and instigation of attempted murder.

90
00:15:51,288 --> 00:16:00,695
John has caused Liam to try to kill Patrik by giving instructions to them to shoot Patrik via extensive contacts with Liam and Oliver, preferably through encrypted phone traffic,

91
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:07,667
and by ensuring that a person supervised the execution of the shooting.

92
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:18,142
Do you think the men will be executed and what consequences will this have for Umeå in the future?
