1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,970
"Witnesses heard Pang Pang and someone fell together"

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,939
"Of course it was my Broski, he shoots like an idiot"

3
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:10,409
"You'll find us at Flashback for any crimes we made"

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,549
He reportedly had not been at the address for a long time and was assumed to be abroad.

5
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:24,553
He has several ongoing conflicts and a hypothesis was that he was involved in the murder of Einár.

6
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:36,229
And that, too, considering the murder that was passed in Rinkeby a day before (Dumlee) is exposed to retaliation.

7
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:53,243
Scar, 23, is a person with great violence.
 From the beginning he was a bit more of a running boy in the Dalen Network, but pretty soon he was responsible for the protection at larger meetings and be the one who was armed at these.

8
00:00:53,243 --> 00:01:04,985
He seemed to be the one in the network responsible for managing and moving the network of the network.
 Soon it was clear that he began to act as a provider in the event of serious violent crimes.

9
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:13,525
Something he seems to think is satisfactory and also sees himself as a "sicario" (assassin).

10
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:25,168
Scar has also acted as a bodyguard for the "Greek" ie Mikael Tenezos.
 Both in Sweden but also when they went abroad.

11
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:38,145
Scar must have performed violence on behalf of its own network, but also performed assignments against payment and gene services for other networks allies with the Dalen Network, eg.
 23st.

12
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:50,588
As mentioned, Imdar is called "Scar" which, among other things, police officers have heard friends call him.
 He has also marked his slippers with it when he was arrested for various crimes.

13
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:58,161
The overall assessment of the police authority is that SCAR is part of a criminal network, Dalen, for organized crime.

14
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:11,872
Scar is suspected of being a target for attacks during the conflict with Kurdish fox and foxtrot.
 A hand grenade is thrown into the gate to the address in Enskededalen he and his family are written on.

15
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:20,412
In addition to that, "SCAR" is also suspected of being an active player for violent acts against the opponent side.

16
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:25,916
After the attack on Scar, the conflict between the valley and the Kurdish fox is a fact.

17
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:39,527
When the conflict between the gang has been at full speed for a few months so in April 2023, the 25-year-old man who is linked to the criminal network Foxtrot in central Umeå is shot.

18
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:50,836
The competing valley network is considered to be behind and now prosecution for the murder trial \ h on the east in town in Umeå has arrived and the trial is ongoing in November.

19
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:59,810
The prosecutors raise a case of a case where eight people are charged with a person in a \ hom, among other things.
 Murder attempts, serious drug crimes and extremely serious weapons offenses.

20
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:11,319
Police have pointed out a 23-year-old man as the brain behind the shooting.

21
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:24,429
He is suspected of instigating attempts at murder, serious drug crime and serious weapons crime.
 The event is considered to be part of the incredibly intense and bloody conflict between the Foxtrot and the Dalen Network.

22
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:33,970
This \ here a settlement in criminal circles.
 These are organized activities where you want to control the drug market in Umeå and Skellefteå.

23
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:44,945
According to the indictment, the business has been ruled by the 23-year-old who has stayed in Spain and the Netherlands before being arrested in The Hague in the Netherlands.

24
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:55,053
He is suspected of having a person to Umeå to ensure that the shooting is carried out properly.
 Of the eight \ Håtalade, seven are detained and one person is on the loose.

25
00:03:55,053 --> 00:04:13,501

 When he was arrested at a tavern in late 2022, he threatened both police and guards by force.

26
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:16,610
- Health "Police Chief's \ Hame" that it is war now!
 He screamed among other things.

27
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,775
The 23-year-old man \ here linked to the violent dalen network.

28
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:44,960
The man was indicted in \ HJANUSURE for abuse, attempted violence against an official, violent resistance, drug crime and illegal threats.
 But the trial never took place.
 According to documents from the Prison and Probation, the man had gone abroad and stayed away.

29
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:53,199
In a picture in the preliminary investigation, you can see that he has published a picture of himself where he insults Kurdish fox and Foxtrot.

"You'll find us at Flashback for any crimes we made"

All are considered to belong to the local grouping in Umeå, which is allied with the Dalen Network.
 The victim in the shooting is linked to the Foxtrot network, a potential motive is that Oliver has been beaten by "some from the south" some day before the shooting.

In connection with the investigation work linked to this case, a large number of phones are taken into account and in the analysis work of these phones, the police have identified a signal alias called "Don Svensson" which has a significant role linked to the investigation.

55
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:52,870
In connection with investigative measures regarding the attempted murder, the drug and the weapons, it has subsequently cleared up a picture that the cases regarding the murder attempt, Bryggargatan and Tegsplan are closely linked to each other.

56
00:09:55,873 --> 00:10:03,779

58
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:33,236
The victim described the incident as a person shot him with a gun.
 The first shot must have hit the stomach and the victim must then have fallen over.
 Then two or three shots came into rapid succession and he must then have run (against the witnesses) for help.

59
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:45,212
The victim survived the attempted murder but in September 2023 he was arrested by the police's force.

60
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:54,686
He was linked to a drug heritage linked to a large seizure at a workplace in Umeå worth SEK 600,000 in March 2023.

61
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:59,261
Large sums of cash were also found in his apartment.

62
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:07,763
The victim, Patrik, is sentenced to two years in prison by Umeå District Court for serious drug crime.

64
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:30,381

He stated that he thought the gun was broken for the sleeve after the last shot was not thrown out of the gun.
 He then could not shoot more shots.

66
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:54,934
He stated that he was aiming for the lower part of the victim and did not believe that the first shot had taken his stomach.
 When he learned in retrospect that the victim suffered a gunshot wound in his hand, the shooter believes that the first shot took in his hand.

67
00:11:54,934 --> 00:11:59,371
That the victim was then hit by shots in the upper body meant the shooter happened because the victim fell.

68
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:16,351
Oliver visits John Aka Don Svensson on at least one occasion, in Spain before the attempted murder, he is identified as the leader and the brain behind the murder attempt.

Through this, the police have made an overall assessment that these individuals are loyal to the dalen network.

74
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:22,970
The conflict between these networks should primarily be about controlling the drug market in Västerbotten.

75

 The police view is that she tried to remove evidence.

79
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:15,045
