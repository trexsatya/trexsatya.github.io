1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome to this course on open access!

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,880
"Open access" has come to the forefront

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,040
of research and library communities
in recent years,

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,920
and will continue growing in importance
for our entire society.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Simply put, "open access" means
it should be possible for anyone,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,400
free of charge, to access research results,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,080
for example academic publications,
by searching the internet.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,160
This may not seem remarkable,

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,400
but the fact is that open access
involves a major change

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,760
for the research and library communities
that make research results accessible.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,440
"Open access" is part
of another current concept:

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,160
Open science.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,520
An open science system
includes open access

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,720
to academic publications
and research data,

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,840
but it also includes open learning resources
and citizen participation in research.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,640
The Swedish government has decided that academic
publications and research data

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,720
resulting from publicly-funded research
should be openly accessible.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,480
Whether you work at a library such as NLS,
or another research library,

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,440
or if you are a researcher,
you will be affected by this movement

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,880
towards open access and open science.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,840
The transition to open access
and open science

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,120
has been underway for nearly 20 years,
but is still evolving.

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,680
This means we do not yet
have all the answers

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,960
to how open access and open science
will work in the future.

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,000
In this course,
which takes about 30 minutes,

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,920
you will receive a broad introduction
on what open access is,

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,680
and how it may affect you in your work.

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,960
You will also meet colleagues
who share their views on open access

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,720
from varying perspectives.
