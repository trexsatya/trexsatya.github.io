1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:03,279
- Yes, it's Dad.
 - (Laura) Dad.

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,879
Did you hear?

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:09,727
There were so many in there who were glowing at us.

4
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,643
It was pretty hard, I think.

5
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:13,717
New Year's resolutions!

6
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:16,593
(Alma) What are you doing?

7
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:25,688
Good morning.

8
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:29,115
- We're in ... - Kläppen.

9
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:31,559
We came here ...

10
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh!
 Harry is on a chair.
 Do you see?

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,356
We came here two days before Christmas Eve.
 We have had a great time here.

12
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:42,848
- Here's Laura!
 - Yes.

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,722
How are you?

14
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:49,173
Completely silent.
 She is doing pretty well.

15
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:51,541
- Should we go and have breakfast?
 - Yes!

16
00:00:57,728 --> 00:01:04,833
- (Alma) Yes, a highchair.
 Should we take one?
 - (Laura) mm.

17
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:14,626
(Joanna) The morning coffee.
 It is important.

18
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:20,581
- Morning chocolate.
 - I know.
 Just kidding.

19
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:27,740
But this is the most important thing of all.

20
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:33,200
Cream.
 Oh!
 God, so.

21
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:44,884
We live at Hotel Kurbits, located in the middle of the hill.
 We've lived here before.

22
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,251
(Shoulder) mm.

23
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:51,406
Two years ago.
 Then there was a big difference in our family.

24
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:52,990
Yes!

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,960
- This one lay in my stomach.
 - Yes.

26
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:04,569
- She was almost not up.
 - Yes, she was.
 She was "ready to pop!"
 Or, I was.

27
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,329
- Yes.
 - I was very pregnant then.

28
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:13,540
But it's still so cool, the difference, because now we have a little girl talking!
 Right?

29
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,741
Huh?

30
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,277
You talk!

31
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:20,545
Talking.
 Just.

32
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,685
Welcome to our 6-bed apartment, this time.

33
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:35,490
Here we have a pretty nice and spacious hall, where you can hang out.
 With drying cabinets, very good.

34
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:40,561
A guest toilet.
 And behind the camera we have the large toilet with shower.

35
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,563
(Joanna) A guest toilet for all our guests.

36
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,567
Yes exactly.
 We do not have a lot of guests, but it is quite nice when you are many in the family.

37
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:51,970
It is Dad's bait toilet where he can sit and cozy for two hours.

38
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,807
- (Joanna) there was someone honest.
 - What f*n!
 What to have to eat.

39
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,476
- Hörrudu ... - I don't bite for two hours.

40
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:03,349
Hey you.
 Don't swear, thank you.

41
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:07,349
- Not swear!
 - Okay sorry.

42
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:12,019
- Now Alma takes over and shows her room.
 - Yes.
 I dropped the word.

43
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,488
This is where I live.

44
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:21,193
Or, I don't live here.
 Or yes, I kind of do because I am here most of the time when I do not ski.

45
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,295
(Joanna) so you have your own room.

46
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:32,770
Yes.
 I absolutely wanted my own room.
 I have an extra bed here, if anyone wants to sleep over.

47
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:40,675
(Axel) And in here we have Harry's and Laura's room.
 It looks like Almas type.

48
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,243
(Joanna) Mirrored.

49
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,281
Laura sleeps down there and Harry sleeps up there, and they have not bedded the beds.
 So it may be.

50
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:52,763
And in here, Joanna and I sleep.

51
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,224
And it works great.

52
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:02,211
It is a small apartment, but it still has quite a lot of common area, which still works.

53
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:09,385
(Joanna) But the best of all ... I never get tired of this view.

54
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:13,902
After all, we are not such a family that is out the hill when the lifts open.

55
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,305
Woho!

56
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:19,242
Laura, are you out in the lifts something at all?

57
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:23,853
Did you say "uh"?
 What does it mean?

58
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,312
- Are you out skiing?
 - No!

59
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:27,913
No.

60
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,550
Laura is with a babysitter a few hours a day.

61
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:40,523
We have found Elma, 17, who comes and fits Laura for a few hours when we go.
 She is coming just right.

62
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,120
Yes.
 She will come soon.

63
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,829
- (Elma) Hello!
 - (Axel) Hello!
 Good morning.

64
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,097
Good morning.

65
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,232
- How's it going?
 - Good.
 How about you?

66
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,714
It's just good, thank you.

67
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,529
(Axel) Bus kid!

68
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:04,586
- (Joanna) Someone who likes their babysitter.
 - (Axel) Yes, really!

69
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:08,512
- What happens now?
 - We are going to ski school.

70
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:12,848
- Take each other like this, so I can pull you.
 - Okay.

71
00:05:12,915 --> 00:05:14,993
Wiiie!

72
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:24,925
Alma and Harry are in the same ski school group.
 Children 9-11, huh?
 Oh, how good you were!

73
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:29,094
- "Kidz" 9-11.
 - Yes.
 "Kidz."

74
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:34,132
- So Harry is a little young for his group.
 - Yes and...

75
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,667
But it is nice to have them in the same.
 "Sorry."

76
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:42,793
Then there are children from other countries here as well.
 Pretty much more than in previous years, I think.

77
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:47,209
I think you hear families coming from all over Europe.

78
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:49,344
- Yes.
 It's exciting!
 - Yes.

79
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:53,414
- But in their group it is only Swedes.
 - Okay.
 I have no control.

80
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,517
I have, because I listened to them yesterday.
 Should we go a little, right?

81
00:05:57,584 --> 00:06:02,369
Yes.
 I have to put on boots and helmets, then we drive out on the slopes.

82
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:04,356
♪ (music) ♪

83
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:36,180
- Own time.
 Luxurious!
 - Very good home time.

84
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:54,890
It's a thing to get in, but then you have to get out.

85
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,698
Yay!

86
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:08,099
(Joanna) Here comes Alma and Harry's ski school group.

87
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,608
- Hello!
 - Hello!

88
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:13,061
"High five!"

89
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,986
(Axel) Alma, how cool you are.

90
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:22,573
- (Axel) How's it going?
 - (Alma) I managed to turn around.

91
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,778
(Alma) What are you doing?!

92
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:30,180
Shoulder!
 Give me the camera.

93
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:38,697
- What are you doing?
 - It looked so nice to just lie down here a little neighbor.

94
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:44,836
You, I think Alma thought you were embarrassing.
 She quickly skiing away here.

95
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:50,448
But that's my job!
 It's my job to be embarrassing.

96
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,047
(Axel) Alma!
 Wait for me!
 (laugh)

97
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,714
"Hugy."
 (scary)

98
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,283
A little scary when you are so high up.

99
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,721
We are in the gondola, on our way up to the top cabin and will have lunch.
 The family is reunited!

100
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,522
Yes.

101
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:15,326
Did you have a good time?
 (Laura Tjar) Yes, you have had so good and so much fun!

102
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:19,430
She has so much new energy when she has been with us for a while.

103
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,064
Yes.

104
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,334
- How is the ski school, then?
 - It's actually fun!

105
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:28,270
- Harry, what do you think?
 - It's really fun!

106
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:30,238
- Good.
 - Oh.
 Host, host.

107
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:35,876
A good thing with ski school, besides learning to get better at skis, is that you meet new friends.

108
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:36,877
Yes exactly.

109
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,053
- I think that's a big win.
 - Yes.

110
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,321
Good, Laura!

111
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:55,529
Laura sits with Joanna's phone, because she is completely done.

112
00:08:55,858 --> 00:09:05,265
I don't know if I like it, but it is very difficult to get something in her when she is tired and hungry.

113
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,302
- Obviously you don't like it.
 - No.

114
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:11,938
- But the need has no law.
 - No its true.

115
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:17,896
Be happy that those two eat well without screen.

116
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,778
- Does it taste good?
 - mm.

117
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:24,929
Don't forget the vegetables, children.

118
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,291
- There were so many in there who were glowing at us.
 - How did it feel?

119
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:49,744
It felt strange.
 It was a bit like being hounded, because I sit and eat and then at least 10 people look at me.

120
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:56,275
You get pretty nervous and don't really know what to do.

121
00:09:56,373 --> 00:10:00,410
- (Joanna) We have become accustomed to a bit at that too.
 - (Alma) Yes.

122
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:08,116
When we have lived in Portugal, we have not really experienced that in the same way, and then we go here ...

123
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:12,419
- (Laura whining) - Now someone wants something here.

124
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,888
Yes, it's Dad.

125
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:17,590
- Dad.
 - Yes.
 Dad.

126
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:22,024
Dad has flown a little drone.

127
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:29,099
- My fingers, then.
 - I canceled you.
 What would you say?
 Or no, Laura interrupted.

128
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:33,402
When we have lived in Portugal, we have been a bit anonymous.

129
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:40,840
You can walk around and be yourself and bark at the children when they are nasty to each other or so.

130
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:44,244
But here it feels like ... it's a little harder.

131
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,980
- You have eyes on you.
 - Yes, a little so, but ...

132
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,915
You have to be your best self.

133
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:56,521
Yes, but then, it is our own choice and it is great exercise to be its best self all the time, I think.

134
00:10:56,688 --> 00:11:03,193
And I love our viewers.
 And I love that they arrive and that they whisper and look and point ...

135
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:10,324
- Do you just love that bit?
 - No, but ... yes, that's part of it.
 I love everything with what we do.

136
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:15,069
So, I don't love being known.
 It sounded really strange.

137
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,986
But, so ... I love our viewers.
 I love you!

138
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:35,318
What a tok fringes!

139
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,657
Now I, Alma and Harry are going to ski.

140
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:43,933
- Yes.
 - Yes.

141
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:48,896
And me and Laura are going back to the room and lie down and rest.

142
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:53,032
- Yes.
 How nice to you.
 - Yes, I think she is freezing now.

143
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,367
I know she freezes.
 And is deadly tired.

144
00:11:55,434 --> 00:12:02,206
Please, you get this camera.
 We have this ... not the mitt.
 This we will film with.

145
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,943
- Yes!
 - Okay!
 Kisses and good night.
 "Boa Noite."
 Love you!

146
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,620
"Love you!"
 (Love you!)

147
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,115
- Have fun!
 I will see you later!
 - Bye!

148
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:14,140
Bye!

00:13:54,695 --> 00:14:00,200
Hörrudu, you have been out and about a lot of skiing and you have been able to do so without any problems.

162
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:04,303
You don't get the energy from looking at your mobile, I promise you.

163
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,263
No, though I don't lose energy.

164
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:13,733
- What?
 Do you lose energy by being out here?
 - Yes, because then I have to touch my legs.

165
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:16,946
- But you should help cook.
 - No, mom ...

166
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,548
- Yes.
 - No.

167
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:21,250
- Yes.
 - I do not want to.

168
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,878
- Yes.
 - please?

169
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:29,323
- What have you thought you should do?
 - Lie inside my room.

170
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:34,639
- No, forget it!
 Now we're going to cook, right?
 - (Axel) Yes, now we will cook.

171
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:40,468
Can you understand that this is the last vlog of the year?

172
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,033
- No.
 - No.

173
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,535
On the last days of the year.

174
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:51,407
Yes.
 So ... it's sick to think about.
 I think this year has flown by.

175
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,277
- I agree with.
 - Yes, it has been very fast.

176
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,747
- What should that imagine?
 - Mozzarella.

177
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:06,819
- It looks like a small poop, type.
 - What?
 If your poop sausages look like that, then you have a problem.

178
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:12,357
No, they don't.
 Although it looks like something strange.

179
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:23,065
What do you think has been best about this year, then?

180
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:29,170
I think it's fun when you say ... So, Laura's words are probably the most fun.

181
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:35,581
When you say "Summer Shadow!"
 To her, then she gets like this ...

182
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:39,348
Did you hear?
 She just, "Oh! Hugy!"
 (scary)

183
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:47,047
And when you say other words, and when she is bargaining and you do so, then she just starts ...

184
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:52,756
- When waving in front of your nose because it smells bad?
 - Yes.

185
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:56,559
But it is great fun that she has begun to understand things.

186
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,994
- Mom?
 - Yes?
 Do you want a hug?

187
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,103
Oh, should you help film?
 Come.

188
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,335
I think the best thing about all year, if you think about the stuff we have shown the viewers,-

189
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:13,005
-As our trip down to Málaga, and then home.

190
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:17,208
And then all summer at home.
 I thought that was absolutely wonderful.

191
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:21,312
- From Portugal to Sweden, you mean?
 - Yes.

192
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:29,351
I think the best thing about this year was when we had Skara Summerland for ourselves.

193
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:32,550
It was so funny!

194
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:40,520
I think the best thing about the year has been ...

195
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,496
Oh!
 She fell.
 (Laura laughs)

196
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:50,835
... autumn in Portugal, because it was so hot and comfortable and we could swim pool for a long time and so.

197
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:52,570
- Yes.
 - Yes, it was cozy.

198
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:58,041
It surprises me that you say summer in Sweden, because it was a lot of packing.

199
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:03,721
- Yes, but ... - Selling houses, that is ... it was pretty hard, I think.

200
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:11,151
It was hard, but it was also a very big and welcome step-

201
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:14,287
-As we brought our family, to sell that house.

202
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:18,557
We had to do it, and it feels great that we have done it now.

203
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:20,091
Mm.

204
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:26,015
- Now it's time to eat, I think.
 - Yes.
 Now it's chaos.

205
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:28,202
♪ (music) ♪

206
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:57,454
We are a day closer to a new year, and we have a suitable today's question.

207
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:02,609
YES!
 What are our New Year's resolutions?

208
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:09,297
- My New Year's promise is that I will learn to go snowboard.
 - Ooh, good there!

209
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:16,112
- My New Year's promise is to learn division.
 - Okay, math.
 Good!

210
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:23,351
Laura fell asleep when we sat down here to record.
 And she is a little too small for a promise.

211
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:28,613
Mine is that I will take care of my health.

212
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,782
- Oh, what good!
 - Make a little better choice in everyday life.

213
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:35,744
Yes.
 It is in the middle.

214
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:38,020
- Same?
 - Yes, the same.

215
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:42,323
What are your New Year's resolutions?

216
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,794
Comment below!

217
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,631
And remember to be kind to yourself now!
 No one should change.

218
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,832
- No.
 - No.

219
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,750
- Don't hold on and, "I'll lose weight and get slim."
 - No.

220
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:00,771
- You can get better, but not hold on and change.
 - Yes!

221
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:06,409
Thanks for watching this video!

222
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:11,546
- Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.
 - Most thumbs up!

223
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:15,283
Comment, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

224
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:18,819
- Happy New Year!
 - Bye!
