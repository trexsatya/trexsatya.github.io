1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:03,279
- Yes, it's daddy.
- Daddy.

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,879
Did you hear that?

3
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:09,727
People were staring at us.

4
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,643
It was pretty tough.

5
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:13,717
New Year's resolutions!

6
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:16,593
What are you doing?

7
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:25,688
Good morning.

8
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:29,115
- We are in...
- Kläppen Ski Resort.

9
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:32,359
We got here...

10
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:36,000
Harry is standing on a chair.

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,356
We got here two days before Christmas Eve.
We have had such a cozy time here.

12
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:42,848
- Here comes Laura!
- Yes.

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,483
How are you?

14
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:49,173
Completely silent.
She's doing quite well.

15
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:51,541
- Shall we go and eat breakfast?
- Yes!

16
00:00:57,728 --> 00:01:03,900
- Yes, a high chair. Shall we take one?
- Mm.

17
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:14,626
Morning coffee. Important.

18
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:20,581
- Morning hot chocolate.
- I know. I was just kidding.

19
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:27,740
This, however, is the most important part.

20
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:33,200
Whipped cream.
Oops! There we go.

21
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:44,884
We are staying at Hotel Kurbits, located right on the slope.
We have stayed here before.

22
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,251
Mm. 

23
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:51,406
Two years ago.
Then, there was a big difference in our family.

24
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:52,990
Yes!

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,960
- This one was in my belly.
- Yes.

26
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:04,569
- She was almost not thought of.
- Yes, she was. She was ready to pop! Well, I was.

27
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,329
- Yes.
- I was very pregnant.

28
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:13,540
But the difference is so cool
because now we have a little girl who talks! Right?

29
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,741
What?

30
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,277
You're talking!

31
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:20,545
Talking. Exactly.

32
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,685
Welcome to our 6-bed apartment, this time.

33
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:35,490
Here we have a quite nice and spacious hall
with a drying cabinet. Very good.

34
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:40,561
A guest restroom.
And behind the camera is the large restroom with a shower.

35
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,563
A guest restroom for all our guests.

36
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,567
Exactly. We don't have too many guests,
but it's quite nice when you're a big family.

37
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:51,970
It's daddy's poop toilet
where he can cozy-poop for two hours.

38
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,807
- Someone was just very honest.
- What the heck! The things you have to take.

39
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,476
- Hey...
- I don't cozy-poop for two hours.

40
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:03,349
Hey. Don't swear, please.

41
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:07,633
- Don't swear!
- Okay, sorry.

42
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:11,953
- Now Alma takes over and shows her room.
- Yes, I lost the floor.

43
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,488
This is where I live.

44
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:20,860
Well, I don't live here. Well, I kind of do
because I'm here most of the time I'm not skiing.

45
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:23,295
You have your own room.

46
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:32,770
Yes. I really wanted to have my own room.
I have a spare bed here, if anyone wants to sleep over.

47
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:40,675
And here we have Harry and Laura's room.
It looks kind of the same as Alma's room.

48
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,243
Mirrored.

49
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,780
Laura sleeps down there and Harry sleeps up there,
and they have not made their beds.

50
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:48,281
That's how it is sometimes.

51
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:52,763
Joanna and I sleep in here.

52
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,224
And it works great.

53
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:02,211
It's a small apartment
but it still has quite a large common area.

54
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:09,098
But the best of all...
I never get tired of this view.

55
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:15,090
We are not a family that's out on the slopes
when the lifts open.

56
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:19,242
Laura, are you out in the lifts at all?

57
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:23,853
What does that mean?

58
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,312
- Are you out skiing?
- No!

59
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:27,913
No.

60
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,550
Laura is with a babysitter
a few hours per day.

61
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:40,523
We have found Elma, 17, who comes and looks after Laura
for a few hours when we're skiing. She'll be here any moment now.

62
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,120
Yes! She'll be here soon.

63
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:48,829
- Hey!
- Hello! Good morning.

64
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,097
Good morning.

65
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:52,232
- How are you?
- I'm fine. And you?

66
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,714
Fine, thank you.

67
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,003
Little rascal!

68
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,472
Yes.

69
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:04,586
- Someone who likes their babysitter.
- Yes, indeed!

70
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:08,512
- What's happening now?
- We're off to ski school.

71
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:14,993
- Take one each. I'll pull you guys.
- Okay.

72
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:24,925
Alma and Harry are in the same ski school group.
Children 9-11, right? Oh, looking good!

73
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:29,094
- "Kidz" 9-11.
- Yes. "Kidz."

74
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:34,132
- Harry is a bit young for his group.
- Yes, and...

75
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,667
But it's nice to have them in the same group.
Sorry.

76
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:42,793
There are kids from other countries here as well.
Quite a lot more than in previous years, I think.

77
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:47,209
I feel like you hear families from all over Europe.

78
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:49,344
- Yes. Exciting!
- Yes.

79
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:53,414
- There are only Swedes in their group, though.
- Okay. I have no idea.

80
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,517
I do, because I listened to them yesterday.
Shall we do some skiing, or?

81
00:05:57,584 --> 00:06:02,369
Yes. I need to put on ski boots and a helmet,
then let's hit the slopes.

82
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:36,180
- Alone time. Luxurious!
- Very good alone time.

83
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:54,507
It's one thing to get in,
but then you have to get out.

84
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:08,099
Here comes Alma and Harry's ski school group.

85
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,608
- Hey!
- Hey!

86
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:13,061
High five!

87
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,986
Alma, you're so cool.

88
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:21,880
- How's it going?
- I managed to turn around.

89
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,109
What are you doing?

90
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:30,180
Axel! Give me the camera.

91
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:38,697
- What are you doing?
- It looked so nice to lie down a bit.

92
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:44,777
I think Alma got embarrassed.
She skied away very fast.

93
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:50,448
That's my job!
My job is to be embarrassing.

94
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,402
Alma! Wait for me!

95
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,714
"Gary." (scary)

96
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,283
A little scary this high up.

97
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,721
We are in the gondola, on our way to "Toppstugan" for some lunch.
The family is reunited.

98
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,522
Yes.

99
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:15,326
Have you had a good time?
Yes, you've had such a good and fun time!

100
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:19,430
She has so much new energy
when she's been free of us for a little while.

101
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,064
Yes.

102
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,334
- How's ski school?
- It's actually fun!

103
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:28,270
- Harry, what do you think?
- It's really fun.

104
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:30,238
- Good.
- Oh. Cough, cough.

105
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:35,876
A good thing about ski school, besides getting better at skiing,
is that you meet new friends.

106
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:36,877
Yes, exactly.

107
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,053
- That's a big win.
- Yes.

108
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,321
Good, Laura!

109
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:55,529
Laura is sitting with Joanna's phone,
because she's completely done.

110
00:08:55,858 --> 00:09:05,624
I don't know if I like it, but it's very difficult
to get her to eat anything when she's tired and hungry.

111
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:08,302
- Of course you don't like it.
- No.

112
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:11,938
- But desperate times call for desperate measures.
- That's true.

113
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:17,896
Be happy those two are eating without a screen.

114
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,778
- Is it good?
- Mm.

115
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:24,929
Don't forget about the vegetables, kids.

116
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,291
- So many in there were staring at us.
- How did that feel?

117
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:49,935
It felt weird, kind of like getting attacked,
because I'm eating and at least 10 people are looking at me.

118
00:09:50,044 --> 00:09:56,275
You get quite nervous
and don't really know what to do.

119
00:09:56,373 --> 00:10:00,410
- We're not really used to it anymore.
- Yeah.

120
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:08,116
When we've lived in Portugal, we haven't really
experienced that in the same way. And then we come here...

121
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:12,419
Someone wants something.

122
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:14,888
Yes, it's daddy.

123
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:17,590
- Daddy.
- Yes. Daddy.

124
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:22,024
Daddy has just flown the drone a bit.

125
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:29,099
- Oh! My fingers.
- I interrupted you, what were you going to say? Well, Laura did.

126
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:33,402
In Portugal,
we have been a bit anonymous.

127
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:40,840
You can, like, walk around and be yourself and yell at the kids
when they're mean towards each other, and things like that.

128
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:44,244
Here, it feels, like...
It's a bit more difficult.

129
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,845
- You have eyes on you.
- Yes, a bit like that...

130
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,915
You have to be your best self.

131
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:56,521
I mean, it's our own choice and it's a very good exercise
to always be your best self, I think.

132
00:10:56,688 --> 00:11:03,193
And I love our viewers. And I love that they come up to us
and that they whisper and look and point...

133
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:10,324
- Do you love that part in particular?
- No, but... Yes, it's a part of it. I love everything about what we do.

134
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:15,069
I don't love to be famous.
That sounded really weird.

135
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,986
I mean... I love our viewers.
I love you guys!

136
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:35,318
What goofballs!

137
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,657
Now me, Alma, and Harry
are going to ski a little.

138
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:43,933
- Yes.
- Yes.

139
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:48,896
And Laura and I will go back to our room
and rest for a bit.

140
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:53,032
- That'll be nice for you.
- Yes, I think she's cold.

141
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,367
I know she's cold. And super tired.

142
00:11:55,434 --> 00:12:02,206
You guys take this camera.
We have this... Not the glove. This camera.

143
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,943
- Yes!
- Okay! Kisses and good night. "Boa noite." Love you!

144
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,999
Love you!

145
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,115
- Have fun! See you soon!
- Bye-bye!

146
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:14,140
Bye-bye!

147
00:12:56,745 --> 00:13:01,687
"It's going away. Now it's good."

148
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,293
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

149
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:20,262
- I saw how you put away the phone.
- I do that when you guys come. It feels nicer.

150
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:26,886
- What secrets are you up to on the screen? Tell me, tell me, tell me.
- What do you mean by "secrets"?

151
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,510
This was a very ugly image.

152
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:38,616
You look like Froggy Ball. Come now.
That was your punishment for hiding in here alone.

153
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:43,526
No, don't post me looking like Froggy Ball.

154
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:48,587
Come on now. The others are sitting out there reading
and having a nice time. Don't hide in here with your phone.

155
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:52,327
- I don't have the energy.
- What do you mean you don't have the energy?

156
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:54,629
I hardly slept at all last night.

157
00:13:54,695 --> 00:14:00,200
Hey, you've been out skiing a bunch
without any problem.

158
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:08,000
- You don't get energy from being on your phone, I promise.
- No, but I don't lose energy.

159
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:13,733
- What? Do you lose energy from being out here?
- Yes, because then I have to move my legs.

160
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:16,946
- You will help cook dinner.
- No, mommy...

161
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,548
- Yes.
- No.

162
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:21,250
- Yes.
- I don't want to.

163
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,878
- Yes.
- Please?

164
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:29,323
- What have you been thinking of doing?
- Lie in my room.

165
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:34,639
- No, forget that! Let's cook food, right?
- Yes, let's cook food.

166
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:40,468
Can you guys understand
that this is the last vlog of the year?

167
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,033
- No.
- No.

168
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:51,256
- Of the last days of the year.
- Yes. I mean... It's crazy, I feel like this year has flown by.

169
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,277
- I agree.
- Yes, it has gone by very quickly.

170
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,747
- What's that supposed to be?
- Mozzarella.

171
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:06,819
- It looks like a little turd, kind of.
- If your turds look like that, you have a problem.

172
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:12,272
No, they don't.
But it looks like something strange.

173
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:23,065
What's been the best thing about this year?

174
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:29,170
I think it's funny when you say...
I mean, Laura's words are probably the most fun thing.

175
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:35,581
When you say, like, "The Summer Shadow!" to her,
she gets, like...

176
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:39,348
Did you hear?
She was, like, "Gary!" (scary)

177
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:47,047
And when you say other words.
And when she farts and you go like this, she starts, like...

178
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:52,756
- When you fan your nose because it smells bad?
- Yes.

179
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:56,559
It's so fun that she has
started to understand things.

180
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,994
- Mommy?
- Do you want a hug?

181
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,103
Oh, you want to help film?
Come here.

182
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,335
I think the best part about the whole year,
if you think of things we have shown the viewers,-

183
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:13,005
-is our trip down to Málaga, and then home.

184
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:17,208
And the whole summer at home
was absolutely wonderful.

185
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:21,312
- From Portugal to Sweden, you mean?
- Yes.

186
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:29,351
I think that the best part about this year
was when we had Skara Sommarland for ourselves.

187
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:32,550
That was so much fun!

188
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:40,520
I think the best part about this year was...

189
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,496
Oops! She fell.

190
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:50,835
...the autumn in Portugal because it was so nice and warm
and we could be in the pool and such.

191
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:52,570
- Yes.
- Yes, that was cozy.

192
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:58,041
I'm surprised you said the summer in Sweden
because we did so much packing.

193
00:16:58,126 --> 00:17:03,721
- Yes, but...
- Selling a house. That was pretty tough, I think.

194
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:14,287
It was tough, but selling that house
was also a very big and welcome step for our family.

195
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:21,092
We had to do it,
and it feels so nice that we have done it now.

196
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:26,015
- I think it's time to eat.
- Yes. Now it's chaos.

197
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:57,454
We are one day closer to a new year,
and we have a fitting Question of the Day.

198
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:02,609
Yes!
What are our New Year's resolutions?

199
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:09,297
- My New Year's resolution is to learn to snowboard.
- Oh, good!

200
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:16,112
- My New Year's resolution is to learn division.
- Okay, math. Good!

201
00:18:16,236 --> 00:18:23,351
Laura fell asleep when we sat down here to film.
And she's a little too young for a resolution.

202
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:28,613
My resolution is to take care of my health.

203
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,782
- Oh, good!
- Make better choices in everyday life.

204
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:35,744
Yes. Mine too.

205
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:38,020
- The same?
- Yes, the same.

206
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:42,323
What are your New Year's resolutions?

207
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,794
Comment down below!

208
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,631
And remember to be kind to yourself.
No one should change.

209
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,832
- No.
- No.

210
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,750
- Don't be, like, "I'm gonna go on a diet and get skinny."
- No.

211
00:18:56,801 --> 00:19:00,771
- You can get better, but not change yourself.
- Yes!

212
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:06,409
Thank you for watching this video!

213
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:11,546
- Please leave a thumbs up, or down.
- Mostly thumbs up!

214
00:19:11,644 --> 00:19:15,283
Comment, ask questions
and take care until next time.

215
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:18,819
- Happy New Year!
- Bye-bye!
