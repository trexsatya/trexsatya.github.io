00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,400
Hello, Jack. Check out the video I sent.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,160
A guy has set fire to a mobile mast in England.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,040
-Why? -He thinks Corona has to do with 5g.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,760
I understand. Wait. I'll call Åsa.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,920
-Hello. -Hello. We have to do the 5G section.

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,600
Journalists Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the Viral reviewer.

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,800
Today, they run the source criticism, Sweden's national team in source criticism.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,280
Now they, together with Edwin, are doing "Källkoll Corona".

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,880
-What is 5g for something? -There are probably many who do not know.

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:05,480
5G is the fifth generation of the mobile communication network.

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,760
0G is the early mobile telephony that partially crossed the radio network.

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,000
1G was an analog mobile technology.

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,280
It worked partly through the radio tower that you called via.

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,800
2G was the first digital technology. Now we could send text messages.

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39.840
With 3G we got mobile connectivity-

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,720
-And with 4G it all got much better and faster.

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
Now a fifth generation is being expanded for a faster internet.

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,080
Just. And it's already underway here and there.

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,240
The Royal Institute of Technology has since 2018 such a network.

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02.600
Experiments are ongoing in the Stockholm suburb of Enskede.

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,160
In Switzerland, too, they have started to expand.

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09.600
But in Switzerland people have demonstrated and protested.

23
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,280
People are afraid of 5G and this radiation you imagine.

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,600
Empty. Here in Sweden, people have protested and demonstrated.

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,440
You manage three to four days under the same conditions ...

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,000
5G is a safe technology. There is a scientific consensus about it.

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
Authorities engaged in radiation-

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35.560
-The checks on scientific reports.

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,000
So far the researchers have not encountered any health risks-

30
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,200
-To long you stay below the limit values.

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,400
The limit values are set so that one really should be protected-

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,520
-mot all secured risks by a good margin.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,080
A friend sent this picture.

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,880
They are worried that 5G has to do with Corona.

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,160
It is alleged that the Spanish sickness came with the radio network expansion-

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07.600
-And Sars came with 3G and that now Corona comes with 5G.

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,320
I have looked at it and it is completely basic.

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,320
It's not that the technology and the virus have to do with each other.

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,240
A British scientist named Adam Finn-

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,440
-while research on infectious diseases and vaccine-

41
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,280
-To-pointed that this comparing viruses and mobile technology-

42
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35.560
-As like comparing apples and Finnish ferries - "chalk and cheese".

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,200
The timeline is strange, logical.

44
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,080
You do not mention the great flu that killed a million people ...

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,040
... 1889-1890.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Then there were no radio networks that could be guilty.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,000
Therefore, you may not mention that flu, even though you should.

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,200
Spanish sickness in 1918 occurred at the same time as First World War-

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,000
-When people were packed in dirty trenches.

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,240
Perhaps it had more to do with the spread of infection.

51
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,560
Just. If 3G and 4G networks triggered influenza in 2003 and 2009-

52
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,440
-Is it strange that it has not continued so that everyone is sick even-

53
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,040
-The nets are implemented everywhere.

54
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,960
One thing is certain: people don't like invisible things.

55
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,680
We don't like ghosts - invisible. We don't like viruses - invisible.

56
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,360
We don't like radiation - invisible. It has always been so.

57
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,760
Edwin, are you afraid of a microwave?

58
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,800
-No. -A time, people were there.

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,000
In the 1980s, a hiking path circulated about a chef.

60
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02.040
He had fallen dead in his kitchen where he worked.

61
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08.040
At autopsy it was found that his intestines had been boiled-

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,000
-To he had stood next to a microwave that was running.

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,320
Now, 40 years later, people are still afraid of these things.

64
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,880
Then it was microwave. Now it's 5g.

65
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,480
With this logic there is another thing one could be afraid for-

66
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,320
-for example. The remote control.

67
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay. New technology and new diseases always scare us.

68
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,880
-Now it's 5g and Corona. -In so simple.

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,600
-Okay. Thanks, corner. -Hello Hello.

70
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,160
-Coffee? -Yes. Coffee.

71
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,160
-Coffee. -Coffee.

72
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52.080
