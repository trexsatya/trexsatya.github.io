00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.080
Today we will talk about women and their crises.

2
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.360
Was life that you had hoped?
 Did you get married right ...

3
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.120
The c. sound phone rings

4
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.240
Svensson.
 Hello Sara.
 Thanks.

5
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.080
40 years, yes ... side change Gustav calls it - page change and sub -40-0.

6
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:21.200
He is thick, yes ... yet he dances belly dance when he drinks too much.

7
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.760
Here he comes.
 It looks like he is trying to focus his eyes.

8
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.920
Come over late.
 Bye.

9
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.120
This is the kitchen.
 I'm your wife ... Lena.

10
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.480
Good morning yourself.
 Sara called and thanked the entertainment ...

11
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.280
I must have eaten something inappropriate yesterday.

12
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.200
It may have been the flower soil.
 Why do you have to be like this at parties?

13
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.840
I'm Swedish.
 In Sweden we have to drink liquor to have fun.

14
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.640
My 40th birthday you celebrated with dancing belly dance to my managers.

15
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.280
Nobody thinks of things like that when it's a party.

16
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.800
If you're looking for trouble you've come to the right place ...

17
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:39.320
Sorry!
 It must be an adult's right to have a drink.

18
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.120
A drink?
 You drank directly from the trunk bowl.

19
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.600
- Is the dad who has cleaned up?
 - We help like a real family.

20
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.600
In real families you drink glass.

21
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.720
- No one asks how I feel.
 - No one dares.

22
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.840
It's meant to think about what I have done to my life.

23
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.120
You should not believe everything you read.
 Imagine if you believed all about Björn Borg!

24
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.760
Not words about Björn Borg!
 Björn Borg is just a underwear!

25
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.520
- Five straight Wimbledon!
 - "Six open French."

26
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.720
- Bear Borg is more than a underwear!
 -Certainly.
 Treasury.

27
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.680
- I regret it more than something else.
 - Serve it when he can hear it.

28
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.680
That I stopped exercising.
 I was about to become a figure skater.

29
00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.440
The coaches thought I could go as far as possible.

30
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.240
When I swirled out on the ice, I felt free and strong and beautiful.

31
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.880
- I could have become someone!
 - But then dad came ...

32
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.800
Have you never dreamed of anything bigger, something alive?

33
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.280
Something that really means something!

34
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.120
I'll take a walk.

35
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.160
-Did you have any 40-year crisis?
 - With this body?
 Never!

36
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.800
... but nice ridges have it.

37
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.960
A whole Trave European parliamentarian says ...

38
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.760
Can you help me?
 I am not a cleaning lover.

39
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.760
You are a belly dancer.

40
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:18.480
- When she comes, it will be nice!
 - You missed a grain of dust under TV - n.

41
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.080
-Where have you been?
 - In the ice rink.
 It was figure skating.

42
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.200
Max and Lina, don't make the same mistake as me.

43
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.600
Find your dream and stick to it!

44
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.600
So it should look!
 Everything works only you dare.

45
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.200
-Where are you going?
 - To Nymans and watch TV.

46
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.200
-What should we do?
 - I usually run with valium.

47
00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.760
- I was the best in the group as a 11 -year -old.
 - I was best at pissing the highest.

48
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.040
There was nothing particular of me anyway.

49
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:13.320
Life rushes past and you walk around in a ridiculous hat ...

50
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.240
I try to lighten the mood.

51
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.120
-Do you love me?
 - It is clear that I love you.

52
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.680
We have a whole life together.
 The kids, the summer cottage ...

53
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:40.560
... bank loans, interest rates, amortization, insurance premiums, ICA cards ...

54
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.120
Sorry I tried to spread some joy!

55
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.440
-Hello!
 Is the ice princess inside?
 - She's up there ... and sour.

56
00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.480
Why do women become so sensitive just because they turn 40?

57
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:09.080
No one cared about me then.
 But I'm a man.
 I have no feelings.

58
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.080
We are different.
 Do you remember when I turned 30?

59
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:22.400
- You called the fire brigade in the middle of the night.
 - I needed to feel that someone was listening.

60
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:30.400
- During the time Olsson's house burned down ... –Lena needs some romance.

61
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:37.800
- The song you sang ... - "It's nice to shit in deep snow"?

62
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:45.480
- It might not be quite right.
 - I have sung at every party!

63
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:52.280
- It's tradition!
 - But Lena needs to be surprised.

64
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.000
You may find something new.

65
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.920
We could start tipping systems ...

66
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.400
- Now I go to Lena.
 -At your own risk.

67
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:14.640
It's me - Sara.
 I am unarmed.
 I don't want anything bad.

68
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:23.720
C.Sangly is to shit in meter -depth snow no, it does not work.
 She is right.

69
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.880
How is it?

70
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.880
- How do men work?
 - No further, unfortunately.

71
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.800
What do you think love is for Gustav?

72
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.880
World Cup 1974. Ralf Edström's 4-2 goal against Germany.

73
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:55.640
I want him to love me.
 Not Björn Borg, not the trunk bowl.
 ME.

74
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.640
You should be able to compete out.

75
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:08.440
He could well surprise me sometime with a flower, a kiss, a trip ...

76
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.840
- Has he really never done that?
 -No.

77
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.960
Well, before he was really fun sometimes.

78
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.920
He would teach mom drink snaps.

79
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:31.360
She ran around the neighborhood in just the panties and sang "Que Sera Sera" ...

80
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:39.160
- Gustav ran after and filmed.
 - What a beautiful memory ...

81
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.240
He was so nice.
 He was so romantic.

82
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.800
- What says Lina and Max?
 -Nothing.
 They are with Nymans.

83
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:57.560
Life may be passing them too.
 They do not know how fast it goes.

84
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:05.040
An error cut when you are eleven years old, and the ice princess becomes a postman's wife.

85
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:11.840
Have you heard the story of the giant pad and the butterfly?

86
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.520
The toad was in love with a butterfly but he never came close to it.

87
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:27.160
- The butterfly was up in the air.
 - Is Gustav or I the giant pad?

88
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:34.960
It does not matter!
 Do you know what he did to reach the butterfly?

89
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:42.680
He jumped.
 He missed the butterfly, landed on the asphalt and burst.

90
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:52.520
- What a horrifying history.
 - Yes, but he dared to jump!

91
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:58.960
- You want to jump too?
 - No, I really don't want to!

92
00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:06.240
Greet the giant pad down there that it is his turn to jump now!

93
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.360
-Who are you?
 -I am death.

94
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:18.400
- Are you coming to pick me up?
 - I have long gone by your side.

95
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.840
- How long will she be up there?
 - Till we show that we love her.

96
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.640
Then I starve to death.
 You get to cook!

97
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.640
-Why me?
 - Because I'm a man and you're a woman.

98
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:44.360
You'll never be a man.
 At its height a mopedist.

99
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:51.360
- Here is the ticket to the family peace!
 –Ditt wills?

100
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.960
We should show mom that we love her - surprise her!

101
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:06.240
- Should you change socks?
 - First, we will do something together.

102
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:13.680
Here is the recipe for Tournedos a la Gustav.

103
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.480
The first thing I invited to your mom.

104
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:26.280
I had put priestly collapses all over the dashboard on the folk car bus.

105
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:33.920
I kept the food warm on the engine block.
 I want to recall that moment.

106
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.760
- First look, first kiss ... - first stomach dance ...

107
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:47.160
- Can't you help me?
 - Everything for love!

108
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.360
He is hungry ... It is clear that we will help you.

109
00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.720
- But then came!
 - Do you think it's free?

110
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.440
Should you have money to show some love?!

111
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.080
No money - no love.

112
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:19.680
- We can also go!
 - Hundred bucks.
 You do what I ask you.

113
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.320
–200 ... and we clean the downstairs.
 -Okay okay.

114
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:33.280
- I run and buy food.
 - Do not glue to buy a new folk bus!

115
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:40.080
–50 to you and 150 to me.
 -Yes.
 No ... huh?

116
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.320
- What do we say when she comes?
 - Hello fucking stew!

117
00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.160
Well ... try something more romantic.

118
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:12.320
-Have you seen!
 Is everything ready now, Max?
 - Yes, now we are just waiting for Madame.

119
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.080
She comes.
 I said you loved her.

120
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:23.320
- Did she go on it?
 - I certainly love your mom.
 Quiet now!

121
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:31.280
- Do you do my mom go on this?
 - I have been a lot of fun in my day ...

122
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.520
You scrubbed Grandpa's roof for him to like you more.

123
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:43.440
-It worked.
 I had to borrow the drill.
 - hire it.

124
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:50.000
- Have you tried to be yourself?
 -Once.
 There were 20 stitches.

125
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.000
In your places!

126
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.600
Stand in a row!

127
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:18.440
Welcome!
 To the woman of my life - Tournedos a la Gustav.

128
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:26.280
- Dad has a sense of raw materials.
 - Just the best is good enough for you.

129
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:33.920
- Be so good and there, honey.
 - Don't you recognize the food?

130
00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:41.480
- A pathetic evening 15 years ago ... - "poetic", max.

131
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.200
Two young people with life ahead of them ...

132
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:53.920
I didn't know what the future looked like - just with whom I wanted to share it.

133
00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:00.920
We raise a bowl for the world's most beautiful 40 -year -old.

134
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:07.920
- Lena Olin!
 - If you put her next to you ...

135
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.040
--... then you take Lena Olin.
 - Max!

136
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.560
The first time I saw you mom -

137
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:22.400
- I decided that she was the nicest I've seen.

138
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.360
- I still think so!
 - Mom, you start.

139
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.320
I've been a real bag of shit.

140
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:39.200
- A big, stinking heap ... - we actually eat.

141
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:46.680
- Sen is dishes Lina and I.
 - So you two may be for yourself.

142
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:53.640
- Have you been bribed?
 - Do you do love can be purchased?

143
00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:01.040
- We just want to relieve you here at home.
 - Mom, we're your slaves.

144
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:06.640
- They have promised to clear the garden.
 -Not really.

145
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.480
- You want a mountain bike?
 -Are you threatening me?

146
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.760
- Would I threaten my son?
 -What are you talking about?

147
00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:26.000
- It is a little word play Max came on ... - We have not played any word play.

148
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.960
- Mom, I'm afraid that Dad is lying.
 - Just now I take nothing.

149
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:39.320
Great!
 Have you never played this before?
 I'm saying figs.

150
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:45.760
-What are you talking about?
 - Right again!
 - Your turn.

151
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:52.960
- This will never go.
 - Indeed!
 - Max, think about the bike ...

152
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.520
Unfortunately.
 200 bucks are too little to clear the garden.

153
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.880
Enemies everywhere.

154
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:09.520
- It was too good to be true.
 - They would set up.

155
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:15.520
- Renating garden was not included in the price.
 - You have bribed them.

156
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:22.280
- Would I try to buy feelings?
 -Yes.

157
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:30.280
Yeah?!
 Sorry so terribly much!
 I just wanted to make you a little happy.

158
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:36.560
I took the help of two traitors - two Lars Skarke!

159
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:42.560
We could be a wonderful family if we just wanted to!

160
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.600
If you had more money ...

161
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.600
Good night.

162
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:57.560
But mom, 200 bucks to clear the garden?

163
00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.440
I have a better business proposal.
 Two hours of work ...

164
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.520
Gustav ...

165
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:20.520
Do you read Björn Borg -book?
 It's good, huh?

166
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:31.360
Thanks.
 It was at least as good as 15 years ago, but less exhaust.

167
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:39.520
I had more garlic then.
 And real cream, instead of creme fraiche.

168
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:48.320
I did what I could.
 I can't replace the kids.
 Or can you?

169
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:56.520
Against Dobermann -Pinschrar ...?
 It is not your fault that it became like this.

170
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:03.040
- No, it's the children's.
 - No, that's my fault.

171
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:10.720
Life has gone so fast.
 I just lived in Vivalla and played hide and seek.

172
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.720
When I had finished, I was 40.

173
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.000
- Where have all the years taken?
 - POFF.

174
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.720
It felt strange to come to the ice rink ... aj!

175
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.760
Happy birthday darling!

176
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:39.240
- Gustav ... - They are completely newly sanded.

177
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.840
It's size 32. I have 38.

178
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.200
That was the size they had left.
 You can't get everything.

179
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:58.040
- The kids ... - no.
 Tonight they clean the garage.

180
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.960
-How much?
 –150 ... where.

181
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.120
They become millionaires!

182
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.680
C.Teletext.urfjarran Dad, how do you back with the car?

183
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.640
