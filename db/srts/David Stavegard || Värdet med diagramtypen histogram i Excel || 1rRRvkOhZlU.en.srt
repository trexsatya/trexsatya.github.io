00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:05.199
Welcome to this week's Thursday tip in Excel, with me David Stavegård

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.966
It's time to get started with an excel file again, and now we've been given a task

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:12.966
Make a histogram over the wage distribution This is, after all, fictional names,

4
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:16.966
fictional wages, it's just for you to see how to do histograms, you have control over

5
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.366
Take a look here you'll see ...

6
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:22.366
You simply go into info, choose statistical graphs and choose

7
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:26.366
Histogram and pang we have got it out.

8
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:30.366
Histogram works so that it collects a number of different values in groups

9
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.832
and counts how many are

10
00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:38.466
So here we have between 22,500 and 31,300

11
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:42.466
How many of the salaries are in between right -clicks you and choose add

12
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.432
Data labels, so it also calculates how many they are.

13
00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:49.433
But, it won't be that great, there will be some strange numbers here.
 Excel tried to be smart.

14
00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:53.433
You're smarter.
 That's why we drive like this.

15
00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:58.066
Right -click and select Format the shoulder, and look at options for shoulder ...

16
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:02.066
Here's a little luring: Do you see that you can scroll down here

17
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.832
It's not that often you have to do it, but if we open this a little instead.

18
00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.833
So you see the values out here from the beginning ...

19
00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:14.833
So you should get to see automatically it is Excel suggests

20
00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:20.366
Interval width, here you can say that we want an interval of SEK 3000 in salary.

21
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:25.299
Then it turns out all the intervals by 3000 in step length.

22
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.800
Or we can say number of intervals, yes, we may want 3 intervals

23
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.200
It might be a little bit, but maybe eight intervals.

24
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.833
Then it draws out how many have salary in these intervals

25
00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:41.833
Then it is like this, there are some that are at the bottom,

26
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:46.199
as we may not care about exactly where they are located, and the same

27
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.166
We may not care about them either, because it gets a little plot like that ...

28
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:54.166
So instead you can say "interval for the highest values" if we were to write

29
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:58.166
60,000 here, then it takes with everyone who is

30
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:02.666
greater than 60,000 and counts them in the same bar, and the same 'intervals for the lowest'

31
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:06.666
For example, if we say 30,000 here,

32
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:10.666
Then it takes with everyone who has up to 30000 and counts them ...

33
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:15.599
So it becomes a little easier to understand this, then you can look good for this graph litigran.

34
00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:25.466
Yes, something like this you can get then, and this is how you work with

35
00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:30.732
Histogram in Excel, it's very neat, one can change

36
00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.466
You just go in here and say how many intervals you want or

37
00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:37.466
Or what interval width you want.
 You don't just have to do this on pay, this is not just a matter of pay,

38
00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:41.466
This can do this on shoe sizes, lengths, ages, I don't know

39
00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:43.866
Go wild, simply

40
00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:47.866
My name is David Stavegård, big thanks for looking at this, we will see you next Thursday, again,

41
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.299
Just as always.
