1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,640
-What do a journalist do?
 -Writs articles and interviews.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,520
Writes about society.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,240
Interviewing people.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,760
-Writing newspapers.
 -interviews people.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,240
Interview people and write newspapers about it, kind of.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,000
It is probably the ones who investigate and write.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,480
They collect articles and things-

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,120
-To write long stuff for your company or film clips.

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,760
-Have you seen?
 -What?

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,000
Education Radio changes its name to VR.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,800
Edwin Safari says UR should change its name to VR-

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,360
-To do everything in "virtual reality".

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,880
Huh?
 Check that out.

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,440
There is nothing on UR's official accounts or from the press department.

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,320
It may not be official.
 He said it was a rumor.

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,880
-Do you feel any at UR?
 -Jack.
 I'll call him.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,520
Good, do it.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,360
-What is this, Edwin?
 -All who wonders can come.

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,240
We talk about the rumor at a press conference and start Källkoll!

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,520
-Do we not look up the rumor?
 -We have no time.
 It's a rumor.

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,840
God, now Calle calls SVT.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,600
Hey!
 Hello, Calle.
 I've just heard about it so I don't know.

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,440
A reporter?
 Ask him to attend the press conference.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,440
-Come to the press conference!
 -We'll see.
 Okay, good.
 Hello.

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,960
Calle, do you walk past the EDWIN Safari thing in the afternoon?

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,360
-It seems damn thin, right?
 -Yes, but ...

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,600
He has made a comet career as an influencer.

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,640
It may be of interest to younger.

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,240
Welcome!
 Fun that many could come when I tell-

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
-That new season of "Källkoll" gets rid of.
 In the season ...

31
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,600
-Byter out of name to VR?
 -Is it true?

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,560
Do you speak for UR in this question?

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,680
-It went like that.
 -I hope you learned something.

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,840
They just wanted to know about the name change.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,440
Journalists ask about what they think, not what you think.

36
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,160
-Are you talking to me?
 -It was a follow -up question.

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,200
The President of Finland is here.
 Ask him something!

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,920
I will, but I want to ask my follow -up question.

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,320
Are you listening?
 Ask him something!

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,680
You can do it in different ways.

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,480
Anyone who is media trained can make it deal with what it wants to talk about.

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,760
Am I not trained?
 I've been with you!

43
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,040
It is not the same to stand on TV and be pressured with questions.

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Media training is about getting difficult questions and answering well.

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,040
It has a bad reputation as it is used to seem ground-

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,600
-And when people got crazy advice.

47
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,400
The government does not comment on the wikileak documents-

48
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,440
-Then these are third -party tasks.
 Third party records.

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,160
I do not comment on the documents as there are third -party records.

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,920
He said "third party tasks" maybe 20 times.

51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,600
Sometimes the examined try to meander.
 They do not answer straight-

52
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,880
-On tries to get out of it.

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,240
As old center leader Maud Olofsson who had informed the prime minister-

54
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,080
-Fredrik Reinfeldt about a deal made by Vattenfall.

55
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,640
It was not good in the current studio when she refused to answer the question.

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Did you inform the Prime Minister about the purchase of Nuon before the deal?

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,440
The Constitutional Committee says ... partly you do not agree.

58
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,640
Did you inform the Prime Minister about the purchase before the deal?

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,440
KU is constitutional.
 Then I am too ...

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,720
-Heeds, Maud Olofsson.
 -It has been adjusted.

61
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,640
I ask the question the third time.

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,000
Did you inform the Prime Minister about the purchase before the deal?

63
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,040
It is not the most important issue.

64
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,160
It is "runajs" to be chased by journalists.
 Are there no limits?

65
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,880
There are limits.
 Journalists in Sweden work after a regulatory

66
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,240
-which prevents overtramping.

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,280
One must find yourself being reviewed as holders of power.

68
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,800
One must be able to be opposed in the general debate.

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,680
This with rules of play for journalists ...

70
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,200
We have heard with Caspar Opitz, our new media ombudsman.

71
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,640
As a media ombudsman, I make sure that TV, radio, newspapers take care of Sig-

72
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,840
-And behaves schyst.
 The rules of the game for press, radio and television are to-

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,760
-To the media to behave correctly, manage news correctly-

74
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,360
-time seek to describe the truth, be fair-

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,840
-Let everyone come to speak, be careful with human-

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,480
-What do not want to join in and behave correctly and schist.

77
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,960
If someone writes something stupid about you report it to me.

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,160
You do not have court and do with lawyers-

79
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,640
-Out you can report it to me, I look at it and help you.

80
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,920
In a self -cleaning system, the media takes care of it.

81
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,240
Newspapers, TV and radio say: "If we do anything wrong, we handle it."

82
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,400
"We don't need any politicians or courts, but we take care of it."

83
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,600
A self -cleaning system is important for democracy and the free word.

84
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,840
Media, television and newspapers should say what they want.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,080
Politicians, judges and courts should not intervene.

86
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,720
In dictatorships, the first thing that happens is to stop the free press.

87
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,400
My role in our system is to keep the legislator away-

88
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,280
-No the media.
 It is important for democracy.

89
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,720
Okay, but some don't look up what they post.

90
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,800
Not everyone follows mediaetic rules.

91
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,200
Some call themselves journalists without responsible publishers.

92
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,400
There are gossip sites that want to report rumors.

93
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,000
Just.
 But with this one cannot decide what is right or not-

94
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,160
-Os the truth can show up anywhere.

95
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,760
Gossip sites may be right and established media can be wrong-

96
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,600
-Alt if they usually get a little more.

97
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,760
So there are everything from people who gossip online-

98
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,160
-To large media houses with hundreds of employees?

99
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,120
Yes.
 I think we should go through the Swedish media map.

100
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,040
We can do that in our channel!

101
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,360
-Look!
 Fine, huh?
 -No really need some help.

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,600
No!
 It's spartan, but nice anyway.

103
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,320
Yes!
 And we have ... seven followers.

104
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,520
Oh ... I don't think I can join, actually.

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,320
-Shucks!
 Whatever.
 Let's go.
 -Yes.

106
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,280
-Time.
 -You usually divide magazines ...

107
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,960
... after when they come out.
 In the past, newspapers were all that found-

108
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
-and they came out every day, week or month.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
But now we read more online and it is a more even flow.

110
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,360
But in the past, those who were distributed every day were called daily newspapers.

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,040
Just.
 Then they divided them into the morning and evening newspapers-

112
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,400
-Or which part of the day they covered.
 Not everyone has a look at that.

113
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,920
Evening newspapers ... come out in the evening, right?

114
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,360
And morning in the morning.
 Or?

115
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,360
There may be a little different news.
 I do not know.

116
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,800
Evening newspapers in the evening, morning in the morning?

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,720
I think morning newspapers may be from the day before, kind of.

118
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,000
And evening newspaper comes from the day, or something.

119
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,960
Now the difference is perhaps mostly a style issue.

120
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,600
Evening newspapers are a bit more sniffy-

121
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,360
-While daily newspapers are a bit more fine cultural and do not take the gossip.

122
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,800
Think some.
 But evening newspapers do good excavation journalism-

123
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,200
-and real blood dog digs and digs out injustice.

124
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,520
Examples of evening newspapers: Expressen, Aftonbladet.

125
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Then we have the morning newspapers, and they, think a part-

126
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,400
-Have considered himself having finer ideals and be a little finer.

127
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,200
Examples of morning newspapers: Svenska Dagbladet, Dagens Nyheter.

128
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,680
Then we have local magazines.

129
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,320
There, for example, we have the Barometer in Småland or Västerbottencuriren.

130
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,720
There it can get cranky, when people expect national news-

131
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,680
-On a local newspaper website and read about a plastic bag that is burning.

132
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,680
Just.
 It is meant that local magazines-

133
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,160
-Do cover the little life in the local community.

134
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,720
Then local magazines are very good at the local angle.

135
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,440
Do you remember the Skellefteå scarf guy?

136
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,840
In the middle of the crowd he stood, among thousands of other-

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,080
-With helmet, outstretched arms, and then that red scarf.

138
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,000
In Sweden, on top of all that-

139
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,680
-The we have SVT and Sweden's Radio with national news and local editors.

140
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,040
And so all magazines that can be about all-

141
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,040
-From hunting and fishing to sports and exercise.

142
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,680
Absolutely.
 And on top of that we have all sites online.

143
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,120
Surely it was the Swedish media landscape?

144
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
-Bra clips!
 -Hello!

145
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,280
You forgot to say how many journalists there are in Sweden.

146
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,280
-You usually say fourteen.
 -But then not all news reporters.

147
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,760
But if not, what do the others do?

148
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,800
In addition to going to a press conference and asking the wrong questions to me.

149
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,600
We do this: We call one.
 - Hi Fouad.

150
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,480
My friend has some questions about journalists.

151
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,160
How does a journalist know what is right or not?

152
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,840
We don't always know that.
 We have to find out.

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,640
There are slightly different ways.
 I usually contact authorities-

154
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,280
-and ask them to send me paper, because on them maybe it says things-

155
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,960
-What confirms something I think.

156
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,720
But sometimes you may need to talk to many people.

157
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,520
If a person says one thing one cannot always trust it-

158
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,480
-But about two, three, or four people say the same thing-

159
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,720
-Can you guess what they say is true.

160
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,320
Right.
 Where do you get your tips from?

161
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,360
We get tips everywhere.

162
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,480
Above all people who hear from themselves-

163
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,560
-If things they think works less well in society and so on.

164
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,680
But companies and organizations often send press releases-

165
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,040
-To journalists when they want to tell about something good that has happened.

166
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,520
There are two of the places.
 Then I usually dig a little-

167
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,280
-In the archives of the authorities among paper and decisions taken by politicians.

168
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,560
I think that is a way to find things that are exciting.

169
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,680
He seemed to be sway.
 But he said that journalists are not always popular.

170
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,000
No, as he said, if journalists are and root and pee in things-

171
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,960
-And asks if such people don't want to answer.

172
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,960
Then journalists are also people with faults and shortcomings.

173
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,680
But then it is important that the corrections are highlighted and so on.

174
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,080
But some may not think that corrections get the place they would have-

175
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,920
-And that journalists are bad at admitting wrong.

176
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,120
And so there are cases where it has completely derailed.

177
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,040
For example.
 German journalist Claas Relotius.

178
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,440
He won many awards for his journalism.

179
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,000
Now it turns out that he found most things.

180
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,400
He has mostly worked for Der Spiegel, but has also been published abroad.

181
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,200
And almost all his reports are fictional.

182
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,040
So embarrassing!
 He has worked at huge story-

183
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,200
-And had started to fake things and find details.

184
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,760
Some colleagues had no idea and tried to warn the managers ...

185
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,360
-. but they didn't listen.
 -It became a splendor scandal.

186
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,480
They would have listened.

187
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,480
The magazine had to do about a lot, they had to check all he wrote-

188
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,640
-To see if it is correct and about how they handle news control.

189
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,440
Yes.
 And Edwin?
 So it can end if you spread rumors.

190
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,200
Yeah ... yeah ..

191
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,440
Hello?
 Now this rumor I spread has spread ...

192
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,440
And that it will start "Källkoll" again!
 Yes, you see.

193
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,400
It is negative attention, but still attention.

194
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,760
This is how we come from seven to seven hundred thousand followers.

195
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,360
Join my channel.
 I'll show you how to do this.
