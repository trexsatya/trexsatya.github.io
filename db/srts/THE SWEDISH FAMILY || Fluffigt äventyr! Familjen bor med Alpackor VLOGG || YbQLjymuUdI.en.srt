1
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,477
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:16,250
We have driven for almost 1.5 hours from Stockholm.
We are on our way to Sala and a farm that has...

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,019
Alpacas! 

4
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:24,176
They are such fun and sweet animals
that I didn't even know existed in Sweden.

5
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:25,156
Me neither.

6
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:29,149
We haven't had any plans
for this winter holiday. 

7
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:36,075
The other day I saw an ad in the paper for
"Norrängen's Alpaca farm and boutique hotel".

8
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:40,627
It seemed really fun,
so I called them.

9
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,779
I got to speak with Paul,
the Englishman who runs it.

10
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:50,351
He has 65 alpacas
and five hotel rooms.

11
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:57,017
None of the rooms are booked for today,
so we will be the only guests there.

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:05,927
We don't really know what to expect, except that
we will get to be close to alpacas and other animals.

13
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:09,170
- How fun?!
- Really fun!

14
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,668
- It's actually going to be super exciting!
- Yes.

15
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,715
- There they are!
- Wow!

16
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:29,160
We saw this animal in New Zealand. 
They're so beautiful. They're like little camels.

17
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:35,170
- They remind me of sheep.
- Yes, they're all fluffy.

18
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:38,871
- Hey!
- Hello! Welcome to Norrängen's Alpaca.

19
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:39,688
Thank you.

20
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:44,608
- Shall we look at some alpacas together?
- Yes! We'd love to.

21
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:50,808
Let's go in here.
They are really sweet.

22
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:03,357
Here we have Tahini, Tahiti, Pharoah,
and Spotify over there, with the spots.

23
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:07,027
Follow me. Let's feed them.

24
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:14,777
You guys can go with Marta.
I'll just go and feed them over here.

25
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,718
- They have such thick fur.
- It's so that they'll survive the winter.

26
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:29,166
- It's so cozy.
- Look, they're coming.

27
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:35,511
Here, take some pellets
in both hands. Good!

28
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,377
Good boy!

29
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,754
It tickles!

30
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:51,005
It tickles! Be nice.

31
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:55,597
- Here they come.
- Ohwee! They're hungry.

32
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:59,013
Daddy, look at me.

33
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,353
Do you want more pellets?

34
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:08,188
- Have you got a girlfriend, Harry?
- No, I don't have a girlfriend.

35
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:12,232
- God, they're so cozy.
- That one is really sweet.

36
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:20,000
- I think they're super cute!
- I know, they are!

37
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:28,809
Now we are on our way
to go and look at the foals... the baby alpacas.

38
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:34,034
You can't feed them.
They're not very friendly.

39
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:41,021
They haven't really learned to trust people yet,
but they're very cute.

40
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:47,849
Look, there are bunnies here.
Alma will get cuteness overload.

41
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:51,765
It's good if you
hold on to the carrot.

42
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:57,171
If you let go of it,
they will take it and run away with it.

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,912
- You can join them, if you want.
- You can have a carrot as well.

44
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,513
- Is it soft?
- Really soft.

45
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:11,852
- Yummy, yummy, yummy...
- It's "Little Frisky". (from Bamse)

46
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:17,091
Oh no!
Little Frisky!

47
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,465
- Shall I get it for you?
- No, it's okay.

48
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:26,117
He can have the whole carrot.
Or should he? Yeah...

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,250
- This is your dream place.
- Yes, I love bunnies. They're so cute!

50
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,104
This is the cutest one.

51
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:46,381
- Here we have Marshmallow. You can pet him.
- Marshmallow!

52
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,720
You can come in here.

53
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:58,339
He spoke a bit, did you hear?
Come in and close the gate.

54
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,978
Hi.

55
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:14,348
It sounds so funny.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,397
Do you want food?

57
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:31,271
He's really interested in you, Harry.

58
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:39,006
He really likes Harry!

59
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:46,013
These alpacas were born in July,
so they are babies.

60
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:57,988
- Let's go to the next stop... if they let me out.
- Right! You might have to stay here.

61
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:11,731
Now we're going to meet llamas. It's like a zoo.
Do you know what this is?

62
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:13,841
No.

63
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:20,000
It's definitely not an animal -
it's a pool... in the summer.

64
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:25,319
- It's a pool in the winter as well.
- Yes, but then it's not open.

65
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:34,811
- See that the llamas are much taller than the alpacas?
- Yes.

66
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:39,298
Oh...

67
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:58,018
Now we are going for a walk with alpacas,
so we're here to get two of them to take for a walk.

68
00:06:58,387 --> 00:06:59,994
So fun!

69
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:06,129
- Are you going to have one on a leash, Harry?
- Yes.

70
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:12,436
Harry just said
that he wants one with fluffy cheeks.

71
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,840
We will see if she chooses one
with fluffy cheeks.

72
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:42,963
How was the walk?

73
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,841
- Good!
- Fun!

74
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:48,962
- What are their names?
- This is Gideon.

75
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:53,293
This is Freedom. Cool name!

76
00:08:53,608 --> 00:09:01,842
- Are they nice?
- Yes. Super duper duper duper duper... nice!

77
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:04,794
Would you like
one each as a pet?

78
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,483
- Yes!
- Yes!

79
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,515
Jinx!

80
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:11,725
What do you say - alpacas at the cabin?

81
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:18,154
I'd love to! We just need permission to put up a fence,
then we can have a few alpacas.

82
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:25,307
I was told that you can have up to eight alpacas
without any restrictions.

83
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:27,898
Shall we? Yes?

84
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:32,606
- The worst thing is that you're serious. I know you!
- Of course!

85
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:40,714
I see how our garden could be open
and grazed and freed from all the tall grass...

86
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,009
The alpacas
could make it really nice.

87
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:51,613
The smoke over there
is from the hot tub we'll bathe in later.

88
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,261
They're heating it up for us.
It takes three hours.

89
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:03,670
- Oh, how cute!
- Really nice.

90
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,390
- Oh, wow!
- What's this?

91
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:16,797
Oh, Alma...
You found the sofa right away.

92
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:24,357
- It's hard to miss with these pillows.
- Alpaca pillows! Oh, my God.

93
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:31,631
Check out this one! It's a little pig, right?
Or is it an alpaca? Who knows.

94
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:38,813
It's an apartment! Really cute.
Here's the little kitchen.

95
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:42,288
The entryway.

96
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:47,514
And here's the bathroom.

97
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,496
It looks brand new.

98
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:59,290
Oh, it's very nice and fresh...
with a bunch of cozy spa stuff.

99
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:04,698
- Who will sleep in here?
- We will.

100
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:08,717
- Anyone want to sleep up under the ceiling?
- Nah...

101
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:10,837
- I do.
- You do?

102
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,839
- Yes.
- I don't. 

103
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,677
And here... is my and Axel's bedroom.

104
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:21,444
- What a cozy bed!
- Is the bed comfy?

105
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:24,813
Super cozy.

106
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,152
Nice!

107
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:33,324
Now let's go and eat.

108
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:49,509
It's so nice because they have all the licenses
and they have an English pub here in the barn.

109
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,320
Here's our menu.

110
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:59,723
You can look through these holes...
and no one sees you're looking at them!

111
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:02,518
Got you!

112
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:07,694
- What are you doing, Alma?
- I'm looking through the menu.

113
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:14,033
Oh, there's a little hole here
so Alma looked through it.

114
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:18,171
You can spy on people.
How funny.

115
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,343
Look at these toasts.

116
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:30,199
Here's our starter.
"Skagen alpaca toast" and mozzarella salad.

117
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:35,000
Harry, can I please have Bregott?
(a spreadable butter)

118
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,956
Absolutely.

119
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:43,070
You're putting Bregott on your toasts?
You two don't understand the good in life.

120
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,864
How is it, Joanna?

121
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:56,669
It's amazing!
We got to feed them alone this morning.

122
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:02,008
It's such an experience. I'm just smiling.
They make you happy!

123
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:08,536
Yes, they're so cute and sweet!
And unusual.

124
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:25,738
Alma is with the bunnies, and Harry is playing
with the kids who live here at the farm.

125
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:30,709
And we are packing
because it's almost time to leave.

126
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:37,243
Yes, it's almost a little sad.
But, God, what a special place!

127
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,715
Super cool.

128
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:46,853
You can really tell that the family that runs this -
especially Paul, the dad - they love these animals!

129
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,185
He's so knowledgeable.

130
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:57,030
You don't just get to pet and feed animals -
we have learned a lot about alpacas.

131
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:03,303
- Yes. I really didn't think that would happen.
- No.

132
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:13,441
This is so typical of Alma.
She has brought four plushies for one night.

133
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,336
But there is something
about kids and animals. I mean...

134
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:26,505
When they've been around here on the farm...
they get so calm and harmonic.

135
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:31,197
- It's like there's always something to do.
- Yes.

136
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:40,464
When they felt bored, they could just go and look at
the bunnies or the alpacas or... some other animal.

137
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:43,810
Kids and animals belong together.

138
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,831
We don't want pets
as long as we live in the city.

139
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:50,716
However, when we move to a house,
then we have promised Alma and Harry...

140
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:54,020
...then we'll get a pet.

141
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:59,025
Harry and Alma,
who do you have there?

142
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:05,355
- This is Gideon and...
- This is Freedom.

143
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,887
They're super cute!

144
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:14,340
Thank you for watching this video!

145
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:18,845
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

146
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:23,396
Comment, ask questions
and take care until next time.

147
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,197
- Mostly thumbs up!
- Bye-bye!
