00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:09,477
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:16,250
We have been running for almost 1.5 hours from Stockholm.
 We are on our way to Sala and a farm that has ...

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,019
Alpacas!

4
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:24,176
They are very fun and fun animals that I didn't even know existed in Sweden.

5
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:25,156
Neither do I.

6
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:29,051
We have sports holidays and we have not had any plans for this promise.

7
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:32,324
I browsed the newspaper the other day and saw an ad:

8
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,036
"Norrängens Alpackagård and Boutique Hotell".

9
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:40,627
- I thought this was fun, and then I called.
 - (Harry) Yes!

10
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:44,779
I got to talk to Paul, the Englishman who runs it.

11
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,368
- He has 65 alpacas ... - (Harry) Oh!

12
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,518
... and five hotel rooms.

13
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:57,017
But, today no one else has booked, so we will be the only guests there.

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:05,766
We don't really know what we have to wait, except that we will get close to alpacas and other animals.

15
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:09,170
- How fun?!
 - Great fun!

16
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,668
- It should actually be super exciting!
 - Yes.

17
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,715
- There they are!
 - Wow!

18
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:24,229
We saw these animals in New Zealand.

19
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,160
They are so beautiful.
 They are like small camels.

20
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:35,170
- They are reminiscent of sheep.
 - Yes they do.
 Quite furry.

21
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:38,871
- Hello!
 - Hello Hello!
 Welcome to Norrängens alpaca.

22
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:39,688
Thanks!

23
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:44,608
- Should we look at some alpacas together?
 - Yes!
 Love to.

24
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:50,808
Should we go in to these?
 They are very nice, these.

25
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:03,357
Here we have Tahini, Tahiti, Pharoah and Spotify over there, he is speckled.

26
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:07,027
Follow me.
 We can stand here and feed them a little.

27
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:12,405
If you go with Marta there.
 I'll just go here and feed them.

28
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:15,928
Good, you can follow Marta.

29
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,718
- They have such thick fur.
 - It's for them to do the winter.

30
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:29,166
- It's so cuddly.
 - Check out, now they come!

31
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:35,756
Here you can take some pellets and feed them.
 Take in both hands.
 Great!

32
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,377
Good boy!

33
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:45,460
Oh, it's tickle!

34
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:50,613
It tickles!
 Please.

35
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:55,597
- Oh, now they come.
 - Oh oh oh.
 They are hungry.

36
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:59,013
(Harry) Dad, check out me!

37
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,353
Do you want more pellets?

38
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:08,188
- Have you got a girlfriend, Harry?
 - No!
 I dont have a girlfriend.

39
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:12,232
- God, what cozy.
 - Whoever comes now is very nice.

40
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:20,000
- I think they are super cute!
 - I know, they are!

41
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:28,809
Now we are on our way to look at the foals ... the little alpacas.

42
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:34,034
They can't feed.
 They are not so friendly.

43
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:41,021
They have not learned to trust people really yet, but they are very cute.

44
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:47,849
Look, here are rabbits.
 Alma will get a sweet shock!

45
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:51,966
It's good if you hold that carrot,-

46
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:57,171
-For if you release it, they take it and run away with it.

47
00:03:57,745 --> 00:04:02,912
- You can go to them if you want.
 - You also get a carrot.

48
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,513
- Is it soft?
 - Great.

49
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:11,852
- Oh, good, good, good, good!
 - It's little shot.

50
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:17,091
Oh no!
 What does it do the little one?
 Little shot!

51
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,465
- (Alma) Should I take it out for you?
 - No it is OK.

52
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:26,117
He can get the whole, right?
 Should he get the whole?
 Yes...

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,250
- This is your dream place.
 - Yes, I love rabbits.
 Oh, they are so cute!

54
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,104
(Harry) This one is the cutest.

55
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:46,381
- Here we have marshmallow, he can pat.
 - Marshmallow!

56
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:52,117
- You can come in here.
 - (the alpaca “grimy” a little)

57
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:58,339
He talked a little, did you hear?
 Come in and close the gate.

58
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,978
(Harry) Hello.

59
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:14,348
What fun it sounds.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,397
Do you want food?

61
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:31,271
He is really interested in you, Harry.

62
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:39,006
He really likes Harry!

63
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:46,013
These alpacas were born in July, so they are babies.

64
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:57,988
- Now let's move on ... if I get released.
 - Yes exactly!
 You may be allowed to stay here.

65
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:11,731
Now we will meet Lamor.
 It's like a whole zoo!
 Do you know what this is?

66
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:13,841
- No.
 - No.

67
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:20,000
It's absolutely no animal - it's a pool ... in the summer.

68
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:25,319
- It's a pool in the winter too.
 - Yes, but then it is not open.

69
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:33,028
Do you see that the lambs are much longer than the alpacas?

70
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:34,811
- Yes.
 - Yes.

71
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,714
- (the animals “grimy”) - oh ... (laughter)

72
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,214
- (the animals “grimy” further) - (laughter)

73
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:55,113
Now we're going to go for a walk with alpacas, so we'll pick up two pieces as we ...-

74
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,994
-.. with which we should go for a walk with.
 It will be great fun!

75
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:05,392
- Should you have one on a leash, Harry?
 - Yes.

76
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:12,436
Harry just said he wanted one with fluffy cheeks.

77
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,840
We'll see if she selects someone with fluffy cheeks.

78
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:42,963
How was the walk?

79
00:08:42,963 --> 00:08:44,841
- Good!
 - Funny!

80
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:48,962
- What are the alpacas you have joined?
 - Here we have Gideon.

81
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:53,293
Here we have Freedom.
 Cool name!

82
00:08:53,608 --> 00:09:01,842
- are they please?
 -Yes, super-duper-duper duper ... please!

83
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:04,794
Would you like each alpaca as a pet?

84
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,483
- Yes!
 - Yes!

85
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,515
Smurf!

86
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:11,725
What do you say - alpacas at the country place?

87
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:17,958
Love to!
 We just have to put up a fence first, ask for permission from the municipality, so we can have some alpacas.

88
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:25,031
I was told that you can have up to eight pieces without any restrictions.

89
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:27,898
Should we get?
 Yes?

90
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:32,606
- The worst thing is that you are serious too.
 I know you!
 - Yes Yes.
 Certainly.

91
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:40,714
I see how our garden can be open and drooling and getting rid of all the tall grass and ...

92
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,009
It can be very nice of the alpacas.

93
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:51,613
It smokes over there.
 It is the hot tub that we will swim in later.

94
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,261
They keep on warming it.
 It takes three hours.

95
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:03,670
- Oh, what a cute!
 - Very nice.

96
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,390
- Oh, wow!
 - (Harry) What is this?

97
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:16,797
Oh, Alma ... you found directly on the sofa.

98
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:24,357
- It's hard to miss with these pillows.
 - Alpacka pillows!
 Oh my God!

99
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:31,631
Oh, check out this!
 Surely it is a little pig?
 Or is it an alpaca?
 I do not know.

100
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:38,813
It's an apartment!
 Great.
 Here we have the little kitchen.

101
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:42,288
And then the hall where we came in.

102
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:47,514
And so we have the bathroom.

103
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,496
It looks completely new.

104
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:58,506
Oh, how fresh it was ... with a lot of cozy spa stuff.

105
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:02,257
Who should sleep in here, then?

106
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:04,331
- We.
 - We.

107
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:08,668
- Does anyone want to sleep up there under the roof?
 - Well.

108
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:10,837
- I want.
 - Do you want that?

109
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,839
- Yes.
 - Not me.

110
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,677
And here ... Mitt and Axel's bedroom.

111
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:21,444
- What a cozy bed!
 - Was it a nice bed?

112
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:24,519
Super cozy.

113
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,152
Fine!

114
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:33,324
Now we will go and check out.

115
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:49,509
It is so wonderful because they have full rights and they have an English pub here in the barn.

116
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,320
Here is our menu.

117
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:59,723
You can look through the holes here ... and no one sees that you are looking at them!

118
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:02,665
Got you!
 (I got you there!)

119
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:07,572
- What are you doing, Alma?
 - I look in the menu.

120
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:14,033
Well, it's a small hole here so Alma looked through it.

121
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:18,171
You can spy on people.
 How fun.

122
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:22,343
So, check out these breads.

123
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:30,199
Here is our starter.
 A little "Skagen-Alpacka-Toast" and mozzarella salad.

124
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:36,956
- (Alma) Harry, could I get Bregott?
 - Absolutely.

125
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:42,727
You do not understand the good of life that has bregott on the sandwich.

126
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,864
How does it feel, Joanna?

127
00:13:51,982 --> 00:13:56,669
It is fantastic!
 We had to go in ourselves here in the morning and feed them.

128
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:02,008
It's such an experience!
 I just stand and smile.
 You will be happy with them!

129
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:08,536
(Alma) Yes, they are so cute and nice.
 And unusual.

130
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:25,738
Alma is with the rabbits and Harry plays with the children who live here in the yard.

131
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:30,709
And we pack because it is time to leave.

132
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:37,243
Yes, almost a bit boring, that is.
 But, God, what a special place!

133
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,715
Super cool.

134
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:46,853
It is really noticeable that the family who drive this - especially Paul, the father - they love these animals!

135
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,185
But then, he knows so much.

136
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:57,030
You do not come here and just have to pat and feed animals, but ... We have learned a lot about alpacas.

137
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:03,303
- Yes.
 I really hadn't thought it would happen.
 - No.

138
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:12,559
This is so typically Alma.
 She has four toys with her for one night.

139
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,336
But there is something about children and animals.
 In other words...

140
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:26,505
When they have been around here in the yard ... they become so calm and harmonious.

141
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:31,197
- It's like there is always something to do.
 - Yes.

142
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:40,464
It's going for half an hour: "I have nothing to do. I go and look at the rabbits or the alpacas or ... any other animal."

143
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:43,810
Children and animals are also connected.

144
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,831
We don't want pets as long as we live in town.

145
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:50,716
But when we move to houses, then we have promised Alma and Harry ...

146
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:54,020
Then it becomes pet.

147
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:59,025
Harry and Alma, who do you have there?

148
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:05,355
- Here we have Gideon and there ... - we have ... Freedom.

149
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,887
Super cute!

150
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:14,340
Thanks for watching this video!

151
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:18,845
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

152
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:23,396
Comment, ask questions and have a great time and we will see you again soon!

153
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:26,197
- Give the most thumbs up!
 - Bye!
