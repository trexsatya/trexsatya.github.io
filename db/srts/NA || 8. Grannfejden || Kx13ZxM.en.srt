1
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.640
Is it so smart to go to this year's village party, Leif?

2
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.800
Of course, Billy.
 We have been there every damn year.

3
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.120
Yes, but Tony is angry because we put him there for the burglary.

4
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.840
Shit in that inbred Stockholmer.

5
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.720
There is nothing to care about.

6
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.880
Can I see?

7
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.480
c.teletext.sangc.sangju more We are together c.Sangju happier we become

8
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.320
Bowl!

9
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.960
It is a great shame that you are going to move, Tony.

10
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.400
That Sörbäcken should lose such a nice boy as you.

11
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.840
I can't stay here anymore.
 The brothers Öhman are sick in the head.

12
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.680
It may not have been easy.
 First, they had to kill your dog.

13
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.240
I have been detained twice for things I haven't done.

14
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.680
- Do you have any buyer at the house?
 - Some have been and checked.

15
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.240
Hello.
 What nice weather!

16
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.400
- Do you want to have anything?
 - A little filling is always good.

17
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.200
-Here.
 Tell me if there is anything.
 -I will.

18
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.880
Have a nice evening.

19
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.360
What the hell are you doing?
 You have your own mom to pick up?

20
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.160
Hello!

21
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.400
Hello!
 Hey.

22
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.560
Well, is it a village party, right?

23
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.160
Are you really invited to this year's party?

24
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.600
What the hell do you mean, Micke?

25
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.720
- I don't think ... - it's clear that they are invited.

26
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.880
Everyone in the village must come.
 Right?
 Of course.

27
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.360
Otherwise, they miss this whole competition that we have run.

28
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.720
- The competition like us ... - Yes, just that!
 The competition, yes.

29
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.560
It is a tradition - the acid streaming competition.

30
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.160
It'll be fun.

31
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.600
- So there!
 -What should we do?
 Eat?

32
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.720
You should eat up each jar of acid streaming on time.

33
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.280
The bun has the record in 1.30 minutes.
 There are 5,000 bucks in the pot.

34
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.680
-Are you ready?
 - We really need the money.

35
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.880
-Are you ready?
 –Yes.

36
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.360
Shall we drive?
 Drive!

37
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.320
- Hurry, Billy.
 - Good, fight!

38
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.440
Come on, Leif!
 Work hard.

39
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.440
-Working at.
 -I can not...

40
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.920
Good, Bill ... Come on.
 In with them.
 Five thousand bucks!

41
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.160
- It's just spewing up.
 Working at.
 -Clear!
 Stop time.

42
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.600
Great!
 New record time - during the minute, actually.

43
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.320
- Do we get the price?
 - The price?

44
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.280
There is no price.
 Did you think there was a price for real?

45
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.960
- Do you joke, right?
 - You are the joke.

46
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.880
Doesn't it smell damn bad here?
 - You might have to go home.

47
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.200
–What damn, the bun ...?
 - No one wants you to be here.

48
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.080
If anyone wants them to be left, you can raise a hand.

49
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.560
- No hands come up.
 - We drove your cat to the vet.

50
00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.600
- After that you had run on it, yes.
 - Tomas?

51
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.720
You killed my son's dog, accused him of poaching -

52
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.400
- And put him there for burglary.

53
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.240
Do you think there are some who want you here?

54
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.120
You can go home.
 - Now we are partying.
 We take a nub.

55
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.680
Hell!
 It still smells like crap all over the body after four showers.

56
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.720
-Oh my God!
 - It doesn't go away.

57
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.320
-What should we do?
 - Yes, Billy.
 That bastard ...

58
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.640
He has turned every one in the village against us, joking us out to everyone.

59
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.560
- It requires revenge.
 -What then?

60
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.560
- No, Leif!
 - We play them a joke.

61
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.280
This is not good.
 - Leif!

62
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:45.160
- But, Leif ... -!
 Down on the hill!
 Insect.

63
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.200
-What should you do?
 You can't shoot.
 - I should scare them a little.

64
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.320
Think about it.
 Is it so smart?

65
00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.160
He pulled down his pants in front of the entire village.
 We can't just sit here.

66
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.880
- We must have a backlash.
 -A shot.

67
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.520
Fucking pigs.
 Should you have a party without us?

68
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.080
- Her God, Leif!
 - Did you see the can?

69
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.320
What was that?

70
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.520
I feel like a sniper, as if you are in a war zone.

71
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.720
I understand that it feels cool, but it is enough now.

72
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.320
Small shooter in the guard, ready to shoot.

73
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.120
Check out the princess cake, Billy.

74
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.920
- It was the last.
 Stop the rifle.
 - A to, Billy.

75
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.040
Look, Tony.
 A full bag-in-box!
 We can have it for dinner tonight.

76
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:04.000
We have the goal in sight.
 Battle woman with wine box.

77
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.120
Not the wine box.
 She holds it.

78
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.480
Stop it!

79
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.080
Cursed!

80
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:23.120
-What have you done?
 - It was you who shot.
 Blame me!

81
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.840
May I look?
 Oh my God.

82
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.600
That bastard.
 - I'll come, mom.

83
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.680
-He is coming here!
 - We have made a love blind.

84
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.720
- What anxiety.
 - Now damn!

85
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.120
Open the door!

86
00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.360
–What have you set up?
 - Do you see that I am?
 You shot.

87
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.800
Is it the police?
 It's Tony Nilsson from Sörbäcken.

88
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.680
Leif and Billy have shot the mother in the eye.
 You may send a car here.

89
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.920
Mm ... Third time liked, Leif.

90
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.240
Two dots before.
 You would get a foot buoy if it became a third.

91
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.560
I was not aware of the dots.

92
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.800
No one has informed us about them.
 Where would I have received them from?

93
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.320
You drove 210 km/h on 30-road, outside a school.

94
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.440
We were running out of gasoline, so we took off to roll home.

95
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.200
You blasted a fox stew into the air.

96
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.640
Yes, and it is called game care.

97
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.320
With 1.5 kg explosives, which you had turned from the mine.

98
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.960
Okay, you took me.
 I did wrong.

99
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:17.600
How long are you drawn with old sins?
 Should I be stamped in the neck as livestock?

100
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.320
It was two weeks ago, Leif.

101
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.720
Now it will be a foot buoy for six months, and there is nothing you can say.

102
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.840
- Damn Fittsnut.
 -What did you say?

103
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.520
He said nothing ... he said nice snuff.

104
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:43.280
Fine as snuff.
 He thinks it will be wonderful to take care of.

105
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.480
C.Teletext.urfjarran test to post the house on the yellow sides.

106
00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:01.360
I have already done that.
 It takes time to sell houses out here.

107
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.720
C.Teletext.urfjarranja, that's enough.

108
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.160
How is it going?
 Have you tested the saw?

109
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.960
Yes, it is made of cryptonite or something fucking titanium.

110
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.080
c.Teletext. sound sign

111
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.840
Hello guys.

112
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.600
I was going to come by, just.

113
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:08.720
It has gone over control this whole thing between us.

114
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.040
This with the footbojan and registration ...

115
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.480
I had to report because I thought my mom had become blind.

116
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:23.600
I understand.
 It was not meant to shoot her in the eye.

117
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.000
No, who does it?
 I get it.

118
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.040
Sorry for what happened at the party.

119
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:37.760
I have a little pardon-mig cake.
 You can take it with you.

120
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.920
- We pull a line over this.
 - Yes, it's good if we can do it.

121
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.040
Greet that I apologize to my mother.
 Is she about to go?

122
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.920
We go down to Stockholm.
 She is a little cut, so I go with.

123
00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:01.400
- What nice that we got to talk out!
 - Thanks for the cake, Tony.

124
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.640
- I should not disturb any more.
 -See ya.

125
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.320
Have a good one.

126
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.520
Take care of you, and eat it up before it melts.

127
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.440
Then you just have to turn side, change chapters and move on.

128
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.560
I think I've learned a lesson from all this.

129
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.800
It is that you can apologize.

130
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:41.160
I feel good about this, you are doing well, the mother, Tony - everyone benefits from it.

131
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:47.400
- You can actually apologize.
 - Giantfint said.
 I agree with.

132
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.560
Just accept the footboy and move on with life.

133
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.760
Now we chop in.

134
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.920
Damn, how good it was!

135
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:10.280
- It was very much chocolate.
 - Near Besk, but in a good way.

136
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:18.720
- Her god, this is how the sky tastes.
 –What nice by Tony.

137
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.840
Fy damn, what good it was!

138
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.800
What are you doing?
 Let's see.

139
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.280
Leif Öhman here.
 I want to rent a sludge cleaner tonight.

140
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.960
C.Teletext.urfjarranvi has no empty cars tonight.

141
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.640
If you have one that is full, I would like to take it.
 I can empty it for you.

142
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:39.200
The brother picks it up tonight, so I do the job myself.
 Good.

143
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:05.640
I don't know if I can do it, Leif.
 You can do it yourself.

144
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:12.280
Do you hear forgotten the footcuff?
 If I walk 20 meters, the entire police force comes.

145
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:18.320
Is that what you want?
 No, get started then, for hell.

146
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.360
What do you say now, Tony?

147
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.480
C.Teletext. sound signc. sounding sound

148
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.440
Hell!

149
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.280
What is going on?

150
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.720
Oh!

151
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.880
What the hell, the whole house is full of crap!

152
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:08.520
"Welcome, your bastard. I am king in the village."

153
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:14.080
"If you have something countless, you can come over and take that eye to eye."

154
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.640
"Leif Öhman."

155
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.680
Run, run!

156
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
