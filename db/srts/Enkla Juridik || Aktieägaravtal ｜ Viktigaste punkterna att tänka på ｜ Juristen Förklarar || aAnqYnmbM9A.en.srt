00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:13.521
A shareholder agreement is a legal document where the shareholders in a limited company agree on the company's structure and how the company's operations are to be controlled.

2
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:18,976
When running a company with several other partners, it is always highly recommended to establish a shareholder agreement.

3
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:25,828
The reason is that it wants to agree on how the company and the partners should act in different situations that may arise in the future.

4
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:31,817
The main purpose of this is that you want to avoid future conflicts that can harm the company or you as a shareholder.

5
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:36,000
The most important thing about shareholder agreements can be divided into 3 parts:

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,539
1. That the agreement is clear and exhaustive.

7
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:42,779
2. That you have agreed on what is happening in unexpected incidents.

8
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,220
3. How you regulate the transfer of shares

9
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:51.836
Regarding the 1st paragraph, it is important for you to think about formulating the shareholder agreement as clearly as possible.

10
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:56,504
This means that any requirements on the partners must be formulated with a simple language.

11
00:00:57,113 --> 00:01:02.037
Any requirements for sales volume per partner or similar must be quantifiable.

12
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:08,184
This is especially true if these goals are linked to clauses for when you, as a partner, have to forcibly sell their holding.

13
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:13,206
In addition to clarity, it is very important that a shareholder agreement is exhaustive.

14
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:18,818
This means that the shareholder agreement will in principle affect all eventualities that may arise in the future.

15
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,191
Paragraph 2 is about regulating what happens in unexpected incidents with a major impact on the company.

16
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:27,833
Here are the most important issues that the agreement should regulate:

17
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,626
What if a partner goes away?

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,217
What happens to the shares if a partner would differ?

19
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:37,330
What happens if a partner becomes long -term sick leave?

20
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:41,433
And what happens if a partner neglects their obligations?

21
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:49.847
It is common to regulate these points by allowing the married partners to have a marriage order that exempts the shares from being included in a division of housing.

22
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:56,064
In the shareholder agreement, it is also possible to decide that the shares in the event of death or divorce have a certain price,

23
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:59,360
And that other shareholders have pre -emption rights on these shares.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04.861
A strong tip is to also write a clause for when you as a shareholder must forcibly sell their shares.

25
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:09.699
An example of such a criterion may be in case of long -term sick leave.

26
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,732
Or if the co -owner does not achieve a certain sales requirement for a given period.

27
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:17,269
Paragraph 3 is about regulating the transfer of shares.

28
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:22,085
It is common for you as a partner to do not want you to be able to sell their shares to anyone.

29
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:28,524
You can limit this right by bringing home the home delegation, pre-purchase, repurchase and consent clauses in the agreement.

30
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:36,000
These four different clauses regulate how any repurchases or sales of shares should go in favor of other shareholders.

31
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:40,010
Now we will go through what these different clauses mean.

32
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:49,815
A home messenger clause means that former owners of a certain share have pre -emption right on that share if an outsider has received it through, for example, inheritance or gift.

33
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:56,586
The right of pre -emption means that you give other partners the right to buy the shares before others can buy the shares.

34
00:02:56,586 --> 00:03:01.087
In this way, you can avoid unwanted partners buying themselves into the company.

35
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:09,000
A repurchase clause regulates the right to buy back shares that have previously been sold for a certain period of a pre -stated amount.

36
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:14,611
This can be smart to do if you let in a partner who does not turn out to be a good match a little further ahead.

37
00:03:15,883 --> 00:03:24,977
Consumption clauses stipulate that in some cases a shareholder must obtain the consent of the Board or Annual General Meeting before a transfer of shares takes place.

38
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:29,280
This further increases control over who can become part -owners.

39
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:34,172
The very last thing you should keep in mind is to ban the shareholders from being able to pledge the shares.
