1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:07,650
Then we are back with five

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,883
Pieces of moral and ethical dilemmas.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,333
I will give you five different dilemmas.

4
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:18,500
The task is how would you act in these situations?

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,466
And remember, there is no right or wrong answer.

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,800
Feel free to write your answers and justify why in the comments field.

7
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:28,950
After looking clearly.

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,766
Pause the video if you need to think.

9
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:35,516
Try to also keep you in response options in those dilemmas

10
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:36,566
As I describe.

11
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:39,566
It is easy to find another solution,

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,650
But then the very point of the exercise disappears.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,800
But then we start immediately

14
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:47,366
number one.

15
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:50,366
The doctor you are a doctor in a hospital.

16
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,166
At the hospital there are two patients, one patient

17
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:58,283
Which is 90 years old and a patient who is 20 years old.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,916
Both have the same deadly illness and are only expected to live for another month.

19
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07.016
But there is a cure

20
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:10,466
That can save them and you have this cure.

21
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:15,600
But the problem is that there is only enough for one person.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,450
What are you doing?

23
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,733
Do you give the cure to the older patient and let him live the few

24
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:26,066
years he has left and sacrifices the young patient?

25
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:29,516
Or do you give the cure to the young patient?

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,966
He has a long life ahead of him.

27
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,966
The old man would soon die anyway.

28
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,700
Or do you do nothing and let both die?

29
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,000
For a life is probably no more worthwhile

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
something else?

31
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,333
Number two dungeons.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,633
You stand at a cliff and at the edge of the cliff hangs one

33
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:00,000
Foreign pregnant woman and stays stuck.

34
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:02,100
She will soon lose grip.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,900
If you don't help her up a few feet away from her hangs

36
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,316
Your best friend, also unable to get up on your own.

37
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:13,733
How they ended up there is unimportant in this context,

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,100
But now it is important to choose who to save.

39
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,466
If you save the woman then your best friend falls down and dies.

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,016
If you save your buddy

41
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:28,016
Then the woman falls with the child and dies.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,700
What are you doing?

43
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,816
Do you save the pregnant woman or you rescue

44
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,250
Your best friend?

45
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47.033
Number three the secret heritage.

46
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,050
You find that you have inherited a large sum with money from a distant relative.

47
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,500
You also find out that this relative earned

48
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
This money through criminal activities.

49
00:02:58,616 --> 00:03:02,566
The police know nothing and you could receive the inheritance without

50
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:05.566
Some problems if you didn't say anything.

51
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:08,550
What are you doing?

52
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,766
Would you accept the inheritance?

53
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:13,766
After all, you are the only one who knows where the money comes from.

54
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:16,883
Or would you refuse to receive them?

55
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:18,533
Right should be right.

56
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:21,533
The police must know where the money comes from.

57
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,250
Number four children of the future.

58
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,400
In this dilemma, researchers have managed to develop a

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,500
Type of gene modification that allows parents to have the opportunity

60
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:44,700
At a cost, of course, to adjust things for their unborn child.

61
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,000
For example, you can see if the child has any genetic disease and remove it.

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,050
At the same time, parents can also change other things in the child.

63
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:57,650
Eye color, hair color, length and so on.

64
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:02.066
But can one play God in this way

65
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:05,550
may you change these things without

66
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,550
Children's permission and science.

67
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,450
What do you think?

68
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,433
You think it's right.

69
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:16,950
This can prevent serious and deadly future illnesses.

70
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:20,516
The child's life can be saved and people always try to find

71
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:24,883
Ways to improve themselves anyway, through education, diet and so on.

72
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,433
So why would this be different?

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,350
You think it's wrong.

74
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,633
You change the course of nature.

75
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:35,700
After all, the child is different from what was initially intended.

76
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:39,866
This will only lead to a further split in society

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,516
between those who are genetically improved and those who are not.

78
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:55,516
Number five the price of love.

79
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:59.066
You and your best friend have known each other since childhood.

80
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02.333
In addition to spending a lot of time with your best friend, you even hang out

81
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,650
with other people and have recently discovered that you have developed

82
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09.916
very strong feelings for a specific person.

83
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:14,333
You introduce this person to your best friend and over time

84
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:19,066
Do you notice that the two seem to have an incredibly strong connection.

85
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,433
After a few months this person tells you

86
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:26,666
That it feels a deeper connection with your best friend than with you.

87
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:29,416
What are you doing?

88
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,250
Would you step aside and let your best friend

89
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,250
And the person you enjoy continuing to socialize?

90
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,750
Although it is incredibly painful for you?

91
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:43,850
Or would you fight for your love and try to prevent them from meeting

92
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,400
and risk losing your lifelong friendship?

93
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:52.466
What weighs heavier than your own happiness and jealousy

94
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,400
Or their potential happiness together?

95
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08.716
Write in the comments what you

96
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:11,850
answers and if you can justify why.

97
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:16,350
If you have missed part, I put it as a link in the description.

98
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:20,566
And as always, thank you for watching!
