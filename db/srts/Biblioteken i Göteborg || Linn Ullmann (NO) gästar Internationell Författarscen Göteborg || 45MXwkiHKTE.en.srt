00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,270
- Welcome to international author scene Gothenburg, tonight with Linn Ullmann.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:15,420
-Sound novel, it is said. Eighth did I count on, so I must have doubled?

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,260
I think it's seventh.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,340
-It's a fantastic novel anyway,

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,620
"Girl 1983" is called it.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,460
- In a way, you can say that it is related to your previous novel,

7
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,340
"The worried," as it also hooks in your own story,

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,380
I thought we would start with the title.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,610
- Who is this "girl 1983"?

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:54,340
She is probably me and not me at the same time, if you can say that way.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,540
I have this from Deborah Levy, if anyone has read her wonderful trilogy.

12
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06.860
She always gets the question, including "The Cost of Living", it's one of the books.

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,020
Is it exactly you you've written about?

14
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,340
She says it's me and not me. So Virginia Woolf said too.

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:23,620
It is a nice line of writing women who write about themselves and not at the same time.

16
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,960
But it is clear that "girl 1983" is based on me,

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:39,270
on an experience, an experience I had when I was 16

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,590
And lived in New York with my mom.

19
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,250
I got an invitation from a much older photographer to go to Paris,

20
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,850
Because he wanted to take a picture of me.

21
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,810
I went to Paris.

22
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:08,150
The book is an attempt to portray those days in Paris.

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,030
The picture that was taken has disappeared.

24
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,030
It was also to start writing about an image that no longer exists.

25
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,485
- What was the picture he wanted to take?

26
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:23,950
He was a fashion photographer.

27
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:34,980
He was long and beautiful and a lot of experience and very cheerful.

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:45,170
He wanted to take a picture of me because he thought I was beautiful.

29
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,150
I think he was maybe the first time ...

30
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:58,740
I was so new, the body of the 16-year-old he met,

31
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:06,140
That body was so new. I was very small and lean for a very long time.

32
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12.570
I had a dental position all over my face.

33
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:20,400
Then at the age of 15, the dental position was taken off and the breasts came,

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,160
And something in the body changed.

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,350
In the elevator where the girl meets the photographer,

36
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,990
she gets a look she has not really received before.

37
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,220
It is incredibly exciting to become in that look.

38
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,357
- What does it do with the girl when she gets that look?

39
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:48,420
In the book

40
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,180
The scene is described where A and the girl meet the first time in the elevator.

41
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,140
It is as if she has always known how to do it.

42
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,140
He looks at her, she looks at him.

43
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,500
She makes a small movement with her shoulder.

44
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:13,000
She wears her pink, white dress and a large leather jacket over.

45
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,120
It is a very small dance.

46
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,560
Choreography is very important to me as I write.

47
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,680
How do the bodies move in the room?

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,248
- You see it in front of you?

49
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,600
I always think choreography before I think anything else.

50
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,800
It's because I danced ballet for many years.

51
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,770
I quit just before I turned 16.

52
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,170
I have my big sister here tonight

53
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,450
And she may remember that I danced ballet for the whole family

54
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,970
On Fårö, summer after summer.

55
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,360
- Appreciated?

56
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,400
Yes, I don't know, I was pretty good, but not so talented.

57
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,120
But I have brought the dance with me.

58
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07.770
Back to the elevator in New York.

59
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,370
The almost invisible little dance she intuitively knows ...

60
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:22,320
she gets this look, she does something with her shoulder and sticks her chest out

61
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,420
And notice that the look is getting stronger.

62
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:36,270
It feels there and then as a huge power, like an intoxicating force.

63
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:42,800
The girl has grown up with a mother who is extremely beautiful.

64
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,080
In my books, in "The worried" and "Girl 1983"

65
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:55,980
So the mother's beauty is as well as staggering. It is stunning.

66
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:03,620
She has grown up to see what the classic or traditional

67
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,510
Female beauty can do.

68
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:20,340
- What is it?

69
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,710
I remember growing up with my mom who is so beautiful.

70
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,070
She still is. She is 84 years now.

71
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,670
I was so fascinated.

72
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,780
She could go into a room and all just ...

73
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,510
The room stopped. I remember I read an American article,

74
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,790
I think it was a review of scenes from a marriage,

75
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,990
Where the reviewer was so damned that Johan left Mariann.

76
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,590
For how can you leave a woman who is so beautiful?

77
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04.070
So he described after the premiere of scenes from a marriage in Manhattan,

78
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:10,390
How all men and many of the women came out of the cinema

79
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,710
And were so drunk by her beauty that they walked and wobbled on the street.

80
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,990
I was ... I don't know how old I was when I read the article.

81
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,830
But that is my picture of what that kind of beauty is.

82
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,850
I grew up with that.

83
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,330
I have a picture of a whole street in New York where men and women walk around

84
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,500
and falls over.

85
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,170
Then this girl comes, 16 years old

86
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,550
And no one is fainting, but it is at least a look.

87
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,630
She knows exactly what little dance to do.

88
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:59,190
In the beginning it is intoxicating, powerful, exciting and fun.

89
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,750
At the same time, she is so heavenly naive.

90
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:11,340
It is only a few months ago that she was flat and quite ugly.

91
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,830
And...

92
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,630
She still feels like a child too.

93
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:26,230
She doesn't quite believe that this adult man wants her that way.

94
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,650
She is both world champion, suddenly

95
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,780
And incredibly naive.

96
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,540
And also occupied in a world consisting of beautiful women.

97
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,270
She goes to Paris. This is one timetable in the novel,

98
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,270
Which is 1983.

99
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:58,180
Then there are beautiful young women and photo models

100
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:05,580
And men who are the entourage for this photographer and different ...

101
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,130
So ... much older. All these men.

102
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,290
The book is very much about looking and who sees and when they see.

103
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,330
But what was important for me to write was that I would not ...

104
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,470
I don't know how you say it in Swedish?

105
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,470
I wouldn't be so much in this male look.

106
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:43,660
It's not the point. I wanted to give the girl look back.

107
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:50,930
So since then she sees, and she is the one who looks at A.

108
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:58,220
It's not so much that he looks at her. She is the one who looks at him, even when he sleeps.

109
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,380
It is a key scene in the book and that comes back to all the time.

110
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,260
He sleeps, she's awake,

111
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,570
And she takes the blanket away and she looks at his aging body.

112
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:19,970
It was fun to write this book and give the girl look,

113
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,530
Because in the eyes there is the story, and in the story there is power.

114
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,010
- you mentioned it was a recurring picture,

115
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,690
It is something that also characterizes the novel at large,

116
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,840
It's like a hike around a pain point,

117
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,480
And it revolves around something that you do not really know what it is.

118
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,160
- What is it? What is this creepy?

119
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:57,520
I think you have a very right that the novel is is circular.

120
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,640
I have tried, almost all of my author life

121
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,850
Have I tried to tell this story and not got it.

122
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,890
It is very briefly included in "the worried".

123
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:17,830
The girl in "The troubled" goes to Paris. It's like the last thing we see of the girl.

124
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:24,740
It is in the middle of the book, but it is the last thing you see from her in "the worried".

125
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:33,240
One of the big problems for me or the challenges for me was

126
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:44,840
That when I came to Paris when I was 16, then I got completely lost.

127
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,300
And not only did I get lost, but I had been checked or logged in

128
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:03,140
In a small, awful hotel, but then driven to some studio and further around.

129
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,300
It's like a road movie in Paris, one day. That's all the book is.

130
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:15,120
I had no idea what the hotel was called or it was.

131
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,010
And I did not speak the language, ie French.

132
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,970
I thought when I was going to write this story almost 40 years later,

133
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,090
How do I write a story about a girl in Paris? I don't take anything from Paris.

134
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,370
I just got lost. I do not understand. It was just dark streets.

135
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:44,060
I just got lost. I can not write. I was on that street and walked there.

136
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,900
And then I had forgotten a lot. Forget is also a way to get lost.

137
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:57,940
You look in the brain for what happened, what happened, how was it and what ...

138
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,100
Both this and to get lost and to have forgotten very much

139
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:09,140
I saw a very long time as a problem with writing. I didn't get it to write!

140
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,900
So it is very often with writing. I don't know if you have the same experience?

141
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,100
That which is the very problem, what says you can't write this thing

142
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Or that you can't do this thing because you have this problem.

143
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:32,310
So it is the problem that is the writing itself, the thing itself.

144
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,430
That's what you should go in. What you should go in.

145
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,750
So the problem, that is a problem is very good,

146
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,730
And in the problem lies the solution, if you understand what I mean. Absolutely.

147
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,230
Did you understand that?

148
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,930
- Yes I think so,

149
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,984
to reach into something, simply.

150
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:54,690
Yes, go into something.

151
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:02,280
You think, especially with writing and all kinds of art, even life stuff that you are doing.

152
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,740
You can't do this, because this thing is here.

153
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,840
But it is this thing that is the thing. That's what you should do.

154
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,840
Back to the circular.

155
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,240
What is it getting lost? Well, it is very often to go in a circle.

156
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,680
This only understands people with bad local minds.

157
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:31,340
I have a very bad local mind. It is in the family, I think.

158
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,980
Terribly bad local mind, but what you know when you go very lost

159
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,420
is that you go in a circle.

160
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,060
What if I could write a book that also goes in a circle?

161
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,180
It must start on page 1 and end on page 240 or whatever it is.

162
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,980
But the shape itself is circular.

163
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,340
You should always come back to the same scenes, but in a slightly different way.

164
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,540
- is that how you work as a writer that you have the form ready for you

165
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,460
Before you enter the process itself?

166
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:18,140
Yes, or I probably feel that form is the most important thing, almost, to write something.

167
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,010
If one does not have an understanding of the architecture

168
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,530
or choreography, or the form, or the composition,

169
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:37,120
Then it is difficult to write.

170
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,240
But you have to write before you have it, but then you write badly, at least I am.

171
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,020
It is also very important when you write, that you write poorly.

172
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:53,880
To tolerate your own bad writing before there is anything good.

173
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,950
But form is the most important thing about poetry.

174
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,830
It is that you dictate, that you write a novel.

175
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07.890
You do not just write a biography or a memoir.

176
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,530
You find a form for your experience.

177
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:17,210
- I thought of one thing you mentioned earlier, that it is about giving the girl the look back, to some extent,

178
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,930
But it is another look that comes in too, namely the adult woman

179
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,490
Who also considers the girl. How is it that?

180
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:32,260
The book takes place on two schedules.

181
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:40,390
So the adult woman is ... she is like me in quite a few ways.

182
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,702
- What way, then?

183
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,980
She lives where I live,

184
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,140
At a large park in Oslo called Torsjö Park, where she counts the trees.

185
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:59,440
She suffers from severe depression, or anxiety.

186
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,420
It's pretty much like me. She also gets lost.

187
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:15,230
Wil in the memories and lost in the brain.

188
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:23,840
But then she also tries to find a form of the book.

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,660
The book is also about trying to write the book and finding a form.

190
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:38,460
She quotes, among other things, or I quote, she quotes Virginia Woolf,

191
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:47,660
As in a fantastic BBC number found on Youtube,

192
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,490
About writing. She sounds so very nice and noble when she says:

193
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:02,170
"All the writ is to find the right words and put them in the right sequence."

194
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05.731
And it's so wonderful!

195
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:10,760
- It sounds so easy.

196
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,280
So I have that quote over my desk, but it is also in the book.

197
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,442
Now I haven't really answered your question.

198
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,080
- I think you have it.

199
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:30,830
It is the woman's gaze on the girl, but it is also the girl's gaze sometimes

200
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:38,250
the adult woman. For the girl sometimes says to the adult writer, don't say it this way,

201
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,810
It wasn't so. Could you be careful?

202
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,890
Being careful is the most important thing you have to be when writing.

203
00:18:50,050 --> 00:19:02.838
It is as much the girl that requires, as requires

204
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:15,170
To be this book, you must be true and careful and concrete.

205
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,610
The book's project is in a way,

206
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,170
Can this girl and woman meet in this circle?

207
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,340
And so maybe they can in tiny moment.

208
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,280
But it was worth trying anyway.

209
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,520
- I have a little trouble letting go of this with looks for

210
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:48,800
Something that becomes so clear in the book is the abyss, which I would at least experience it,

211
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,160
between one then and one now, between a time ...

212
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:01,720
There are other books that have taken it up, Vanessa Springoras "Consent" for example.

213
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,360
There is a documentary series about Brooke Shields

214
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,760
Which also debuted very young as an actor in these nymphic roles.

215
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:19,360
It is how striking the pedophile look for young women is at this time.

216
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,920
Yes, and all other times.

217
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,640
- You experience it like all other times too?

218
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:34,100
Yes, it is now that we may see and have a very strong look at that look.

219
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:41,970
So we understand that we take a settlement with the pedophile look.

220
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,290
But it is clear that it has existed at all times.

221
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:54,360
Then we have a settlement now, for good and bad.

222
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,530
But mostly, that this settlement will come.

223
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,780
At the same time, I think there is a difference between my ...

224
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,270
I really like Vanessa Springora's memoir. It is a memoir.

225
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,085
It is very important and very strong.

226
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:16,950
- Does everyone feel for this one?

227
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:24,150
It is about a 13-year-old who is with a nearly 50-year-old writer

228
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:30,640
that was, is, he still lives, a pedophile,

229
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:37,390
And who wrote about their pedophile conquests.

230
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,790
There is a lot to say about it.

231
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:47,150
"Girl 1983" differs on several points, I think, from Vanessa Springoras.

232
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,470
She is 16, the girl. Not 13.

233
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,670
It was important to me, it happened to me when I was 16,

234
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,710
But it was also important for the book, that she is actually 16.

235
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:09.390
She is in the space between adult and child.

236
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:16,030
Everything that is written, almost everything I write, at least in this book, is in a kind of crack, a gap

237
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,100
Where you can't really see ...

238
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:27,600
Was it a crime or was it a love story?

239
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,620
Or were it both?

240
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,050
It is always she, the girl, who goes to him.

241
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,970
Or that go to the men. It's not just A and you, there will be more too.

242
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,930
It's always her. She is never forced, but maybe she has groomed?

243
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:51,860
All these things are at once.

244
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,440
It is difficult...

245
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,800
It is more difficult to discuss. It can easily,

246
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,940
As it is called in English, weaponizes, taking one side or the other side.

247
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,740
But for me it was extremely important to write about the girl's desire.

248
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,820
I'm not so busy with the man's desire in this book.

249
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:22,160
He is portrayed mostly as either a little crazy and a little crazy,

250
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,680
Or that he sleeps.

251
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,440
- He's closest to a shadow figure?

252
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:35,840
Yes, he is most clear when he sleeps. It is the woman in art and novels and in songs.

253
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:44,140
How many pictures have we not seen from sleeping young girls and a viewing man?

254
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,340
But her desire is extremely important.

255
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:56,260
She requests him, and the desire is so great and new in this new body

256
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:03.070
That she needs several bodies to keep all the desire.

257
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:10,630
Then it happens, when she is with him, that the desire suddenly leaves her.

258
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:17,680
Then it is just nasty, and she wants to vomit.

259
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,520
So all of these overwhelming, you can say it in Swedish, overwhelming feelings

260
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,520
Available in the body and comes very quickly after each other.

261
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,940
There is a desire, it is not a desire.

262
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:40,060
It is very much for a 16-year-old girl body to escape.

263
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,010
It does ...

264
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,930
When you take in the girl's desire into such a story, it becomes shortly,

265
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,770
It becomes more dredged.

266
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,500
I do not know if you can say dumb in Swedish, but it will be it anyway.

267
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,281
- It can be said now if not otherwise.

268
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:08,380
Yes, you think that understands.

269
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,860
After all, novels are for, and art in general,

270
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:20,720
Is there to do everything, confuse everything.

271
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,511
- Yes, seek ambivalence.

272
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:25,560
Yes, it is also a great way to say it.

273
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,180
- The science, all that.

274
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,310
- I guess you have received this question a thousand times, or this claim.

275
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,710
The shine and power relations in this book and in this scene,

276
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,350
Especially in this key scene that recurs,

277
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:49,950
It is impossible, would I say, not to associate with Metoo?

278
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,150
Would it have been possible to write this novel before Metoo?

279
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:57,830
I tried to write it long before metoo and then I wrote it.

280
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:06,780
After all, I wrote the story in "the worried" even before metoo, when I wrote.

281
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09.820
I would like to say it's not a metoo novel

282
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,300
But that's because I don't like categorization of novels.

283
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,020
I don't like the word autofiction.

284
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,980
I don't like to say that something is a metoo novel.

285
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,900
But then you have to say that there is a lot of autofiction and metoo novel.

286
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,980
One of the books that have been inspired mostly with, both for the worried and this book

287
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,660
Is Margaret Dura's "Lover". In any case, it was written long before Metoo.

288
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,100
It is about a very young, 15 year old, girl who is with an older man.

289
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,420
It is about her relationship with her mother.

290
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52.570
Duras switches between me and she. I do too.

291
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:01,510
It is the girl's look that is important in that book.

292
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,070
Not so much the lover.

293
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:12.510
Yes, I think women have written about these things

294
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,830
And certainly some men too, at all times.

295
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:26,180
After all, Virginia Woolf writes in "Moments of Being", in her autobiographical depictions,

296
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:34,070
So she writes about something similar, or about an older relative as ...

297
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:42,410
It's just that now we say that this is a metoo novel.

298
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,410
This is a metoo novel.

299
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:51,500
But you say it pretty much about books written by women

300
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:58,020
Because I think we still have more a tendency to want to categorize,

301
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,810
It feels safer to categorize books written by women,

302
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,530
Female writers, because then you have to place this.

303
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,650
Yes, but this I understand. It's a m too-novel.

304
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,143
- Then you can sell it?

305
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:13,480
No, not sell it

306
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,980
But then you can live ... So, it can be ...

307
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,730
Once you bring in the violent desire for example, and so you can still say

308
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:32,460
that what happened was not okay ... but she was nothing,

309
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:39,360
The girl in this book is not a perfect victim.

310
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,920
She is not innocence. She feels a lot of desires.

311
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,880
She goes to these men.

312
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:56,300
They don't force her physically. So it complicates the victim role and ...

313
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,700
But can you still say it wasn't okay?

314
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,720
So shouldn't ... you shouldn't ...

315
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,190
So I'm not saying that these guys would have done this with the girl,

316
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,150
Or been with the girl that way.

317
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:24,790
- But I understand it right if I claim that autumn 2017, the entire Metoo debate,

318
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:31,870
That you feel it did, split people too easily into victims and wore roles?

319
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,870
No, this is a long discussion

320
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,310
So if we have all night we can sit here and have a real discussion about Metoo.

321
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,640
I think it is very, very important.

322
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,400
Rachel Cusk, the fine writer, said something very nice to me.

323
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:58,160
I remember. I had interviewed her at the Literature House in Oslo.

324
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,720
So we sat at a table, this was probably 2017,

325
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,770
We sat around a table with several younger women.

326
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,650
There was a discussion about metoo and the younger women,

327
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,570
Rachel Cusk and I are the same age, they talked about things they had experienced

328
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,730
Which they didn't think was okay.

329
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:19,650
A full writer had come up to one and said, you want to fuck.

330
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,810
And she was damned for this.

331
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:31,740
I said something, because I thought then that, my God, this we all have, it was not so dangerous.

332
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,780
And so Rachel Cusk told me, you and I will shut up.

333
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,340
We will listen to what the younger women say.

334
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,100
We will listen to their experiences and we will try to understand.

335
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,420
And she was absolutely right.

336
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,580
So I don't know if it was an answer to your question either.

337
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,100
But it is clear that it

338
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,750
The Medial Metoo debate is mostly on good

339
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:14,170
but have also had pages that are highly problematic

340
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,170
that has to do with legal security.

341
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:22,140
that have with the fact that there is actually a big difference between abuse

342
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:32,530
And stupidity.

343
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:40,370
And the medial image of the victim role is very often,

344
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,010
It is starting to become a little Victorian for my taste.

345
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:53,470
We should be sure that the victim is clean.

346
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,590
That there was no Grums there.

347
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:02.940
And so little that is clean.

348
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,500
I'm the mother of a 19-year-old.

349
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:10,330
She was 15-16 when I wrote this book.

350
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:21,660
I am extremely happy that she has a completely different view of what is good.

351
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,900
If a man looked at her when she was 16, a 44-year-old old man

352
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,700
As that man in the elevator looked at me,

353
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,740
She had just wanted to say fuck you.

354
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:40,240
What fucking old man are you looking at me that way?

355
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,840
And that's because she has grown up with Metoo and is a feminist.

356
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,480
- She is aware that she is not supposed to be treated that way?

357
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:57,010
Yes, she is aware that her value does not come through an old man's gaze.

358
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:12,430
And it's pretty nice to see that the girls who are much younger than me and you,

359
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,630
You are much younger than me ...

360
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:17,790
- Not so much!

361
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,990
Suddenly you are the oldest in the room.

362
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,950
Maybe not quite, but ...

363
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,990
Yes.

364
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:34,980
- We can move on.

365
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:41,380
Something like DN's critic and former cultural director, Maria Schottenius,

366
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:47,700
She wrote something interesting about your authorship, just when she reviewed "Girl 1983"

367
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:53,140
Then she writes that with "the worried" something peculiar happened,

368
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:59,500
It was like her, Linn Ullmanns, storytelling in contact with the autobiographical substance

369
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04.320
had been electrified, prose vibrated.

370
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,207
- Do you keep with her that there was something that happened?

371
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:15,380
It was very nice.

372
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:23,140
I think every book I've written has had its challenges

373
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:30,220
and that previous books have had a lot of autobiographical things in itself

374
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,660
But not so obvious.

375
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:40,260
You agree with me who writes books, but I think the books will come when they come.

376
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:46,500
The books you write come when they have to come.

377
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:53.060
I tried to write "the worried" before I wrote "the precious" who came before "the worried"

378
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:59,590
- But then I didn't get it. So I have to write "the precious" first,

379
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,910
Which I think has many qualities.

380
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,590
I don't want to say that all the other books ...

381
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:14,190
No, I do not fully agree, because all books have their tone,

382
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:18,190
or one's fabric, or sit ...

383
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:24,580
- How did it happen then that you began to approach the more openly autobiographical?

384
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,380
I tried to write “the worried” quite a long time too,

385
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:35,330
Which is to start, my sister is here, our father's death.

386
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:41,770
I wanted to write about a father's death.

387
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:56,860
Then it was not necessarily my father, and then it became a bit obviously autobiographical.

388
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,100
I don't know how it turned out. I think something has with that

389
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,500
To the extent that my parents, for example, are included in the books,

390
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:12.060
is that they are as old or younger than me, in how they are portrayed.

391
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:19,230
I have become so old that I can look at my parents eg

392
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:29,520
as people who are not only very much older

393
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,440
and wiser or dumber, or what you always think.

394
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,360
But I see them as people striving.

395
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,390
The older you get, or I get anyway,

396
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,870
So you get a kind of overview.

397
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,960
One that has been extremely important to me in writing, especially of these last two books

398
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:05,280
Is a choreographer named Merce Cunningham who lived with John Cage, musician John Cage.

399
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07.560
John Cage is also very important to me.

400
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,040
John Cage is he who composed 433

401
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,070
Where the entire orchestra is quiet for four minutes and 33 seconds.

402
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:27,740
He saw that the music was in the silence or in everything around us.

403
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:33,870
Not in ... but Merce Cunningham, which he lived with, who was a fantastic choreographer,

404
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:40,280
said he discovered his voice, or how he would choreograph on stage.

405
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,400
When he realized he could open the stage room.

406
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,920
He was trained in the classic ballet where everything is about the Center Stage.

407
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:59,740
Everyone looks here, the ballerina stands here, this her we are looking at and she spins around.

408
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,980
While in his dance, he opened the whole ...

409
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,540
And what was interesting was what happened there and what happened there.

410
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,400
A completely different way to understand perspective and understand the story.

411
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,640
I try to do that in my books, to go away from center stage

412
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,190
And open the stage room completely.

413
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,310
Was that an answer to the question about why?

414
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,510
-Yes.

415
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:35,390
Before we round off and fill in with some audience questions here,

416
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:41,390
Now we have talked a lot about the girl. You mentioned this look at the parents.

417
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,310
It is also a very nice portrayal of a mother and a daughter

418
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:54.565
and how the daughter during the pandemic almost takes over this motherly role over her own mother

419
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,990
- Why was it interesting to portray?

420
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02.040
It's like the Mor-Dotter books.

421
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,600
It is the adult woman who was the girl and who cannot ...

422
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,440
Who has never been able to talk to his mother about this that happened in Paris.

423
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,820
And much else she has not been able to talk to her mother about.

424
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,780
Although it has been a turbulent mother-daughter,

425
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,900
and a very loving, but very turbulent mother-daughter relationship,

426
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:31,370
So there are a lot of silences and a lot of things they can't talk about.

427
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:37,450
And so it is portrayed in the book and so it is well for me and my mom too.

428
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:43,460
And I remember that I with my mom ...

429
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:50,520
That it was precisely the pandemic. And she was in Lockdown in the United States

430
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,480
and sat in Massachusetts and looked at a tree outside the window,

431
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01.820
And I was in Oslo in Torsjö Park and looked and counted my trees.

432
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,250
And my mom can't,

433
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,530
She knows nothing digital. She can't send text messages, she can't go online.

434
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:16,410
She absolutely can't. Her hands tremble very and she does not understand,

435
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:19,200
She can't.

436
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,850
She can speak on the phone and she can send fax.

437
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,330
She has a fax machine and she does not understand why not everyone has fax masacins.

438
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:32,850
But I have a program, a very complicated program

439
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:38,450
So I can receive her fax on my e -mail online.

440
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:44,690
It is very complicated. But anyway, what happened was that I could ...

441
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:53,712
She sat in Lockdown and couldn't go in business, but I could get her shopping lists,

442
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,400
which she sent on fax, on e -mails.

443
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,700
Then I could order these goods on an American supermarket

444
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07.540
Which could then leave it at her door.

445
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,820
One thing ... I can still talk about it and get pretty proud.

446
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,420
She thinks it's fun that I write books.

447
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,800
But the thing that I could fix that.

448
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,600
That she could send me a fax with what she needed

449
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,340
And so I could arrange it, online.

450
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,080
She thought ... Yes, she liked me so much then.

451
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:41,540
She thought I was ... and then in these conversations we had on the phone -

452
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:48,180
- And this faxing that was about food.

453
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,340
Her shopping lists were very modest. They were very small.

454
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:59,830
It was like coffee, tea, shampoo that smells good.

455
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03.330
One bread.

456
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07.530
Not that sourdough bread you usually order,

457
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,530
I want white bread.

458
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:17,580
So in this that was about food and nutrition -

459
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:27,250
so you could very slowly start a small, little gently call

460
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:33,740
About things that had happened.

461
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,300
Not only with me but also with her in her youth.

462
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:45,780
As a writer, I thought was so exciting, as a writer, was exciting,

463
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:55,370
To portray how conversations come from very small silences and small food lists.

464
00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:00,270
- There is such a stillness over those scenes as well.

465
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,350
- I think it's a great way to round off this call.

466
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:10,310
Big thanks for that. Big thanks, Linn Ullman, author of "Girl 1983".

467
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:18,140
Thanks to you.
