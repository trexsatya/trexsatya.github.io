1
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
We will go through how to edit, upgrade and enrich in Libris cataloging.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,460
We will look at editing a description, upgrade of advance information and preliminary information,

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,140
Enrich from template and from mail and detailed enrichment.

4
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:32,256
In most cases, there is already a post in Libris for what you should describe.

5
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
Search carefully before creating new to avoid duplicates. Follow the instructions and guidelines

6
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
When you edit and upgrade items.

7
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,872
You will find links to instructions on the Edit and upgrade page in the assistance section.

8
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
Once you have applied and got a hit, check out what level the item has. You see it as an icon in the summary.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59.648
You also see it in admin metadata below description level.

10
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:05,792
If the item is at the national bibliographic level, like this item, it usually does not need to be changed.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,424
If the post is at a minimum or library level, it may need to be supplemented.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,420
An entry at the level of advance information or preliminary needs to be upgraded before you place stocks.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,400
When you upgrade the entry, you must change to another approved level before saving,

14
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,060
Otherwise, your changes can be overwritten.

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,208
Read more in the help text for admin metadata below description level

16
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,120
and under nuclear elements and mandatory elements, description levels.

17
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:47,520
To edit, click the edit icon in the tool menu

18
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,848
or use the shortcut Ctrl + E.

19
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
You can add properties with the plus signs during instance, during instance of works

20
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00.320
and under admin metadata.

21
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,160
Watch the movie Properties and entities.

22
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,304
Feel free to use the enriching feature from template to add multiple properties at the same time.

23
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,656
You can find it under tools, enrich from template.

24
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,264
Here you get a list of templates that you can choose to enrich from.

25
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
I choose a book.

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:29,600
A number of properties were now added from the template, both during instance and during instance of works

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32.060
and under admin metadata.

28
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,540
You can then work on these characteristics and fill in the tasks, link to entities, etc.

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,640
Then save the post and place stocks.

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,340
It is also possible to enrich from another entry.

31
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,320
Under tools you have the enrich from mail option.

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58.688
Here are two options, from ID or from file.

33
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
If you choose from ID

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,672
So you get the opportunity to enrich the pre -mail with properties from another entry.

35
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,024
So you need an ID for the second post.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,640
Here we have a finished mail

37
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,800
And we find ID to the post in the summary. We copy the ID.

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,100
Then we paste it into the pre -mail, enrich from ID

39
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,440
And now a number of properties were added from the finished item to the pre -mail.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:52,340
Of course, we must check carefully if these information is correct and change to correct information.

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,780
But you get in many cases

42
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:01.408
Good tasks to start from and that you can then continue to work on.

43
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,272
It is also possible to enrich the post from a file.

44
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:12,160
We go to a more full record that we want to enrich from

45
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:20,080
And here we choose tools, download JSON-LD and we choose to save it as a file

46
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,200
as we name. I call the file a template file.

47
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,620
We go back to the pre -mail.

48
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,600
And now we want to enrich this from the template file.

49
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,040
Then we go to tools,

50
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
Enrich from mail, from file.

51
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
And here we choose template file.

52
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,820
Now a number of properties from the template file were added to in the pre -mail

53
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00.940
And just as we said before, you have to check it carefully and edit it

54
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,600
Who needs to be edited before saving.

55
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:12,080
This way of working can be useful if you are going to make a number of items that look almost the same.

56
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,400
And you can then enrich them from a template file.

57
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,279
It is also possible to enrich with one property at a time from one post to another.

58
00:05:22.303 --> 00:05:28,191
Then you go to tools, detailed enrichment, and here you need id

59
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
For the item you want to enrich from.

60
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,383
We go to the more complete post and copy ID from there.

61
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:43,295
Then we go back and paste the ID under detailed enrichment into the pre -mail.

62
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,695
Then we come to a view where we can hand pick property for property.

63
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,119
And we see here the post we want to enrich from and the post we want to enrich to.

64
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01.471
However, it does not work during the instance of works.

65
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,383
Incidentally, you can expand or replace properties.

66
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
We try to expand.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,120
We pick up on the origin from one item to the other.

68
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,540
And we try to replace a task with another task.

69
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,180
Of course, you have to check that all information is correct before you save the mail.

70
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,260
Once you have checked all the information and saved, you can set stocks.

71
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,900
Watch the movies about stocks.
