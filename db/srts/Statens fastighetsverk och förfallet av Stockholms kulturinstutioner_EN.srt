1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,960
Each country has them, national symbols that adorn postcards

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,160
And attracts tourists.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,280
Sydney has its iconic opera house, Oslo its marble -covered opera

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,520
Milan the legendary La Scala.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,120
And Sweden's 250-year-old cultural pride: the Royal Opera.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,080
The opera's CEO has testified about mold and smell of stool

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,600
And also stones have come loose from the facade.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,000
Physically, the 250-year-old feels very bad. It's really a crisis.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,800
Flying stones and stool smell.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,840
Is it the opera or Christmas dinner with my grandmother?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
She is so angry all the time.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,920
The opera house falls apart. Should no one cook it?

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,360
Yes, but this someone is full of

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,560
to produce sneaky recruitment films.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,960
It is the love of the houses and cultural heritage

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,200
And to the special assignment.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,320
We preserve the properties for future generations.

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,880
That is why we exist.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,520
Without us, many of our cultural treasures would have disappeared.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,080
State Property Agency, SFV

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,160
which manages Sweden's cultural -historical heritage.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,360
They must ensure that every village halt has a castle in fine condition.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,800
Where one can go with the family when you have to find something

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,680
Because you do not endure being in the same apartment.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
In total, SFV manages 4,000 buildings:

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,080
Citizens, castles, museums, theaters and state building memories.

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,160
Varberg's fortress, Kronoberg's castle ruin - you name it!

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,040
SFV is there and does a questionable job.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,320
Unfortunately, many tenants do not seem to feel as good as the Royal Opera.

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,440
It is hardly possible to work there anymore.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,640
We are very crowded already.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,520
Musicians warm up in the corridors, the dancers' gym is in a corridor arm.

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,640
Under the roof it gets extremely hot.

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,840
It rains from time to time when the snow melts or it rains outside.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,600
What a shame! Every civilized country should have a national scene.

36
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,280
An important symbol for culture in this country.

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,400
I love a finely tuned opera, just last week I took part in

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,800
One of this year's cultural highlights: The set "Where is the sandwich?"

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,720
That was unbelievable! Wow.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,160
The whole show I wondered: Where is the sandwich?

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,280
Culture can really move one to other places.

42
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,120
When digging, you realize that the opera house has become pure horror experience.

43
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,040
The other night I had guests in the house. They needed to go to the bathroom.

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,920
When they turned on the water, small flies poured out. It's not so fun.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,480
No, that is not fun at all.

46
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,680
I got flies in the crane myself after a wild week at Rhodes in 2001.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,840
I had to burn them away. Why am I telling this?

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,240
I just want to remind myself that once I was a viril young playboy

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,360
And now I'm talking about state real estate.

50
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,920
Where were we? Just that, flies in the crane, it's not good, no.

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,680
So instead of an iconic landmark, a dilapidated ghost house.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,040
The Phantom has to leave the opera and walk on the city streets like an ordinary man.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
And the opera is not alone in slowly breaking.

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
The Natural History Museum also seems to be severely neglected by SFV.

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,480
300 kilos of roof plaster that loosened.

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,640
The ceiling at the Natural History Museum in Stockholm

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,000
risks collapsing, and now they have to keep closed.

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,120
As if dinosaurs were not extinct enough!

59
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,600
First a comet in the skull, now roof plaster.

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,520
Not easy to be Dino in today's Sweden.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
Nightclubs refuse to let in raptors.

62
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,080
Try to get bank loans like Tricratops! Handelsbanken possibly ...

63
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,720
What is SFV doing? What happened to the mission to preserve cultural treasures

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
And with their "love for the houses"?

65
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,480
Well, behind the decay of the houses lies a rental model

66
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,680
The Persson government introduced 20 years ago.

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,360
The model is called cost rent and the intentions were obviously good.

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,880
Five central national cultural institutions

69
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,280
would not have to pay market rent, which is the basic arrangement

70
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,400
And instead pay cost rent.

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,120
The work charges exactly what it costs to manage the house.

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,240
Yes, and these five buildings, The Big Five

73
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,680
Is the opera, the Dramaten, the National Museum, the Historical Museum and the buffalo ...

74
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,720
Sorry, Natural History Museum.

75
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,200
The Big Five has cost rent:

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,040
The rent must correspond to the house's operating costs.

77
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,800
The problem is that all costs for SFV to manage and run the premises

78
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,880
has increased, and because of the rental model they are plus on the rent.

79
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,720
All costs end up on the rent, even major local renovations.

80
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,280
The rent on the building can increase by 50 percent.

81
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,200
The increase will include: Because they build a lift to the entrance.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,480
Because according to the agreement with SFV, the Dramaten itself will pay for renovations.

83
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
It will be added on next year's rent.

84
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
The new elevator is double bad news for Dramaten.

85
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,760
Height rent, and so women must now share a lift with Ã–rjan Ramberg again.

86
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,880
It is apparently tough.

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,560
The drama received a 50 percent rent increase due to an elevator!

88
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,760
Then think what happens to the opera's rent about SFV in the end:

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,400
Celesting roofs, leaking pipes, flies in the tap and poop smell.

90
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,160
Such plans exist, but can cost several billion.

91
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,800
It will be a huge damn rent increase.

92
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,680
It has already happened to another of The Big Five: National Museum.

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,920
The rent for SFV includes the costs of the newly renovated premises

94
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,360
And make large holes in the museum's budget.

95
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Staff have been terminated and exhibitions have been canceled.

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,880
It would be sad if one is not prepared to bet money

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,200
so that it is enough for a reasonable business.

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,000
You can choose between large holes in the ceiling or large holes in the budget.

99
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,000
The National Museum's rent is so high that they may be forced to close for good.

100
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,520
Do you understand what this means? We kill the culture.

101
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,280
We risk losing magnificent cultural experiences

102
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,440
As the opera "Where is my sandwich?"

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,320
You think you know where the sandwich is - and poff! So they sow doubt.

104
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,160
Art can really ask the big questions.

105
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,680
Cost rent is not sustainable, and the government has realized this.

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,560
They will investigate a new rental model. But it seems bark in another direction.

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,240
A review of the rental model has recently been conducted.

108
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,520
The investigation proposes a transition to market rent

109
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,280
And thus the same rental model for all properties with cultural activities.

110
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Voldemort here ... sorry, he who must not be mentioned by name.

111
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,120
The Big Five will receive the same rental model as SFV's other tenants.

112
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,480
Thus, market rent. But tenants with market rent

113
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,240
Seems to have it even tougher.

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,520
In September, the BlÃ¥sar Symphonics leave the Musical Quarter in Stockholm

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,400
where one has been in twelve years

116
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,000
After SFV in Christmas announced a strong rent increase.

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Now the music has been silenced in Sweden's oldest concert hall

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,680
Because the BlÃ¥sar Symphonics cannot afford the rent, which was increased by 60 %.

119
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,440
Thank you and hello, poor orchestra. You may take your bass violins and flutes

120
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,160
And go home where you came from. StrÃ¤ngnÃ¤s, maybe.

121
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,960
Not the person, or Ikea's affordable candle holder.

122
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,880
The town of StrÃ¤ngnÃ¤s! Well, you are from Skaraborg?

123
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,720
I should understand that when you danced one way, then the other way.

124
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,080
No no no! No applause. It is Per Andersson's script.

125
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,280
In the market rent model, SFV sets the rent after

126
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,880
What they could get in an open market.

127
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,239
If a concert hall has an attractive location, such as central Stockholm

128
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,440
So the rent becomes very high, and there is probably a logic.

129
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,640
The state can house a really big O'Learys there instead.

130
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,360
But many cultural properties are built for what they are used for.

131
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,760
The Royal Opera is an opera, you can't have it for much else.

132
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,800
And the opera cannot move. We only have one royal opera house.

133
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,880
Market logic does not go together. Same with the National Museum.

134
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,000
But it doesn't really seem to have gone up for SFV.

135
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,280
What do you do about the National Museum forced to evacuate?

136
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,480
What should you have the property for?

137
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,600
I haven't thought about that, I really hope

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,680
that the National Museum may retain its fine business.

139
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,560
You believe that the National Museum will continue to be the National Museum

140
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,040
In the National Museum's own premises? Yes, that sounds reasonable.

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,520
But why should government institutions have to get on your knees

142
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,760
Because a state authority requires them on sky -high rents?

143
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,280
Like the state renovating itself. A self -harm behavior.

144
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Several stage art dealers come back to what they describe as

145
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,920
A KAFKA-ARTER MONOPOL GAME. Tax money moves back and forth.

146
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,320
Through an authority, the state makes a new performance.

147
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,640
Then the state raises the rent through another authority

148
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,760
so the theater must take from the same money and return

149
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,880
to cover the rent increase.

150
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,600
Did you hang out? Client, landlord, tenant, victim, perpetrator

151
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Everyone involved turns out to be the state itself!

152
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,480
It was one and the same person all the time. What a plot twist!

153
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,160
It was eerily like the end of the opera "Where is my sandwich?"

154
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,320
It emerged that the sandwich had been in the wardrobe all the time.

155
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,280
At least the kids in the salon got goose bumps.

156
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,920
The last place to look for a sandwich. In the kitchen maybe ...

157
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,600
But why does SFV do this?

158
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,360
Well, for some reason I do not understand, they are imposed on a profit requirement.

159
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,560
They have to generate profit to the state

160
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,680
And their way of doing it is through rents, and this is good.

161
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,880
Last year the profit requirement was SEK 97 million

162
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,440
But they pulled in over half a billion.

163
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,560
Don't tell this to StrÃ¤ngnÃ¤s!

164
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,320
But I have a populist suggestion: Take that money and spend the culture.

165
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,600
Make a new sandwich show or make sure it stops smelling poop at the opera.

166
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,360
Or one can imagine a world

167
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,840
where some selected cultural properties completely avoid the rent.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,160
That it is seen as a higher value for society

169
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,400
That these institutions are doing well.

170
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,840
But such a special treatment is not SFV, you think? Yes, sometimes.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,040
Through the over 200 -year -old agreement

172
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,360
Does the royal family need not pay rents, renovations

173
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,280
or operating costs where they live. The taxpayers must stand for it.

174
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,120
SFV must treat the opera and our other cultural institutions

175
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,200
A little more like the king - big letters, pictures in the books.

176
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,160
Let them avoid the absurd carousel of profit requirements and market rents.

177
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,960
This performance with an oppressive, greedy authority

178
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,120
And a dilapidated and terrified opera house must come to an end.

179
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,560
Release the opera free from the Tyranni of the Property Agency

180
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Before the curtain goes down for good.

181
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,920
I got goose bumps again. Take care of you, and we'll see you in a week.

182
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,040
There is my sandwich!

183
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,520
SWEDISH SUNTING: M TAKALA & C EngstrÃ¶m @ Sveriges Television AB 2023

184
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,280
Huh?
