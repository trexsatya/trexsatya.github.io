1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,560
The best thing that can happen is that the electricity continues to flow-

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,600
-And there will be no major power outages.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:19,240
Even in the best possible scenario, electricity prices will be very high.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,400
The worst thing that can happen is that we get to see some electrical outbreaks-

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,880
-In a way we are not used to.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Secondly, we can see very high electricity prices.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,400
Much higher than now.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,720
The consequences that can be almost insultable.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,640
We can end up in new types of conflict-

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,560
-With other European countries.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,520
We can also see new types of protest movements.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,240
More and more militant protests against rampant prices.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,000
As a historian, I'm a little worried about this-

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,240
-who, that when we look back on the crises of ancient times

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,600
-To there is a clear connection between high prices on food and energy on the one hand-

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,720
-and radical events such as the French Revolution-

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,440
-or the Russian Bolshevitic Revolution-

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,040
-So there is every reason to take such a scenario seriously.
