1
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,040
These are actually my home neighborhoods.

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,800
I lived for many years just above Karlberg Castle.

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,360
So I've been very much here-

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,080
- Run Karlberg and the castle park, the lawn here by the water.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,960
So I really feel at home here.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,840
I was 24 years old.

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,200
We were based in the Sinai desert in Egypt, and suddenly Israel invades southern Lebanon.

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,640
The UN quickly decides in the Security Council to form a new UN force: Unifil.

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,720
We are regrouped into southern Lebanon.

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,560
In Lebanon it was a war -like situation where there was a fight in several different places -

11
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,160
- And where we also were exposed to direct or indirect shooting.

12
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,760
So it was a completely different situation with many uncertain elements.

13
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,360
Already in the first week there was a shock message.

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,120
We were then told that a patrol -

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
- As was out driving with a terrain car had gone on a mine.

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,040
The boss in that patrol, fan junker Karl-Oskar Johansson-

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
- Howed dead by a minsp.

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,160
It was a very heavy message, and I will never forget the collection -

19
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,440
- We had at the company headquarters where we received an account for what had happened.

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,920
There were those who signed a contract to go to Sinai and do that assignment -

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,720
- As did not want to remain.

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,320
There were such.

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,960
But in the end, everyone stopped but a few.

24
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,880
There were a few who moved back to Sinai.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,720
Most others, most of the strength, which was over 240 men -

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,520
—The elected to stay in Lebanon and complete the assignment -

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
- which was to prepare for other nations that took over.

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,120
We do not see any rescue workers, there is no clearing ...

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,600
... is also a show of the very latest in Russian military technology ...

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,280
... the militia Maap's closest roadblock ...

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,600
... this tape -moving artillery piece ...

32
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,120
... there a child was killed and another seven people were injured.

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,240
After Lebanon, I decided.

34
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,040
One of the reasons was precisely that I met many foreign correspondents -

35
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,320
- As I got to guide through my position,

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,040
I thought this was a great way to continue traveling.

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,120
Because it was very loss of travel that drove me -

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,400
- Both regarding international military service and also journalism.

39
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,760
Physically speaking, I have been badly out twice.

40
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
One time was in present Congo-

41
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,160
- Where we ended up in crossfire and were shot.

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,320
My photographer got a ball that went straight through the leg.

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,960
We managed to put a bandage on the injury -

44
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,680
- And, thanks to us being educated, get him to care.

45
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,520
The second occasion was in Bosnia -

46
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,520
- Where we drove a car from Pale, the Bosnian Services headquarters, down towards Sarajevo.

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,000
When we round a mountain bump, there are three masked men -

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,080
- With dark clothes and masks and aims at my face and tries to stop us.

49
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,920
But we had already discussed conceivable scenarios and agreed -

50
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,040
- If we would drive and then you push into the car from behind.

51
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,040
The rear window disappears, it turns some bullets into the plate -

52
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,120
- And I feel I have been met.
 But it is a superficial injury.

53
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,960
It goes outside the ribs, and eventually gets stuck in the arm.

54
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,240
When traveling in this type of area -

55
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,240
- Conflict or disaster areas, so I think it's partly the same type-

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,120
–As people who are drawn to these areas because they want to make an effort -

57
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,000
- And they want to be where they really affect.

58
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,840
It can be journalists, aid workers or doctors -

59
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,320
–And even soldiers who go out to make a mission-

60
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,480
- Therefore, you think you can do useful.

61
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,080
"Today during the morning Karlsson and I go into a burial ground and look."

62
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,640
"All graves are shredded or broken."

63
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,120
"The graves are plundered."

64
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,120
"Many chests are opened and the corpses are completely visible."

65
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,720
"We photograph and leave."

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,120
It has certainly shaped me a lot as a human being, the experiences -

67
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,120
- And you learn a lot about yourself when you end up in stressful situations.

68
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,880
Then you are put to the test and learn a lot about yourself.

69
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,920
So it was definitely an effect of that service.

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,760
I remember a scene already from Arlanda when we landed and sat in a bus -

71
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,960
- I think it was against Strängnäs, P10, and would disrupt.

72
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,240
Then comes a white truck and everyone says -

73
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,160
-"Yeah, a UN car", "There comes the supplian", someone shouts and jokes.

74
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Then we dismiss - and then it was over.

75
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,080
After all, there was no readiness at that time to take care of people -

76
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,640
- Which has been involved in traumatic experiences, but we just went home.

77
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,640
I felt a little lost from the beginning.

78
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,720
After having come home from an extremely dramatic period -

79
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,280
- Getting home to Sweden where it didn't happen that much.

80
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,720
It was a restructuring period.

81
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
Before Christmas I went, for the first time ever -

82
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,160
- For I had time left and bonus points to do away with, and looked where I could get?

83
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,240
I looked where I could come?
 Yes, Beirut.

84
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,640
So I flew to Beirut and was there for a week as a tourist -

85
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,120
- For the first time, and it was pretty cool because I like Lebanon.

86
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,840
It is an incredibly complicated -

87
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,640
- And right now quite tragic country because there is so much that goes the wrong path.

88
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,120
But I like the people there, they live as well as for the day.

89
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,160
They may have to do it.

90
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,640
My name is Stefan Borg.

91
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,320
I am a foreign veteran.
