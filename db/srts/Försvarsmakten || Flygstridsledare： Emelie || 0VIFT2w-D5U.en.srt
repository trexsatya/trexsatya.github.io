00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07.920
An ordinary day at work starts about half past eight in the morning

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,360
with a morning briefing where we go through today's weather,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,400
What the systems look like and what kind of business we should have.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,080
Then we have four to five passes in the combat management center.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,800
For example, a pass for us may be a four against four

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,520
Where there are four own aircraft and four opposing planes.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,800
My task then is to inform my aircraft

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,640
About how the opponents behave, how they fly,

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
what speed, what height, because my pilots

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
in the best way should be able to act on it.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,080
The more aircraft it is on the screen, the more that happens

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,880
the more tagged you will be to solve it

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,920
And give the best possible you can.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,600
My name is Emelie and I work as a flight combat leader.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,880
The best thing about being air combat leaders is clearly my colleagues.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,720
I always have fun at work.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,200
To feel that I am contributing to Sweden's defense and

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
The development of Sweden's defense makes me proud.
