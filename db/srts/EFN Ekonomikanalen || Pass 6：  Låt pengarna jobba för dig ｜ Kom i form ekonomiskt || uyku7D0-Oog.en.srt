1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03.560
Saving should be about. Some have 0 when the month is over.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,440
I have to keep track of my finances - now.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,120
Mia Ingelström is not only an economist, she is also a personal trainer in economics.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,320
You hear. Should we start?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,920
-Yeah, Mia, look here… -What nicely.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't think about this. It is nothing.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,240
Hello and welcome to the section "Let the money work for you".

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,720
Is it about leaning back, the money is working and you are becoming richer?

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,160
That's how it is. Once you have put your strategy and started doing after this, it feels that way.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,600
Excellent. We will talk about how to make a strategy for their savings.

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,160
We will talk about fund fees and something called Fondrobot.

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02.960
Have you heard of it? I don't have that.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,480
Saving should be about. Not everyone can save.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
When the month is over, it's 0.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,600
I claim that most of us can save.

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,200
But on the basis of one's own conditions.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,440
Not everyone can save several thousand, but a few hundred most people can put away.

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,640
We have previously learned to increase income and reduce expenditure.

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,160
-There is quite a lot to work with. -It doesn't have to be that much.

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,360
Now we will start saving. You cannot do that in a payroll account.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,120
There it is SEK 0. Then you have to enter the stock exchange and so there.

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,920
It depends on when to use what you save.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,680
When you are going to use the money ... we look at these buckets a bit.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,160
-No, what's this ...? -The certainly are they good? Fun buckets.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02.080
Krishink - buffer. If anything really shits ...

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,480
Something happens. You become unemployed or ill. You have to pay the bills.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,600
-Then you don't want to take an SMS loan. -Hund gets sick ...

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,280
You also do not want to sell fund shares that may have gone down a lot.

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,080
This money should be in a savings account.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
-No stock exchange for that money. -Okay.

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,360
The one -year bucket is what to do extra for a year.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,600
You have decided to go on vacation and really want it to happen.

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,160
Then you need money in that bucket. They should also be in savings account.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,880
You want it to get rid of and want that money to be there.

35
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,280
In the five -year bucket you can start to take some risk for the money.

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,440
The higher the risk you take, the greater the opportunity for higher returns you have.

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52.560
Higher risk - higher interest rates.

38
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57.560
Five years are quite a short time interval anyway.

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,480
It may be an apartment effort, that you should study or have children.

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,680
You can't afford to take too high risk. Middle high risk for the money in the five -year bucket.

41
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,920
Then comes the pension and future bucket.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,760
It is probably quite a long way to retire.

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,600
Not in your case, then ... but long time for the socket.

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,840
This is extra money for retirement. It's not the same as the orange envelope.

45
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,560
You need to save extra for your pension. Most of us need to do that.

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,240
In the future bucket there are over. Once you have started filling up the other-

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,120
-Can there be money left that you can spend in the longer term.

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46.560
-I will not be able to fill up everyone. -No. Not from the beginning.

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,960
You should always start with this bucket. You should try to fill it up.

50
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00.040
Preferably money for three months of expenses. It helps you sleep well.

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02.600
You should start thinking about the future as well.

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08.600
A couple of hundreds in this one month is probably enough if you start early-

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,440
-To to save good capital.

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,560
Then you can start decorating in the different based on your time horizon and what you want to do.

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,600
This is a strategy. You will not fill all of them.

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,040
But it gives you a clue about how to invest the money.

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,520
-This are regular accounts only? -Spark account.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,480
-This I can't ... -Here you can take help from the bank ...

59
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,800
… To find out how to invest the money.

60
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,160
This is money that is going into the stock exchange, but at different risk.

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,400
Either you hear from your bank and ask what types of funds you should have-

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,000
-Which fits the buckets, or you use a fund robot.

63
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00.880
-A Fondrobot is… -The thing we're talking about it we'll sit down.

64
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03.920
This seems to be a lot ... I'm retired.

65
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09.640
Mia ...

66
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,200
-Fondrobot? -Exciting.

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,240
I haven't heard about that until today. Tell us what it is.

68
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,200
It is a shortcut so that you do not have to choose which funds to buy.

69
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,920
It helps you get started. It is a lower threshold to enter the stock exchange.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,440
-Is it a website? -The banks have their own fund robots.

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,200
Other institutes also offer fund robots.

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,440
You say: "I want to invest this money for such a long time."

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,760
Then you get suggestions on what to buy. The fees are clear.

74
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,760
-But ... -it's getting easier. A shortcut.

75
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,160
-Now we are in on fees. -It is important.

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,160
Each fund costs money.

77
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,680
If it is actively managed, someone is sitting and buying and selling-

78
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,520
-To it often costs more. If it is passively managed, it follows an index-

79
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,800
-Is it often lower fee. The fee is of great importance for how much money you receive.

80
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,720
It eats a fairly large part of the return.

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,720
-What are we talking for percentage? -Allting below 0.5 %...

82
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,480
… Are pretty low fees. When it starts ticking up over-

83
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,080
-Do you know why you want to own that fund.

84
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,320
You can choose it, but you should know why.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,440
"Hello Mia! I'm eager to start saving on the stock exchange. When is the good place to start?"

86
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,280
Now, if you are craving. It is always good to start saving on the stock exchange.

87
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,320
Now is a good location on the stock exchange if you know your strategy

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,280
-So what money you can save in the long term.

89
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,280
If you can afford to delay money-

90
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,720
-And know how much you can put in, it is good to insert them per month.

91
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12.560
You can save monthly. Then you buy funds both when they are a little more expensive and cheaper.

92
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,040
Why not start saving for your extra pension.

93
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,960
Get started and take a few hundred a month. Start now.

94
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,200
Start stock market already today. If you want.

95
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,920
What a tasty section. I have learned that you have to have a strategy with savings.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,960
Some should have a regular savings account.

97
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,880
The money you should have in a little longer term, have them in funds.

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Take the help of a fund robot, I have learned.

99
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,160
If the fees are a little higher, you should know why they are.

100
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,760
-Super good! -I can do this now. Bye!

101
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,920
-I could do well, right? -Super good.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00.400
-I'm proud. -I can hold it. You don't have to come.
