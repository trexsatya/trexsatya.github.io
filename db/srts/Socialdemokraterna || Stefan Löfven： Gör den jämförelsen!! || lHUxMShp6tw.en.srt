1
00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:03.360
Thanks, Mrs. President No, here is not blamed anything.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.373
But it is very important to compare.

3
00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:11.915
Then we will compare in the defense area.
 What did it look like then, during the bourgeois government

4
00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:14.776
What does it look like now makes that comparison!

5
00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:17.991
Make comparison with investments in the judiciary

6
00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:27.716
Make comparisons in terms of laws, where we tighten 50 laws and before 20 new crime classifications

7
00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:33.797
There was nothing in the office drawers when we took office from the bourgeois government.

8
00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:36.134
That comparison must be made.

9
00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:41.271
I am proud of the fact that Sweden has one of Europe's strongest economies

10
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:48.011
And that we could take on the pandemic in a way that few countries could do because we have such a strong economy.

11
00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:56.826
I am still equally obsessed with fighting crime, and we see that results can be achieved in, for example, MalmÃ¶.

12
00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:58.726
But we have to do much, much more.

13
00:00:58.726 --> 00:01:03.360
Then we have to have more police officers, and that is what this government makes sure it is.
