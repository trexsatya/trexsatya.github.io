00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:22.629
Hello and welcome to a new vlog.

2
00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:26.641
I am actually on my way from home now

3
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:34.239
And will go to TC to go to Ljusne and work a weekend with the little bridge.

4
00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.077
Tomorrow I know it will be partying.

5
00:00:38.077 --> 00:00:40.591
Johan turned 22.

6
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:45.443
It is completely sick, so he turned 22 on March 17.

7
00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:48.938
So tomorrow it will be a little minical for Johan.

8
00:00:48.938 --> 00:00:52.235
Then we'll see what it is off.

9
00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:54.860
I've been working all day today.

10
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.456
It has been a packed week and it will be a packed weekend I think.

11
00:00:59.456 --> 00:01:05.921
But I will also take the opportunity to work a little what the computer on the way to Ljusne and be a little time efficient.

12
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:10.896
See you when I'm there.
 I have to hurry to the subway.

13
00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:51.381
Now I have come to Söderhamn.

14
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.746
Mom is here too and will pick me up soon.

15
00:01:54.746 --> 00:02:00.145
The train journey went well.
 I sat and worked most of the road.

16
00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:05.048
Then I chilled a little with Youtube and snacks.

17
00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:08.780
This with filming yourself while people check ...

18
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.795
I am very tired.

19
00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:16.961
It is half past nine now and if I feel right I will not be able to film so much tonight.

20
00:02:16.961 --> 00:02:20.511
It's not so much that will happen either.
 I know Johan is safe and sleeping.

21
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:28.611
He will surely be mad at me and not listen to a single thing I say the first few hours.

22
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:33.463
So I think now it's free Friday night for little me.

23
00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:36.507
See you tomorrow morning.
 See ya.
 Hello

24
00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.856
Good morning.

25
00:02:38.856 --> 00:02:39.920
Good morning.

26
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.833
Saturday.

27
00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:43.021
What time did we woke up today

28
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:45.021
Four

29
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:47.847
I feel really good for having a party today.

30
00:02:47.847 --> 00:02:49.461
"Giant Pig".

31
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.093
Yes what is happening now

32
00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:53.528
It's like ...

33
00:02:53.528 --> 00:03:00.000
I have worked all week so the night I have sleep tomorrow I always sleep at least ten hours.

34
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.905
Yes and Johan sleeps like a prince in his new room.

35
00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:06.845
Just what has happened since the last vlog?

36
00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:12.194
We have equipped Johan's bedroom.

37
00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:15.221
So now it is no longer 200 teddy puh he has more

38
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.519
Without now, it is a mix between Nalle Puh and Hockey.

39
00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.777
We actually have Örebro's shl shirt hanging on the wall.

40
00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:26.780
Look at that

41
00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:30.272
So we have ...

42
00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:36.061
We will try to get together a complete SHL collection for that wall we thought.

43
00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:41.847
It is great fun because that room has looked the same for 15 years.
 Chaos

44
00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:45.078
Was it difficult for him to get used to it took a lot of time?

45
00:03:45.078 --> 00:03:51.739
Yes.
 Last time we arranged in his room so we removed maybe 200 Nalle Puh

46
00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.955
Then it took three weeks before he thought it was okay.

47
00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:57.640
Now we have removed 100 teddy puh

48
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.095
And now he is also angry.

49
00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:02.381
So he goes in there then he just sleeps but he does not go in there and plays.

50
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.513
Soon he will do that

51
00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:05.800
But he has the most important things he needs.

52
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.942
The paintings he likes, and so he has a card on grandma.

53
00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:11.763
That's what he needs to have.

54
00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:14.266
So God what good it was with tea cookies.

55
00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:15.216
I know

56
00:04:15.216 --> 00:04:17.678
I haven't eaten like that for any length of time.

57
00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:19.872
Thumbs up

58
00:04:19.872 --> 00:04:22.418
So today it is party.

59
00:04:22.418 --> 00:04:24.119
Then you should see.

60
00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:28.973
This is cute because it really is typically Johan.

61
00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:31.888
He cleaned what he thought was important.

62
00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:35.252
The tablet and teddy bear.

63
00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:37.097
Error everywhere here.

64
00:04:37.097 --> 00:04:41.867
We have heard that sound for 20 years it feels like.

65
00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:43.103
Yes.

66
00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:45.443
He gets a new teddy bear every year in Christmas.

67
00:04:45.443 --> 00:04:48.845
Oh I have a sandwich in my hair.

68
00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.676
Johan.
 Hello

69
00:05:11.676 --> 00:05:12.631
Can you wave

70
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.197
Hello you can wave

71
00:05:16.197 --> 00:05:17.133
To the camera.

72
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.764
Hello you want coffee

73
00:05:22.764 --> 00:05:23.264
Yes.

74
00:05:24.213 --> 00:05:26.661
Should you help pour in milk

75
00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:30.204
Should you help then come.

76
00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:33.189
Should you pour in

77
00:05:33.727 --> 00:05:34.844
Should you pour in

78
00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:40.000
Stop.
 Good oh how much it was.

79
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.141
But it was good, or how

80
00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.438
So bye

81
00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:46.641
What are you going to check out

82
00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:49.047
Want to check out the animals

83
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:50.567
Want to check out the animals

84
00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:53.788
What do you want to check out

85
00:05:54.773 --> 00:05:56.082
Want to check the dog

86
00:05:56.082 --> 00:05:56.596
Mh.

87
00:05:56.596 --> 00:05:57.096
Do you want that

88
00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:57.596
Mh.

89
00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.899
Look

90
00:06:00.436 --> 00:06:01.912
What are you watching

91
00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:03.912
No you look at the voff

92
00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:11.066
Hello, I'll see Highfive!

93
00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:38.981
Now haha ... I have just given Johan some porridge.

94
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:44.316
And as you can see here, I have the world's nicest little tiger.

95
00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:53.546
I was going to jump into the shower a little short and then take a walk with Johan.

96
00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:56.981
While they reveal a little at home and fix before the party.

97
00:06:56.981 --> 00:07:02.771
Then Johan will change and then it is Kalastime

98
00:07:04.812 --> 00:07:06.160
Double chin.

99
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.398
See you then when Johan and I go out for a walk I will take some cat therapy for so long.

100
00:07:17.609 --> 00:07:24.446
In addition to meeting Mom, Micke, Sebbe and Johan again, this is how cozy.

101
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:28.571
No, but the cat

102
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:29.718
Johan what should we do now

103
00:07:29.718 --> 00:07:31.718
Shall we pull the cord

104
00:07:31.718 --> 00:07:34.288
Ah okay.
 Should we wave then goodbye!

105
00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:37.380
Now we go for a walk.
 Bye

106
00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:42.578
We are on the walk

107
00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:46.173
Walkix.

108
00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:48.332
Where are we going

109
00:07:48.332 --> 00:07:50.332
We will pull the cord.

110
00:07:50.332 --> 00:07:54.370
Where are we going somewhere then we will press the button.

111
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.146
Where should we go to school yes!

112
00:07:58.146 --> 00:08:04.762
Ajjemen.
 There is thus a string or button that you can press to open the door.

113
00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:09.017
And open and close doors is Johan's specialty.

114
00:08:09.017 --> 00:08:12.484
So that he wants to go there so we go there.

115
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.064
There are tractors here and Johan thinks that is very fun.

116
00:08:44.504 --> 00:08:46.700
No but it was locked

117
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.385
Should we try to press the button then

118
00:08:48.385 --> 00:08:50.164
Try to press the button

119
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:53.336
Push the button.

120
00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:57.190
No it is broken.

121
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.096
Where are we going now then

122
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.065
What are we going to do now

123
00:09:33.065 --> 00:09:34.653
Now we will change.

124
00:09:34.653 --> 00:09:36.698
To some nice clothes.

125
00:09:36.698 --> 00:09:40.944
And then it gets partyed.
 Hello come here, we're going to change

126
00:09:40.944 --> 00:09:42.487
Come on now.

127
00:09:42.487 --> 00:09:45.461
Okay, Let's Go.

128
00:11:05.734 --> 00:11:09.298
Now I thought we would end this vlog.

129
00:11:09.298 --> 00:11:13.984
Now that we are in the middle of the party you have had to hang out with a little.

130
00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:19.187
But hello Johan we are not ready.
 We must try to finish on something here

131
00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:24.698
I really hope you liked this vlog and that it was nice that I mixed in a little more

132
00:11:24.698 --> 00:11:28.356
My way here and back and what it looks like for me and such.

133
00:11:28.356 --> 00:11:30.061
Johan can you wave

134
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:32.629
Okay.

135
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:34.300
Hello, in Guess.

136
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.765
Yes Johan was not so tagged in being involved in finishing this vlog

137
00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:43.321
So I have to do it myself then.
 I made a brave attempt anyway.

138
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:50.525
But I really hope you liked this vlog and that you like to see a little more how it is for me, on your way to and from Ljusne

139
00:11:50.525 --> 00:11:52.643
And what it looks like a little to me.

140
00:11:52.643 --> 00:11:56.632
And then when I'm at home with Johan and such.

141
00:11:56.632 --> 00:12:06.984
See you pretty soon again.
 I think I end now and then we will focus up here on Johan and have a little coffee and celebrate a little and such.

142
00:12:06.984 --> 00:12:10.439
Yes, hope that you are fine and we will see you soon.

143
00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:11.734
Bye
