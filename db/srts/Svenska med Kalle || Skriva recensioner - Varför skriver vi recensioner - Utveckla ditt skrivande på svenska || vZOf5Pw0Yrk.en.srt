Hello Hello

2
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:05.805
I got a question about

3
00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.865
I could make a movie about how to write

4
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:09.995
a review

5
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,065
and i'm pretty sure of

6
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15.605
that there are movies from

7
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:18,405
For example, SFI teachers and

8
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,445
Swedish as a second language teacher who is about how to write

9
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:22.535
a review

10
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:25,995
So I want to try to answer the question

11
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:28,595
In a slightly different way maybe

12
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:33,795
Because I think it's always an important issue to ask

13
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:37,105
Why do we write reviews

14
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,375
What is the meaning of a review

15
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,525
Who reads it and why does someone read

16
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:43,525
a review

17
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,315
Then I think a little about myself that

18
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:49.815
I am reading reviews sometimes, not a huge

19
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:52,735
in newspapers and online and so

20
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,745
And then I read reviews

21
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:58,745
because I want to discover new writers

22
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:01.905
or i want to find new books

23
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:03.560
or i might want to know

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07.235
How a new book is, if I have read

25
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,235
books by a writer and so have that writer

26
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:13.565
released a new book, published a new book

27
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:17,395
Then I want to know if that book is good

28
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,645
what it is about, about it is the same

29
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22.605
as previous books or about

30
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:25,015
The author has written in a new way and such

31
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:28,745
So you might say that is the summary of that is the summary

32
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:32,235
of why do you write reviews, JO

33
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:35.905
because a reader

34
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:39,315
Reads the reviews because that person

35
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:41,225
Am curious
