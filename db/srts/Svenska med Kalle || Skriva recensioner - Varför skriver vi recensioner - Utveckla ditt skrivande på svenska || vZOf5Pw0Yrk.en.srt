00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:01,885
Hello Hello

2
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:05,805
I got a question about

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,865
I could make a movie about how to write

4
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:09,995
a review

5
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,065
and i'm pretty sure of

6
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,605
that there are movies from

7
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:18,405
For example, SFI teachers and

8
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,445
Swedish as a second language teacher who is about how to write

9
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:22,535
a review

10
00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:25,995
So I want to try to answer the question

11
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:28,595
In a slightly different way maybe

12
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:33,795
Because I think it's always an important issue to ask

13
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:37,105
Why do we write reviews

14
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,375
What is the meaning of a review

15
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,525
Who reads it and why does someone read

16
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:43,525
a review

17
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,315
Then I think a little about myself that

18
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:49,815
I am reading reviews sometimes, not a huge

19
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:52,735
in newspapers and online and so

20
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,745
And then I read reviews

21
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:58,745
because I want to discover new writers

22
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:01,905
or i want to find new books

23
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:03,560
or i might want to know

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,235
How a new book is, if I have read

25
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,235
books by a writer and so have that writer

26
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:13,565
released a new book, published a new book

27
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:17,395
Then I want to know if that book is good

28
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,645
what it is about, about it is the same

29
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,605
as previous books or about

30
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:25,015
The author has written in a new way and such

31
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:28,745
So you might say that is the summary of that is the summary

32
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:32,235
of why do you write reviews, JO

33
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:35,905
because a reader

34
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:39,315
Reads the reviews because that person

35
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:41,225
Am curious

36
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:44,965
the author who has written the book or the book itself

37
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:46,755
or both

38
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,845
And you also read reviews

39
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,825
some in any case, because it is a kind

40
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,655
Talks about books going on

41
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:59,405
in newspapers and on

42
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:02,075
Internet, on different websites

43
00:02:02,445 --> 00:02:05,875
So that writers write books

44
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:08,825
Critics and reviewers

45
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:11,285
Reads and reacts and discusses

46
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,385
The books and

47
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:17,375
We who are ordinary readers, we read the books we read

48
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,325
the reviews and this helps us to

49
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:23,375
think and understand and discuss

50
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,225
the books, it gives us, so to speak, a

51
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:28,975
bigger and more profound

52
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:30,875
understanding of what we read

53
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:34,855
It's like the point I think, as I said

54
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,825
In other contexts: to write

55
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,975
is to talk, write is communication

56
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:42,355
With readers

57
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:45,995
and reviews are a way to

58
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:48,055
yes

59
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,435
discuss

60
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:53,055
Books, discuss

61
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:56,505
literature by writing about it, both to

62
00:02:57,145 --> 00:03:00,115
other writers and perhaps the author himself

63
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:03,515
Reads reviews and the gears read the review

64
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:06,325
and that makes

65
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,565
We get a richer understanding

66
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,315
a richer picture of

67
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:15,115
the books we read and the authors we read

68
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:18,655
So this I think you should have

69
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:22,035
in the head, one should think about this

70
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,955
When writing a review, of course, you can get a list

71
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,655
on what should be with, there is certainly

72
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,535
that you should bring a little about the action

73
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,575
Tell us a little about the writer, say what you think

74
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:36,615
absolutely, but why should you bring it

75
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:40,025
Well because the one who reads your review

76
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:43,085
is curious about the writer and or

77
00:03:43,085 --> 00:03:45,725
The book and also

78
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,715
Maybe the person is interested in reading this book

79
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:51,695
self and then want to know if it is a good book

80
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:54,535
and if the book fits him or her

81
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,245
so it is clear that one needs to know

82
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,925
a little about the action in the book in order to be able to

83
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:03,365
decide if it is a book

84
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:06,445
as I want to read and then you can't tell a little

85
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:09,395
because then it becomes uninteresting, that only

86
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:12,295
Write: The book is about love

87
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:15,175
It is far too general;
 It gives me

88
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:18,545
no picture of what the book is all about and to say

89
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:21,725
The book is about a couple that first becomes happy

90
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:23,505
And you think it will be great

91
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:26,565
for them but then they become unhappy and at the end so

92
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,915
they kill each other

93
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:32,105
Then you tell you too much, that is, you can't tell

94
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,365
anything about what is happening in the book or exactly what is happening

95
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,445
Without you have to tell you a little

96
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,705
you have to give a tastes, a feeling

97
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:44,825
Small clues

98
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:46,475
You need to suggest

99
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:49,765
what the book is all about in an approximately

100
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:52,905
So that I can think: Yes, this sounds interesting, this is a

101
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:56,035
story I am interested in

102
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:58,615
This is a topic or theme that interests me

103
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:02,255
So one can generally talk about theme

104
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:05,575
and give examples of about what the action is

105
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:08,835
and also tell me a little about what style

106
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:11,395
the book is written in, is like

107
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,965
is it simple language, is the difficult language

108
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:16,935
is it very poetic, is it

109
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:19,515
just telling, it can make

110
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:22,225
I get more curious or less curious

111
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:25,165
On a book, I might be craving a challenge

112
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,855
and want to read something difficult or I might just

113
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:31,085
want something easy and entertaining to read

114
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,285
So it's interesting to pick up, the style of the book

115
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:35,525
And the language

116
00:05:35,855 --> 00:05:39,025
and even the genre, if you can

117
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:42,025
tell about which genre book belongs to

118
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:45,155
is it a realistic novel

119
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:47,985
is that a historical story, is that

120
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:51,680
a romantic story, is that a horror story

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,140
Is it about the future, science fiction

122
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:58,835
and so on, it also helps the reader to

123
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:01,825
Some readers may be like this: I think

124
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:04,865
best about imagination / fantasy

125
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,965
books, so I want to read about that

126
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,975
but realistic books I am not so interested in

127
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,080
so tell us something about which genre it is

128
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,640
then happy to say something about the writer

129
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,825
Either you present the writer a little

130
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:24,925
Then you think the reader is not aware

131
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:25,925
The author since before

132
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:29,265
But is it a famous writer then maybe it's better to

133
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:32,095
say a little about how this one

134
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:34,995
the book, the new book is relate to

135
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,975
Books and styles

136
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:41,265
As this writer has written before

137
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:44,095
and then you have to

138
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:47,195
have some control over that writer but that

139
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:50,175
may be of interest to the reader that now has

140
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:53,115
the writer it and it suddenly wrote

141
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:55,825
A science pocket book

142
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:59,315
He or she has never done that before.
 It does

143
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:02,725
he or she good or it makes them bad

144
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:04,675
so

145
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,935
maybe not good / bad but how

146
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:11,265
works this new style, this new genre

147
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,765
for the author who has written in a different way than before.
 It's interesting.

148
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,745
For a curious reader to read about

149
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:21,885
And then you usually say that

150
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:24,655
A review should contain a review

151
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:27,685
You should say what you think about the book

152
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:30,645
and of course it is interesting

153
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:31,800
sometimes

154
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,465
but it depends a little on

155
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:40,075
It is interesting if you can explain why

156
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,965
you think the book is good or bad

157
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:46,615
And it might be more interesting to try

158
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:50,255
So to say explain to the reader that if you are interested

159
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:53,005
of this and this you will

160
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,655
Enough like it, if you appreciate

161
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:58,825
such books this is a book for you

162
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:02,415
It's not that interesting what you really think

163
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,185
The interesting thing is what readers

164
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,795
may like the book or what

165
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:10,935
The reader may feel if he or she reads the book

166
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:15,595
There is an exception, if you are one

167
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,695
Famous reviewer who writes many reviews

168
00:08:18,695 --> 00:08:21,755
and many read your reviews

169
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,835
Then the reader may have a

170
00:08:24,855 --> 00:08:27,975
relationship with that particular reviewer

171
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:29,205
so that

172
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,065
For example, I.

173
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:34,425
is interested in what exactly the

174
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,765
The reviewer likes

175
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,115
a book or something

176
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,725
so then it is a little more interesting that what

177
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,865
that person thinks, but if you are so to speak

178
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:50,475
Don't write reviews often

179
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:53,005
So I don't know anything about your taste

180
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:56,045
and what you appreciate and do not appreciate

181
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:58,745
And then it is not very interesting what exactly you think about the book

182
00:08:58,745 --> 00:09:01,845
I want to have a chance to guess more

183
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,335
What I will like the book

184
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,775
But it can still be involved and

185
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:09,805
We practice writing reviews

186
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:11,105
Personal reviews

187
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,455
Of course, some

188
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,765
of what a review

189
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,120
may contain

190
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,995
And then you can, too, if you have

191
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,755
More space, want to write a longer review

192
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:28,775
so you can also turn into it

193
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:31,465
as more becomes real

194
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:34,105
Genuine criticism

195
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:37,205
And then I do not mean criticism that criticizes

196
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:40,495
Without criticism like putting the book in relationship

197
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:43,615
To other books and other authors

198
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,165
to describe

199
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:48,505
and examine and analyze how the book

200
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,635
relate

201
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:52,585
to politics and society

202
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,645
and religion and psychology thus

203
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:58,695
put the text and writer

204
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:01,615
and the book in relation to

205
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:04,185
other things in history and society

206
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:07,445
And then the purpose is to

207
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:10,585
give the reader a deeper

208
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:11,805
Function of the book

209
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:15,115
I can sometimes do so that if I read

210
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,945
A book that I find interesting, but I may not

211
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:20,795
understands everything or i want to deepen my understanding

212
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:21,795
of the book

213
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,955
Then I look at reviews after I

214
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:27,565
have read the book because they might be able to

215
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,695
give me

216
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:30,635
Insights about

217
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:33,615
what the writer has thought or

218
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:36,705
In which context, in which context like this

219
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:37,705
the text

220
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,275
have come to how it is to be understood

221
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:44,795
So it can also be interesting

222
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:47,505
Then you need more space

223
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:50,585
one needs to be able to write more

224
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:53,515
Should you write a fairly short review then you just have

225
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:56,375
little space for such in -depth

226
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,865
comments or analysis-

227
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:01,865
parts, analyze the text

228
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,115
so that

229
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:06,895
The reader can get help to, yes, get a

230
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:09,075
deeper understanding of the text simply

231
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,865
But it's really the most fun

232
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,555
to get to that step, to really

233
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:18,135
Start thinking about yourself, what is this text about

234
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:21,045
what does it stand in relationship

235
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:22,915
to for others

236
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,900
texts and things outside the text

237
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,685
So please test it a little

238
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,875
If your teacher says that;
 Write as much as you want

239
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,485
Try to write a little more

240
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:38,835
in -depth about what this book is about

241
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:42,185
But the most important thing is, as I said, what I said at the beginning

242
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:45,075
Try to give the reader of your review

243
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:48,405
a sense of what the text is about

244
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:50,915
of which style and genre this is

245
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:53,315
what kind of writer

246
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:57,005
and something to help the reader understand

247
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:59,875
Does this book fit me or don't fit me

248
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,015
Then I think you will get a

249
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,335
will write a good review

250
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:10,235
Yes, these were my tips;
 not so much

251
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:13,105
grammar or sentences or phrases now

252
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,105
Without more

253
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:16,185
How to think

254
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,825
When writing a text and in this case a review

255
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,265
So I hope this gave you some thoughts

256
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:25,275
or any ideas and

257
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:28,285
The discussion can, as always, continue in the comments

258
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:29,325
Down there

259
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,765
Write someone about what you think about reviews

260
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:36,480
Do you read reviews yourself, do you usually write reviews

261
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,640
What do you think about it

262
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,195
go for it

263
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:42,555
The comment field is yours

264
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:46,765
And then you will have a good time, so we will see you again soon

265
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:48,235
bye
