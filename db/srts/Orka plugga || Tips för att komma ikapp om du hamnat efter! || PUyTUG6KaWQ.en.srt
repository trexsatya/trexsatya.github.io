1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,920
Are you behind with your schoolwork?

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,240
Are your teachers reminding you about assignments 
you haven't even started?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,480
Right, reading log 2 needs to be done
by Tuesday. Make sure to hand it in.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,640
-What? I thought it was next Tuesday.
-No, this Tuesday.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,520
Perhaps you meant to study yesterday, but instead 
you hung out with a friend.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,680
It's easy to put things off until later.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,240
But the longer you wait, the harder it gets.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,160
Here are some tips for how to catch up if you're 
behind with your schoolwork.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
The big picture.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,680
Start by thinking through everything you need to do.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,960
List your assignments to make things clear.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,520
English is this week, right?

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,760
Write down when they're due and estimate 
how long you think they'll take.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,040
-Swedish, that was quite a lot.
-I'd say five days.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,800
When a task is done, tick it off.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,760
It's motivating to see that you're getting things done.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,120
Hang in there. Is your to-do list long?

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,600
Try to visualize how you'll feel when you're done.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,760
It might be intense right now, but try to see the bigger picture.

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,280
It might seem far away now, but you'll manage.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,520
Prioritize.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,640
A good way to start is to figure out 
what's urgent and what can wait.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,840
The chemistry test is important.
That's next Friday.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,600
Yes. And the second language test
and the reading log in English.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,120
Even if everything seems urgent, prioritize.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,680
Decide what to do first. You can't do everything at once.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Talk to your teacher if you get stuck.

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,800
Try to hand in all assignments on time.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,320
But if it seems impossible, talk to your teacher.

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,480
-We don't understand the assignment.
-We won't be done in time.

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,040
Perhaps, you'll get some guidance and 
help with how to get started.

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Start by describing Coraline...
