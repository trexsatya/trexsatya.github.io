1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,320
Feature stories share similarities with 
news articles, but are more descriptive.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,200
Describe the setting. 
How does it smell, feel, and look?

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,520
Anything that lets you create 
the scenario you want to describe.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,600
Use an attention-grabbing lead 
to make the reader want to read more.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,480
Keep this in mind 
when you're writing a feature story.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,520
Choose where to focus the story.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,800
What is the best way 
to say what you want to say?

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,080
Decide on settings and interviewees 
that are relevant within the context.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,480
Make sure to quote your interviewees 
as accurately as possible.

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,880
Record the interview, so you won't 
have to worry about forgetting something.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,760
Just jot down keywords to help you 
navigate the interview later.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,760
Experiment with the rhythm 
in your writing.

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,400
Mix long and short sentences, 
and don't repeat phrases.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,080
That makes reading the piece 
more enjoyable.
