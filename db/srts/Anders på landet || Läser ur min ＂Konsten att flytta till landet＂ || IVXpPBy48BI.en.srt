00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Already after a couple of weeks, small green balls appeared -

00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
where the rhubarb leaves stretched after the sun

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
Then came the drought.

00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,768
The muddy soil that I touched around solidified to a hard crust

5
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,168
And burst into a grid pattern so my rhubarb jam looked like the pictures from a drying disaster in Africa.
