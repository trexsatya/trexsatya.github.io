1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,720
Optimise your break to stay energised 
the whole school day

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,800
Have you run out of energy? 
Feeling tired and moody in class?

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,200
Thinking more about going home, 
not really listening to your teachers?

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,240
That's no surprise! 
Going to school is exhausting.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,520
After sitting in class for hours, 
where you have to stay focused-

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,440
-maybe all you want to do 
is go home, relax and take it easy.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,880
-When is class over? 
-In...25 minutes.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,440
It can be hard to sit still; 
hard not to talk to your friends-

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,120
-and hard to focus on the task at hand.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,520
That's it for today. 
Remember to push back your chairs.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,600
But your school timetable 
consists of more than just classes.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,560
You have breaks, too. 
So, make the most of them!

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,240
The easy option is to just sit down 
with your laptop or your phone-

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,360
-and play games 
or just scroll your time away.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
If your breaks tend to be sedentary, 
try to break that pattern.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,080
If you're active, you'll boost your mood 
and have more energy in class.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Want to join? 
We're going to play ping-pong.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,240
When you're active, 
chemicals in your brain are released-

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,520
-like serotonin and dopamine, 
and they help counteract depression.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,800
You not only get happier, 
but your memory can improve-

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,080
-your stress levels are reduced, 
and you'll sleep better.

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,800
Contemplate this: Do you feel better 
if you hang out with your friends-

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,280
-or would you benefit 
from being by yourself for a while?

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,160
My top tip for break activities is to play 
basketball and to be with your friends.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,920
So, in order to have more energy 
in class, make the most of your breaks.

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,840
Move about. Why not go outside 
and get some fresh air?

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,360
A short walk is often enough 
to get you energised.

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,960
If I sit indoors all day, 
being in class is so much more boring-

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,160
-and you lack the motivation 
to carry out the task at hand.

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,640
It feels great! Being active for a while 
makes it easier to concentrate in class.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,680
The best part about being active is-

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,560
-that you build motivation 
to do your schoolwork.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,680
The best part about being active is 
that you have more energy in class.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
You can work harder, 
because you have more energy.
