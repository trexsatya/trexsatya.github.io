1
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:46,951
Yes but exactly.
 No I agree.

2
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:50,289
Just now.
 Sure!

3
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:53,136
But you, what we talked about yesterday?

4
00:00:53,597 --> 00:00:56,461
Just.
 Do you have time with it now or?

5
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:01,262
No I think it feels like we ... I just want to get it done right away.

6
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:05,589
Great!
 Then I come by right away.

7
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:07,895
Just picked up also wanted so we're at you in a while.

8
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:11,817
Or by the way, run out and meet us instead and we will pick you up on the road.

9
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:14,061
Good, hello.

10
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:16,311
How's the guy?

11
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:18,228
Good.

12
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:23,672
Miss told us what had happened and that is nothing to care about, okay?

13
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:26,650
It is he who is stupid, right?

14
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,351
Have you done any fun in school today then?

15
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,550
Not so much.
 We were in the forest.

16
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,425
Cozy.
 Did you play and so?

17
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:53,826
We grilled sausages and Miss read some fairy tales.

18
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:58,213
Be good with sausage.
 What kind of fairy tales Miss read for you then?

19
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:00,101
Red Riding Hood.

20
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:02,338
Red hat, is it good?

21
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:03,563
But is it not a little uncomfortable when the wolf dresses up,

22
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:06,563
And does the Red Hood cheat in that way?

23
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:09,501
No, it's not at all.

24
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:12,538
Dad thinks that is really scary.

25
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:15,388
"Why do you have such big teeth?"

26
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:18,901
"It's because I can eat you!"

27
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:22,076
You old man, we'll just pick up Henrik a turn on the way home.

28
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,301
So should we fix one thing, is it okay?

29
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,576
Okay.

30
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:26,913
When does Bolibompa start?

31
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,326
Bolibompa starts at sex, we can get home to that.

32
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:32,488
Are we watching together later, right?

33
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:52,514
Hello!

34
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:53,514
Hello!

35
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:54,514
How's it going?

36
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,896
Yes, think it will be damn nice to get this done.

37
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,994
Yes I get it.

38
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,906
What about wanted then?
 Is it good?

39
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:01,906
Yes.

40
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,082
"Ville-Viking" right?

41
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,082
Yes.

42
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,533
Yes, "Ville-Viking".

43
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,279
Yes that is good.

44
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:08,279
Do you have the address or?

45
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,377
Yes I know where we are going.

46
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:11,679
It is good.

47
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,141
It is good.
 Damn wouldn't you sell this car by the way?

48
00:03:16,141 --> 00:03:17,200
Yeah absolutely.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,749
I posted an ad on the block as well.

50
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:21,455
But you are fucking a mail bomb by 7000 Mohammed jihad

51
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,475
Who will buy the car for nothing.

52
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:26,043
"I buy the car for one and 700 SEK"

53
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:29,043
No thanks that is SEK 30,000 in the ad.

54
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:31,749
"I buy the car for one and 700 SEK now!"

55
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:34,259
Yes it is completely senseless

56
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,494
You know I had a friend who would sell.

57
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:37,710
He posted his number.

58
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,004
It ended up with him having to change numbers.

59
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:41,494
They came home to him with their families,

60
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:45,749
, their goats and camels and all the crap they have.

61
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:51,847
Stands there and just “You sell!
 You sell a friend! ”
 Absolutely fucking incredible.

62
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:55,886
No.
 The blators should stick to baking kebab pizzas.

63
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:57,867
Well, they do it damn well.

64
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:59,475
Haha, that's damn true.
 But what if SD wins the election.

65
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:01,102
Then there is no more kebab pizza for us.

66
00:04:01,102 --> 00:04:06,475
But damn, wins SD, they are well allowed to introduce such a pizza test.

67
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:10,041
The immigrants who bake the best pizzas may promise to stay.

68
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,179
And you would sit in that jury then or?

69
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:15,963
Yes, you have squeezed a lot of pizzas in your days.
 You know that!

70
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,767
You know the Thai massage down here at the corner?

71
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:18,767
Yes.

72
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:21,375
It can be left, for that jury I would like to sit in.

73
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,492
Well.
 With happy endings then or?
 Do you like huh?

74
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:25,492
Happy endings?

75
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:27,653
Wanted is behind it.

76
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:30,806
Wanted, you wanted some Thai massage.

77
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:35,532
You had paid Thai massage Ville.
 So nice with Thai massage wanted!

78
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:37,414
Am i running wrong now or?

79
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:38,414
Where is it somewhere?

80
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:39,904
Grästorpsvägen.

81
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,434
Grästorpsvägen?

82
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:43,139
You know where we looked at that Saab a while ago.

83
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,139
Don't you remember that?

84
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,061
Yes Yes.
 It's right here.

85
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,179
It sure is.

86
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:49,571
Then you turn left there.

87
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:52,845
So I don't understand why you don't get GPS.

88
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:54,355
It's great!

89
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:57,100
GPS.
 I can't sit and peel with a computer while driving.

90
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,904
It is not certain.

91
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:01,943
Yes, but you come up anyway, right?
 Lol.

92
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,983
You I think it's time for us to play that game now.

93
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,100
Yes Yes.

94
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,179
Wanted, should we play hide and seek?

95
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:23,179
Yeah!

96
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:25,296
Then you must not look now, so you count to 50.

97
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:28,061
So we will two hide.
 Okay?

98
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,237
Should we do as we did last time or?

99
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:34,237
Yes.

100
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:39,865
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven…

101
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:43,571
You don't peek out now huh?
 Wanted to?

102
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:45,590
No, now you have to start over from one again so we have time to hide.

103
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,218
So you have to promise Dad that you close your eyes properly now.

104
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,375
Okay.

105
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,688
Not a peek now wanted, it is important!

106
00:05:56,296 --> 00:06:04,649
One two three four five,

107
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:13,786
six, seven, eight, nine,

108
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:21,943
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

109
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:27,434
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,

110
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:33,022
twenty, twenty -one, twenty -two, twenty -three,

111
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:39,159
Twenty -four, twenty -five, twenty -six, twenty -seven, twenty -eight…

112
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:41,198
Yes?

113
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:45,394
You, take and keep your fucking son in school!

114
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:15,976
It's quiet, it's quiet.
 No one is here.

115
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:21,722
Forty six, forty seven, forty eight.

116
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:24,349
Fifty!
 I see you!

117
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:28,898
No but?
 He found us right away too!

118
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:31,447
What a little racker we have back there.

119
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:35,251
You, you will have no more problems in kindergarten with Abdoul.

120
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:39,310
Should it be, you say.
 Promise it!

121
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,310
Mm.

122
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,525
Good.

123
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:45,271
Good work.

124
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:47,976
Yes damn well fought!

125
00:07:49,231 --> 00:07:51,114
Henrik: Damn you can let me off at the pizzeria later.

126
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:53,898
I got so damn craving for kebab pizza when we talked about it before.

127
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:55,937
Dad: You have earned a good blattepizza.

128
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,526
Henrik: No, damn it was scabbling!

129
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:59,055
Ville: Blattepizza!

130
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:01,859
Dad: It is the fyfan those who bake that shit.

131
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:03,604
Henrik: Are you going home and jaw or?

132
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:06,839
Dad: Yes, Mom has cooked some pork pancake for us,

133
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,506
So we'll check out Bolibompa tonight together we thought.
 Have a little cozy.

134
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:13,349
Henrik: End good everything good then?

135
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,427
Dad: Exactly!
