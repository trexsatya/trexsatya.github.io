1
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:46,952
Yeah, exactly. No, I agree.

2
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:50,290
Just now. I know!

3
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:53,510
Hey, you know what 
we talked about yesterday?

4
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,410
Yeah, that. You got time now?

5
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,211
No, it just feels like we…
I just want to get it done, right now.

6
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,538
Great! I’ll come by right now.

7
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:07,844
I’ve just picked up Ville, so we’ll be out-side soon.

8
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:11,766
Or, by the way, run out and meet us 
and we’ll pick you up on the way.

9
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:14,010
Cool, bye.

10
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:16,260
How are you, honey?

11
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,177
Fine.

12
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:23,621
Your teacher told me what happened, 
and you shouldn’t worry about that, okay?

13
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:26,599
He is the bad guy, right?

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,300
Did you do anything fun in school today?

15
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,499
Not so much. We went to the forest.

16
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,374
Nice! Were you playing?

17
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:53,775
We had hot dogs and a bonfire.
And teacher read us stories.

18
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:58,162
Hot dogs, yummy! What stories 
did your teacher read you?

19
00:01:58,162 --> 00:02:00,050
Little Red Riding Hood.

20
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,287
Little Red Riding Hood,
that’s a good one, right?

21
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:06,512
But a bit creepy when the wolf 
tricks her like that, isn’t it?

22
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:09,450
No, not at all.

23
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:12,487
Daddy thinks that’s real scary!

24
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:15,337
”What big teeth you have!”

25
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:18,850
”All the better to eat you with!”

26
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,025
Hey, honey, we’re just picking 
up Henrik on the way home.

27
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,250
We’re gonna take care of 
something, is that okay?

28
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,525
Okay.

29
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:26,862
When does the cartoons start?

30
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:29,275
The cartoons starts at six 
so we’ll be home in time.

31
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:32,437
And then we’ll watch 
it together, right?

32
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:52,463
Yo!

33
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,463
Hey, man!

34
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:54,463
How’s it going?

35
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,845
It’s gonna feel damn good 
to get this over with.

36
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:58,943
Yeah, I get that.

37
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:00,855
And how’s Ville doing? Good?

38
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:01,855
Yeah.

39
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:03,031
Yeah, Ville’s a viking, right?

40
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:04,031
Yeah.

41
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:05,482
Yeah. ”Ville-Viking".

42
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:07,228
It’s all good.

43
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,228
You got the adress?

44
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:09,326
Yeah, I know where we’re going.

45
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:11,628
Sweet!

46
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,090
Weren’t you selling this car, by the way?

47
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,149
Yeah, for sure.

48
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:18,698
I put out an ad online and all.

49
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,404
But then I’m fucking mail bombed 
by 7000 Mohammed Jihad

50
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:23,424
who wants to buy it for next to nothing.

51
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:25,992
”I buy car for one and $200”

52
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:28,992
No thanks, it says $4000 in the ad.

53
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:31,698
”I buy car for one and $200 now”

54
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:34,208
Yeah, fucking unbelievable.

55
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,443
You know, I have this 
friend who also was selling.

56
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:37,659
He posted his phone number.

57
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,953
It ended with him having to 
change his fucking number.

58
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,443
They like, came to his house

59
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:45,698
with their families, their goats and 
camels and all their shit, you know.

60
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:51,796
Standing there like ”you sell! you sell, friend!” 
Fucking unbelievable, right.

61
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:55,835
No, those towel heads should 
stick to making kebabs.

62
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,816
That’s something they do damn well.

63
00:03:57,816 --> 00:03:59,424
But what if SD (=Sweden Democrats)
wins the election?

64
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,051
Then no more kebabs for us.

65
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:06,424
Well fuck, if SD wins they’ll have to 
arrange one of those pizza tests.

66
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,990
The immigrants who make 
the best pizzas get to stay.

67
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,128
And I guess you’d be one of the judges?

68
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:15,912
I’ve crammed a whole lotta 
pizza in my days. Am I right?

69
00:04:15,912 --> 00:04:17,716
You know that thaimassage 
place on the corner?

70
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,716
Yeah.

71
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,324
That can stay, cause that’s a
jury I sure would like to be in.

72
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:24,441
Oh I see. With happy endings, then? 
You like that, don’t you?

73
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,441
Happy endings?

74
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,602
Damnit, Ville is back there.

75
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:30,755
Ville, you wanted some thai massage?

76
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:35,481
You have paid thai massage, Ville. 
Oh, very nice thai massage, Ville!

77
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:37,363
Am I on the wrong way now, or…?

78
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:38,363
Whereabouts is it?

79
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:39,853
Grästorpsvägen.

80
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:41,383
Grästorpsvägen?

81
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,088
Yeah, you know where we
checked out that Saab a while ago.

82
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:44,088
Don’t you remember?

83
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:46,010
Yeah, right, that’s just over here.

84
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,128
Yeah, isn’t it?

85
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:49,520
Take the first left up here.

86
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,794
I seriously don’t get why you 
don’t have a GPS.

87
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,304
It’s really good.

88
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:57,049
GPS? I couldn’t sit here fidgeting 
with a computer while I’m driving.

89
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,853
That’s not safe.

90
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:01,892
Yeah but at least you’ll get 
where you’re going, right?

91
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,932
Hey, I think it’s time for us to… 
We’ll play that game now.

92
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,049
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:22,128
Ville, you wanna play hide and seek?

94
00:05:22,128 --> 00:05:23,128
Yeeah!

95
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,245
You can’t look and 
you have to count to 50.

96
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:28,010
Then we’ll hide. Okay?

97
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,186
You wanna do it like last time?

98
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:34,186
Yeah.

99
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:39,814
One, two, three, four, 
five, six, seven...

100
00:05:39,814 --> 00:05:43,520
No peeking now, right? Ville?

101
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,539
Now you gotta start over from one
again so that we have time to hide.

102
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,167
And you’ll have to promise daddy 
to close your eyes real tight now.

103
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,324
Okay

104
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:54,637
No peeking now, Ville.
It’s important!

105
00:05:56,245 --> 00:06:04,598
One, two, three, four, five,

106
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:13,735
six, seven, eight, nine,

107
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:21,892
ten, eleven, twelve, 
thirteen, fourteen,

108
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:27,383
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, 
eighteen, nineteen,

109
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:32,971
twenty, twenty-one, 
twenty-two, twenty-three,

110
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:39,108
twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six,
 twenty-seven, twenty-eight.

111
00:06:39,912 --> 00:06:41,147
Yes?

112
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:45,343
Hey. You should control your
fucking boy in school!

113
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,925
It’s cool, it’s cool. 
No-one’s here, it’s cool.

114
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:21,671
Forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight,

115
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:24,298
Fifty! I got you!

116
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:28,847
No way? He found us right away?

117
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,396
What a little rascal we’ve 
got back there.

118
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:35,200
Hey, you’re not gonna have any more 
trouble with Abdoul in school now.

119
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,259
And if you do, you’ll tell us. Promise!

120
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,259
Mhm.

121
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:42,474
Good.

122
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,220
Well done.

123
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,925
Yeah, damn good job.

124
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,063
Hell, could you drop me off 
by the pizza place later.

125
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:53,847
Got real bad kebab cravings 
when we talked about it earlier.

126
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,886
You’ve earned a tasty hajji pizza.

127
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,475
Fuck, that’s nasty!

128
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,004
Hajji pizza!

129
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:01,808
Yeah, but it is them who 
makes that fucking shit.

130
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:03,553
You’re having dinner at home?

131
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:06,788
Yeah, mommy’s made us pancakes.

132
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:11,455
Then we’re gonna watch the 
cartoons together. Get cozy.

133
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,298
All well that ends well, then?

134
00:08:13,298 --> 00:08:15,376
Right!
