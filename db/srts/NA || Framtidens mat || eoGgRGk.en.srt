1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.040
In the world of science: see what will be cultivated in the future.
 Note BV

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920
- Is it the food of the future?
 -Yes.

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.040
And what we eat.
 Note free

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.960
If you take all rapeseed in Sweden in one year and pick out the protein molecules -

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.080
- It would be enough for half our protein needs.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.240
Each newly built greenhouse will have a small fish farming in a corner.

7
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.360
The shift is not about a click, but it moves many and should go fast.

8
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.480
That food is science will be clear in the next hour.

9
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.200
We need to change eating habits and the way we grow at -

10
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.280
- Both for our health and for the environment.

11
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.520
So where do we find the new, nutritious food that will be enough for everyone?

12
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.720
In unexpected places.
 And we will test the food today.

13
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.200
A family should taste what the researchers have developed.

14
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.160
It will be a surprise and will not be similar to something you have eaten before.

15
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.840
So there are no scornful space pills - Note Nytextat here

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.080
- Without food as a researcher thinks we should start eating already.

17
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.120
We live in an abundance of food, at least in our part of the world.

18
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.440
But most of us do not eat so healthy.

19
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.200
The Earth's environment feels worse by food production.

20
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.400
Lakes such as the Baltic Sea are severely affected by agricultural emissions.

21
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.280
Rain forests are cut down to give way to grazing cows and soybeans.

22
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.160
Food production leads to excursion -

23
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.240
- And threat that species are disappearing.

24
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.040
The climate issue, then?

25
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.880
Globally, agriculture causes about a quarter of climate -hazardous emissions.

26
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.200
It can be compared to the flight that causes 2-3 % of climate emissions.

27
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.560
But there is hope.
 Researchers work on developing foods -

28
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.640
- And cultivation methods that should be more environmentally friendly and healthy.

29
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.200
It is among other things.
 About greenhouses with built -in aquariums.

30
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.840
You try to create meat of rapeseed and hemp.

31
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.920
Fields with cultivated plants are built below the water surface.

32
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.640
Is this the way of growing and saturating ten billion people -

33
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.080
- Healthy and environmentally friendly?
 And should we eat this in the future?

34
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.320
Kristineberg's marine research station, at the Gullmarsfjorden-

35
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.120
–12 miles north of Gothenburg, was founded as early as the 19th century.

36
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.280
Here, surveys are conducted on life in the sea.

37
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.400
And so you have started growing under the surface.

38
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.240
How can you get durable food and clean the water at the same time?

39
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.200
The answer grows on long rope: pliers.

40
00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.520
Sugar pliers - Saccharina Latissima - which has grown on ropes in the water.

41
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.440
It is a very fast -growing species that contains a lot of goods.

42
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.240
- Is it the food of the future?
 -Yes.
 And you don't have to do anything.

43
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.440
We don't have to water them.

44
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.560
It can be dry summers for land -based agriculture.

45
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.880
We do not need to fertilize, because the sea is abandoned.

46
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.040
It lives on the industry in the sea.
 The only work tasks are -

47
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.240
– To put out the sown thin ropes on the large rope -

48
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.160
- And then when harvesting in April.

49
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.720
In the summer, the sugar can be sown in aquariums.

50
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.160
The algae release germ cells that form small plants.

51
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.000
They get stuck on ropes on coils.

52
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.240
They are then spun on long ropes located in the sea between buoys.

53
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.280
When the algae is put out, they are three millimeters.

54
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.320
In April, when they are picked up, they are three meters.

55
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.040
They are cooked and frozen or dried.

56
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.200
You said people eat algae daily without knowing it?

57
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.240
Yes, in the form of different additives in food.
 They have different E-numbers.

58
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.120
They are flavor enhancers, for algae have what you call umami.

59
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.440
When we add it to the food, it gets a fullness and tastes more.

60
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.680
Algae is often included as a food ingredient.
 It is a multibillion industry.

61
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.840
- ice cream, beer ... - ice cream and beer.

62
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
- What is it in the beer?
 - The foam.
 A little shame ... the beer foam.

63
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.040
- It's of algae?
 - Yes, they are included.

64
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.560
I'm letting go of these now.

65
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.600
In Ostasian food, seaweed is common but now also comes in e.g.
 Denmark.

66
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.000
Tangs, seaweed pesto, seaweed and seaweed.

67
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.120
The Danes like seaweed and snaps.
 They have done this.
 Very tasty.

68
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.240
Professor Fredrik Gröndahl and his colleagues at KTH in Stockholm -

69
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.680
- Has produced a brick of algae and sand, and algae mugs.

70
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.840
It has no design yet.

71
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.760
In Sweden alone, dentists use 50 million mugs a year.

72
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.840
- This can be eaten up after the visit.
 -Could you show?

73
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.920
You can eat it or compost it.

74
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.440
Fredrik hopes that algae can make milk and beef more climate friendly.

75
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.760
It has a pretty strong smell.

76
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.880
Cows release when they ruminate.
 Out comes the greenhouse gas methane.

77
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.160
Australian researchers have shown that emissions can decrease by 96 % -

78
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.280
- When the lining is mixed with a tropical algae.

79
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.760
Maybe Swedish algae works just as well?

80
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.600
We will investigate about twenty Swedish algae -

81
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.920
–And test them at Swedish cows.

82
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:38.640
Fredrik Gröndahl wants to take us under the surface to show wild algae.

83
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.760
The fascination for life in the sea began early.

84
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.160
I grew up on the Mediterranean, in Spain.

85
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.720
I was often in the water and fascinated by life there.

86
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.160
We caught octopus that we sold to restaurants.

87
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.920
At the age of 12-13, I decided to try to become a marine biologist.

88
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:12.280
Then I wanted to work with sharks, but it first became jellyfish and then algae.

89
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.800
- How do life in the sea feel?
 - The sea is affected by eutrophication.

90
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:33.120
And it has started to get warmer, so some foreign species come in.

91
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.600
But there are also improvements.

92
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:42.440
Here around the Gullmarsfjord there has been a lot of tumblers lately.

93
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.320
They have been lost, so you see some improvements as well.

94
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.400
Eating algae, are we created for that?

95
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:59.520
In a way, you think so.
 Once upon a time, when the brains developed ...

96
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.760
According to the Sea Theory, the foremen picked algae and mussels -

97
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.760
- And things that were still when the tide pulled away.

98
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.760
It was part of the food that may have made us for those we are today.

99
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:26.640
Oh, what fun!
 Here I find some of the "sea truff

100
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.040
- As we can see here.
 This green algae is very delicate.

101
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.320
It is appreciated among star chefs and is widely used in cooking.

102
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:45.720
We try to grow it on the west coast, indoors in vessels.
 And also on Gotland.

103
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:52.560
Fredrik leads the Seafarm project.
 Several universities are involved -

104
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.160
- And companies have started production on a commercial scale.

105
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.080
We direct towards the research station.

106
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.240
I see people there.

107
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.360
Professor Kristina Snuttan Sundell -

108
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.840
- Leads the National Center for Marine Aquaculture Research.

109
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.120
She also hopes for other future food from the sea, so -called "Scary Seafood":

110
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.320
Animals that we don't usually eat, but that are packed with proteins -

111
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.440
- fats, vitamins and minerals.

112
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.600
- Has it been good for you?
 - You can answer that.

113
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.640
One idea is that everyone who can and wants has their own colonial lot in the sea.

114
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.760
There is not quite yet in Sweden, but there is in Denmark.

115
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:55.920
Imagine a colonial lot, where you grow your vegetables and such, but in the sea.

116
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:04.360
Fixed in the form of mussel rope with mussels on, algae with algae on -

117
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.480
--Ostron baskets where you grow oysters ...

118
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.640
You build a jetty in the sea to grow sea food.

119
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.080
In anticipation of it, you can pick wild food in the sea.
 What can you find?

120
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.240
There is a lot to find.

121
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:30.240
I pave up because there is a lot of fire jellyfish.
 And jellyfish can be taken.

122
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.400
Snuttan Sundell captures ear jellyfish - note in earlier

123
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.040
- To see if they can be quick -dry in liquor for jellyfish chips.

124
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.160
The four purple ears are the jellyfish's genitals.

125
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.280
She also finds beach snails - a delicacy on French plates.

126
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.240
They are sometimes served raw.

127
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.440
But in Sweden, they are mainly used as bait for mete.

128
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.800
Some pliers end up in the bucket.
 They are small compared to the North Sea shrimp -

129
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.520
- But they are actually the origin of the Danes' butter bread with shrimp.

130
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:12.640
She also gets up beach crabs, which give good taste to pots.

131
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:19.720
It doesn't work if everyone suddenly starts picking and fishing the animals -

132
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.040
- As not fished before, because then you may knock out the stocks.

133
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:33.160
We need to research more on what the stocks look like and which one can fish.

134
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.360
The snout spent his childhood summers at the research station -

135
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.560
- Then her parents researched there.

136
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.720
She wondered how the animals in the sea adapted to the environment there.

137
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:57.480
In the lab there are aquariums, where the seamen of the future is investigated.

138
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.960
This is very attractive food.

139
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:07.520
In Japan, such a sea mayor condition among the highest prices.

140
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.640
It is the next species to grow.

141
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.200
They also have a very good ecosystem service.

142
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.840
They eat such nutrition that falls down on the bottom, and they can eat fish buzz.

143
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.040
They can be grown together with fish.

144
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.240
What potential does food and sea food have?

145
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.520
It has a gigantic potential.

146
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:41.080
Of the earth's surface is 71 % water.
 Most of it is sea, and a little fresh water.

147
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.200
29 % are land, or land.

148
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.960
Of the food we produce -

149
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:55.560
- We produce between 5-6 percent of the food we eat in water.

150
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.720
The earth's population is growing all the time.

151
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.960
We preach that we are almost ten billion in 2050.

152
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:10.120
All these people must have food.
 Good and nutritious food is needed.

153
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.320
-What is this?
 –My expensive grabs - sea cucumbers.

154
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.760
Our Swedish, red signaling cucumber.

155
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:26.200
We have a project where we will develop cultivation protocols -

156
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.520
–And study how they can be grown.

157
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.440
It has a front end, with a tentacle crown here and a mouth -

158
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.560
- As it eats in the custom.

159
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.880
It takes in sand and everything, takes up the nutrition and poop out the sand here.

160
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.680
The funny thing is that they also breathe with the butt.

161
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.200
- Should we cook them?
 -Yes exactly.

162
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.040
Hello, Snuttan!

163
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:04.520
I have a cultivated sugar pliers with me that we will see if we cook with.

164
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.440
I cut my soy marinated sea cucumber in the meantime.

165
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:16.440
The pliers are cooked briefly to reduce the iodine content and give it a green color.

166
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.640
It will be a wrap with fish, asparagus, potatoes and anchovies.

167
00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:30.200
The snout fry the sea cucumber and boils seaweed and beach crabs.

168
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:36.040
Fredrik roasts "The truffle of the sea", the tube he found on the cliff.

169
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:42.760
And then some algae and legum steaks of the sugar pliers grown in the sea.

170
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:48.520
The snout boils the beach snails with garlic, wine and roquefort cheese.

171
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.800
-Here you go!
 Have a nice meal.
 -Have a nice meal.

172
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.040
Although there are also future foods from the fields on land.

173
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.120
Like here at Österlen in Skåne.

174
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:24.960
Gunnarshög's farm produces two million liters of rapeseed oil per year.

175
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.640
Remains will be a residual mountain.

176
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.680
When cold pressing rapeseed, you stop at about three kilos of rapeseed.

177
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.400
Then you get a liter of oil, which looks like this.

178
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:46.600
Then you also get two -thirds seed shells.

179
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.720
The protein -rich rapeseed cake has so far been mainly given to cows.

180
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.920
It tastes bitter, so the animals are not fond of storm.

181
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.120
It would be even more efficient if we ate the rap proteins direct -

182
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.240
- The place to eat the beef later.

183
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.920
It would have been more fun to do something that we humans can eat of this.

184
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:15.640
- Is it going?
 - Yes, because they have nice values.

185
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.560
You could make a vegetarian steak, burger or a small bun.

186
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.320
Karolina Östbring is a food researcher at Lund University.

187
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.000
She is interested in the press residues, which contain vegetarian protein -

188
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.160
- In the same top class as soy.

189
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.320
The rape has great potential to end up on our plates in the future.

190
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.560
The rapeseed has a nice protein quality.

191
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.200
No vegetables have just the right composition for the body -

192
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.600
- But soy and rapeseed are closest to the plant kingdom.

193
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.040
Is there any problem with making food from rapeseed?

194
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.200
Yes.
 Almost all vegetables have antinutrients:

195
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.520
The plant's own protection against attacks from pests and such.

196
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.800
That molecule is not good for us.

197
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.960
The substances that give a bit of taste, ugly color and which are not so useful -

198
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.800
- Want Karolina filter away.

199
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.920
In fact, there is already rapeseed and leg beef in the stores.

200
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.120
Karolina sees great potential.

201
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.040
If you take all rapeseed grown in Sweden annually -

202
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.160
–And removes the protein molecules -

203
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.440
- It would be enough for half our protein needs in one year.

204
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.480
- There is a lot of protein in the rape.
 —More than in meat?

205
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.640
Meat has about 20 % protein, while this one has 30 %.

206
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.000
Do anyone want some melon?

207
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:11.640
An alternative to rapeseed steaks may be protein from another crop -

208
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.040
- Available at Mossagården, five miles west.

209
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.800
- Mom, Mom!
 See!
 - Yes, you can ...

210
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.640
This three -year -old has eaten hemp all his life.

211
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:33.880
Hemp is the mother of agriculture.
 A 28,000 old hemparep has been found.

212
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.000
It has been grown since the Bronze Age.

213
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.800
It has given textiles.
 I wear hemp clothes.

214
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.200
And it has provided food and energy.
 You can fire with it.

215
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:53.160
Just like the rapeseed, the hemp's seed gives oil.
 The remains become a protein cake.

216
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.840
Of that, Ebba-Maria Olson makes hemp milk and hemp bread.

217
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.040
This is the purest hemp milk.
 It will be a real hemp coffee this.

218
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.240
Hemp is the same plant as cannabis -

219
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.040
- But what you grow here is industrial hemp, which lacks narcotic substances.

220
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.720
-Look!
 -A butterfly.

221
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.960
- Do you want to have more to drink?
 - I jump down now.

222
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.840
Ebba-Maria brings with the field.

223
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
The hemp is easy to grow, she thinks.
 Injury insects do not give up on it.

224
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.640
Only you fertilize, it grows so that it is cracking.

225
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.240
But here it is still pre -season.

226
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.880
Now you have just sown here.
 How big will it be?

227
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.400
It can be 3.5–4 meters high.
 And we use the trunk too.

228
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.520
- In a summer?
 -Yes.
 You almost see as it grows.

229
00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.680
And it collects a lot of carbon dioxide.

230
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.800
When hemp seeds are pressed into a cake, the food researcher has Karolina -

231
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.920
- I took them to Lund University.

232
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.040
The proteins are allowed to go through the extruder machine, a pressure cooker -

233
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.000
- As the structure of the proteins converts so that the hemp meat gets chew resistance.

234
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:29.680
We humans like to chew, and among other things.
 Therefore, we appreciate meat.

235
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:35.240
The shift is not about a click, but it moves many and should go fast.

236
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:41.400
It is an advantage if people recognize the feeling in the mouth -

237
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.720
- Because they will miss their steak.

238
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.240
This is hemp protein.

239
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.240
This is a burger made of rapeseed.

240
00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.200
Karolina roasts on the hemp meat and the steaks of rapeseed and leg beef.

241
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.120
There it was finished.

242
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.320
It must go away to change the diet, Karolina believes.

243
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.480
From bloody roasts to algae and hemp steaks.

244
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.680
But how do you attract those who think the future food seems disgusting?

245
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:25.080
I have met with researchers Karin Wendin and Håkan Jönsson.

246
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.520
They point to a previous food revolution that went fast:

247
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.320
From inedible to home cooking - it was with sushi 30 years ago.

248
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.880
- What is special about this?
 - That it has gone so fast.

249
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.080
In the 80s and early 90s, no one knew what this was.

250
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.080
After all, it was really strange to eat something raw.

251
00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:59.680
This was seen as inedible, and most people thought they got sick of it.

252
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.160
We were used to making food.

253
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:08.120
Then it just said "boom", and then all sushi.

254
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:15.600
Introducing something new to eat usually takes many, many years.

255
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.800
Here came the entire kit with internationalization -

256
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.000
–But also that the exotic Japanese had been in the United States and turned -

257
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.280
- And got a quality stamp there.

258
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.720
It's okay to mimic California.
 It came here with the Yuppie era.

259
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:44.680
The 80s siblings led the road, and the Swedes became fond of raw fish.

260
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.960
The research has proceeded on how to influence the taste of disgust.

261
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:56.360
In Malmö there is the Disgusting Food Museum which offers Cazu Marzu:

262
00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.560
Cheese with live larvae, from Sardinia.

263
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.960
And Kiviak, from Greenland, where a seal is filled with hundreds of birds -

264
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.120
- And then buried for months to be fermented.

265
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.560
And American bull testicles and Chinese mouse fetuses in wine.

266
00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.960
At the museum, the ticket is a spy bag.

267
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:32.800
- We will try insects.
 - I can start with a cricket.

268
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.160
- It tastes popcorn.
 - I strike with a dung beetle.

269
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:46.760
And I have promised to take the one that was kind of an oblong drill.
 It's huge!

270
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.400
It wasn't ... very good.

271
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:04.000
You need to rinse down ... there are so much dry wings and legs.

272
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.000
But Andreas, museum manager here - does all visitors eat these insects?

273
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.200
Most.
 When it comes to crickets and flour worms, 80-90 % try them.

274
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.000
- There are many more than we thought.
 –And why do they try?

275
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.720
You have gone through the museum and questioned the image of what is food.

276
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.840
You get open to try things.

277
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.440
If you want to start eating insects, or get people to start with it -

278
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.640
- You need to get them in appetizing form.

279
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.680
You can grind them down to flour that can be used in many dishes -

280
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:53.560
- For example, buns.
 I have made a recipe brochure with my colleagues.

281
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.760
Oh, what tasty insect rights!

282
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.760
What is among the most disgusting you have here at the museum?

283
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.120
You should get a nice piece of Hákarl.

284
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.440
- Now comes ... all tastes.
 - It tastes a little ruled.

285
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.520
Hákarl is Greenland.

286
00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.600
It kisses through the skin so the meat is full of urine.

287
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.800
- Are you ready for the next?
 -Absolutely.

288
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.760
This has been compared to everything from shower drains to green cheese.

289
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.880
- It's "stinky tofu".
 - Yes, fermented.

290
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:44.280
- This was worse than acid streaming.
 - I probably agree with that.

291
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.200
- Do you want to have the bag?
 -No.
 But I look at the licorice.

292
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:58.560
You have licorice, brine.
 Why do you have it?

293
00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.160
That's what most spit out.

294
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:08.760
It is very Nordic.
 Only six countries in the world like brine.

295
00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:14.120
But if you want to get everyone to eat "stinky tofu", or insects -

296
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.640
- Or hemp steaks or algae burgers or something else.

297
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:25.400
How to make people change food culture quickly?

298
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.600
Go "all in" that we're social.

299
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:36.800
You can try to get an influencer or star chef to start with this.

300
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:43.760
If I am the first to mimic, I show that I know what is inside.
 Note in later

301
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:50.200
Then comes the next wave that eats it, because you want to be almost as hot.

302
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.760
Suddenly it is almost normal.

303
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.920
I want to say "appeal to reason".

304
00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:04.600
If you know that insects contain very good proteins and fats -

305
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.320
- Can you think that if we are to eat sustainable and nutritious -

306
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.720
- Insects are a good alternative.

307
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:20.800
How is the food food?
 Ethnologist Håkan Jönsson sees a new trend -

308
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.480
- As paves the way for algae, hemp and rapeseed steaks.

309
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.880
Young people do not think that close -knit is the dream, like their parents.

310
00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:38.320
The new generation would rather have sustainable vegetarian options.

311
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.440
The really young generation, where you can see roots from the 50s.

312
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.120
The really processed food is no problem.

313
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:53.360
The future food is very technology for alternative proteins.

314
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.160
And there is something that can solve an experienced problem:

315
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.320
The problem with an increased population -

316
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.720
- And that we have to eat in a different way for the planet to do well.

317
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.760
Those values have begun to take over from our generation -

318
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.520
- which was focused on gastronomy and good taste.
 Note new texting from here

319
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:28.320
With us now meal researcher Richard Tellström and chef Carola Magnusson.

320
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.800
Influencers that make lovely food of this -

321
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.120
- Can be a crucial role for new food to beat.

322
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.520
What do you think is required for it to go home?

323
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.520
What is always required is that people have to think it's okay.

324
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.240
"Okay" is usually translated to taste good.

325
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:59.440
But basically it means I become an okay person when I eat it.

326
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.680
I am recognized by my friends, my family likes me.

327
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.400
It must be fulfilled in order to eat something.
 Food is values.

328
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.560
If the values change with us, we can start eating in a different way.

329
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.720
- What do you think is required?
 - I agree with what Richard says.

330
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.960
But if taking it to itself, that this is going into my mouth -

331
00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.520
- So it's probably about the food getting an identity.

332
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:36.440
One should feel confidence in the person who has cooked and for it on the plate.

333
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.120
I have worked a lot in school dining rooms.

334
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.520
We can present a raw material that is new to the guests -

335
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.760
- So they can say hello to it for a week.

336
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.880
After a week it is on the plate.

337
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:59.640
Is it easier to start eating new food when you are young than when you are old?

338
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.800
It is probably easier as a young person.

339
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:09.200
Especially as an infant, because then you do just as the group does.

340
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:16.600
Then children can eat anything, even sand in the sandbox.

341
00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.960
Then it goes in waves.
 At the age of four, protests come.

342
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.200
School food is usually okay to sixth class-

343
00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:32.840
- The students come to high school and then all the food becomes huge.

344
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Then it will be okay in high school again, because then they start to get their own identity.

345
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.680
You've been working on introducing organic food -

346
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.520
–And unusual raw materials.

347
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.080
- How did it go?
 - Fantastically good.

348
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.600
Today I have boiled soybeans with green lenses for a bolognese -

349
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.880
- which also belongs to the food of the future.

350
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:07.080
When serving, not many people choose it, but they get to taste -

351
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.200
- Values more than half it.

352
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:15.440
The hemp steak in the feature, where you worked a lot to get chewing resistance.

353
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.480
Why is the texture so important?

354
00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.600
The crucial.

355
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:29.800
When I get a new raw material in my hand, the first thing I know is about the texture.

356
00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:37.560
When I tasted the hemp meat without cooking, it was a bit like cardboard.

357
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:43.320
But only with a frying with some salt and pepper and neutral rapeseed oil -

358
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.320
- It brought great!

359
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.440
The food culture is based on our sensitivity in the oral cavity.

360
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.560
We are extremely sensitive to a small fish leg in the food or a strand of hair.

361
00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:03.360
- You would like to spit out.
 - Yes, we want to keep control of the food.

362
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.760
Then the texture is something we learned.

363
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:14.000
If you are used to eating soggy, broken food, you are happy to continue with it.

364
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.400
But have you become accustomed to eating crispy food -

365
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.800
- It is difficult with a dip in the pot.

366
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.400
This soggy bread swimming in broth.

367
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.960
- It's really good!
 - If you grow up with it, it works.

368
00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.840
There is a memory function in textures.

369
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
We are also interested in setting textures against each other.

370
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.040
Crisp against soft, soggy against hard.

371
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:52.880
So dishes that strike often have these compositions.

372
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.840
- TEXTURE is perhaps more important than taste?
 -Yes.

373
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.160
It should be about new ways of growing.

374
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.600
You do not have to saddle to farms to grow their own food.
 Note new text here

375

Each newly built greenhouse will have a small fish farming in a corner.

377
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:31.760
A new type of greenhouse where the food is grown with the help of fish.

378
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:37.240
As far as we know, we are the world's largest aquavic cycle cultivation.
 Note in out bv

379
00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.960
If we succeed in this, there is no protein deficiency in the future.

380
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.600
In a residential area outside Sigtuna-

381
00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:02.360
- If a family of children have taken food production in their own hands.

382
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.760
-Hello!
 You are the one who is Maja?
 -That's me.
 Welcome!

383
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.880
My name is Maja and I work as an intensive care nurse.

384
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.200
I'm excited to see your cultivation.

385
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.880
I grow all my vegetables with acvavonical cultivation in the garage.

386
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:29.040
I can show you around.
 We have no cars in here.

387
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.520
Oh, damn.

388
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:43.200
Maja has connected the water from two fish pools with her cultivation.

389
00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:49.000
It will be a cycle where the nutrients of plants come from the feces of fish.
 Note BV

390
00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:55.920
The water drops here, and it comes from the fish tank - note freely

391
00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.440
- And go back purified in gutters to the fish.

392
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.880
Is it enough to give birth to your family?

393
00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:09.280
Salad we are self -sufficient.
 We have too much salad.

394
00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.240
The basil I do a lot of pesto on.

395
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.400
As you can see, it thrives.
 It grows like weeds in here.

396
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.520
I have four children.
 Do I want them to eat things -

397
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.280
–A has been imported and is sprayed to keep longer - Note BV

398
00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.240
- When you can just harvest and put on the plate -

399
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.440
- And all the nutrients are left.

400
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.240
Maja's family is also self -sufficient in fish.

401
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:50.640
Fishing luck for girls!
 There was a devil that was up and watching.

402
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.600
Here you have one!

403
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.360
Oh, damn!

404
00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.200
So!
 Here we have two.

405
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:10.600
These are also breathing on land, so they can survive on land for a very long time.

406
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:16.280
- It's a Clarias, an eel mal.
 -What should we do now?

407
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.200
We throw one back, and smoke the other.

408
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.320
Then we take this and go and cook dinner.

409
00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.160
Good, now I got carrying help too.

410
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.160
Not only in the garage can you grow like this.

411
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:43.640
In Härnösand, a cycle cultivation has become greater than it was possible.

412
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.800
Large amounts of tomatoes and rainbow salmon are grown here.

413
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.560
That's about 4,000 plants - Note BV

414
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.680
–And we produce about 1,200 tonnes of tomatoes a year.

415
00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.240
And we will produce 40-50 tonnes of fish.

416
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:06.640
As far as we know, we are the world's largest aquavic cycle cultivation.

417
00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:14.920
Aquaponia originates from fish and rice crops in Asia.

418
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.880
In recent decades, the systems have moved into modern greenhouses.

419
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:24.400
The water between fish and plants goes in the cycle.

420
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.120
Nutrient water with ammonia comes from the fish into the greenhouse -

421
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.240
- To the gravel bed with the tomato plants.

422
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.640
It becomes a natural filter -

423
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:41.640
- And the bacteria convert ammonia into nitrate - nitrogen that becomes nutrition.

424
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:48.200
The wastewater has been purified from nitrogen using the roots of the tomato plant -

425
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.360
- And runs back to the fish tank again.

426
00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:03.040
I think in 10-15 years all new greenhouses have a small fish department -

427
00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:09.840
- To get this natural fertilizer to the plants -

428
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.240
- At the same time, you also get a very nice product in the form of fish.
 Note BV

429
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.440
Anders Kiessling believes that technology will revolutionize food cultivation.
 Note BV

430
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.520
This feels like winning at Lotto!
 All of a sudden I got a lab.

431
00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:30.520
I have been controlled.
 I can look in the sand for the bacteria.

432
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:34.040
I can see what in the fertilizer of the fish do -

433
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:39.280
- That they manage with a tenth of the same nutrition compared to artificial fertilizers.

434
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.800
Akvavonical systems have proven to be very effective.

435
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.200
But there is a problem, and that is the feed for the fish.

436
00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:56.120
If we are to continue to have animals, the feed must be sustainable.

437
00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:01.040
It is our Achilles heel.
 Today it is not sustainable.

438
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:07.160
This is what I hold in my hand is the whole industry.

439
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:12.920
This, together with electric power, is the driving forces in the system.

440
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.720
The lining often contains fishmeal from unsustainable fishing in the world ocean -

441
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.880
- And soy grown on rainforest.

442
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:27.360
The nutrition that is left over contributes to the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea.

443
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:33.400
We pick up the nutrition far away, and use it at another place -

444
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:39.240
- And where there will be accumulation.
 In the Baltic Sea we see that it is not good!

445
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.440
Therefore, we must create a cycle again.

446
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.680
To develop a sustainable feed, the researchers look at Swedish raw materials.

447
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.160
Hello!
 Welcome to Örnsköldsvik.

448
00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.680
In Örnsköldsvik, Anders Biotechnister Björn Alriksson meets.

449
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:09.320
He tests growing a protein -rich fungus on residues from forestry.

450
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:16.280
Here we have the mushroom biomass.
 It looks like a black "slurry".

451
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.440
The fungus grows very fast-

452
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.760
–And is growing on nutrition that not many other fungi enjoy growing on.

453
00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.920
It propagates through division, exponentially -

454
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.200
- So we get rapid protein production compared to that in animals and plants.

455
00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:39.560
The microben grows on sugar found in chips from down trees.

456
00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:44.200
You should test if the fungus can grow on a larger scale.

457
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.320
-What is this?
 - The fungal biomass.

458
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:52.440
Björn shows a test of what the fungus can look like when it is finished.

459
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:58.760
- This is the food?
 - A protein ingredient in the fish feed.

460
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.640
It smells a bit yeasty.

461
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:08.320
We can start with 10 milligrams microb and a week later have 100 tons.

462
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.560
If we can succeed in this, there is no protein deficiency in the future.

463
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:19.840
The trick is to convert the protein from something that we cannot eat -

464
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
- To something fantastic on our plate.
 There the fish comes in.

465
00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:30.280
The researchers can only make the big, expensive experiment once a year.

466
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:39.920
If we fail, we must find new money and start again.

467
00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.400
Now we harvest the mushrooms.

468
00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:05.840
Exciting, Björn!
 Wow!
 60 percent protein of the highest quality.

469
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.560
- So this will your fish eat?
 - Food protein from Swedish forest.

470
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.160
Isn't that a complicated way?

471
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:21.680
No, we have made beer since ancient times, and the principle is the same.
 Note BV

472
00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.960
It's just that we use the forest instead of the field.

473
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.400
The nutrition from the fishing manure also makes it possible -

474
00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.760
- To grow tropical fruits and plants in Sweden.

475
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:56.560
This is KTH's research facility for acvavonical cultivation.

476
00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.440
About twenty different plant species are in the same cultivation system.

477
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:07.800
We have cocoa trees, guava trees, coffee, papaya, vanilla and so on.

478
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.520
It is very good to grow.

479
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.400
There was a piraya.
 Mad quick!

480
00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:22.120
They are triggered by the sound of falling fruit.
 Note BV

481
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.440
We will probably cultivate much more tropical fruit, especially acvavonically.

482
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:35.280
The product gets extremely much better when it is allowed to sit and mature clearly.

483
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.200
It becomes much tastier, sweeter -

484
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.560
- And I would guess it is more nutritious than imported fruit.

485
00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.960
Björn thinks it will be difficult to import fruit in the future.
 Note BV

486
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:53.080
The countries we import from will probably have more and more problems.

487
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.480
One is climate change, but also increasing water shortages.

488
00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.280
The aquavic systems are extremely water efficient.

489
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.760
Filip, do you pick up the salad?
 The one who is there.

490
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.880
So you and I take some basil.

491
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:23.640
At Maja at Maja, it will be time for dinner.

492
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.680
Thank you sweetheart!

493
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.880
It will be ready in a week.

494
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.200
We'll look at what it looks like.

495
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.160
There you go!
 Not bad.

496
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:49.640
- Very cucumber.
 Everyone likes cucumber.
 - I love cucumber.

497
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.720
Has the economy been affected by the cultivation?

498
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.280
We save money -

499
00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.720
- And it tastes much better to grow it yourself at home.
 Note Copied from Stn-2020-0916-Framtidensbrod.

500
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:15.720
Imagine if you needed to dig up every year and then about your lawn.

501
00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:22.440
About the same, the cultivation of the world's most common cereals works, wheat.

502
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:28.560
Researchers at The Land Institute believe that many of the agricultural problems -

503
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:35.520
- You can be solved if our crops were perennial, so -called.
 perennial plants.

504
00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:40.800
For 20 years, the researchers here have refined a new cereal -

505
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.880
- As they call Kernza.

506
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:48.680
It comes from a wild grass that is a relative with wheat.

507
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:58.840
Today Petrus Jakobsson will bake one of the first breads in Sweden -

508
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.920
- On this unique flour.

509
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.600
I don't know anyone who has baked it.
 It's very exciting.
 Note BV in.

510
00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:14.280
It feels like it can go anyway.
 Hope it tastes good.

511
00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:21.920
Then in terms of consistency, the feeling in the oven and everything we will see a little later.

512
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:28.520
Peter bakes on sourdough, a natural yeast consisting of flour and water.

513
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:34.000
... and leave to stand.
 When you do it with this flour -

514
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.600
-React it pretty funny and become cemented -

515
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.960
- Because the grinding degree is rough.

516
00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:48.880
In a while it will be like a fun clay they have at a preschool.

517
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.680
- This is 100 percent Kernza?
 -Just.

518
00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.040
The wheat flour that Peter got hold of is malt along with the core -

519
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.240
- What makes the flour become coarser.

520
00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:07.720
It reacts, I think only based on the grinding degree, like a rye bread.

521
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.520
Can this flour be grown in Sweden?

522
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.640
In a field, biologist Anna Westerbergh keeps on -

523
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:32.280
- Adapt the perennial wheat from the United States, so that it will thrive here.

524
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:39.080
Now we have stepped straight into our research work and the development of -

525
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:45.280
- A perennial relative of our one -year -old wheat, called Kernza.

526
00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:53.120
We have twenty different populations of Kernza here, which we study carefully.

527
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.960
What is it about the perennial plants that make them better?

528
00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.160
It is that you can take harvest from the same plant and field -

529
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:09.120
- During several years without the field having to be plowed and sauce every year.

530
00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.960
The roots of the multi-year-old wheat plant go deeper and wider-

531
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.640
- Enter the one -year -old.

532
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:25.000
This allows it to bind more carbon dioxide and nutrients in the soil.

533
00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:30.640
This is important, for binding carbon dioxide is crucial -

534
00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:35.120
- To reduce climate emissions from agriculture.

535
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:39.160
I have watered a little, because the soil is dry.

536
00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.640
This year it is a dry summer.

537
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.600
- Now comes the whole plant.
 - Now we got it up.

538
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:53.360
We have dug off a lot of roots that go far down the ground.

539
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:59.240
- We only get with the top roots?
 - Yes, we did not dig such a big hole.

540
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.360
With the roots that go deep and wide-

541
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.560
- Can they effectively utilize the industry in the soil.

542
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.640
Eventually, the carbon is stored into the soil.

543
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:17.280
This also means that we get a minor emissions of greenhouse gases.

544
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:30.000
At Peter's bakery, the dough has been fermented clearly and should now be baked.

545
00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:35.640
Now it's time to shape this hundred percent dough.

546
00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:40.280
- This is 100 percent Kernza?
 -Just.

547
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:48.480
It feels fun to feel on the first attempts that it will be a dough.

548
00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.480
It both fermentes, smells good -

549
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.400
- And still has a smooth feeling to work with.

550
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:09.640
Just like our other breads, we add quite a lot of steam -

551
00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:15.280
- To get a better crust and let the bread open up.

552
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.400
Hope it blooms a little more.

553
00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:26.120
But there is a problem.
 Ordinary wheat gives five times more returns -

554
00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.080
- Out perennial Kernzavete.

555
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:34.640
It becomes difficult with the profitability of farmers who can think of growing it.

556
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:40.160
Kernza has really only been planted for 20 years.

557
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:47.280
But nothing says that we cannot reach the harvest levels that we see in the wheat.

558
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:53.240
We can make it much more efficient with modern plant breeding methods.

559
00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.160
And we have more knowledge about the biology of these plants.

560
00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:04.520
I am convinced that we will see many perennial cereals -

561
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:12.320
- And perennial crops generally in the fields in Sweden and throughout the world.

562
00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:25.640
It's time to remove the freshly baked breads from the oven.

563
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:32.680
A very own scent compared to the other scents here in the bakery.

564
00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:38.800
A new scent stands out, of course.
 This one is significant.

565
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.840
A new bakery scent in this bakery.

566
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.200
Now they are ready.

567
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:56.200
The experiment went better than Peter thought.

568
00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:01.360
But is he interested in using the flour in the future?

569
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:09.600
Mm ... it's exciting, because it only has yeast during the day.

570
00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.360
But it has got a lot of acid and taste.

571
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:19.160
This would probably be interested in -

572
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.640
- If it would be to shop.

573
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.400
It got much better than I thought.

574
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:32.200
You want a bag directly.
 Note new extension from here to the end

575
00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:39.200
Now Carola Magnusson has cooked food from these ingredients.

576
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:43.840
-Thanks so much!
 -Very exciting!
 What is this?

577
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.720
Here is part from each part of the different reports.

578
00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:53.480
At the bottom are the rape, the rapeseed.

579
00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:58.760
Then an aquaviaically grown cucumber that I have salted.

580
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:03.880
And a pliers that I quickly swept in the pan with a little salt.

581
00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:06.920
Have a nice meal!

582
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.640
Mm!
 Oh, how good it was!

583
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.880
Wait now ...

584
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.560
Between meatball and falafel.
 There somewhere ...

585
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.120
Surf and Turf too.
 Wonderful good!

586
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.840
We have a family that will sample as well.

587
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.480
Here we have the Österlund family.

588
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.400
John, Sarah, Nathan, Bella and Jonas.

589
00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.600
What have they got in front of them?

590
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:50.600
They have received a deep -fried rapeseed ball -

591
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:57.000
- With aquaponically salted cucumber and a pliers to begin with.

592
00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:02.840
Then a small beach snack that we have boiled quickly in white wine and garlic.

593
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.880
Then a pad thai made on sugar pliers and hemp meat.

594
00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:17.200
Down here we have a small beach crab and fish that I have not eaten before.

595
00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:22.080
There is fried pliers in the bottom, the truffle of the sea.

596
00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:28.600
And so a little baked tomato.
 Next to a bread on a wheat called ...

597
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.560
- Kkernza.
 -Right!

598
00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.680
Chop in!

599
00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:40.320
- Is the fish grown in a garage?
 - Yes, together with the tomato.

600
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:46.040
And together the salad found in Pad Thai.

601
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:53.400
- You seem pretty positive.
 -It was delicious!

602
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:59.880
You plug.
 There is often spaghetti and ketchup among students.

603
00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:07.040
At least as I remember it.
 Could this be a challenger?

604
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.920
Pad Thai was super good.
 Much more exciting flavors.

605
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:18.400
It was very similar to ordinary pad thai, the only difference was the consistency -

606
00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.400
- In this seagrass ...

607
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:28.240
But it was a little fun to eat it.
 Different, a dispute on it all.

608
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:34.360
- It was hemp meat in the pad Thai?
 -Yes exactly.

609
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.480
The Kernza bread, has anyone ventured to it?

610
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.640
- It tasted a little ... – wort bread.

611
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:49.240
This is fun for me who doesn't eat meat.
 It feels a bit like meat.
 Note BV

612
00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:53.360
Alger, was it difficult to do it, Carola?

613
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.200
I have never cooked this sugar algae before.

614
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:04.520
But I think it was outstandingly good.
 I like the texture on it.

615
00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:11.960
It is "snappy" when chewing on it, like a hard fried fungus.

616
00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:19.680
It secretes like a small secretion.
 It is very happy to take in.

617
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:25.120
That tastes a little sea and sugar together.
 Very good to cook on.

618
00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:30.000
Was there anything that was difficult to repair this?

619
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.760
No ... Yes, you have to try it out.

620
00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:41.800
The rope in the rapeseed was work with to find good combinations.

621
00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:48.680
The hemp meat behaved very well when frying, so it was not difficult.

622
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:55.200
If you want to see how Carola cooked the food, go to our web then everything is there.

623
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.480
You can also read more about the food of the future.

624
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:06.360
Next week it is about new excavations in Pompeii.
 See you then!
