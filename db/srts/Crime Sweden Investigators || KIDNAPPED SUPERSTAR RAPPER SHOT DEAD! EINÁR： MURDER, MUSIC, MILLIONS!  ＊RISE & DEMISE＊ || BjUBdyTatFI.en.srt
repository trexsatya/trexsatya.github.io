00:00:00,101 --> 00:00:05,405
the nineteen-year-old swedish rapper Einár died\h
after being shot in south of stockholm last night\h\h

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:12,844
the shooting happened around 11 pm in hammarby\h
sjöstad (where he lived) and so far no one has\h\h

3
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:18,382
been arrested. Einár was due to witness in the\h
appeals court next week after the high profile\h\h

4
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:23,586
case in which he was kidnapped and robbed by a\h
stockholm gang. since he didn't show up to the\h\h

5
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:28,623
trial in the district court the police were\h
planning on escorting him there next week.\h\h

6
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:33,193
the 19 year old has earlier described\h
his upbringing in "Dalen" of stockholm as\h\h

7
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:38,164
influenced by drugs and weapons. he had\h
his breakthrough at 16 years old and has\h\h

8
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:44,869
won several awards for his music and in 2019 he\h
was the most popular swedish artist on spotify.

9
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:49,306
Einár was born september 5th 2002\h
and grew up on the south side of\h\h

10
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:55,578
stockholm in "Dalen" he always wanted to be\h
a rapper and started rapping at 6 years old.\h\h

11
00:00:55,578 --> 00:00:58,947
he made his first serious song\h
on a beat when he was just 10\h\h

12
00:00:58,947 --> 00:01:03,251
and he was early on recognized as a\h
talented rapper in this neighborhood.

13
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:09,689
"This morning mama`s babyboy said goodbye for the last time, she knew something was wrong when he walked out that door"

14
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:15,127
Einár had problems in school and started acting\h
out and getting in trouble. he was taken from\h\h

15
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:19,363
his mother and put in government facilities\h
for troubled kids on multiple occasions.\h

16
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:28,304
on february 18 2018 when Einár was just 15\h
years old he and a friend separated a teen\h\h

17
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:33,174
from his other friends he punched the other\hboy then tried to take him down to the ground\h\h

18
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:38,545
put a knife to the teen's throat and held the\h
weapon against the victim's stomach then proceeded\h\h

19
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:47,185
to steal his jacket. Einár releases "duckar\h
popo" with a music video on may 24th 2018.\h\h

20
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:54,058
it receives a lot of attention but also a lot\h
of backlash with people wondering quote "why is\h\h

21
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:59,929
this little white boy pretending to be gangster."
later that same year just three days after Einárs\h\h

22
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:06,501
16th birthday on september 8th 2018 he stabbed\h
and cut another teen in the arm with a knife he\h\h

23
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:13,239
was charged as a minor for assault with a deadly\h
weapon. at the starting stages of his career Einár\h\h

24
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:19,911
was supported by SSTV (Southside TV) which backed him with money\h
for making songs and music videos also giving him\h\h

25
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:26,550
much needed backup and "street cred "in the gangsta\h
rap genre Einár was making music in. he had a hood\h\h

26
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,088
to claim and the "Dalen" network as his muscle he\h
was managed at that time by "Paki" and "Chapo"

27
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:57,341
on december 16th 2018 Einár close friend and\h
manager "Paki" is shot dead inside a apartment in\h\h

28
00:02:57,341 --> 00:03:03,813
"Dalen" at least seven shots were fired and "Paki"\h
was shot in the head and chest several times

29
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:12,119
"Paki passed away, Im not cappin. you dont get it bro it happened all random. I cant tell who did it....you wont believe it"

30
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:15,032
"With my bro *Paki* len we go against anybody"

31
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:23,362
tragically the alleged shooter is Einár`s other manager nicknamed "Chapo"

32
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:29,700
Chapo is tried for the murder of "Paki" but the\h
charges don't stick and he is found not guilty\h\h

33
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,772
first in "tingsrätten" and then in "hovrätten".\h
Einár continues to release several songs and\h\h

34
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:42,610
videos on youtube but it was in january\h
2019 that the rapper blew up overnight\h\h

35
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,981
when he released the song "Katten i trakten"\h
which loosely translates to the neighborhood\h\h

36
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:53,185
baddie. around that time Einár got himself into\h
a rap beef when he and another rapper called

37
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:59,257
"MPL" went back and forth online on social media\h
with diss song stand trading insults and threats

38
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:06,629
"On my mama you`re a lost cause, you tattooed a tear on your face and started acting hard. Youre a snitch, both you and me know the truth"

39
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:23,576
"Tell youre family to stay inside, because the one we find I swear disappears. And I remember when I ate you like dinner, you gave me 30 000 SEK so of course your pissed off. BTW brother tomorrow Im escaping (juvie), I swear when I hit you it was a shame man. you said "okay stop Im begging you, you win". And when I catch you Im going to carve up your cheek "bre". When "Kaka" beat you up I was there, after your video you got a price on your head. We assault, we cut, we shoot and you don`t know nothing about that".

40
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:34,051
Einár and MPL had collaborated on a song with Dilly D that was released early 2018\h
but the two rappers had issues\h\h

41
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:36,186
with each other after that for\h
unknown reasons, at one point\h\h

42
00:04:39,188 --> 00:04:44,860
Einár uploads a story on instagram where his\h
armed with a gun saying he's looking for "mpl"

43
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:54,534
on his overnight stardom with "Katten i trakten"
Einár had this to say "I first released it on\h\h

44
00:04:55,501 --> 00:05:00,605
youtube and there started trending at number\h
one and it got 400 000 views in five days\h\h

45
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:07,911
then I released it on spotify and the next\h
day it had 250 000 streams it blew up and\h\h

46
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:12,548
things got completely crazy i could not\h
understand it and it was the number one\h\h

47
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:18,053
record in sweden the most played song in the\h
whole country the numbers just grew and grew"\h

48
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:24,057
after his first banger everything the\h
golden child touched turned to gold\h\h

49
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:28,728
claiming the top spot on the charts and his\h
song having over a hundred million streams\h\h

50
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:36,000
the common theme in Einárs music was violence\h
and gang crime. Einár`s lyrics often referred to\h\h

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,472
weapons violence and drugs and his music videos\h
also show both weapons drugs and known criminals.

52
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:47,643
most of these music videos were shot and took\h
place in "Enskededalen" which is an area on the\h\h

53
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:53,180
south side of stockholm and in this neighborhood\h
there is a group active that the police have\h\h

54
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,485
identified as a criminal network after the\h
success of the smash hit song "Katten i trakten"

55
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:06,624
then it was time for Einár to introduce himself\h
for real he then delivered his debut album\h\h

56
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:13,530
"Första Klass (first class)" the album had features from rappers\h
"K27" and "ADAAM". on the album among other\h\h

57
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,401
songs there was the praised title track "Första Klass (first\hclass)" which today has over 40 million streams\h\h

58
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:27,408
the newspaper "Expressen" and reported that in just\h
10 weeks in the autumn of 2019 Einár had around\h\h

59
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:34,547
60 list placements which completely crushed all\h
competition after the extremely successful year\h\h

60
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:41,352
of 2019 when Einár the fair-skinned gangster\h
rapper basically became sweden's golden boy he\h\h

61
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:48,624
was praised in the media on tv and in interviews he\h
becomes sweden's most played artist extremely fast\h\h

62
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:55,697
at his quick rise to fame in hindsight perhaps\h
was too quick for a 16 year old boy by the end of\h\h

63
00:06:55,697 --> 00:07:03,403
2019 Einár had released both his debut album "Första Klass (first\h
class)" and his second album called "Nummer 1 (number one)" released\h\h

64
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:09,975
on the rapper's birthday. in the beginning of 2020\h
the rapper ends up winning the award for newcomer\h\h

65
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:16,246
of the year at the grammy awards in addition\h
he also won hip hop of the year. at another\h\h

66
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:23,852
award show "P3 Guldgala" he took home the song\h
of the year category for the super hit "Katten i trakten"

67
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:48,372
but meanwhile Einár has massive and unseen\h
commercial success as a rapper and artist his\h\h

68
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:54,710
personal relationships are deteriorating there's\h
a dispute over money where the record label\h\h

69
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,814
production companies and criminal elements\h
supporting Einár early on in his career\h\h

70
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:06,386
feel stiffed on the profits when Einár starts\h
to generate millions in income. the details\h\h

71
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:12,291
differ but allegedly Einár's mother started\h
another company "ns production scandinavia"

72
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,295
for Einár to release music through which\h
legally would allow him to break his contract\h\h

73
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:21,765
and keep all the money he brings in\h
for himself this didn't sit well at\h\h

74
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:26,602
all with people on the street. Einár lost\h
his backup and was vulnerable to be attacked.

75
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:34,775
in april of 2020 Einár thinks he's going to\h
a studio session with fellow rapper "Haval" but\h\h

76
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:41,881
instead his kidnapped by a criminal organization\h
called "Vårbynätverket (Vårby Network / gang)". he is beaten humiliated\h\h

77
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:48,286
and robbed by his captors of a rolex watch\h
worth more than 300 thousand SEK, two gold chains\h\h

78
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:55,892
worth more than 160 000 SEK and a gun. not only that\h
his kidnappers also try to extort him after they\h\h

79
00:08:55,892 --> 00:09:01,930
release him saying they want 3 million or they will\h
release demeaning pictures they took of him during\h\h

80
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,302
the actual kidnapping. when the extortion appears\h
not to be working the gang contacts another gang\h\h

81
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:14,707
paying them for a bomb to be built. they want them\h
to take the bomb and blow it up outside Einár`s or\h\h

82
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:20,545
his parents home, members of the gang are on their\h
way with an explosive device in a car to Einár's\h\h

83
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:27,750
home but they turn around when they are met by\h
police on the spot. so the kidnappers released the\h\h

84
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:33,655
pictures online but it didn't get the effect they\h
were after. Einár's career wasn't destroyed and\h\h

85
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:39,860
he commented briefly on this on social media\h
basically saying "anybody can get kidnapped"

86
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:11,018
instead of paying, Einár went looking for protection\h
to "May Nätverket (May network / gang)" and "Västeråsnätverket (Västerås Network / gang)"

87
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:16,689
which are the arch rivals and number one opps
for "Vårbynätverket (Vårby Network / gang that kidnapped Einár)" allegedly paying them a\h\h

88
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:24,162
cash sum and percentages on his music career. "Free Mayk (Mike) Makyil Yokhanna" "Free Namo ("Namo Stress" Boss of Västerås Gang)  "Free Ali" "Free Alan" shoutout\h"Kardå (Namo Stress little brother).

89
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:30,500
with the Encrochat network being cracked, EncroChat
was a europe-based communications network and\h\h

90
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,971
service provider used primarily by organized\h
crime members to plan criminal activities,

91
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:40,775
the gang's kidnapping of Einár was revealed\h
and good evidence of the crime was provided\h\h

92
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:45,245
since Einár never reported this incident\h
to the authorities and never cooperated with\h\h

93
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:50,449
law enforcement. during the police's work on the\h
case it was revealed that another famous rapper\h\h

94
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:56,621
"Yasin" was involved in a previously unsuccessful\h
kidnapping attempt of Einár, where yasin's role\h\h

95
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:02,792
was to lure Einár to a specific location so\h
the kidnappers could take him. "Yasin" was found\h\h

96
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:07,863
guilty and got imprisoned for his involvement\h
in the preparation for the kidnapping he has\h\h

97
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:13,267
already served his time and "Yasin" is a free\h
man "Yasin" is connected and considered a member\h\h

98
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:20,373
of the infamous stockholm gang "Shottaz" that has\h
close ties to the gang "Filterlösa Grabbar" or "FLG"

99
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:28,213
another famous rapper and "friend" of Einár
"Haval" later took over yasin's role in the\h\h

100
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:34,217
successful kidnapping and lured Einár into the\h
kidnapper's hands. Haval could be seen in pictures\h\h

101
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:39,188
when he and Einár arrived to the kidnapper's\h
apartment  and later wearing Einár's gold chains\h\h

102
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:44,058
"Haval " received a sentence of two and a half\h
years in prison for his role in the kidnapping\h\h

103
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:50,263
he will probably be released in the summer of\h
2022. "Haval" is considered to be close to one of\h\h

104
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:56,702
the leaders of one side of "Dalen Nätverket (Dalen Network / gang)" with the\h
nickname *Super Mario* he's also considered mostly\h\h

105
00:11:56,702 --> 00:12:02,606
in control of nearby neighborhoods "Bagarmossen"
and "Skarpnäck" where "Haval" is from at that time.

106
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:07,977
several other people involved in the kidnapping\h
had earlier been seen standing side by side with\h\h

107
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:14,216
Einár music videos and pictures not long before\h
this event Einár was reportedly robbed at least\h\h

108
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:21,321
one time at gunpoint during the fall of 2020.\h
in late 2020 and early 2021 Einár starts to diss\h\h

109
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:27,726
Yasin but mostly rapper Haval and other people\h
that "turned on" him both on social media and with\h\h

110
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:34,332
subliminal disses and on a live on instagram\h
he calls "Haval" a snake and a son of a b!tch.

111
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,613
in the beginning of 2021 Einár rides\h
through Haval`s neighborhood "Skarpnäck"\h

112
00:12:52,613 --> 00:12:56,683
in a car playing Haval`s verse of their\h
collaboration track before the beef called\h\h

113
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:59,485
"HELL YE" a clear message being sent to Haval\h

114
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,794
reportedly people in charge of Haval's instagram\h
account since Haval was locked up at the time\hfor Einár`s kidnapping.

115
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:14,730
replied to EInár with an instagram story\h
where they are standing at the exact\h\h

116
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:21,736
same location Einár was hours before posing\h
with guns. Einár puts up more stories\h\h

117
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:24,371
posting with automatic weapons as a reply...

118
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:39,483
on february 18 2021 Einár was arrested for\h
a serious gun offense when two pistols were\h\h

119
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:45,655
found by police in his home. Einár releases a\h
song together with the rapper "23" in\h\h

120
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:53,528
the beginning of april 2021. "23" is backed and supported by
by "May Nätverket (May network / gang, leader is Mayk)" and that gang is led by Mayk (Mike) *real name Maykil Yokhanna*\h\h

121
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:58,799
and they are at war with Vårbynätverket (the gang that kidnapped Einár)\h
which Einár hates for obvious reasons\h.

122
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:09,807
in the song "Trendsetter" both\h
rappers take shots at Vårbynätverket.
