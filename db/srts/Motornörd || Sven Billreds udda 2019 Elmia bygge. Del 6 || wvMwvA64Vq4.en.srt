1
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,720
I drink way too much coffee. Thanks that is good.

2
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,640
Must celebrate the start -up with coffee and good cake.

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,020
After that maybe there will be funeral beer instead.

4
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,140
Hello! Hi, is it party?

5
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,320
It was like damn!

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,720
Well, it's Easter soon.

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,800
Well I know ... hahahaha!

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00.640
-Now the motor is mounted. Yes.

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,080
All ignition cables are drawn and vacuum for the ignition and electricity ..

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,780
... and even the oil pressure. It may be good to know when starting the engine.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,880
Most of it is connected and clear.

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,140
The cooling is also connected so you can see that it works.

13
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,640
So it does not go hot or any leakage.

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,760
It always leaks in some hose clamp.

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,620
It just should be to turn the key now and we'll see if it works.

16
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,660
You never know but it will be exciting. -Yes, very!

17
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,960
I am preparing the main power switch.

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,885
I am Anders and brother of Sven.

19
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:47,760
I try to help as best it goes into the last.

20
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,440
He has a little stressful ... hehehe.

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,800
He still has a lot and still do.

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59.660
-What is your task today? It will be to help him with small things.

23
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,180
Then he gets to polish and polish what he is good at.

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07.020
It's a switch.

25
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,100
There are 2 ink here and here the cables are switched on.

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,160
And screws ate with them hear the screws. Then you stop in this ...

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,080
So it sits there ... when you turn it out.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,600
And when you put this together.

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,660
When you turn on it, it goes down so it becomes contact.

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,480
One of these grounded in the body instead of going to the other Poland and now it is fixed.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,100
-Do you think the car will start? Yes it will go well.

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,720
He is good at this Sven. It will go well.

33
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,520
It is certainly something that needs to be fixed, but it will go well.

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,600
Tjena, welcome! Good today's!

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,100
Here are the guys who have balanced the entire engine package.

36
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,120
Crankshafts, drove yes the rub ...

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06.800
Now we see if it works.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,160
-Had you managed to do this yourself? I probably hadn't been able to.

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,760
It probably takes some letters to cope with it.

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,880
-Do you have any vehicles yourself? Well I have some mustangs standing.

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,080
-So you are Ford guy then? This cheva. Well that's why I have my hands in my pocket.

42
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,160
-Hahahaha!

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,800
It scratches a little ...

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,060
-Are you nervous? Well I'm so used to ... hahaha.

45
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,040
Don't know how many cars I have built ... It is probably 12-14.

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,980
Sometimes it goes and sometimes not. I think it will go well.

47
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,800
I'm not like American ...

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,260
... when they stand and scratch their heads as it shoots and throws fire out of the carburetors.

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,180
They cannot understand what is wrong. And then they discover that the distributor is wrong.

50
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,600
That kind of thing is you checked before?

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01.560
And this I have checked several times so it should work.

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,740
-It will be very exciting. Yes.

53
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08.940
-And lots of friends are here. Yes the rumor spreads quickly.

54
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,120
And then it's something new. No one has heard such an engine before.

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,260
It's a little exciting and will be fun.

56
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,240
We'll see how it goes.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,500
Yes exactly...

58
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,660
The small computers to the cooling system. -A fan or?

59
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,400
No, it's the water pumps. They go for a while and feel.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,080
What do you think, will it start?

61
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,520
It will probably start but with some problems maybe but ...

62
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,240
... goes it does.

63
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,060
Should I start?

64
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07.860
It does not get fuel.

65
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,240
I have screwed up the idle on both.

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,940
To get some flow. Then fuel goes so it gets sucked all the time.

67
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:24,080
Otherwise, it can be difficult for the other carburetors to get gasoline when they are so long.

68
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,620
-As it gasoline? Well, I have to have a choke on it.

69
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,740
It gets gasoline but not enough.

70
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,180
Does it work now? YEA !!!

71
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,740
Sven can you open the door? So we get some air.

72
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,280
We may need it.

73
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00.040
Finally!

74
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02.020
-Are you happy? Now I'm happy.

75
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05,180
It was good ride in the engine when it got hot.

76
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,580
Ah but it needs to be run in before piston rings and everything has settled.

77
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,980
It is noticeable that it leaks a little.

78
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,240
Now it will work. Now it is just driving on so you get ready for Elmia.

79
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,000
There is only a little polishing left.

80
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,880
"A LITTLE!" Hahaha!!

81
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29.605
All the mocks ...

82
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,620
I think the carburetors are tight. Usually leak a little otherwise.

83
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,580
I have to start it again.

84
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,240
At least one more time.

85
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,640
Now you don't need a choke? We'll see if it's easy.

86
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,300
Where.

87
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,540
A ray straight out here. Well there.

88
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,560
Oh phase. I try to tighten this.

89
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,580
Well it is from there.

90
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,140
Yes that was why ... but it must leak more.

91
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,540
-How has it been? Well it has gone well I think.

92
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,000
-What was it that was first strolling? I have to have choke.

93
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,160
The car needs so much fuel when it is cold.

94
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45.060
And then...

95
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,380
... I'll probably put in a cupboard.

96
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,900
The ax pump is a little too small.

97
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,220
So I have to put it there.

98
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,620
What it is leaking ...

99
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09.860
There Sven.

100
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12.860
Up somewhere. That's that welding.

101
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
Well there. There it leaks.

102
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,400
When I pressed my finger, water came.

103
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,540
When I pressed my finger, the welding split.

104
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,080
It's fun to be able to help a little ... hehehe.

105
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,120
Then there will be a back job there.

106
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,880
-What do you give for the first start? The experts have to comment on this.

107
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,980
To be Chevrolet it was pretty good.

108
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,380
Hahahaha!

109
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,640
What grades do you give an 8a? Yes somewhere there.

110
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,960
Always exciting. Absolutely superb.

111
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,880
Yes it was something new. Yes with such simple means.

112
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02.820
You have witnessed as no one else has seen.

113
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,900
I haven't seen any straight 12A.

114
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,340
Definitely no one with offset ignition.

115
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12.560
-Can he approve then? Oh.

116
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,220
With praise!

117
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,240
Then we come to the look but there it is the taste like the back.

118
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,720
It was probably a sense that I would have a crane here.

119
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,880
If something would happen along the way. Yes then you become standing.

120
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,020
This system holds quite a lot. How many cans were I filled up?

121
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,100
Three large glycols as much water plus two 5 liter cans.

122
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,480
If you want to pick up water in a stream, you can run many times.

123
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,600
-What do you give Sven for points? An 8a or 9a almost.

124
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00.040
A little water leakage but clearly approved. I get to agree with a 9a.

125
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,600
It's a cranky creation this, huh? Clearly different but absolutely wonderful.

126
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08.860
-What job he has done. Great!

127
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,460
And the innovation.

128
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,340
Just getting the idea to build the car in this way.

129
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,420
He is good Sven.

130
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,460
-No had fixed with the engine, huh? Jajemän we have balanced both.

131
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,660
Adjusted and mixed a little so it should go soft and nice. And it obviously did.

132
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,940
We have balanced with the cardan.

133
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,360
It is quite important.

134
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,080
-What do you give for points to yourself?

135
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,540
If 10 points are perfect then it's almost a 9a.

136
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,200
You can expect a little leakage.

137
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:50,560
That I must have choke ... yes you could have thought of it.

138
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,620
Other I think the engine went well. And then the engine is not yet run.

139
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,120
I am satisfied, really satisfied. It will be fun to test drive then.

140
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,120
-So this was the thing to fix? Yep, this is the water leakage.

141
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09.960
Are you doing it or can you blame someone?

142
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,395
That's myself. It is a very own construction.

143
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,940
Unfortunately, I can't blame anyone else.

144
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:24,020
There in this welding. I get to weld all the way and add support.

145
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,220
There will probably be some break on this but then it will work.

146
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,340
I get to print it before I put it again.

147
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,980
-But it was the only thing. Well, you have to be happy about that.

148
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,180
-And a little stroll with the carburetor. I get to put a choke and a cable.

149
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,960
It's a pretty small thing really.

150
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,220
And your friends give you high ratings. Yes it is always nice.

151
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,880
I hope to finish with the grinding tonight. Then only the polishing is left.

152
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,640
A little fire to taillights. The idea and interior should be mounted.

153
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,280
I have one and a half weeks on me.

154
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,700
And the grill is going there ..

155
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09.400
-Does it start to get stressful now? Well it has been for six months.

156
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,720
Now it feels to go in the right direction.

157
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,040
I have to start polishing now.

158
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,500
If you polish, we will be visible in the future.

159
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,320
Have it for so long! See you!
