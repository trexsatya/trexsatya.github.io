1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,160
Democracy means national government.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,800
This means that we together decide how the country should be governed.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,560
Through free elections, citizens vote on politicians-

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,320
-which represents the will of the people.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,880
But living in a democracy means more than being able to vote in elections.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,960
You have rights, such as
 That you can say what you think-

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,320
-Seave out the way you want, take advantage of all the news-

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,280
-And say when you think something feels wrong.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,840
People in a functioning democracy easily forget how fragile it can be-

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,560
-So it feels so obvious.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,440
Keep in mind that in some countries the democratic development has gone backwards-

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,000
-and people's freedom has been limited.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,720
When propaganda and lies are spread and sources miss-

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,880
-The free word and with that, the democratic society is limited.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Therefore, it is important to keep track of how you can think of source critically.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,360
Divide the facts and opinion.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,720
When you read or hear something, think about whether it is fact or an opinion.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,240
Both facts and opinions are found in newspapers and on news sites.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,200
You as a reader must keep track of what you read.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,880
Many newspapers have a leadership page where their political position is expressed.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Two different leadership pages can write about private schools-

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,520
-Where one is for and the other against.

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,160
They express their political views.
 There is no right or wrong-

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,920
-Why it's just opinions.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,840
Under the headings leaders, culture and submissions you will often find views-

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,120
-While the news sites have sources and are more fact -based.

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,240
Who is the sender?

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,120
Although it is a person you trust, who usually come up with smart tanks-

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,680
-Still, attempt to be source critical.

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,960
Where has it received information from and why does it want to spread it further?

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,600
Sometimes friends, parents, celebrities and people on social media-

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,720
-Raw spreading opinions as facts.

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,200
Public persons can comment on things they do not have knowledge om-

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
-As because they feel the subject.

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,280
Think about the source of origin, who benefits from the information disseminating

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,640
-and if it is still relevant.

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Before you disseminate information further, be absolutely sure it is correct.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Is it really true?

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,360
On social media it is difficult to determine if anything is true, a bluff-

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,520
-A a misunderstanding, a lie or maybe half.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,000
Things that look true can be fake-

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,520
-And things that look wrong may turn out to be true.

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Influencers and viral clips on e.g.
 Tictok and youtube-

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,040
-Can get much greater spread than a news journalist writes.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Does the information feel relevant, urgent and true?

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,880
Then you easily forget to be source -critical and share further.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,840
The information may be taken out of context and apply something else.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,520
With another sound, other text, or by removing part of a movie-

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,960
-Can it have a completely different meaning.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Confirmation bias is a psychological mechanism-

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,480
-while make us particularly attentive-

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,440
-On information that confirms what we already think.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Some tips on how to review the content:

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,160
In a democracy, citizens should be able to make informed decisions.

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,320
It requires that you know how to evaluate and analyze information.

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,480
When you focus on source criticism, you do not want to trust anything.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,240
But there are sources you can trust.

58
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
A credible source has source references, is independent-

59
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
-And it is clear who is the sender.
