1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,160
Democracy means people's rule.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,800
That means we together decide 
how the country should be run.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,560
Through free elections, 
citizens elect politicians-

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,320
-representing the will of the people.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,880
But living in a democracy 
means more than voting in elections.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,960
You have many rights, such as 
the right to express your opinions-

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,320
-to look however you like, 
to access news of all forms-

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,280
-and to speak up 
when something seems wrong.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,840
People in a functioning democracy 
can forget how fragile democracy is-

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,560
-because it feels so natural.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,440
But in some countries, the democratic 
development has gone backwards-

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,000
-and people's freedom 
has been restricted.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,720
When propaganda and lies are spread 
and sources are missing-

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,880
-free speech, and subsequently 
democracy, is restricted.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,040
So it's important to know 
how to be critical of sources.

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,360
Make sure to tell fact from opinion.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,720
When you read or hear something, 
question whether it's fact or opinion.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,240
You'll find both facts and opinions 
in newspapers and on news sites.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,200
You need to know what you're reading.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,880
Many newspapers have editorials where 
their political views are expressed.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Two editorials might concern 
private schools-

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,520
-where one is for and the other against.

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,160
They're expressing political views. 
There's no right or wrong-

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,920
-it's only their opinions.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,840
On the editorial, culture and letter to 
the editor's pages you'll find opinions.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,120
The news pages will include 
source references and are fact-based.

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,240
Who is the sender?

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,120
Even if it's someone you trust, 
who normally has clever ideas-

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,680
-you should still be critical.

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,960
Where did they get the information from 
and why do they want to spread it?

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,600
Sometimes friends, parents, 
celebrities or people in social media-

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,720
-spread opinions as facts by mistake.

33
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,200
Public persons can make statements 
about things they know little about-

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
-just because it means a lot to them.

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,280
Find the original source. Who benefits 
from the information being spread-

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,640
-and is it still relevant?

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,000
Before you share the information, 
make sure that you know it's correct.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Is it really true?

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,360
On social media it's hard to tell 
if something is true, fake-

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,520
-a misunderstanding, 
a lie or a half-truth.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,000
Things that look true might be false-

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,520
-and things that appear to be false 
might turn out to be true.

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Influencers and viral clips, 
e.g. on TikTok or YouTube-

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,040
-can be shared to many more 
than what a news reporter writes.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Does the information seem 
relevant, urgent and true?

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,880
Then you often forget to be critical of 
the source, and share the information.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,840
It might be taken out of its context 
and concern something else.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,520
With a different sound or text, 
or if part of the clip is edited out-

49
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,960
-it might have a different meaning.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Confirmation bias is a subconscious 
psychological mechanism-

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,000
-which makes us pay more attention-

52
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,440
-to information 
that confirms what we already think.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,000
Here are some tips 
on how to check content:

54
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,880
Question yourself. Do you believe this 
because you want it to be true?

55
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,640
Google. Search for something that 
confirms or disproves the information.

56
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,680
Question whether the information 
might be taken out of its context.

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,160
Citizens in a democracy should 
be able to make well-founded decisions.

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,320
In order to do that, you need to be able 
to evaluate and analyse information.

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,480
When you're focused on source 
criticism, it's hard to trust anyone.

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,240
But there are sources you can trust.

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
A reliable source has references 
and is independent-

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
-and the sender's identity is clear.

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,720
