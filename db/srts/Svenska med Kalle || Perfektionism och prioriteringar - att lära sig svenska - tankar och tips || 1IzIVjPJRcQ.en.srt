00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:01,805
Hello

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:05,125
In this movie so will

3
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:07,985
talk about a question like me

4
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:11,225
think many people can recognize themselves in

5
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:15,495
which is about perfectionism

6
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:17,535
to want to be perfect

7
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:20,425
and about being stressed

8
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:22,975
When one learns a language

9
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:26,075
And then I was going to answer a little short

10
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:27,825
on two questions I have received

11
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:31,325
but we start with

12
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:34,705
Perfectionism and

13
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:35,705
The stress

14
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:38,635
and the question of how to

15
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:40,835
Should choose

16
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:44,335
what one is trying to learn

17
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,565
and what one is waiting for for later

18
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:52,185
For I notice that many

19
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,415
On Youtube and on Facebook

20
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:57,615
and on my instagram

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,400
and in my classroom

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
becomes stressed

23
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:05,645
And frustrated

24
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:07,395
And sad

25
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:10,245
When they don't understand

26
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:14,425
and sometimes it feels reasonable

27
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:17,685
I can think that "yes, this should you understand"

28
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,555
This I would also like to understand

29
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:22,115
in your situation

30
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:26,155
But many times it feels unreasonable

31
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,005
and unreasonable means that

32
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:32,565
one hopes too much

33
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:35,525
too fast, it's not

34
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:39,175
logically to believe that one should be able to

35
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:42,085
Understand difficult things

36
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:44,745
In the beginning without one must accept

37
00:01:44,745 --> 00:01:47,165
that it takes a long time

38
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:48,925
to learn some things

39
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,355
And then this one feels

40
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,875
frustration or the sad feeling

41
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,525
A little unreasonable

42
00:01:57,525 --> 00:02:00,085
Because I think "yes but, it's natural ...

43
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:03,625
that you don't understand or can this yet "

44
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,155
it must get to come later

45
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,715
so

46
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:13,425
Just that, this can be called, I think everyone

47
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,435
have more or less

48
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:19,295
by perfectionism

49
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:22,265
and perfectionism is thus

50
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:25,805
the will to be perfect

51
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:28,785
to manage something to 100%

52
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:31,715
Not to make mistakes

53
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:34,815
For example, you want to speak Swedish

54
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:35,815
perfect

55
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,375
it is different but many have

56
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,455
a bit like that anyway

57
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:45,755
And there may be many different

58
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:48,695
Psychological

59
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:51,485
Thus, thoughtful

60
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:52,975
Causes behind it

61
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:56,345
It may be such that

62
00:02:57,195 --> 00:03:00,025
you feel sad or frustrated

63
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:02,635
When comparing to whom you are

64
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:05,515
and how you can speak on your

65
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:08,435
mother tongue and who you become

66
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:11,645
and what you can say in your new language

67
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,565
It's hard to

68
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:17,155
When you talk in your mother tongue

69
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,095
can you say exactly what you want and express

70
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:23,075
exactly what you think and feel

71
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,135
But in Swedish it becomes

72
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:28,985
So little and

73
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:31,725
so bullied you might say

74
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:34,355
bullied means approximately poor

75
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:37,945
It feels like you can't say what you want

76
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:41,595
and

77
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:44,585
Another thing that I think many anyway

78
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:47,945
A little affected

79
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,525
It is a feeling that one wants to impress

80
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:54,865
There is a word for it in Swedish and it is

81
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,395
vanity

82
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,905
and vanity is the will to

83
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:02,295
be good and good

84
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:04,935
and impress others

85
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:07,735
simply appear as a very

86
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:09,385
good and good person

87
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,865
and that ... I can for example

88
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:15,695
feel it when I speak English

89
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,635
I understand that my English is not perfect

90
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,135
But somewhere in the back of my head so I would

91
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:24,895
want to be able to shine as one says

92
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:27,895
impress, have a perfect pronunciation

93
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:31,025
able to express me exactly

94
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:34,125
As I want because it feels pretty close

95
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,485
but

96
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:39,995
If I try to speak French

97
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,275
or Somali

98
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:45,265
so i have to let go of it altogether

99
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,865
If I study

100
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:52,115
Somali for ten years to

101
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,480
So maybe I can talk

102
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
fairly good

103
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:59,115
But now ... there is no chance

104
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,995
To expect

105
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:04,615
to hope I will talk even close

106
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:05,925
perfect

107
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:09,115
So it's good to ask yourself a little ... Why

108
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:12,375
am i sorry why am i getting frustrated

109
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:14,265
When I don't

110
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:17,095
Speaks as well as I want

111
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:20,465
and if it is that I want to impress

112
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:23,635
Then I don't think it's such a good cause

113
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:26,845
Then you should probably think a little about it

114
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,795
maybe think more about

115
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:32,185
How can I communicate the most important

116
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:34,935
I want to communicate

117
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:37,885
It is much more important to get

118
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:40,955
Being able to express it as you want to say

119
00:05:40,955 --> 00:05:44,055
and think about what

120
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,265
is most important

121
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:48,535
In order for you to be able to express yourself

122
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:51,485
a little better, a little more efficient

123
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:54,955
A little more advanced

124
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,335
and here I come to the last

125
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:01,615
the point in this thought

126
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:04,675
and that is that I think one must try

127
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:07,925
feel for yourself where man is

128
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,345
in their language development

129
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:13,815
so that one is trying to understand

130
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,695
that this is reasonable

131
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:19,635
this can actually

132
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:22,885
teach me, this can I try

133
00:06:23,395 --> 00:06:26,515
use yourself or understand

134
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:29,335
But this is too hard

135
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:32,245
This is too specific, it is for special words

136
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:35,175
or this is too small grammar

137
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:38,185
Right now I can't

138
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:40,835
use or understand that

139
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,725
I have to try to cope with something easier

140
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,135
And then when you talk, for example

141
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,180
with someone or reading a text

142
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,720
or you may be looking at my instagram as some do

143
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:57,965
and sometimes thinks "oh, what difficult words

144
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,195
it was today ”

145
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:02,925
Then I think you have to ignore

146
00:07:02,925 --> 00:07:05,925
So do so;
 okay

147
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,875
I will take that late, I don't care about it now

148
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:12,125
I focus on something that

149
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,445
Fits my level right now

150
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,080
and there is something one must balance

151
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
and think about all the time

152
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:23,655
what is just hard

153
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,525
For me right now.
 If you get yourself

154
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,635
a sense of that

155
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:31,455
So I think you will put the energy

156
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:34,505
better, ie laying the energy

157
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:37,925
more effective on it as

158
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:41,235
that fits a right now

159
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,905
and one won't waste

160
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:47,540
as much energy on it that is too difficult

161
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,440
so that somehow

162
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:52,435
Prioritize and

163
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:53,435
opt out

164
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:56,625
Choosing what is most important right now

165
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,685
And it can be different for different

166
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:02,145
people, it's both different

167
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:04,845
Depending on what you want to do

168
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,675
What you want to talk about

169
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:10,085
in Swedish and it depends on which

170
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:12,705
level you are and a little what you have

171
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,725
difficult for and what you have easy for

172
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,485
But it is not possible to stress, it is not possible

173
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,435
to push too much

174
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:24,825
and therefore one must try to follow some kind

175
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:26,400
Natural development

176
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,020
where one first learns the light and then

177
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,540
Step by step learns more and more

178
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,900
Then I think you will have more fun and

179
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,000
and enjoy more of learning the language

180
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,340
If you just look at what you can't

181
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,820
and trying to grasp

182
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,105
that which is too difficult

183
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:51,485
Then it will be very painful

184
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:53,185
very hard

185
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,495
and it is easy to criticize

186
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,495
itself

187
00:08:57,685 --> 00:09:00,335
and it's not good when trying

188
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:03,305
learn something, to criticize oneself

189
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,305
it should try to avoid it

190
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:08,845
Try not to

191
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:11,285
So not do

192
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:15,365
So I think about this

193
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:21,385
And please say what you think

194
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,015
Feel free to comment and I tried

195
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:27,385
Using some different interesting words now

196
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:29,035
So if there was any word

197
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,555
As you think was interesting

198
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,800
and that fits your level

199
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,060
So please ask me

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,340
If you don't understand then I try to explain

201
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,975
Just that, then I had received

202
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:44,495
two somewhat interesting questions

203
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:47,885
one was about the slang word

204
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:50,855
“tagged”, to be tagged

205
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:55,075
So often you can say that about

206
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:58,155
A party for example "I'm tagged"

207
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:00,985
Before the party

208
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:03,575
I am tagged on going to a party

209
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:07,175
or to go to the party that means that

210
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:09,615
I'm enthusastic

211
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:12,315
I am looking forward to, I'm happy

212
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:15,375
I feel a lot of energy, I am tagged in learning Swedish

213
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,065
I would like to learn

214
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:21,075
Swedish, I am enthusiastic

215
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:24,475
so it's a pretty common expression

216
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:27,085
you can test to use it

217
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:30,335
It's not like a

218
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:33,285
dangerous slang word to try I think

219
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:34,285
Many people use it

220
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:38,385
Then I had a different question about

221
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:41,155
why we delete them

222
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:43,695
in many

223
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:46,125
preteritumverb, ie when

224
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,765
We use a verb in preteritum

225
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:50,965
and it ends on d e

226
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:53,765
so we remove D and e when we talk

227
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:54,765
Quickly

228
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,080
and it applies to verb groups 1

229
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,020
When we have such -ade

230
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,865
Look-a-they

231
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,575
asked, so if you listen

232
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:10,605
On Swedes they often remove

233
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:13,675
-They at the end and say for example

234
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:16,755
I played)

235
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:19,665
football yesterday so that you hear

236
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:21,820
is just play t

237
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,675
But if you were to write it, it will be played

238
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:28,605
And why do we do that, then

239
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,585
because when we talk so

240
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:32,645
null

241
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:35,875
do you understand much more of the context

242
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,355
one must not be as clear

243
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,955
And then you can be a little lazier

244
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:44,005
And a little more comfortable

245
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,485
And for example, remove such

246
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:47,755
endings

247
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,575
To get a more flow in the speech

248
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:54,695
The important thing is not grammar

249
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:57,295
The important thing is that the other understands

250
00:11:57,295 --> 00:11:59,195
And if, for example, I say

251
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:02,185
I play (they) football yesterday

252
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:05,675
so the other person cannot misunderstand what I mean

253
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:08,255
while maybe when writing

254
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:11,035
so it is more important that it is 100 %

255
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:13,615
clearly what one is talking about

256
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:16,985
and also most people want

257
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,535
Write correctly

258
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:22,355
one does not want to neglect too much when writing

259
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:25,455
so there is almost a little vanity there

260
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,095
Although the other would understand

261
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:31,935
so we want to write with the right

262
00:12:31,935 --> 00:12:34,985
grammar, most of us

263
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,805
But it is also because there is a greater chance of it being

264
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:40,985
misunderstanding while writing

265
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:44,155
When you talk, the other can also

266
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:46,985
ask if he or she

267
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:49,825
becomes unsure of what you mean

268
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:52,855
But when you write it must be

269
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,655
Super clear, very clear

270
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:57,375
Crystal clear

271
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,945
already from the beginning

272
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:03,655
have

273
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,645
That was probably what I had to say in this video

274
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:10,515
I hope it didn't get too messy

275
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:12,925
There the first part

276
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,965
I think it's important to think a little bit

277
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:18,615
Perfectionism so

278
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,085
Feel free to comment and tell us about your personal experiences

279
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:24,105
of it and how you do to

280
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:27,015
Find a way when you learn Swedish

281
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,865
to navigate

282
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,925
so that you don't get lost

283
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:35,645
Without following a kind of path

284
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,335
a path like

285
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:39,595
suits you

286
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:43,485
To learn the language, it would be

287
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:46,305
very exciting to hear what you

288
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:47,705
thinks and likes it

289
00:13:48,185 --> 00:13:51,055
so go down and comment
