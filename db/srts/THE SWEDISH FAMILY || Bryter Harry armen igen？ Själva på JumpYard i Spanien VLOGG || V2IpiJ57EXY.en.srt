1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:02,002
This is our hotel room.

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,403
Pink.

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:06,116
- Is that your favorite color?
- Yeah. Pink.

4
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:08,941
I'm so pumped.

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,009
Alma, come!

6
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:13,078
I've never felt like such a bad parent.

7
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:17,196
No!

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,023
Hey, hey!

9
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:29,958
We are standing outside...

10
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,426
JumpYard!

11
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,794
In Madrid!

12
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:37,297
And that's in Spain.

13
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:41,700
Yes! Shall we go in?
It's early in the morning and we're the first ones here.

14
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:44,069
And it's very cold outside, so let's hurry inside.

15
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:50,874
Good morning!

16
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,542
- Hello!
- Hello!

17
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,011
- How's it going?
- Great! How are you guys?

18
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:59,014
We're good.
Of course Mister JumpYard is here.

19
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:03,084
You'd think there's a Mister JumpYard
at each JumpYard.

20
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,687
Exactly. I've cloned myself and work everywhere.

21
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:09,956
- Could you give these to Harry?
- Yes.

22
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:11,691
Yes, come on!

23
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:19,697
Are these for me? How nice of you.

24
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:22,766
Jumping socks are a must.

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,568
Thank you, thank you!

26
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:29,870
And these for daddy. Do you think they'll fit?

27
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,606
What?

28
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:35,877
So shall I have ten, then?
One for each toe.

29
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:37,678
Tiny, right?

30
00:01:37,758 --> 00:01:40,147
Oh, God. This is Laura-size, isn't it?

31
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:44,350
- It sure looks so.
- XXS. Extra extra small.

32
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:50,021
Now you're coming with some that might be better.
These look good. Thank you, Laura!

33
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:57,360
- Wow, she really likes working here, huh?
- Yes. She might be their youngest addition.

34
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:01,030
Oh, thanks, Laura. How nice of you!

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,186
- Too short.
- Is it too short?

36
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:10,030
- Mommy... put it on.
- Yes, I'll put it on.

37
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,740
- It be there?
- Yes. What color did you get?

38
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:14,941
Pink.

39
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:18,490
- Is that your favorite color?
- Yeah. Pink.

40
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:25,210
- She's obsessed with pink.
- Yes. Pink is my favorite color too.

41
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:32,256
- It was Harry's favorite color before.
- Yes, but Harry's favorite color is actually yellow now.

42
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:33,689
Look at that.

43
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:40,027
- You guys take so long to put them on.
- Oh, you were so fast. What a pro!

44
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,261
High five!

45
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:53,114
- Oh, what a climbing section!
- Oh, wow!

46
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:58,208
- Oh, do you see the disco ball?
- A proper climbing section!

47
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,944
Yes, that's a disco ball up there.

48
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:07,683
It's so cool that it's two floors.
It's so much bigger.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,908
I'm so pumped.
Alma, come!

50
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:19,010
- Can we just run off?
- Yes, go ahead!

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,628
Wait! Harry, wait!

52
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:29,700
So, up here are the trampolines,
and here you see the end of the climbing walls.

53
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:33,970
Very cool layout.
Is that how you say it? Layout.

54
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,006
- Yes, you could say that.
- Layout, of the park.

55
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,141
- Really cool.
- Yes.

56
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:45,479
There are very large windows
so I have a feeling there's a cool view too.

57
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:54,353
Oh, for sure. You don't really see it, but it is.
A view of Madrid.

58
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,223
Even though we're all alone in the park,
it's not just us who make noise.

59
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:01,259
It's a...

60
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:07,030
Well, some type of air conditioning
that just whistles and makes noise.

61
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:12,034
- They hear it, I promise.
- I hope you can stand the noise.

62
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,837
- How's it going, Harry?
- Good.

63
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,001
Woho!

64
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,986
This one gives me anxiety.
Does anyone remember?

65
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:31,516
What was that?
Someone did something you shouldn't do.

66
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:36,019
As I was saying...
Remember when Harry broke his arm?

67
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:39,489
- How could they forget that?
- Maybe they haven't followed us that long.

68
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:40,623
That's true.

69
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,093
He used to hang on monkey bars like these,
as they're called, and fell down.

70
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:51,165
He lost his grip and fell, and then he put his hand down
and then both bones were broken.

71
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:55,960
I have never felt like such a bad parent
as I did in that moment.

72
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,420
- No.
- Never again, we hope.

73
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:03,941
But now he has a fully functioning arm
and is up and climbing new stuff.

74
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:04,963
Mhm.

75
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:09,337
No, no...

76
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:14,197
No!

77
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:19,354
- Good thing the ground is soft.
- Yes.

78
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:38,602
- It's only the top one.
- Yes.

79
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,505
Isn't the point that it should be different?
Now! Look.

80
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,540
57.

81
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,409
- Oh, you won big!
- Yes.

82
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:48,744
Nice job, Alma!

83
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,072
JumpYard has an offer in the Swedish Family Club.

84
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:31,344
Yep. 20% discount on the one-hour jump,
the two-hour jump, and the family jump.

85
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:36,081
One and two hours.
Now we're talking about JumpYard in Sweden.

86
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:36,949
Yes.

87
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,085
And for those of you who don't know,
our club is completely free for members.

88
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:49,507
In there, you will find many good discounted offers,
and also sometimes giveaways and contests.

89
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,110
Mhm.

90
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:58,530
- And JumpYard also has a giveaway in the club.
- Yes. Twenty 500 SEK...

91
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:00,234
- Gift cards.
- Thank you.

92
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,271
Very generous.
20 club members have the chance to get it.

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,674
So, if you're not a member
you have to become one, you see.

94
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:09,808
Yes.

95
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:14,145
- There's a link in the video description.
- Check it out.

96
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,679
Yes, do that.

97
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:31,520
- What are you doing?
- We're pretending to sleep, as if we've been waiting a long time.

98
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,759
You have to be quiet.

99
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:36,720
It was a competition with the elevator.

100
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,320
Gosh!

101
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:48,405
You took such a long time.

102
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:52,020
- Oh, what a super YouTuber!
- We're home now.

103
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:57,360
She didn't even react to you lying there sleeping.
What a fail!

104
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,547
- Daniel?
- Yes?

105
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:01,282
- Want it.
- Do you want it?

106
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,343
- Mhm.
- Yes.

107
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,490
There. And the other foot, nice.
And let's pull it up.

108
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,292
Oh, wait.
If you hold your arms straight out...

109
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,027
Can you climb when you're this little?

110
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:20,431
We'll try and see.
If the harness fits as it should, there's no problem.

111
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,299
- It feels very small.
- Wait, Laura.

112
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:26,469
But shouldn't it feel small and tight?
Isn't that the whole point?

113
00:08:26,535 --> 00:08:33,007
- No.
- I do not want it to feel big and loose when I climb.

114
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,679
- Mommy.
- Oh.

115
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:46,184
Shall I help you? Shall we ride the elevator again?
Come, let's ride the elevator.

116
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,686
I'll hold you.

117
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:51,355
Now feel the elevator.

118
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,090
- Daniel, I'm starting to climb.
- Sure.

119
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:58,694
One more time, come on.
And the elevator, hold on.

120
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,317
- It was a little scary, huh?
- Aha.

121
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,790
- That's why we take it slowly.
- Aha.

122
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,633
- Do you want to ride the elevator again?
- That one.

123
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,469
That one? Go ahead and climb.

124
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:12,504
Grab here. Can you do that?
Walk up to it.

125
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:15,338
Yes, I'm holding you. Come.

126
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:20,078
- Nice!
- Oh, the first time in a harness like this. Sweetie.

127
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,146
Now you can grab this one.

128
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,415
Use that hand. Exactly.

129
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,900
Oops!
It's a little difficult. Let's do it like this.

130
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:32,688
And grab there.
And now, Laura, you can put your foot there.

131
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:35,357
Now pull yourself up. Nice!

132
00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:37,525
And now it got difficult.

133
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,894
Alma, you're so fast!

134
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:43,230
- (Daniel) How old are you now, Laura?
- (Laura) Uaua.

135
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:45,846
(Daniel) How old are you, Uaua?

136
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:55,673
- Was it fun?
- Yes.

137
00:09:56,085 --> 00:10:00,677
This is so smart,
this system where you secure yourself.

138
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:15,021
- I just want to feel that it's okay to climb on.
- Daniel said that you can get some scratches on this wall.

139
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:18,291
Yes, it's a little scary.

140
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:24,562
It's made to mimic a mountain.
Well, it is some kind of rock, but yeah…

141
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,770
It's like a volcano. Look.

142
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:36,205
Ah, now I see. I get it. But yeah...
One that hurts a little, maybe.

143
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:39,741
Yes. I won't climb it now, I think.

144
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,335
Nice!

145
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,415
- What did you say? Do you want to take it off?
- Yes.

146
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:53,485
Sure.
You did great! You got super high!

147
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:57,155
- Yes.
- Yes! Yes, almost all the way up.

148
00:10:57,488 --> 00:11:00,357
It's a joy to film with Daniel.

149
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,362
Partly because he knows how to record and what to think about.
That you shouldn't talk over each other, for example.

150
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,433
But he's also so very good with the kids,
so it's like having the world's best babysitter with you.

151
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:18,750
- Yes. All kids love Daniel. Mister Jump Yard!
- Mister JumpYard, yes. Exactly.

152
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:01,406
What passion!

153
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,341
This is life-and-de*th.

154
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:17,018
Are you tired, Laura?

155
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:23,156
Tired and hungry.
That's what happens when moving around so much.

156
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,824
Yep!

157
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:30,890
- What are you guys doing?
- We're trying to... do this. Can't you show how to do it?

158
00:12:36,534 --> 00:12:39,836
- Let's see it again.
- Now we're tired.

159
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,738
Wooo!

160
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:48,220
- And you're not very good at it yet. Or?
- No. Yes, actually.

161
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,816
Soon.

162
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:54,348
So-so, I think.
You can practice a little more, Alma.

163
00:12:55,682 --> 00:13:00,019
- What's your plan, Harry?
- I don't have a plan.

164
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:04,889
Do you remember last time?
Then she had a hard time hitting when it was tight, didn't she?

165
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:08,025
- Mhm.
- So build it as tightly as possible.

166
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:11,028
What are you doing, Alma?

167
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:18,200
We are building a... fort.
Then, we'll try to...

168
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:22,603
You take ten of these and build a fort.

169
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,872
Or, like, a wall.

170
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:33,078
And then you have to try to get the other person's wall down
by just throwing these.

171
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,214
You have to be behind these.

172
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,021
Five. Three.

173
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,024
Laura wants to play Valo Jump.

174
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:54,629
- Turn on the TV.
- You have to jump on the trampoline to get it going, Laura.

175
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:03,661
YAY! I can do it!

176
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,874
- Are you ready?
- YES!

177
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:12,009
Ready, set, go!

178
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:15,145
No!

179
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,414
- Yes!
- Yes!

180
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,614
Nooo!

181
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:22,351
- We won! Nice work!
- Well done.

182
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,622
Now he comes. Harry doesn't like to lose!
Oh, wow! Watch out, watch out!

183
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:33,248
Come on, Harry! Fight, fight! All the way.

184
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:36,362
All the way!

185
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,724
You're not there yet, we still have one left!

186
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,335
Whoo!

187
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:51,074
Good, Harry.
Fight! Fight, Harry!

188
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,742
Yayyy!

189
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,352
You keep bouncing…
even though we're at the hotel.

190
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:54,357
- Uaua jump more.
- Yes, you want to jump more. It was so much fun at JumpYard.

191
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:58,360
- Did you have fun too, Alma?
- Yes, it was super fun.

192
00:15:58,427 --> 00:16:03,164
- Sit down, JumpYard, sleep.
- Are you going to sleep a little now?

193
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:10,136
- JumpYard, sleep.
- Yes, you need that when you've been up so early and filmed.

194
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,038
We are in our hotel room.

195
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:17,542
- No, the airplane!
- No, we're not on the airplane.

196
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:22,613
Ride the airplane again. I want to go to Japan.

197
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,549
You want to go by plane to Japan.
But I think we should drive home later.

198
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,684
But maybe we should show what it looks like here.

199
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:31,086
- No, don't go home later.
- Yes.

200
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:34,689
- No.
- You want to stay here and be at JumpYard with Daniel?

201
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:35,556
Yes.

202
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,025
This is where we're staying.

203
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:43,296
Mommy, daddy, and Laura
sleep in this room.

204
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:43,896
Mhm.

205
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:48,834
And we have two hotel rooms,
so it's like a double room with this door.

206
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,740
Right. A connecting door that can be unlocked.

207
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:56,940
- Yes, exactly. And Harry and I sleep here.
- Yes.

208
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,100
- That's pretty much it.
- Yes.

209
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:02,678
It's quite small and very messy,
but that doesn't really matter.

210
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:07,548
- No, we're only here in Madrid on a quick visit.
- Yes.

211
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:10,417
- To visit the new park.
- Yes.

212
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:15,221
It's great fun that JumpYard is expanding abroad.

213
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:16,889
Spider-Man!

214
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:18,290
- Come.
- Spider-Man.

215
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:20,158
Spider-Man is expanding abroad.

216
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:24,228
No, but JumpYard is a Swedish company.
I don't think everyone knows that.

217
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:25,629
No.

218
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:30,433
- And then we go around and then we meet Daniel in every park we visit.
- Yes.

219
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,535
We call him Mister JumpYard.

220
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:36,738
He's always there when a new park opens.

221
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:43,544
They're opening new ones in Sweden, and also abroad.
We have been to Lisbon. More...?

222
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,811
And now Madrid.

223
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,012
Yes.

224
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:47,880
Västerås, right?

225
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,883
- Västerås. Very fun.
- And Nacka, many times.

226
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:52,884
Yes, we have been to the one in Nacka many times,
in Stockholm.

227
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,555
- Västerås.
- Västerås. Yes. We might have to go back there.

228
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:03,026
- Västerås! Go to Västerås!
- She wants to go to Västerås.

229
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,028
- But listen.
- Yes.

230
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:08,250
- Question of the Day.
- Mhm.

231
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:14,390
One popped up very naturally when we entered the JumpYard
this morning. Our favorite color.

232
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,804
- RIght.
- Pink. Pink.

233
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:19,700
Yes. Pink and pink.

234
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:23,409
- Green.
- Green?! She said yours was yellow.

235
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:24,676
- Yes.
- Oh, right.

236
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:26,900
YELLOW!

237
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:32,417
- Do you have two?
- Yes. Yellow, grey, and green.

238
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:35,552
Three. Yellow, grey, and green.
Mine is...

239
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:38,954
- Yellow-grey-green.
- You're really a talker, aren't you?

240
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:40,689
Pink.

241
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,026
- Mine is red.
- Like JumpYard's colors.

242
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,427
What about you?

243
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,652
I feel that I answer this question differently every time.

244
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,497
Yes.

245
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:56,335
But maybe orange, or orange-pink.

246
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,671
What's your favorite color?

247
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:04,675
Comment below!

248
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,280
Thank you for watching this video!

249
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:15,750
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

250
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,685
Mostly thumbs up!

251
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:21,354
Comment, ask questions,
and take care until next time.

252
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:24,490
- See you!
- Bye-bye!
