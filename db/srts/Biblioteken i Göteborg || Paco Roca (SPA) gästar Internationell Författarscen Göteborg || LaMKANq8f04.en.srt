00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:10,400
Welcome to international author scene Gothenburg. My name is Ellinor Broman and I am a publisher

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,760
at Palabra publisher. I'm going to talk to Paco Roca, a Spanish series creator

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,040
who has written the series novel Arrugas, which in Swedish was named \ H \ h

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,044
Emilio and forgetfulness.

5
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:29.867
Welcome Paco to this call at the International Author Scene in Gothenburg!

6
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,196
Thanks! It is a pure pleasure.

7
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:36,512
Too bad I can't be in place, but I'm glad we can make the call like this.

8
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:45,160
Series novel Emilio and forgetfulness is about a retired bank director

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,287
who suffers from Alzheimer's and must move to a retirement home.

10
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:55,240
We get to know several of the others who live in the elderly,

11
00:00:55,554 --> 00:01:01,240
and I am fascinated by your ability to shape their personalities,

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07.131
But also on how you depict different types of dementia, their way of behaving.

13
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:12,820
Can you tell us a little about how you prepared to write the story? \ H \ h

14
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:20,290
Sure. The starting point for the story was that I wanted to tell you about old age because

15
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:26,800
My parents had become old, and I also realized that there were very few stories

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,130
that had older people in the lead role, not only in cartoon series but also

17
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:39.430
in movies and books. There are stories with older people in,

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:49,080
But then they have supporting roles. It is rare that the stories make us see what older people see.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:56.040
I decided to draw this story to try to understand my parents better, \ h \ h

20
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,970
understand how they experienced their lives. My parents lived at home, but I thought it was more interesting to have

21
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:10,470
A slightly wider focus. It wouldn't be just about two people's old age, just as you say

22
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,670
did I want to show different types of dementia and different ways of dealing with old age, and then I thought that

23
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,840
It would be best to place the action to a retirement home.

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,370
There are people of all kinds, right. I had never been to such a thing so I had to have \ h \ h

25
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39.540
do investigations, and what I did was that for six months I visited \ h \ h

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,860
various elderly homes, private and municipal. I knew people who worked as nurses and doctors, or

27
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,690
Simply had relatives who lived in these retirement homes. To me it was extremely important

28
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,350
To see how life was there. As good as everyone I tell you about in the book \ H \ h

29
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:09.480
I got to know these elderly homes. My impression was

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:18,810
that they, like lost there, had come there for various reasons. \ h \ h

31
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:26,490
There were those who were in good health but whose families could not take care of them anymore, \ h

32
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,800
or that could not afford to pay their apartment or simply become lonely

33
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37.560
and decided to move to a retirement home. There were also those who had

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,920
some kind of dementia and had to live there because their families could not take care of them. \ h \ h

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:52,770
So we meet people who are very different from each other, and who over time ties friendships.

36
00:03:52,770 --> 00:04:00.690
I think that Emilio and forgetfulness rather than to deal with an illness

37
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,990
or if dementia is about loneliness, the loneliness of the elderly

38
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:18,000
and how they again try to create relationships with other people. \ h \ h

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,670
Just. I think you succeed very well in portraying how some of them live in the past.

40
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,740
I have brought with me two pictures. This is Felix who think he is a soldier \ h \ h

41
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,680
On a Spanish location in North Africa, and do the one of Miguel and Emilio.

42
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:51,030
I thought the story was a little more varied with these stories.

43
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:58,080
One of the problems with the story was how to make it interesting. It is shopping

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,390
About boredom, right, about the monotonous life of a retirement home.

45
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:10,320
It was hard to know how to portray a situation where every day is the same,

46
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,260
And they are people talking. Then it struck me that I could create variety,

47
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,920
Both in terms of image and in history, with these fantasies.

48
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,140
It is also so, as we talked about earlier, that it is about \ h \ h

49
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:35,730
show reality as these people experience it, with their various dementia diagnoses. \ h \ h

50
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:41,910
They get a little spinning and think they are somewhere else. \ H \ h

51
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:47,850
I thought it was interesting for these two reasons. \ H \ h

52
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:58,950
Yes, we have another example here, Señora Rosalía who thinks she is sitting on the Orientexpress on her way to Istanbul.

53
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:10,620
It is a pretty comforting picture of dementia I think you are in a remote landscape, \ h \ h

54
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:19,950
Where you were young. This page gave me comfort anyway.

55
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:27,420
Yes, it's a sad story, and I wanted to be a realist, \ h \ h

56
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:36,300
It is as it is, whether we want it or not, we are getting worse to body and soul

57
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:43,470
When we grow old. But I still wanted to find something hopeful, a bright spot in the whole. \ H \ h

58
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:51,360
This to play with parallel worlds I thought gave it, and

59
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59.990
Also a little humor and optimism. And this person, \ h \ h

60
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:09.090
Antonia, if she is now named Antonia in your version, she takes refuge there

61
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,400
in front of a reality that she does not like, she has been left alone when all the others

62
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,220
have left the table they used to gather around. First that couple who may move one floor up, \ h \ h

63
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:27.510
Then Emilio and Miguel, and finally she just sits at the table. One can say

64
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:35,670
that she decides to pull away from reality, live in her own fantasies

65
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:43,890
When what is around her no longer interests her and then she joins the other woman's daydreams, \ h \ h

66
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:50,130
She who thinks she is traveling with the Orientexpressen.

67
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:59,280
Yes, the general theme is, as I said, loneliness, old age and dementia, but another important motif is the friendship between Miguel and Emilio.

68
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:10,850
Miguel takes care of Emilio until the end. How did you get the idea for Miguel? \ H \ h

69
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:19,010
I came up with the idea for Miguel ... I think this is the only time it has happened to me that a character

70
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:27,950
which would really fulfill a very simple role, in this case give the reader the information

71
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:33,560
as needed to understand how a retirement home works. \ h

72
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:41,150
I thought it was a good idea that through Emilio and Miguel you would know \ h

73
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,790
A little about the elderly. So from the beginning he would only have that task,

74
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52.940
inform about things the reader should know. But as I said I think it's the only time

75
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,910
As a character has been given much more space than I had imagined, a character that would \ h \ h

76
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:06,770
have a supporting role almost gets the lead role in history. \ h

77
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:13,490
He grows and changes and eventually gains a completely different meaning than

78
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:21,590
The one I had thought he would have in history. In a way, I think that is what is happening

79
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:31,130
Anyone who takes care of another person. Many times you forget that person when talking about

80
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:37,010
elderly homes or a disease like Alzheimer's. A caretaker, or \ h \ h

81
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:44,870
only is a relative or friend, the one who takes care of the sick person,

82
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:53,480
It grows as a person. It is something many have told about,

83
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,610
caregivers and others whose relatives have been affected by \ h \ h

84
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:06,350
Diseases with such a long and sad course such as Alzheimer's.

85
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,830
They have said that it also brought something positive with them, that they have discovered things about themselves.

86
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,660
So I thought that all that agreed to Miguel, like \ h \ h

87
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:25,850
Without noticing it grew by taking care of Miguel.

88
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:33,220
He took a road \ Hos I had not planned.

89
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:40,990
Arrugas, as the book is called in Spanish, has also become a cartoon, and I would say that this friendship

90
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:51,250
Is even more prominent in the film. That Miguel has been given a bigger role there.

91
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:58,630
Yes, I was on a corner in making the series a movie, in the script work and a little in \ h \ h

92
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:05,230
The design of the characters, but the one who really worked with the film was the director,

93
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:13,030
Ignacio is ferrase, and I think he made a very good interpretation. Some of the

94
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:19,360
The themes that the comic novel just rub at he deepened. Just as you said is for example \ h \ h

95
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,400
The friendship between Emilio and Miguel even stronger in the film.

96
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,700
One thing I like I became curious about the movie is that Miguel \ H \ h

97
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:43,750
talking to Argentine accent, how are it? \ h \ h

98
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:51,520
It was Ignacio, the director's idea. His family comes from Argentina and he wanted to make a wink to them. \ H \ h

99
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:00,970
In addition, it is true that in Spain there is a notion of Argentinians who

100
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:08,380
Life -happy and happy, they can convince one of anything with their talk,

101
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:14,110
And it really fit into Miguel as a character. \ h \ h

102
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:20,500
He is a tremble, and it is suitable for him to have Argentine accent.

103
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:31,800
Just. I have read in several places that Emilio and forgetfulness are the work that paved the way for \ h \ h

104
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:42,870
The series novel in Spain. Is that right? \ H \ h

105
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:52,230
I think it is because a number of factors coincided. It came out in the right moment, \ h \ h

106
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:59,400
had it come out five years earlier or five years later it had \ h \ h

107
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,580
been completely different. When it came out, for example, it was so that \ h \ h

108
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:12,690
The National Series Prize was awarded for the second time, and that it received the serial award \ h \ h

109
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:22,470
Made it a lot of spread. It was also a series that reached many

110
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:29,130
Readers who had never read series before. It was about such as

111
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,320
Many could recognize themselves in.

112
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,910
A story that so to speak is more typical of series,

113
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,180
which deals with mysteries or superheroes or something like that,

114
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:56,190
may not reach out to an above audience but this subject \ h \ h

115
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:03,690
was familiar to everyone, and the series reached out to those who never read series before. \ H \ h

116
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:11,250
It was noticed in the press and in many other places. Another important factor

117
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:18,720
I think was that many general bookstores started taking in comic books.

118
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:34,480
Previously, in Spain, it could only have been able to buy comics \ hi special bookstores, and to them came almost only \ h \ h

119
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,860
Those who were already serial fanatics. It was thus difficult to reach outside that circle, \ h \ h

120
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,380
Because series were not sold anywhere else. But then came luckily was

121
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,890
chains like FNAC to Spain with a French culture and

122
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:59,470
SPECIAL DEs for series. Then also other major and less

123
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:07,120
Book stores to sell comic books. That the book then

124
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,930
received the national series award, and that it is easy to recommend because

125
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:19,630
It's a story with a beginning and an end, a so -called series novel \ h \ h

126
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:25,210
that is easily accessible to all kinds of readers, I think was the reason for that

127
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:31,180
Emilio and forgetfulness reached out to a serial audience. \ H \ h

128
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:40,180
You have written several series novels since then, and I have brought some of them with me.

129
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,750
I also want to tell you that several of your books are here at the library in Spanish and English,

130
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:56,140
And of course Emilio and forgetfulness in Swedish. El Faro, La Casa,

131
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:09.860
Los Surcos del Azar. I also know that a new book will come out of you in December, \ Hregreso Al Edén (return to paradise).

132
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:21,060
Just. I finished it this summer and it went to print in September, \ H \ h

133
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:28,440
And on December 3, it will come out. It is a very personal story that revolves around

134
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,790
A photograph, the only photograph my mom has of her mother,

135
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:43,140
Who died when she was very small. She was born in a poor home

136
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,650
after the end of the Spanish Civil War. That photograph

137
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:57,960
have always been lying where mothers have the habit of saving

138
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,410
The photographs they keep loved ones, under the glass on the nightstand. They want them beside them when they sleep.

139
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:11,880
It is the photograph of my mom that I have seen most times.

140
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:19,050
I wanted to make a story about that picture and fulfill a dream that I think we all had at some point, \ h \ h

141
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:25,770
about being able to crawl into a photograph and find out what happened outside the frame, \ h \ h

142
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:35,070
on both sides of the frame and before and after the photographer snapped the photograph. \ h \ h

143
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,220
Yes, and the critic Álvaro Pons wrote on Twitter the other day that Regreso Al Edén \ H \ h

144
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:49,440
Together with La Casa and Emilio and oblivion, a masterful trilogy is about the memory. Do you agree with that?

145
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,900
Is it the memory that is the theme for all your books? \ H \ h

146
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:06,480
Yes, it is a recurring theme, but maybe not the memory as much as the history of recent decades.

147
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,610
And the look back I would not say has to do with nostalgia, that it would \ h \ h

148
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:20,070
Have been better before, no, not at all. Rather it is about the search for an identity, \ h \ h

149
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:30,800
to try to find out where I come from, from a social rather than personal perspective. \ h \ h

150
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:37,980
As Álvaro says, it is about memories and regreso al Edén to a greater extent than La Casa is an exploration of \ H \ h

151
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:47,640
me and the identity of my family, where I come from and why I am as I am. \ H \ h

152
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:55,020
I got to learn more about my mom and the environment she grew up in, and about my dad and that summer house \ h \ h

153
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:02,640
The family had. I got to know myself better. In the case of Emilio and oblivion, it is a bit about the same thing.

154
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,540
I believe that a disease like Alzheimer's belongs to the worst, \ h \ h

155
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:16,170
For it, not only erases the past but also your identity, right.

156
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:22,740
When it comes to the chalk we are what we have lived. A disease like this blur out \ h \ h

157
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:29,610
What we really are, so you could say that the book is about the loss

158
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:40,200
of identity, purely physically, not metaphorically as may be the case in other stories.

159
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,170
So it is true that the three stories are about memories, \ h \ h

160
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:52,740
and the search for an identity using the past. \ h \ h

161
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,370
Yes, and this book, Los Surcos del Azar (random track), which will be released in Swedish next year,

162
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:05,580
Could you say is a restoration of historical memory, right?

163
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:12,780
The protagonist is a former soldier in La Nueve, a company in free French forces.

164
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:24,950
Why was it important for you to tell this story of Miguel, a ninety -year -old former soldier? \ H \ h

165
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:33,320
Well, that was a bit for the same reason we mentioned earlier. Spain, like all countries, has its features. \ H \ h

166
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:41,030
In Spain we had a civil war and then 40 years of dictatorship.

167
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:49,700
Then it became a transition to a democratic system,

168
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:58,070
And it was not easy to go from being a dictatorship to becoming a democracy.

169
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:08,510
They made a kind of agreement to forget, we would forget everything that had happened and not search for justice or guilty

170
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:15,560
Or so, we would all shake hands and forget all that. Maybe it was necessary to

171
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:22,490
It would not be a new war or a coup d'état or other problems, the transition to democracy became peaceful. \ h \ h

172
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:29,000
But, as mentioned earlier, we lost part of our history

173
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,630
And our identity, because one did not talk about the civil war, you did not talk about the dictatorship. \ h \ h

174
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:41,630
It was thought it was better not to talk about it not to tear up the wounds.

175
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:48,410
This meant that many stories ended up in the cloud. Such as this story of

176
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:54,590
The soldiers who fought with the ninth company. In any other country I think one would have

177
00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:02,540
named them as heroes. They never ceased to fight against fascism, they believed in democracy. \ H \ h

178
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07.820
They continued war as long as they could, and were in on \ h \ h

179
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:14,330
to liberate Paris. They were the first to enter the occupied Paris.

180
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:22,790
It is a fantastic story simply, but in Spain it was practically unknown. \ H \ h

181
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:29,310
That is why I thought it was interesting to save it from forgetfulness, this part of the story. \ h \ h

182
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:37,590
As I said, they are real heroes, they never stopped fighting, even though they could have it,

183
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:45,450
They decided to continue to fight to defeat fascism both in Spain and in the rest of Europe. \ H \ h

184
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:52,450
I also wanted to tell you about it because I like a type of end that doesn't necessarily have to be dramatic.

185
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:58,840
The same goes for Emilio and forgetfulness. There are people who, although they know \ hat

186
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:08,110
They will lose continues to fight and do so with dignity. Emilio knows he never \ h \ h

187
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:15,850
Can win against his Alzheimer but is still fighting against it. And these \ h \ h

188
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:22,960
Spanish Republicans in the ninth company also fought, they were fighting because they thought a victory over \ h \ h

189
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:32,250
Hitler and Mussolini would make it easier to then liberate Spain from Franco's fascism. \ H \ h

190
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:37,650
First one must win in Europe, in order to then be able to return \ h \ h with the help of the Allies

191
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:45,480
To Spain and restore democracy in the country, but it did not succeed in the end.

192
00:23:45,480 --> 00:24:00,300
This kind of slightly sentimental end I like, they make the stories more important than those who have happy ending. \ H \ h

193
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,640
They make you reflect on the subject, right, to think about what would have \ h \ h

194
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:14,130
could happen and didn't.

195
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:19,410
Yes that's how it is. And I can say that the characters in Emilio and oblivion are still alive for me, I sometimes think of \ h \ h

196
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:30,840
them as if they were real people.

197
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,830
Yes, and I think it's the finest praise you can get about a story that when the book has been struck again \ h \ h

198
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:44,310
It lives on the reader's thoughts. So, as I said, it is the best possible praise.

199
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:53,340
These are really amazing stories, and we are so grateful that you have been able to participate

200
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:00.030
In this conversation in these difficult times, and we hope you can come to Sweden \ h \ h

201
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:09.330
Next year, or 2022, to be here in front of the public at the City Library.

202
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,680
I think we should ...

203
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:27,520
It's time to round off and end this call, so

204
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:34,060
Big thanks to you, Paco Roca, and I hope to see you soon. \ H \ h

205
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:41,080
Many thanks to you, and all Swedish readers, and I hope I can get there soon.
