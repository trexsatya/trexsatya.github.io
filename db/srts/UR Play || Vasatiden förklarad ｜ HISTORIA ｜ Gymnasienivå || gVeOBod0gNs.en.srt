1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,560
Sweden's history between the 16th and 19th centuries is divided into four eras.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,080
-This is the first of them.
 -Vasa time is a revolving time.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,040
It must have felt very dramatic.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,960
The Vasa era is counted from Gustav Vasa becoming king to Karl IX dying.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,320
A lot happened in Sweden then.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,080
A new king changes religion in the country and sends out bailiffs everywhere.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,600
It is a time filled with conflicts with peasant uprising and power matches about the throne-

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,160
-Which is quite close to fantasy.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,120
What happened in Sweden during the Vasa era?

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,240
And how fun was it for ordinary people?

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,480
The 16th century Sweden does not look like today.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,880
Areas are missing in the south and west, but large parts of Finland are included.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,800
In this kingdom, almost the entire population lives in the countryside - 95 %.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,320
Almost everyone lives near a church.

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,520
Next to the church were a group of farms with barns, houses and cattle.

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,720
The villages were small.
 It may have been hundreds or fifty people.

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:35,080
The church, which people live next door, is also not as we are used to today.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,880
Sweden was Catholic.
 The church and the bishops had very great power.

19
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,360
The fairs, ie the services, were celebrated in Latin.

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,800
The people were there, but most people did not understand what was being said.

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,200
Much is different.
 For example, king is something that is chosen.

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,360
When our history begins, the king is not Swedish.

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,720
Sweden is more Danish than Swedish.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,200
Sweden was part of a union with Denmark and Norway that was ruled from Denmark.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,320
In 1520, Denmark invaded Sweden-

26
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,480
-As now with coercion, the Kalmar Union is kept.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,960
The Danish King Kristian II, sometimes called Kristian Tyrann in Sweden-

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,920
-King to king over Sweden.

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,000
It happened in Stockholm.
 He behaved really badly when he was there.

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,680
During Stockholm's carnage, many who could stand up against him were executed.

31
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,520
Who will save Sweden from the Danes?

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,920
A clue is found in the name of the era.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,080
A young nobleman does not trust Kristian Ii-

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,760
-And stay away from the capital.

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,040
Gustav Vasa's path to success was Stockholm's carnage-

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,240
-As wiped out large parts of the top tier within the Swedish nobility.

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,000
He now has a good position to take power if he can remove the Danes.

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,200
In Dalarna he hopes to gather farmers in an uprising, but it goes like that.

39
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,200
Why are they going?
 Why don't they listen?

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,840
How will Gustav Vasa get the farmers to support his plans?

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,120
Stockholm's carnage will come in handy in his ambitions to reach power.

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,760
When the stories reach out in the country-

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,000
-The farmers are subject to a popular rise to the Danes.

44
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,400
Dalkarlarna rethink their position and close up behind Gustav Vasa.

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,720
He becomes the master of the landscape.

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Now the liberation war against the Danish Union King can begin.
 Go Sweden!

47
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,720
It went pretty well for Gustav Vasa in the fight against Kristian II.

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:10,560
But the Danes held important fortresses and also had control over the sea.

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,040
The Danish fleet seems almost invincible.

50
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,840
Gustav Vasa and his rebellion need money for boats and weapons.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,960
They are allowed to borrow and war on credit.

52
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,440
Some who are happy to lend are the city of Lübeck and Hansan.

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,000
They look forward to Denmark getting on ding.

54
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,920
With the support from Lübeck, Gustav Vasa finally stands as a winner.

55
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,400
27 years old he is elected king, and in 1523 he trains into Stockholm.

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,400
Now the Danish is definitely defeated.

57
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,840
Sweden is now its own kingdom, and it is now the country is based on real.

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,280
It is usually said that Gustav Vasa is the founder of the kingdom-

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,120
-And what you mean by that is that he defeated Kristian II.

60
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,200
But he also united the parts of the country.

61
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,960
The kingdom was brought together and gained a much clearer identity.

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,800
But how should this young nobleman no one thought would end up on the throne-

63
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,440
-Kun keep the grip over the kingdom?

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,480
A kingdom that does not have so much money and large newly taken debts.

65
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:38,680
He focuses on something that has money, the church, and changes religion.

66
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,360
It was not strong religious motives that led Gustav Vasa toward Luther-

67
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,920
-When he needed money because he had large debts to Lübeck.

68
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,680
And, at all, he wanted money for the cash register.

69
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,200
Sweden breaks with the Pope in Rome and carries out the Reformation.

70
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,800
The Swedes are now Protestants, and the riches of the church now become the state.

71
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,040
Religious services are now held in Swedish.

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:21,320
The church becomes a communication channel, from the state straight out to the villages.

73
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,680
Gustav Vasa is pushing for changes throughout the state.

74
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,000
He wants to make Sweden a national prince's state.

75
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,720
It became more order and ready, but even more control and higher tax-

76
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,680
-And many felt more monitored.

77
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,680
Sweden is run as a large company.

78
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,840
He is the CEO who controls and sets, even in the smallest details.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,360
He settles in a lot that happens in the kingdom.

80
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,920
He develops the mining and copper and iron will be out of the ground.

81
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,960
Gustav Vasa is aware of the benefits of creating his own history.

82
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,760
It is called propaganda.

83
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,360
The chronicle about his heroic adventure in Dalarna is to be taken with a pinch of salt.

84
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,680
He creates a poster about Stockholm's carnage to remind people of it.

85
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,560
But propaganda does not matter when the people think they behave badly-

86
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,360
-And takes their stuff.

87
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,880
The farmers in the valleys are starting to grumble.
 They rise again against the king.

88
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,520
The problem for Gustav Vasa is that now he is king.

89
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,960
This is done in the watch uprising.

90
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,160
Gustav Vasa requires extra tax payments.

91
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,360
Every congregation or parish church should give away a church bell.

92
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,920
When the clock picks come to pick up the church bells, they hit them down.

93
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,240
This leads to severe punishments.
 They receive a punishment and the death penalty.

94
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,640
Gustav Vasa has ruthless sides.

95
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,120
He executes people to the right and left and cannot withstand resistance.

96
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,440
But he also likes luxury and flair.

97
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
This saddle has belonged to Gustav Vasa.

98
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,480
It is a gilded saddle with decor in the color of the steel.

99
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,480
You can discover seahorses with unicorn horns and mermaids.

100
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,040
It was included in the luxury items that Gustav Vasa purchased in Augsburg 1541.

101
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Gustav Vasa loves trends and fashion.
 It should be tight pants and gold.

102
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,120
In an inventory of his wardrobe, he had 52 such headgear.

103
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,080
The German princes are his role models.

104
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Gustav Vasa is a man of power.

105
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,640
He can be brutal, cruel and execute people, but he also has humor.

106
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,800
In all the letters he writes, the person Gustav Vasa forwards a little neighbor.

107
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,760
He was a pretty nice dad.

108
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,560
Gustav Vasa marries three times and becomes the father of eleven children.

109
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,760
He is a piglet and likes to eat sweets.

110
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,760
He has a toothache with which he is drawn, and he can be grumpy and grumpy.

111
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,040
He has bigger problems than toothache.

112
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,720
Outside the country, it is more and more grimbed against him and his rule.

113
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,960
The most serious of the uprising is the Dacke feud, which is a peasant uprising.

114
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,920
The farmers in Småland have had enough.

115
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,240
The Dacke feud is a pretty kind word for a full -scale civil war.

116
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,520
The feud starts poorly.
 Vasa's jacks are not used to fighting in the forest.

117
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,960
The farmers, under Nils Dacke, win many kinds.

118
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,320
But in the end, Gustav Vasa wins.

119
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,960
Nils Dacke falls into battle, and his head is put on a pile.

120
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,160
The drawing is actually designed by an adult.

121
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,640
But everyone did not rebel, but lived their usual lives.

122
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,080
What did a day in their lives look like?

123
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:42,280
They got up early.
 Maybe at four, five.
 Then the girls would out and milk.

124
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,480
Then they prepared breakfast.
 Porridge and mound.
 Bread was included in all meals.

125
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,400
Life was a constant toy with what was the basis for the livelihood.

126
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,440
A work of animals and agriculture.

127
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,440
Children help and there is no difference between work and leisure.

128
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,520
They worked to get hot in the house, food on the table, security and stuff.

129
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,040
Chores change depending on the season.

130
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,080
Sometimes it is the focus on the field, sometimes on fishing, and sometimes on cheese cheese.

131
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,120
Someone took responsibility for the fact that there was food on the table at twelve o'clock in the day.

132
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,720
That was when you usually for the big goal.

133
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,040
They eat with their hands and drink most beer-

134
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,440
-The water is usually dirty.

135
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,280
The beer has lower alcohol content than today.

136
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,760
You had no clock, but you were in control of the time in many different ways.

137
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,360
From the 13th century, medieval cities have often had bell ringing.

138
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,840
A care clock calls at nine, and then it should be quiet.

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,560
Then it got dark.

140
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:13,280
It is difficult for us to understand how carbon black it must have been.

141
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,520
So is the life of most people in sweden-

142
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,320
-What is becoming more and more its own, with reformation and central government.

143
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,680
In 1560 Gustav Vasa, old and fragile dies.

144
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,600
Then is the end of the vase time?

145
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,600
No, because Gustav Vasa has introduced that kings should no longer be chosen.

146
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,960
The crown should instead be inherited, so now his descendants can retain power.

147
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:49,920
He wanted his sons to rule the kingdom together in good care.

148
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,760
But there were very many different conflicts in the way.

149
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,640
In 1958 a grave opens in Västerås Cathedral.

150
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,400
Here is the 400 -year -old body after Erik XIV, Gustav Vasa's oldest son.

151
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,160
The grave was opened in modern times to investigate whether he was murdered.

152
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,120
High levels of arsenic were found.
 The main suspect is half -brother Johan.

153
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,480
How could there be so many conflicts between Gustav Vasa's children?

154
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,440
Come along.
 Now it will be a family ride that extends over fifty years.

155
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,720
After Gustav Vasa's death, the crown falls on his oldest son's head, Erik XIV.

156
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,960
He has high ambitions.

157
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,880
For example, he wants
 Marry the Queen of England.
 However, he has a problem.

158
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,400
What was problematic for him was that he was not mentally stable-

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,440
-And it is difficult to make a diagnosis many hundreds afterwards.

160
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,280
You talk about persecution mania.

161
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,000
-Is he fool?
 -Without doubt.

162
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,200
Johan has less persecution mania, but equally large ambitions of power.

163
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:17,520
He takes a Polish princess and wants his son to become king in Poland.

164
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,160
They still choose king and are also Catholics.

165
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,160
But King Erik is becoming increasingly tricky.

166
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,760
He murders a couple of people from the Sture family on very loose grounds.

167
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,560
It will be a rebellion.

168
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,520
His brother Johan now sits on the throne as Johan III.

169
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,560
Erik is locked up for 9 years before he dies, poisoned as the tomb opening showed.

170
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,360
Already during the time, many are sure that Johan was behind the murder.

171
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,360
Eventually, Johan's son is king of Poland, just as planned.

172
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,080
When Johan himself dies, the son Sigismund becomes regent over two countries.

173
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,840
The king of Sweden is also king in Poland.

174
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,640
But more Vasa sons want to be king.
 Now his youngest son Karl sees his chance.

175
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,320
-He comes into conflict with Sigismund.
 -It then begins a civil war.

176
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,400
Sigismund wants to regain his throne but is defeated outside Linköping.

177
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,680
After the battle, Karl King Karl becomes IX in Sweden.

178
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,800
Sigismund remains only king over Poland, something he was not happy with.

179
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,760
The third vasason sits on the throne.

180
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,920
He is recognized by his fun, unique hairstyle.

181
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:53,520
He reigns with a firm hand and clears those who were loyal to the brother.

182
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,440
Karl is the one that many say is most similar to his father, to the way and appearance.

183
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,320
When he gets a son, he baptizes him to the same name as his father - Gustav.

184
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,320
The Vasa era ends in 1611.

185
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,080
And what really happens?
 Well, Karl IX dies in a stroke.

186
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,560
And his son, the only 16 -year -old Gustav II Adolf takes over power.

187
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,000
With the change of power, it has been seen as a new era begins.

188
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:34,640
The Vasa era has often played a major role in the story of Sweden.

189
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,040
This is a huge picture, made by Carl Larsson.

190
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,360
It was completed in 1908.

191
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,760
During national romance, Gustav Vasa becomes a symbol of Sweden's birth.

192
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,160
One should feel something for the king and the motherland-

193
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,520
-And you go back to Gustav Vasa.

194
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,920
To when he creates a Sweden that is an invented Sweden.

195
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:09,120
You make him extra blonde, and then you start looking at other pictures.

196
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,560
Then you discover that he is not at all blonde on the paintings from the 16th century.

197
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,360
He is quite dark.
 What do you do then?
 Well, you turn to Anders Zorn.

198
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,680
He may then repaint one of the 16th-century portraits-

199
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,320
-And Gustav Vasa Blonde.

200
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,560
How we look at history change over time.

201
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,280
The image of Gustav Vasa has been very positive until modern times.

202
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,240
Yes, in modern times, the image of Gustav Vasa has a good, collecting country father-

203
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,080
-completed with reckless pages.

204
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:56,000
He has been described by some as a tyrant, dictator, or Tony Soprano.

205
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,160
What do we have from the Vasa era more than Vasaloppet-

206
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,680
-Which happens in Dalarna, but neither contains rebellion nor bell theft.

207
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,800
The most important thing is that Sweden is still a Lutheran country.

208
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,320
Many people do not think so much, but it is important.

209
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,440
Also the fact that we have an inheritance king.

210
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,960
During the Vasa era, part of Sweden's political system-

211
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,600
-When it applies to central power and administrations.

212
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,600
Although people had a different everyday life than the one we have today was very similar.

213
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,480
People dream of similar things as today: community and love.

214
