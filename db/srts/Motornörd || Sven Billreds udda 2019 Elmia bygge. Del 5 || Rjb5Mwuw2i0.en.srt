1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,440
-Good afternoon! Good afternoon.

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,740
-Where did the car go?

3
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,035
It has happened a bit since last time.

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,520
-The time I was here put it together but it doesn't do it anymore.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,800
-The car is completely dismantled. Yes.

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,980
It is easy to mow with. I didn't need any help I could lift everything myself.

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,660
It went pretty fast.

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53.560
I have built the car myself so I know what order it should be picked down.

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,300
What is left to pick down is front and rear wagon.

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:05,340
Then I start with the frame and weld the holes again, put and paint.

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07.820
After that, the frame should be foiled.

12
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10,360
-Who should do the foil? I do that myself.

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,660
I have ordered material.

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,340
-Have you done it before? Yes we often do it on the buses at work.

15
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,300
-Oh okay.

16
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:25,800
The only thing that is a problem is the corner here. The rest is quite simple.

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,940
The foil is easy to handle so it should probably work.

18
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,300
The engines are completely disassembled and the crankshafts are sent on balancing.

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,220
The cardan is also sent to the same guy.

20
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,720
I've got all the parts so I can pick up the engine when I get the crankshafts.

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,140
And the engine should be cleaned and painted.

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,960
-What is it for color? It becomes plain silver.

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,720
The color will not appear so it becomes something simple.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,040
-Type Matt Silver? Yes.

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,540
-like the covers here? Yes exactly it will be the same.

26
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06.080
I have also prepared the stainless steel exhaust system and suction.

27
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,300
What is located here should be sent on electrolyte polishing.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,060
I don't really know how it goes. I think they dip it in some kind of acid.

29
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,020
So it corrodes all deposits from welding, etc.

30
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,200
Then some other liquid and last with current and then it becomes a glossy surface.

31
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,660
It will be exciting to see how it will be when it comes back.

32
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,540
-What do you have lying here? It should be elected gold.

33
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:38,820
It is controlling the p-end that is original from the 30s that I have sanded and made smooth.

34
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,340
Also these and some other small details.

35
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,400
And it gets gold.

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,880
The car has a fun shape when you look at this behind it looks like a boat.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,600
It is the front of a 30-40s boat. Yes, haha.

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,400
That is why called Boat-tail.

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00.880
Although it is big stuff, it is the heaviest frame.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04.860
I managed to carry it myself last time so I'll probably succeed this time.

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,460
Here we have the rear or luggage.

42
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,120
It is a skeleton made in 20x20 tubes that are clad in aluminum.

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,380
It does not weigh that much and is easy to lift.

44
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,540
But still stable.

45
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,580
The same goes for the torpedo. I can lift it myself.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,980
Here we have the kick plates.

47
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,940
Passengers and driver's side.

48
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,980
It will not be polished. Everything on the inside will be brushed.

49
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,040
About this piece. Now I've only done a little bit.

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
You see a difference.

51
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,600
If you take a photo from above, it looks like a ...

52
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03.020
... car building kit that you bought when you were little. When everything sat together in a map.

53
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,200
There will be a few square meters to be polished.

54
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,580
Here is...

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,100
... the floor itself.

56
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,740
To the luggage. And here's the turn over the wheels.

57
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,040
I have to back a little because the car is so terribly big.

58
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,480
Here is the fuel cap.

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,100
This one should also be polished. I don't polish it on the inside.

60
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,520
Just what is visible.

61
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,800
-What does aluminum have deficiencies compared to sheet metal?

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,780
Aluminum is done correctly so it does not rust.

63
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,800
If you make a mistake, it rusts more than regular sheet metal.

64
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,500
All electrical drawing & lamps should not be grounded.

65
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,620
This is drawn a special earth cable.

66
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,860
You drive power through the body.

67
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02.680
With these iron beams you get the correction directly.

68
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,380
-Where does the frame come from? The frame comes from a Chevrolet truck from 1929.

69
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,380
Which has been a fire truck from the beginning with a water tank.

70
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,400
It was perfect.

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,100
I had just gone through what I needed to build my own frame.

72
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,700
With axis spacing and how long the frame rails would be.

73
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,100
I was about to order materials.

74
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,060
Then there was an advertisement on the Block on this chassis.

75
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,140
It was just to hit and pick up. -Wike flow!

76
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,500
-What have you done with the frame? Made some rust.

77
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,360
That section here ...

78
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45.560
... was at the water tank and here it sat double plate.

79
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,840
It was upset so this part is changed.

80
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,780
I have done this reinforcement cross.

81
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57.715
So that the frame becomes more rotated.

82
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02.320
Now it is a mute frame when all rivets are welded.

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05.515
There are no rivets left.

84
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08.840
The attachments for the leaf suspension are original.

85
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,780
They sit on the outside which is good.

86
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,040
Often on passenger cars, the attachment sat in the middle or on the inside.

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,900
Its further out they sit so more stable, the car becomes good.

88
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,900
The rear axle is from a Camaro from 1977 or -78.

89
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,380
As I have redone the brackets on.

90
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,595
-Why just such a rear axle?

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,320
A regular GM rear axle that it is easy to get parts and right with width.

92
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,340
The front car is largely original with leaf suspension longitudinal.

93
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,480
I've got hold of the murders brakes from 1953. -hahaha!

94
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,020
It's Bolt On.

95
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,640
From 1929 until 1953, they have not changed anything.

96
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,360
What if it could be the same on today's cars?

97
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07.840
I have changed so that the front car is above the leaf suspension instead of below.

98
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,200
It lowers the car almost 10 cm.

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,420
Right. It provides a smooth height front and rear.

100
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,820
This is an original beam that I have redone a bit.

101
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:25,860
I have raised the beam because the front carriage comes higher up so it does not hit when it springs.

102
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,920
And that it is welded instead of rivets.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,180
Here I have some left to weld. I haven't accessed before.

104
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,200
Yes you have things to do? Yes, there are a few weeks left for Easter.

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,500
Surely it is two months left for Easter? Yes something like that.

106
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,220
I would have had anxiety if I knew it was only 2 months left and so much to do.

107
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,340
That's what pepper one. It is almost as fast to pick it up as apart.

108
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,740
When it is to be picked up, each part must be polished before.

109
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,500
I have gone through it 2-3 times before so there should be no problems.

110
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,960
-What are you grinding this one with? It is its own invention.

111
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,060
I have driven this in the English wheel and was not so huge ...

112
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:23,020
... it is quite roughly processed. There is a lot of structure in it.

113
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,980
I have leveled mostly with a hammer.

114
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,880
Here you need as you can see here ..

115
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,500
... it is a little uneven. Here it is finished.

116
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,940
Then I have taken the big machine that spins while being oscillates.

117
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,200
I have made an aluminum board that is stuck in Velcro.

118
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,120
The sandpaper is stuck in adhesive paper.

119
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,040
This is a sandpaper.

120
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,740
So I can drive with it.

121
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,500
It does not follow any contours and grinds completely flat.

122
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,960
The problem is that it gets very hopeful.

123
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,580
Then I spray on cold breeding and grind on.

124
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,260
It works well as a lubricant.

125
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,960
-How long takes this? I usually say a quarter 14 days ...

126
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,340
... it depends on how nice you are. Hahaha!

127
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,520
Haha, a quarter 14 days ...

128
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,580
This has taken ... This page is finely cut up here.

129
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,440
Here I have the polishing left.

130
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,800
Here it should be honed and then polishing on everything.

131
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,520
For this, it has been 10 hours. Oh.

132
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,440
And I have about 20 hours left.

133
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,100
So around 30 hours

134
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,600
It takes to grind and polish such a piece.

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,760
And that's pretty little. For the torpedo I started on Friday ...

136
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51.060
... at 14:00 and was finished Sunday at 21:00.

137
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55.840
Then I lasted for 13 hours on Saturday and 10 hours on Sunday.

138
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,780
It was a little more difficult because it is not smooth but more shaped.

139
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07.840
I've built .... I think it's ...

140
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,140
... 10E Rodden that I build from scratch.

141
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,900
And also other cars so I know what it takes.

142
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,220
Previously, I worked as a injury repairman on buses.

143
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,600
There you could have jobs that took 700-800 hours.

144
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,820
Then you had to put everything in the right order.

145
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,360
Then you had to go through everything so it was completed within a reasonable time.

146
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,180
You have great benefit from this when you build yourself.

147
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,780
Being able to set up planning properly.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,780
Anticipation.

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,020
I see many people starting to hold on ...

150
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,080
... with brakes or engine.

151
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01.080
And then something is missing or that they do not know what they should do.

152
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,720
Then they go home and shit in it.

153
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07.060
I don't know how to do it.

154
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,820
I always have 4-5 different items.

155
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,440
Which I can work with.

156
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,940
I'm not going to come here and think about what should I do tonight.

157
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,800
I'll have finished tasks.

158
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,500
So I want to take it easy and sit on a chair so there is such a type of job.

159
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,340
It should still be done later but then I can do it now instead.

160
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,320
You have great benefit from that. There are many friends to me who have been stuck.

161
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,900
Because they don't know what they should do. I'll take it another day ...

162
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,440
I will take it next week that will be month ago it will be standing.

163
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,380
You might have made a Swedish angels who go around and fix the last in the garage.

164
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,260
Hehehe ...

165
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:08,700
It is often so that you need a kick in the ass so you can move on.

166
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:15,540
Many times it can be the financial but there is much you can do that does not cost anything.

167
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,320
Which you can continue on if there is no money.

168
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,360
It is important to plan correctly so it goes.

169
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,460
When you are done with the car, should it be inspected before Elmia?

170
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,600
I'll try to inspect it before.

171
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,940
It is always fun to come to Elmia with a registered car.

172
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,040
I only have the old F sign.

173
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,740
Well, it was probably an a sign.

174
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,480
X!

175
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45.515
X2686.

176
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,600
It would be nice with it is not certain that time is enough, but you never know.

177
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,160
There are no more things to be ordered or manufactured?

178
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,260
Well I have some orders from the USA, among other things, new distributors.

179
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,160
And some other small things. Other I should have everything.

180
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,080
It should not be anything. Wouldn't the benefits come ...

181
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,060
... I have used lying down but then I have to renovate them.

182
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,520
It would have been smooth with two new ones so I don't have to do that much.

183
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,900
I realized that you had no floor in the cab last.

184
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,780
No, I have made a template. Ah a woodwall, huh?

185
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes this template fits both on the right and left side.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,280
Easy to grind and cut out a new one. So I have the whole floor.

187
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,520
Will it be in sheet metal then or? No, it actually becomes such a 10 mm wooden board.

188
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,440
There will be good sound insulation. Plate is happy to be shameful.

189
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,040
Otherwise it is not so much more. A little putty and painting on the frame.

190
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,020
All that job I will do down here. It's not the weather to take a frame outdoors now.

191
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,975
It is better to stay here and do it yourself.

192
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,460
It should not be painted it will be brush painted.

193
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,760
The frame should be ground down so it becomes smooth and then foil.

194
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,520
Most of it will happen down here in the garage.

195
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,460
It will be cool to see. I'll have a return visit soon.

196
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,660
So we'll see how long you've come. See you!

197
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,580
We hear, Hello!
