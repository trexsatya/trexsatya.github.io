 "Sorry" in swedish and the first of your books \ h \ h

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,840
Published in Swedish.
 I HOPE It's Not The Last \ H SINE YOU HAVE SUCH A BIG AND EXCITING PRODUCTION. \ H \ H

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:37,760
"Forgive" is a very touching book.
 It's an apology \ h from your Father, writen by you.
 An apology from \ h \ h

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,920
Your Father's Point of View That You Waited \ H For Your Whole Life and Never Received.

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,200
An apology from your Father's Point of \ H View That You Waited For Your Whole Life \ H \ H

25
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and never receives.
 Your Father and Pergetrator \ H WHO Sexually and Physically Abused You Never \ H \ H

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,840
Owned up to his Wrongdoings.
 When Writing the \ H Book He'd Been Dead 31 Years.
 You decided \ h \ h

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,640
to give yourself what you needed.
 Him Taking \ H Accountability for His Actions and Him Explaining \ H \ H

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,840
What led him to treat his oldest daughter this \ h way.
 This Book is a Letter to Eve from Arthur.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was deeply touched by your book "sorry" \ h and it resonated with me in more way than i \ h

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
would have imagined.
 I was \ h so filled with strong emotions \ h \ h

31
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,320
When Reading, it was like \ h a physical experience reading it. \ h

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,240
SINCE THERE SO HARD TO READ ARTHUR \ H RECOUNTING THE EVENTS, I WAS FILLED WITH SADNESS, \ H \ H

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,680
Relief But Also Anger and Rage.
 One thing \ h that Kept coming back to me was the extensive \ h \ h

34
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,240
Emotional Labor Behind Your Method.
 To Bring \ H Back Your Father From The Dead and Evoking His \ H \ H

35
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Voice couldn't have been easy.
 Can you please \ h Tell me about the process behind this book \ h \ h

36
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,830
And how the book came to be?

37
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:27,920
Thank you so much \ hor that introduction and for the response to "the apology".
 It's funny that you're saying \ hthat about the physicalness of your response, \ h \ h \ h

38
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,840
Because Writing This Book was so physical. \ H it was so physical in so many way.

39
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,800
I Never Had an Experience \ Hlike that, Writing Before.
 I'VE WRITTEN A LOT OF \ H \ H

40
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Books and a Lot of PlayS But it Felt As \ H I WENT INTO A Kind of Trance State. \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,680
My Father, My Dead Father was very, very present \ h through the whole thing.
 In Really Learned \ H \ h

42
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,480
a lot about the dead.
 The Dead Are Always With Us. \ H they're Always Around us and often they Long to be \ h \ h

43
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,680
In Communication with Us to Help Them Understand \ H Where they are and to help them get free and other \ h \ h

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:18,240
Zones Where they live.
 But the Experience of \ H Trying to Climb Into My Father, to Live Inside \ Hhim.

45
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,320
The Book is a Conjuring, \ hit's fiction.
 I don't know if \ h \ h

46
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,280
A Lot of It's Even TRUE BECASE MY FATHER REALLY \ H NEVER TALKED AND HE NEVER TOLD ME About Himself. \ H

47
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,840
But it Feels Like It's TRUE BECAUSE HIS PARSENCE \ H AND BEING INSIDE HIM FELT SO REAL WHILE I \ H

48
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,760
Was Writing It.
 It was excruciating, it was \ h liberating, it was terrifying, it was maddening. \ H \ h

49
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,200
In Had Moments Where I Was Literally Curled Up \ H IN A BALL, just just weeping.
 But it was

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Incredible Cathartic.
 In Always Say, \ H there's a line at the end of the book \ h \ h

51
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
which I don't know if my father \ h say or in say because by the end of writering \ h \ h

52
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,080
The Book in Didn't Know Who Was Writing \ H It, But The Line Is "Old Man Be Gone" \ H \ H

53
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,520
When that line got said. It \ h really fault like my father just wet \ h \ h

54
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,200
Into the ethers, like he was gone and to be HONEST \ H HE HASNRY COME BACK.
 He is gone from my \ h \ h

55
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,040
Life, Gone!
 He's No Longer Possessing Me.
 He's no \ h Longer Occupying me.
 He's no longer determination \ h \ h

56
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,720
Me.
 I'm No Longer His Consequence, which is one of \ h the reasons in Changed My Name.
 I FELT LIKE \ H \ H

57
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,160
That name was part of that narrative and that \ h story and I'm now writing a new narrative.
 \hrs

58
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,600
We're \ hgoing to talk about the ending of the book LATER \ H \ H

59
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,840
but I absolutely loved the last line of the book. \ h it was very freeing for me as a reader as well. \ h

60
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I Thought a lot about that \ hwhen Reading your book because, \ h

61
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,840
For me as a writer, in Always Think that \ H Writing is a way to connect to the dead \ h \ h

62
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,120
and make the dead a part of the living and \ h so much of writter is trying to reach the dead. \ h \ h

63
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Can you say something more about \ hhow the dead are living \ h \ h

64
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,120
With Alive People and What is Literature's \ H Role or Writing's Role In This Relationship? \ H \ h

65
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:31,280
I feel like our ancestors are all around us \ h all the time and it's a question of whether we \ h \ h

66
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,840
Tune into their presence.
 But i think because \ h i was writing this book in my father's voice \ h \ h

67
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,680
I was calling him in.
 I Needed Him To Talk \ H TO ME AND LITERALLY I WOULD BE ASLEEP \ H \ H

68
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,000
and he would wake me up at four in the morning.
 I \ hwould wake up and he would say, go to your office, \ hi'm going to tell you a story!

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,204
So I would get \ hup in the Middle of Winter I'm Go To My Office and He Would Start To Talk To Me.

70
00:07:57,204 --> 00:08:06,254
And I \ hstarted to Understand, \ hthere's a whole passage in the \ h book, like the dead are all around us.

71
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:12,874
And if we are willing to open ourselves to them and feel them and to list to them and be in dialogue with them

72
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:24,822
and embrace them, \ hthey will speak to us.
 And they will let us know what they are feeling.
 And they will also instruct \ house and direct us and help us.

73
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:31,040
I feel like they are here and I feel a lot \ h of people leave this world very incomplete.

74
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,400
They leave, my Father for Example Left Very \ H Arrogant, He Left Very Prideful, He Refused to \ H \ H

75
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,960
Look at any of the Things he had done Wrong. \ h so he literally had stuck for 31 years spinning \ h \ h

76
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,720
in this terrible, terrible limbo which was real \ h hea hava to deal with all the undealt things he \ h \ h

77
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Hadn't Dealt With.
 I Think by My Summoning Him \ H Here, In A Literary and Emotional Way Give

78
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,720
an Opportunity to Really Work Through What He \ H was going through, wherever he was.
 It Certainly \ H \ H

79
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Did it for me.
 So that is my imagination. \ H i think the imagination often is so much more \ h \ h

80
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,205
truthful than reality.

81
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:25,760
In Always Think About Truth \ Hwhen Writing Fiction.
 Even when writering fiction you know what the \ htruth is.
 You can see what's truth and what's \ h \ h

82
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,240
Not the truth.
 So that's interesting, the fantasy is like more connected to the truth.

83
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,360
In Also Thought About, When Reading, because, in was Angry.

84
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,720
I Thought About Two Different Kinds \ H of Anger.
 Anger, as the feeling Consuming \ h \ h

85
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,880
The Narrator, Your Father, and Making Him \ H Like A Horrible Person, Impossible To Reach, \ H \ H

86
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,240
Impossible to Connect with.
 Like indicates AS Lacking \ H Empathy.
 But there is also ankher Kind of Anger \ H \ h

87
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:07,920
and that's Eve's indicates in the book, fueling \ Hher Survival

88
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,920
duck entering as a maker of boundaries. \ h there's a harrowing scene when she smiles at sky \ h \ h

89
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,099
When He's Been Beating Her.
 It's so Angry, It's Full of Rage

90
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:29,520
But it makes her own.
 So I'm curious, what are your thoughts \ h on indicates?
 Is it destructive or is it helpful? \ H

91
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,080
It's such a brilliant way of \ h putting it.
 Both Those Two Types of Anger ...

92
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,600
I think, as women, we are so often \ h taught we're not allyed to be angry. \ H \ h

93
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,480
Oh, you just anchor woman or \ h the b word, or you're all this.

94
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,480
Men are so trained to be allowed to have the one indicates \ h and also to learn how to direct their indicates \ h \ h

95
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,640
Into Achievement and Into all Kinds \ Hof Things.
 For me,

96
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,040
I'Ve Always Been Very, Very Angry.
 I'm just \ ha raging person and i think my rage \ h \ h

97
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,800
is what helped me survive.
 If I Hadn't Had \ hthat Anger, if I hadn't had that defiance, if \ h \ h

98
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I hadn't had that refusal in me, just the \ h furiousness at heaven, he would have wiped

99
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,240
Me Out.
 He would have just run me over. \ H so i think indicates is very \ h \ h

100
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,440
Healthy.
 It Fuels Revolutions, It Fuels Resistance, \ H It Fuels Risings and and People

101
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,680
speaking truth to power and refusing to be \ h upssed and refusing to be slaves and refusing \ h \ h \

102
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,960
to be undone.
 There's Also A Point When \ H You Have To Start Looking at Your Anger

103
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,960
and there's a line in there where his mother \ h say to heaven, indicates is a poison you mix \ h \ h

104
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,160
for a friend and you drink yourf.There becomes \ h a point where that indicates becomes toxic to you. \ h

105
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,760
One of the reasons in wrote this \ h book, there are many reasons, but i heard myself one \ h \ h

106
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:04,160
Night just going on and on and on about my rage, about men.
 In don't accept \ h \ h

107
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,840
Any Kind of Homogenized or Generalized Monolithic \ H Response to Any Group.
 IF AnyBody Said, in Hate

108
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,440
A Group, I would stand up and say, how can you \ h possilly say that?
 That's racist!

109
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,680
But Why was in Allowing Myself to feel perfectly entitled to go on about but? \ H

110
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,720
I realized that I did not want to be that person. \ H i Didn't Want to be that person who was going \ h \ h \ h

111
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,160
on about raging at but for my whole life.
 That \ hwas one of the reasons in wrote this book.
 To just \ h \ h

112
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,880
say, okay let's go in, let's see what what is \ h this controlling rage doing and is it serving my \ h \ h

113
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,080
Life Anymore?
 Is it really moving me forward?
 The Answer was it wasn't serving my life anymore. \ H \ h

114
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,240
It was keeping me attached to a notion of myself \ h as this perpetual victim.
 Which I did not want to be \ h \ h

115
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,560
Anymore.
 I was only in reaction to my father.
 I was \ h Only in response to my father which meant I was \ h \ h

116
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,600
still in my father's story.
 I was still within his \ hconstruct or his narrative.
 I WANTED \ H \ H

117
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,284
To be in my own narrative.

118
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:22,320
That's The Big Wonder of This Book.
 It's not an Angry Book.
 It's a Book Filled With Understanding, \ HTRYING TO UNDERSTAND OR EVEN AN ACT OF \ H \ H

119
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:31,360
Compassion.
 That is what husbands \ H this book so curious in a way.

120
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,520
Another thing that was so interesting \ h with your Father or the Voice of Your Father \ H \ h

121
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,920
In the book, in your wring, is heaven trying to \ h explain how he became such a violent person.

122
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:50,160
Early on he talks about how he as a teenager Went to \ h the movies and discovered the american movie star. \ H \ h

123
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:59,360
And charm.
 He decides to become a charming man. \ H to use this charm as a shelter from \ h \ h

124
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:07,920
The Violence He Heavenly is Experiencing at Home.
 And \ h After this he becomes almost this image of a man, \ h \ h

125
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:16,320
Instead of a real man.
 I was so \ h intrigued about this picture, this image.

126
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,960
How is that related to lying versus Telling \ h the truth?
 And also this obsession \ h \ h

127
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,000
With the image or the picture in western culture \ h or american culture?
 Could Say Something \ H \ h

128
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,364
About that?

129
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:36,080
From My Father's \ Hearly Years, My Father Was Obsessively Adored.

130
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,880
I Think Adoration of Boys, Adoration \ H of Anyone, is a Devastating and Destructive Thing \ H \ h

131
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,365
because it does not allow them to be a human being. \ h it forces them to be ...

132
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:48,094
Why is that?

133
00:14:48,094 --> 00:15:01,120
When you're adored for this \ hidealized image of yourself, so you have to always be performative.
 You can be doubtful, you \ hcan't cry, you can express weakness.

134
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,320
It's Also Very Lonely When \ H You're adored because you're this perfect person. \ H \ h

135
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,440
And in my father's case no one was good \ h enough to be your friend because you are so perfect.

136
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,520
And I think it made my Father really anxious and \ h Crazy Early on.
 And i think he was abused by \ h \ h

137
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:25,840
His Brother.
 So when he found moviestars and images of

138
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,720
Valentino and Cary Grant and All These \ H People in the Movies, He suddenly had this \ h \ h

139
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,400
veneer.
 He had this image of himself that he could \ H Portray and Bring Into the World.
 But it didn't \ h \ h

140
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,040
Take Care of All The Feelings That Were Underneath It, Which Rage And Which Were Self-Hatred and \ H \ h

141
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,520
Which Never Feeling Loved for \ H WHO HE WAS BUT For this idealized Ida that his \ h \ h

142
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,240
Parents Had of Him.
 Nothing Having to do \ h with who he real was.
 America \ h \ h

143
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,400
is this place that creates these images.
 Then it exports these images, Both \ h \ h

144
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:09,440
Internally all through the country and into the \ h world of this kind of fantasy idea of ourselves.

145
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,320
RIGHT NOW THERE'S THIS NEW \ H THING GOING ON IN MOVIES HERE WHICE

146
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,760
Feels like wealth porn.
 All the movies \ h are filled with these unbelievable clothes and \ h \ h

147
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,720
Unbelievable Houses of the Wealthy.
 All These \ H TV Series Are Just Exporting This Notion of \ H \ H

148
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,920
of the rich and what it's like to be rich.
 So everybody starts Comparing Themselves to That \ H \ H

149
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,400
and starts look at their own shabby house and \ h feeling like, oh my good, look where in live, it's so \ h \ h

150
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,120
Pathetic!
 And it Feels Dimined and Feels \ H Like they are less than, it feel like they are not \ h \ h

151
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,840
Enough.
 This is what this country \ h is known for, the manufacturing of fantasy.

152
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:59,520
We elected this crazy predator in chief. \ H who was the king of that.
 He was a \ h \ h

153
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:07,200
Television show, he was a hologram.
 That was the ultimate in an American Kind of \ H \ h

154
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:14,400
Projection.
 SO MY FATHER WAS CHARMING AND HE WAS HANDSOME.

155
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,920
Everybody Wanted to Look Like Him and \ H Be Like Him and He was a Bastard and He was horrible. \ H \ h

156
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,080
This is so true of so many.
 Whether You Look Through All Of What Happened In The \ H \ H

157
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:34,160
Recent Metoo Exposure in Hollywood, if you look \ h at all of these people who are so called charming \ h \ h

158
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,880
and Delightful.
 I 'Been \ H Reading Hannah Arendt Lately Because She's One \ H \ H

159
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,480
of my favorite writers.
 She Always Talks About \ H The Fact That The Evil Don't Look \ H \ H

160
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,240
Like Evil.
 The Evil Looked Banal, The Evil Looked Regular, The Evil Looked Charming, The Evil Looked \ H \ H

161
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,800
Like just like everybody else.
 And i think \ h this notion of charm is something that \ h \ h

162
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,400
is very confusing and distorting and crispling. \ h it took me years to be able to really say, \ h \ h

163
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,720
This man who appears to be charming to all of \ h you, is destroying my life.

164
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,440
Even in Couldn't Believe that this person who was \ h so charming would be doing this to me.

165
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,880
Culturally we also have Great Faith in the Charm or in the Picture of Charm.

166
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,400
It's a Spell, Charm Really Means a Spell.
 People \ H Put a Spell On You Through Their Charm.

167
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,840
That's very interesting.
 There's a \ h Beautiful scene in the book \ h \ h

168
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,960
Where Eve's Father Has Been Dead For A Couple \ H of Days And He See's Eve Sitting in His Closet \ H \ H \

169
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,920
With her face buried in his shirt.
 He's \ H Reading This As A Sign of Eve's Willingness or \ H \ H

170
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Her Efforts to Remember some form of Tenderness \ H Between them.
 This Made Me Think of Making \ H \ H

171
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:08,400
Room for Grief When Grief is Not Easy.
 How do \ h we grieve the people we hate or have hated \ h?

172
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,040
It's such a good question.

173
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:27,840
It took me so long to grieve my father. \ Hone, because my father was so ungenerous.
 When you have a memorial or a funreral, it's an act of generosity. \ H \ h

174
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,040
You're Allowing the People Who Loved You To Have \ H A Way To Process The Loss of You.
 My Father Didn't \ H \ H

175
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,600
Believe in any of that.
 So there was no funeral, there was no memorial.
 There was no way to grieve \ h \ h

176
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,280
for my father.
 He found them petty and he found them loathsome. \ H \ h

177
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,080
Like things that human beings would \ h do.
 SO After My Father \ H \ h

178
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,480
HAD DIED AND I WAS AT MY PARENTS HOUSE, I did not have any way to to experience \ h \ h

179
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,520
The Disappearance of My Father.
 The Evaporation \ H of My Father.
 He was here and he was gone.
 But \ h \ h

180
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:09,120
There was nothing, there was no ritual, there was \ h no process to integrate that into myself.
 \ h \ h

181
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,760
So I just Went Into His Closet And I Remember \ H Ha Had This Yellow Cashmere Sweater That \ H \ H

182
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,800
He was all the time.
 I just took it down \ h and i Sat in His Closet and I just smelled it.

183
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,960
As a way of at least have the memory of heaven and \ h the loss of heaven all at the same time.

184
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,880
To be HONEST WITH YOU, MY FATHER DIED 31 \ H YEARS AGO.
 It wasnnt until in wrote this \ h \ h

185
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:40,640
Book That in Truly Grieved My Father.
 Grieved who he was in life and \ h \ h

186
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,160
grieved the loss of heaven.
 Because I was too angry at that time, I was too angry. \ H \ h

187
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,720
I'm happy he's dead.
 I was just brusque and I was glib.

188
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,440
In Hadn't Seen My Father in Years.
 He'd been \ h horrible but there \ h \ h

189
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,200
Were Layers and Layers of Feelings under There \ H Where I Had Once Loved My Father Deeply.
 I was \ h \ h

190
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,720
Once Very Attached to My Father and Through the Writing of This Book \ H \ H

191
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,080
I finally undangled Those Feelings.
 I just Dismantled them so that in could go on \ h \ h

192
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,460
Clean.

193
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:29,840
There's a change in \ hhow he sees what he's done, through the book, in the beginning he tries \ hto give eve as a five-year-wold some kind of agency. \ H \ h

194
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,760
Almost Claiming That She's Been Flirting with \ H Him as a Five-years, and this just made me \ h \ h

195
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,840
Boil!
 In Almost Couldn't Read It.
 It was so Painful to Read.
 But then he \ h \ h

196
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:55,360
Starts to abandon this idea of Eve's agency and he \ h starts to recognize the truth.
 That Eve's Agency \ H \ h

197
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:03,440
was a lie.
 This is When the Pain \ H Starts to Affect Him or the Consequences of What \ H \ h

198
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,840
He did to you starts to affect him.
 For me this was a Victory Functioning as an Image in My \ H \ h

199
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,080
Own Life.
 There is this small possibility that \ h a perpetrator would admit his wrongdoing \ h.

200
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:24,160
It was also bitterweet, because as you also \ h Talked About, it made me realize how the apology \ h \ h

201
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,686
is missing in the patriarchal \ h Society.
 During and after

202
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:33,600
metoo there was this big

203
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,040
VOID OPENING BETWEEN ALL OF US.
 Countless \ H Women Came Out and Told)

204
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,520
and shared their trauma publicly, which is very \ h hard, with hope that something would change. \ h \ h

205
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,840
For me it was never about cancelling but \ h out, it was about trying to start a conversation. \ H

206
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,160
But now there's like this open wound.
 All of \ h us still waiting.
 What are your

207
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,840
Thoughts on this?
 Why Can't Toxic \ H Masculinity Hold Space For The Apology? \ H

208
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,360
It's SUCH A GOOD QUESTION!
 SINCE I'VE WRITTEN THE BOOK, \ H

209
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,040
It's Been Amazing, Because I Am Surprised \ H TO SEE HOW MEN have responded to the book. \ h \ h

210
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,920
A lot of but have had me on shows. \ H i've Received Lots of Letters From Men \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H

211
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,720
WHO HAVE WRITTEN ME APologies.
 They have written \ h to their perpetrators, I mean to their victims \ h \ h

212
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,000
which has been really moving.
 But what i want \ h to say is that, except for maybe one exam of \ h \ h

213
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:47,440
A Couple On Ted, I have never heard a man make a \ h public apology in a true way for sexual violence.

214
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,520
Nobody Has in the History of Humankind.
 I'Ve Gone Back, Back, Back Centuries.
 Never. \ H \ h

215
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,680
What I Discovered Writing This Book is \ H THAT IS ACTUALLY A COLUM THAT HOLDS UP \ H \ H \ H

216
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,880
Patriarchy, The Non-Apology.
 As long as \ h but refused, and I'm not going to say but, \ h \ h

217
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,720
As Long as perpetrators, because there are \ h Women perpetrators too.
 As long as perpetrator, \ h \ h

218
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,480
But I'm going to say again, that one out of three \ h Women on the planet will be beat or raped.
 And \ h \ h

219
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:23,280
That is by men, so that's a lot of but.
 As long \ h as but refuse to apologize \ h \ h

220
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,480
Patriarchy Stays in Place.
 Because \ h Once One Man Begins To Say He's Sorry \ H \ H

221
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,080
and he knows it was wrong, then all the but have to \ h begin to say they know what they're \ h \ h

222
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,480
Doing is Wrong.
 And one once that begins to \ h Happen This Methodology, which is violence, which \ h \ h

223
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,760
is the thing that keeps patriarchy in its place \ h will begin to collapse.
 So in belief it's \ h \ h

224
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,440
Truly Significant, The Apology.
 It's a core \ h to dismantling patriarchy, it's at the core. \ H \ h

225
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,240
Because you have to make yourself vulnerab.
 You \ h have to say you were Wrong.
 You have to acknowledge. \ H \ h

226
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,760
First of all, What Went Into Making You?
 What \ h are the patriarchal ingredients that allowed \ h \ h

227
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,240
You and Pushed You To Become a \ H Man Capable of Rape, Capable of Violence? \ H \ h

228
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,240
THEN YOU HAVE TO FEEL WHAT YOUR VICTIM FELT, \ H ACTUALLY Climb Inside Her and See The Impact of \ H \ H \ h

229
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,760
What you did to her.
 You have to look at the actual \ h Things that you did to her.
 What exactly did you do? \ H \ h

230
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,680
And then you have to take responsibility \ h for that.
 All of Those Things Work Against \ H \ h

231
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,440
Everything that patriarchy is.
 It keeps \ h its distance so it can mainain its power. \ H \ h

232
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,000
It's Always About The Father Is Right No \ H Matter What.
 It's Always Insisting \ H \ H

233
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,760
On Domination Rather Than Cooperation and Dialogue. \ H SO I BELIEVE THAT AT THE CORE, IF WE REALLY WANT \ H \ H \ H

234
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:59,520
To Dismantle Patriarchy, we have to start \ h to have apologies and repair, processes, groups \ h \ h

235
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,200
everywhere in the world.
 It has to be begin \ h to happen.
 And I think there are more but willing \ h \ h

236
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,480
To Undergo that process than we think, having see \ h letters that are starting to come in from the book. \ h \ h

237
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,080
I SAW YOUR TED \ HTALK AND I REALLY LIKED YOU \ H \ H

238
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:24,880
Talking about calling but in after calling them \ h out.
 That takes some effort to be \ h \ h

239
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,360
Willing and Able and have the courage to do so.
 Can you just explain what calling but in is? \ H

240
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,840
My Friend Tony Porter, Who Runs This Organization, \ H Called A Man and He was the one who \ h \ h

241
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,040
Actually coined that phrase.
 He was like saying, \ h and i just loved it because i feel like, okay \ h \ h

242
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,320
We have now exposed, not just with metoo, i've been working 23 years \ h

243
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,880
In a Movement Called V-Day where what \ h have we been doing but calling out but!
 Calling out \ h \ h

244
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,120
stories, tell our stories, breaking the silence. \ h breaking the silence breaking the silence telling \ h \ h

245
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,840
The stories.
 We've done that.
 The Next Stage of This \ H Movement Has To Be That Men Begin To Talk About \ H \ H

246
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,000
What they've done.
 Literally why they've done it. \ H what's in their history, what it feel like and \ h \ h

247
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,440
What they are going to do to change.
 Otherwise We're \ H GOING TO BE STUCK HERE FOREVER.

248
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,440
One of the amazing things about the ending \ h Violence Against All Women Movement \ H \ h

249
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,840
is that women took this on.
 This Actually Isn't \ h our Movement.
 It should be a men's movement. \ H \ h

250
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,360
It should be but saying, we are going to stand \ h up and we are going to fight to end violence \ h \ h

251
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,520
Against Our Mothers and Our Sisters and Our Wives \ H and Our Girlfriends and our best Friends and our \ h \ h

252
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,000
Aunts and our grandmothers.
 We Care That \ H Women are Being Violated, It Disturbs Us as much \ h \ h

253
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,560
as it disturben them.
 And there's something holding \ h that back from Happening Called Patriarchy. \ H \ h

254
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,240
Because as my friend Tony Porter Also Says, there's something called the man box and every \ h \ h

255
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,200
Man is born into that box.
 And when you step out of \ h that box you risk other but judging you.
 Other but \ h \ h

256
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,920
Exiling you, not being a part of the group.
 All \ h i can say is those of us who were feminists at the \ h \ h

257
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:18,800
Beginning Back Then when It was not popular, when \ h people called you names and threw \ h \ h

258
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,880
Things at you and made fun of you, we took the risk \ h of standing up so that women could be liberated.

259
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,800
Men Need to Take Those Same Risks Now So That \ H Men and Women Can Be Liberated From This Horrible \ H \ h

260
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,920
tyranny of patriarchy which is destroying so many \ h lives and morphs into fascism everywhere you look. \ h \ h

261
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,990
It's the Seeds of Fascism.

262
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,040
I love that \ hyou're saying liberation because

263
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,320
Again in the book, your Father Gets in \ H A Way Liberated When He Admits to the \ H \ h

264
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,800
Consequences of His Crimes.
 And the lacquer of \ h Accountability is keeping sky in limbo. \ H \ h

265
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,640
And when he starts writter he's been \ h there 31 years and when he finally admits to what \ h \ h

266
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,040
He has done, he is transformed \ h to something else.

267
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:22,320
This was so beautiful to read.
 I was so touched \ h by it because he's actually transformed into eve \ h \ h

268
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,120
in a way.
 It's Absolutely Beautiful Scene \ H THAT ACHED IN MY BODY AS I WAS READING IT.

269
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,760
Can You Please Speak About This Image And \ H How the Sincere Apology Changes Not Only The One \ H \ H

270
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,035
Receiving it but the one giving it?

271
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:49,280
I don't \ hthink there's anything more transformative than owning your misdeeds truly.
 And really going \ hthrough that four-step process that in just quickly \ h \ h

272
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,760
Outlined.
 There's No One \ H Who's Done Something Terrible to Somebody Else \ H \ H

273
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,240
Who isn the Direct Result of it.
 Their lives \ h have been changed by, it their character has \ h \ h

274
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,040
Been Changed by it, their emotions, their Spirit, \ H their soul has been Changed by it.
 You don't get \ h \ h

275
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,960
Away with it.
 When you begin to take \ h Responsibility for it, when you begin to process \ h \ h

276
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,560
It, when you begin to own it, when you begin to \ h really let the person who you've harged know \ h \ h

277
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:25,440
That you feel what they feel something amazing \ h begins to release inside you.
 You get to be free, \ h \ h

278
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:34,960
You get to be reconnected to the world, \ hyou get to come out of, you see it all the time where somebody does \ hsomeThing really horrible to somebody \ h \ h

279
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,640
and then they go on a path in their lives where \ h they start to do more and more horrible things \ h \ h

280
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,920
because they're so possessed, they are so so \ h occupied by the darkness or by the guilt \ h \ h

281
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:55,040
or by the plague of what they've done.
 Apologies are just these amazing roots to freedom. \ H \ h

282
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,200
They give us the possibility of transformation. \ H i don't belief in prisons, in

283
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Believe in transformation.
 In Believe We \ H All Are Part of an Evolving Kind of Human Story. \ H \ H

284
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:19,760
We've all been brought up in racist, sexist classist patriarchy so we're all contaminated and \ h \ h

285
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,320
We many of us do terrible things.
 It just happens. \ H How are We Going to Create A World Where People \ H \ H

286
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,520
can do bad things and then change and become \ H OTHER KIND OF PEOPLE?
 That's what's most \ h \ h

287
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,880
Interesting to me.
 I don't want to hold anybody \ h fixed as one permanent mistake for the rest of \ h \ h

288
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,960
their life or one permanent bath thing.
 I'm not \ h Into vengeance.
 In Think Punishment is Foolish, \ H \ h

289
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,800
I think all it does is create more bad things. \ H so what are the mechanisms we're going to create \ h \ h

290
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,480
That Allow People to Become Other Kinds of People? \ H ALSO SO MUCH OF WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE THAT \ H \ h

291
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,520
Brings Them to Prison Is Class Situations, Is Not \ H Hajing Money, Is Being Abused Themselves, Is Being \ H \ H

292
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,720
abused by racism, so how are we going to \ h cure Those Things and heal Those Things so \ h \ h

293
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,720
That People Aren't Forced to Do Bad Things?
 Once You Begin The Apology Process and You Look at \ H \ h

294
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,320
What Brought you to do that things then you have \ h to address three things so we stop doing them.

295
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,720
As a Last Question I Just Want to Talk \ H About Your Dedication In The Book To \ H \ H

296
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,760
All the Women Still Waiting for an Apology.
 If we are not talking about the power in \ h \ h

297
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,480
Giving the Apology, I WANT TO TALK \ H About Power in Receiving an Apology. \ H

298
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,760
What is the power in \ h receive an apology and how did it change you? \ H

299
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,840
What I can say this, I Couldn't Get \ H My Apology From My Father Because He's Dead. \ H

300
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,960
So I Wanted to See IF By Writing His Apology, It \ h would help me.
 And maybe by doing that i \ h \ h

301
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,920
Could Create A Path Which Might Help Other Women. \ H and the truth of the matter is, if you sit down and \ h \ h

302
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,120
You Climb Into Your Pergetrator and You Write A \ H LETTER FROM HIM TO YOURSELF, WETHER IT BE A WOMAN, \ H \ H

303
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,680
Man, whover that is.
 And you really, really do it.
 And then you sit with somebody who will help you \ h \ h

304
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:29,680
With it, because you shouldn't do it Alone.
 Because \ h it's very, very hard emotionally - you can get free! \ H \ h

305
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,920
It is possible.
 Lt is possible.
 That's \ H NOT TO SAY I WANTED TO TAKE PEOPLE OFF THE HOOK \ H \ H

306
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,360
of their responsibility, but there are cases where \ h you can get an apology from some.
 Eiter you \ h \ h

307
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,120
Don't know where they are or whther they're dead \ h or you're too scared of them.
 This Exercise \ H \ h

308
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,720
is a very, very powerful Exercise.
 I've been hearing from different people, \ h \ h

309
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,120
which is also very moving to me, that they're \ h using the book now with people who are coming \ h \ h

310
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,480
Out of Prison to Help Them Begin to Write their \ H Apologies.
 And they're using them in women's groups \ h \ h

311
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,960
LIKE TO OUR OUR CITY OF JOY WHICE IS A SANCTUARY \ H FOR RECOVERING Women in the Congo and a \ h \ h

312
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,680
Revolutionary Center.
 They're actually doing this \ h Exercise as part of the program WHERE WOMEN WRITE \ H \ H \ H

313
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,320
Apology Letters to themselves.
 It's Been Highly \ H Successful In Women Release A Lot of the Toxins \ H \ H

314
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,205
and rage and that feeling of being occupied by \ h their perpetrator.

315
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:31,505
