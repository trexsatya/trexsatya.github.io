would have imagined. I was \ h so filled with strong emotions \ h \ h

31

SINCE THERE SO HARD TO READ ARTHUR \ H RECOUNTING THE EVENTS, I WAS FILLED WITH SADNESS, \ H \ H

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,680
Relief But Also Anger and Rage. One thing \ h that Kept coming back to me was the extensive \ h \ h

Emotional Labor Behind Your Method. To Bring \ H Back Your Father From The Dead and Evoking His \ H \ H

And how the book came to be?

37
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:27,920
Thank you so much \ hor that introduction and for the response to "the apology". It's funny that you're saying \ hthat about the physicalness of your response, \ h \ h \ h

38
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,840
Because Writing This Book was so physical. \ H it was so physical in so many way.

39
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,800
I Never Had an Experience \ Hlike that, Writing Before. I'VE WRITTEN A LOT OF \ H \ H

40
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Books and a Lot of PlayS But it Felt As \ H I WENT INTO A Kind of Trance State. \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H \ H

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,680
My Father, My Dead Father was very, very present \ h through the whole thing. In Really Learned \ H \ h

42
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,480
a lot about the dead. The Dead Are Always With Us. \ H they're Always Around us and often they Long to be \ h \ h

43
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09.680
In Communication with Us to Help Them Understand \ H Where they are and to help them get free and other \ h \ h

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:18,240
Zones Where they live. But the Experience of \ H Trying to Climb Into My Father, to Live Inside \ Hhim.

45
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,320
The Book is a Conjuring, \ hit's fiction. I don't know if \ h \ h

46
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,280
A Lot of It's Even TRUE BECASE MY FATHER REALLY \ H NEVER TALKED AND HE NEVER TOLD ME About Himself. \ H

47
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,840
But it Feels Like It's TRUE BECAUSE HIS PARSENCE \ H AND BEING INSIDE HIM FELT SO REAL WHILE I \ H

48
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,760
Was Writing It. It was excruciating, it was \ h liberating, it was terrifying, it was maddening. \ H \ h

49
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,200
In Had Moments Where I Was Literally Curled Up \ H IN A BALL, just just weeping. But it was

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Incredible Cathartic. In Always Say, \ H there's a line at the end of the book \ h \ h

51
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
which I don't know if my father \ h say or in say because by the end of writering \ h \ h

52
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06.080
The Book in Didn't Know Who Was Writing \ H It, But The Line Is "Old Man Be Gone" \ H \ H
