Here there will be girls who are going to blind date a guy who sits behind that protection.

And the guy who will be sitting on the other side today, that's Andreas...

-a cartoonist from Malmö.

10

No, it's not. Niklas, it's you.
-Yes!

These are such good pranks. 
-Boom!

We prank. 
-Prank channel.

16
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,860
First we took you there with the camper...
-Yes, yes.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,965
Then Niklas went on it.

18
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,348
Soon he comes in again with an axe and threatens Niklas.

[IN RUN] That's right.

20
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,205
Because those are his chicks.

21
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:58,281
We're going to react to this. 
-Ah.

22
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:02,059
We have no idea how the blind date has gone for Niklas.
-No.

23
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:07,135
Anton who helped film this has edited this as a draft and we'll see how the hell it goes.

24
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:10,032
You and me, Lucas, we...
-Went in and masturbated yes.

25
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:12,290
In another room, so we didn't see this.
-No, how wrong it was.

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,846
On each other.

27
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:18,832
This, shall we say, is a bit of a Fiveish thing and what are the others called...?
-Sidemen

But we hook it, we test. 
-Yes, yes.

Yes, go!

34

So Niklas is newly single.

35
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:40,388
It's funny that Anton cut in that music, because it's like Niklas has never met a girl in his life.

36

00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:11,898
Yeah, yeah, yeah! There will be lots of girls and you should date them.

49
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,722
One of these could be your future wife, Niklas.

Look, the legs just bounce.

55
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:30,503
...and then based on their answer, which is the worst, you say "no, I don't like number three's answer..."

Go away.

57
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:33,518
That's how you send her out.

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,496
If not, I would probably like to do some tennis or padel.

170
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:56,093
I would run something crazy like that with a little pulse, a little Liseberg, Escape Room, that kind of fun.

171
00:07:56,093 --> 00:08:02,703
Ah, eight. That's assuming it's summer, but I like to swim.

172
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:06,157
Everyone speaks Gothenburgska. [GÖTEBORGSKA]"Likes to swim"

173
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,616
...home and watch a horror movie.

174
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:11,814
Number nine. I would have said a classic bar crawl.

175
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:15,354
Just walking around and trying different bars and having drinks.

176
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:18,037
There must be alcohol involved.
-Yes, absolutely.

177
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:21,682
Of these, which one suits you best?

178
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:22,606
Me?

179
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:24,434
Yes, like a first date?

180
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,638
Number 22. 
-Oh, I thought you meant which girl.

181
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,133
[No, no...

182
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,526
[ADDED] You have a smorgasbord in front of you, who do you take?

183
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:37,250
Which date do you think...No, they have said which first date they want to go on,

184
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,074
Which first date do you think sounds nice?

185
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:42,225
So uh...

186
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:44,564
Blue and white and hotel sounded nice.

187
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:48,588
Tell you what. Annie's date, bringing friends along.

188
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:53,954
I think it's great ... because then it's not like "it's just you and me here" but you are a nice bunch.

189
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:57,098
I can laugh with my friend and they can laugh, like that.

190
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:59,302
So that's a great idea.
[Mmm.

191
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:01,509
I like the one about the hotel room.

192
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:06,194
[INAUDIBLE]
-No, you just want to sleep in a freshly made bed.

193
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:07,512
Yes, you do. Is it made up?

194
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:10,251
So a classic pub crawl.
-I have a question then.

195
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:13,823
I think it was number three who said bowling.

196
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:15,872
Is that right?
-I'm very good at it.

197
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,312
I don't have any other questions I think.

198
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:19,958
Number four said billiards. 
-Billiard, okay.

199
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,620
It's fine, it's fine.
-What would you have done on the first date?

200
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,282
It depends on the person you meet, but ideally you do an activity.

201
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,895
Not bowling though, I hate that.

202
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:33,793
I'll start by sending number three home.

203
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:36,018
Oh, I'm sorry. 
-Bowling.

204
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:40,042
She from Helsingborg. 
-So she has taken the car from Helsingborg.

205
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:43,080
Niklas sends her out head first.
-I think it was me who sent her here.

206
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,591
She was so damn excited. I think she was the most excited in the conversation.

207
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:50,006
"It's going to be so fucking fun," she said. 
-Seven hours in the car she sat.

208
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,855
She was in for three seconds.
-Mm.

209
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:55,374
Just because she accidentally said bowling. Thanks anyway!

210
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:57,899
Lucas, you like bowling. 
-Ah.

211
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,751
I'm engaged. 
-It doesn't matter, it's just bowling.

212
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,343
Yes, we can do that. 
[Mmm.

213
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:06,474
I don't mean you should bowl...are you going to bowl with her?

214
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:09,365
Yes?
-Yeah?

215
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:12,269
Hey, hey, hey!
-Hi. Do you regret your choice?

216
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:15,503
Uh...no, I don't.

217
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:17,121
But we'll do the next one.

218
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:20,289
What the hell, Niklas? Damn what sad.
-He looked at her ...

219
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,901
He looks from top to bottom like that.

220
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:25,450
I don't think it was intentional, he was thinking...
-No, it wasn't.

221
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,496
This is what I mean, I think Niklas wants to be a bit harsh here.

222
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,876
That's good.
-That's great.

223
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,852
Oh! That's fucking great.

224
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:36,280
But it's a bit...a bit stiff, isn't it?

225
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,948
Hell no.
-Next.

226
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:42,332
Make your best pick-up line.

227
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:44,186
Oh shit.

228
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:48,197
I only say one basic here but give me another chance on the next one.

229
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:52,889
Are you google? Because you're exactly what I'm looking for.

230
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,067
Okay, well...

231
00:10:55,067 --> 00:11:00,491
When I pick up girls, it's mostly eye contact and "hey, you look nice".

232
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,760
"Maybe you want a shot?"

233
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,925
[SCREAMING]
-What did she say?

234
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:06,862
Was it a pick-up?

235
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:09,034
They are too cute.

236
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:12,343
It was still a bit funny:

237
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:15,381
"Oh I think you're nice, do you want a shot?"

238
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,310
[LAUGHS]
You can't do that everywhere.

239
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,293
Say you're single, someone comes up to you, a pretty girl:

240
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:24,609
[IMAGINED VOICE] "Hey, you look nice, do you want a shot?". You just had: yes!"

241
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:25,993
That would have easily worked. 
-Yeah, yeah!

242
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:28,283
That's really poor. 
-Yeah.

243
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,092
"You look nice, do you want a shot".

244
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:35,040
When she orders two, headbutt her, take her shot too and I have two.

245
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,868
When in the history of the world has a girl walked up to a guy and said "you're pretty, do you want a shot?"?

246
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,000
Does this happen for real?
-Number two has done it tons of times.

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,339
Do you think so?
-Yes, it can happen often.

248
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,128
It feels like you do it if you're really drunk.

249
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:50,242
If I was single, I would be the worst at picking up women.

250
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,736
Incredibly bad.
-Hit on me once.

251
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:55,254
It's crowded now.

252
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:57,146
Sit there.

253
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,803
I'm a bartender. Do you want raw juice?

254
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,141
[BRIGHT VOICE] I'm so fucking horny!

255
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:05,887
[LAUGHTER]
-What did he say?

256
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,881
Horny? What? 
-You're standing with the bartender?

257
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,204
I don't know why...

258
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,465
I thought she was, it's three in the morning...

259
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,041
Let's start again.
-Okay.

260
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,093
Then there was a raw juice for you here.
-Yes, thank you.

261
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:19,383
Well, can I sit down here?

262
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:20,640
[IMAGINED VOICE] Okay.

263
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,259
What did you say?
-Okay.

264
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:28,974
I think you're incredibly beautiful. Your beard, how thick it is.

265
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:32,440
Uh... can I buy you a drink?

266
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,829
Yes, I would like a tequila sunrise.

267
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:37,788
Would you like a tequila sunrise? Is that what she says?

268
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:41,506
Is that the first...? "Would you like something to drink? Yes, a tequila sunrise" [SCREAMS].

269
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,631
I figured she'd like that. Is that Conchita Wurst?
- Mmm.

270
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,766
Imagine your fucking beard. If I met a girl with that beard...

271
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,738
Imagine the beard, but also imagine the cock.

272
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:53,651
Okay....

273
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,596
We are on the second question.
-Number four.

274
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:59,076
Hey cookie, are you standing there crumbling?[FNISS].

275
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:02,141
I can't pick up, sorry, that's why I'm here.

276
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,663
That's a good answer.
-Number five, uh...

277
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:07,748
I also go without words I think, I like eye contact,

278
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:12,004
Preferably long eye contact.

279
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:14,483
Napa -07 then.

280
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:18,152
...chemistry I think, and we'll take it from there.

281
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:23,125
Number six, it's definitely not a pick-up line really.

282
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,678
It's way too corny for me.

283
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:30,529
So it's a little rhyme: roses are red, violets are blue. If I want a birkin - will you buy it?

284
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,142
Oooh.
-Nope, you get a bag in the bargain.

285
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:36,999
Number seven then, I can do a pick-up line.

286
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:41,750
Birkins are expensive as hell, which Lojsan got.

287
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,102
Bag for 400 thousand.
-But it's still charming.

288
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:47,283
I would say that too.

289
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:50,288
First date. Birkin. 
-Ah.

290
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:54,583
Did we go to the same school? Because I could swear we have chemistry.

291
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,587
It was a bit good, wasn't it?
-It was good!

292
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,463
Like, "I've lost my number, can I have yours?"

293
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:03,279
Like that.

294
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,171
I don't have a pick-up line either, I do a lot of eye contact.

295
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:10,528
Maybe a bit boring, but it seems to work anyway.

296
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,968
...or not.
-Who goes?

297
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,283
We know Niklas. Who goes?

298
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:19,399
You know what? "I've lost my number, can I have yours?"

299
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,265
But at least it's a pick-up line.

300
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:24,792
But is it still a bit clever?

301
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:27,727
Yes, it's great, it's a classic pick-up line.

302
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:29,389
I think the fifth will go.

303
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,414
I think the five or the one.

304
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,456
I think the five is because...the others were very funny but she was like that:

305
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:40,417
She felt a bit grown up.
-Very grown up.

306
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:43,258
I think Niklas is looking for something more...
-He likes children.

307
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,623
[REDACTED]

308
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:48,936
I thought they were good, most of them.

309
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:53,301
Then I send...I can't remember which number. Four or five.

310
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,620
Kex-linen.

311
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,655
Well, Denise, nice. 
-It was the other Helsingborg man?

312
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:00,489
Yes, I do.

313
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:02,605
Typical.
-Maybe next time biscuits will work.

314
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:04,796
What do you mean "I do"?
-He changed his mind.

315
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,030
He said yes.

316
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,722
Damn how fast he was there!

317
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:11,759
It felt like a Niklas bride. 
-Same hair color.

318
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,960
Why is everything so fast here?

319
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,074
They don't ask a question except "do you regret your choice?" "Yes!"

320
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:21,885
I think it's nervousness.
-Yeah, nervousness. They just want to get out of there.

321
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:24,131
Appearance-wise?

322
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,775
Blonde, 25 years old, likes to do sports...

323
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:30,205
Gym rat preferably, I like to go to the gym.
-She looked beefy.

324
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:37,068
I like blond guys, I'm not so...the look doesn't matter so much, but a little longer...

325
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,503
Blonde guys.

326
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,629
Does she know it's Niklas on the other side?

327
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,213
We had printed that the guy is blond.

328
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:48,463
Advantage for her. Smart girl though!

329
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:52,030
Taller than me, nice lips and nice eyes. That's important.

330
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:56,353
Number five. Scandinavian look, preferably taller than me. I am 1.71.

331
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:59,973
I think blue eyes are nice.
-Scandinavian look?

332
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:05,147
The fifth person has very clear requirements.
-Yes, preferences.

333
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,080
Could that be why she is single?

334
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,331
You can think what you want, but that limits...
-Very specific.

335
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:14,776
You're limiting most of the world.

336
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:18,182
It feels like she has very high standards.

337
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:23,021
You recognize that in people who are single with too high demands, they never meet anyone. You have to let your guard down a bit.

338
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:26,009
Uppercut. 
-Right in the kidney.

339
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:30,067
I like tall guys, preferably over 1.90. 
-That's where the shit hit the fan.

340
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:33,147
It's a plus, but not a dealbreaker. They are welcome to have brown hair,

341
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:36,147
I have blonde hair myself so I don't think it's as-sexy with someone who looks like me.

342
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:39,192
He will send her now. 
Preferably broad-shouldered.

343
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:40,531
That's also a plus.

344
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:44,890
I'm not that picky, so I would say nice eyes...

345
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,980
Getting a good tan for the summer...tattoos are nice.

346
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,579
It's this classic.

347
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,980
"I'm not that picky...BUT I like nice eyes..."
-"Good pigment, tattoos"

348
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,476
Yes, exactly. [SHOUTING]

349
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:59,729
Money, housing...
-Abs.

350
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:02,512
[ADDED] "Can think about not having a cohabitation agreement"

351
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:03,907
"23 slack"

352
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:06,209
"Contacts..." yes, yes, all that.

353
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,965
I think he will send Annie now, number 6. 
-Me too.

354
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:11,806
That described the opposite of Niklas.

355
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,844
I think he likes number seven.

356
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:15,990
I usually meet short guys, actually, but...

357
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,481
It's nice if they are tall too but,

358
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,965
Blonde or brunette does not matter, but preferably light eyes.

359
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:24,362
And preferably tattoos.

360
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:30,580
Yes, preferably tall guys. Preferably not under 1.80.

361
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,084
Nice eyes, preferably tattoos, and preferably good clothing style too.

362
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,686
I think it's important that he knows how to dress.

363
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:42,299
Hair color has mostly become brunette but that's not very important.

364
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,752
Which number was last?

365
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:46,627
Wow!
-Can I just say one thing?

366
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:50,833
If you're going to talk about height, there is no guy...?

367
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:55,907
If guys would say that they liked tall girls,

368
00:17:55,907 --> 00:18:02,760
Then it's more discriminatory against the girl than it is if girls say that about guys.

369
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,233
Well, yes.
-Do you understand what I mean?

370
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:09,620
You don't impose height requirements on a girl.

371
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,031
But it's fucking done on guys all the time.

372
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:17,569
Isn't it true that the guy shouldn't be shorter than the girl?

373
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,299
That looks like fun.

374
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,848
[Yes, it does...maybe.

375
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:29,718
[FNISS] Isn't that...?
If a girl is 1.90, should she only meet two-meter guys?

376
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,657
Ah exactly.
-Yes, unfortunately.

377
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:36,446
No I'm kidding, it doesn't matter. 
-Well then, that's how it is.

378
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:41,635
But I think it's very common that the girl doesn't want the guy to be shorter.

379
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:45,296
I would have to take notes if I were to sit in there.

380
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:50,310
You liked tall guys, and I don't know if I should expose myself but I'm not over 6 feet tall.

381
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,265
So there's a fucking problem here. 
-You're not that tall, are you?

382
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,615
No, I'm not that tall, no.

383
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:56,333
But it's okay, you don't have to be that tall. As long as you're taller than me, okay?

384
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,367
How tall were you?
-Number one, I'm 1.70.

385
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,925
Maybe you dug your own grave there.

386
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:04,287
Or I'm just kidding, you're fine whatever you are.

387
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,737
What is your type?
-What is my type?

388
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:14,596
I don't have a type whether they are blondes, brunettes, redheads or whatever, it doesn't matter.

389
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:16,573
Preferably shorter than me.

390
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,554
However, I have met people who are as tall as me so it's not very dangerous.

391
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:23,310
But then just...
-He sounds a little nervous.

392
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,584
[HONORING NIKLAS] The guy!

393
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,541
But she seems too nice, number one that is.

394
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,806
She seems incredible.

395
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:32,046
She was a bit late too. 
[HEARING GIRL 1] "Yes I was driving around...dududu"

396
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:37,542
I saw her running around there all over the place...

397
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,867
...and look like this:

398
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,763
"There you are!"

399
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,883
"You can be taller than me, it doesn't matter"

400
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:50,305
If you don't have a sense of humor, then I don't know if we will click.

401
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:53,628
I'm sending you number nine.

402
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:57,947
Hey, hey, hey! Wilma.
-Hi.

403
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,682
Nice to meet you. Do you regret your choice?
-Yes, I do.

404
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:06,197
Is there anything you really don't want to do in bed?

405
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:12,923
Wow!
-Number one. Yes, there are actually quite a lot of things but one thing I absolutely will not do is...

406
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:16,664
That's the second hole. Absolutely not.

407
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:19,157
What's going on?
-This is a bit hard to watch.

408
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:21,955
What the hell is going on?
-No, I need a coffee, I think.

409
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:26,941
[Now that she said the second hole..."Nah I'll have a cup"

410
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:32,152
Damn how sick... I think it was Niklas...
-Yes, it was Niklas who came up with that question.

411
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:34,401
The funny thing was that the day before...

412
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:38,073
It was the same day before the recording, we were in the office going through questions,

413
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:39,963
Then Niklas said: "It must be raw!"

414
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:42,858
[It must be the sickest fucking questions then!
-BDSM.

415
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:46,278
He dug his own grave a bit there.
-Do you want a cup?

416
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,094
Shall we?
-Yes.

417
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:51,384
Then we were back with a cup in hand.

418
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,019
Absolutely not, it's very unpleasant.

419
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,887
Yes, it depends on who it is with,

420
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,507
if it's with someone you're comfortable with,

421
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:03,738
There are some things you might not want to do with someone you're not comfortable with.

422
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:07,800
It depends a little bit but yeah, it's kind of like you said.

423
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,191
Number five. Yes, no fights, no punches, I don't want to take that.

424
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:15,780
And don't give.
-It still feels right-or what?

425
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,806
I'll gladly skip that.

426
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:19,308
Okay, number six.

427
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:23,323
What does she mean? Spanking on...or?
-Yes, but some... some... uh...

428
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,137
Some people drive really hard.

429
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:28,502
But no fight?
-That would have been crazy.

430
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:33,677
[You're sleeping with a girl ...
-I have to take a neck swing at her.

431
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:36,508
No, but it was reasonable.
-Yeah.

432
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,764
So butt sex and fights on the first three.

433
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:45,718
Spontaneously, I feel uncomfortable answering this question because I haven't seen you yet.

434
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,769
A bit early stage.

435
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:50,794
There are things I don't like, but...

436
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:54,678
You'll find out if you're so lucky, I think.

437
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:58,148
Number seven then...you have to explore it a bit yourself.
-Good answer.

438
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:00,562
But I would never do anal.

439
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,406
[GIRL]Anal? Nope.

440
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,836
Feet go away. No foot fetish here.

441
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:08,616
Those were exciting answers.

442
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:11,987
I'm sending number six home.

443
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:14,381
Ow...ow.

444
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:19,108
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Annie. Do you regret it?
-Yes, I do.

445
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:23,260
But I think like this: ouch....woww.

446
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,870
I thought Niklas would be tough and say that he doesn't regret his choice all the time.

447
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,622
He regrets all but the first one. 
-Yeah, no, that was a bit...

448
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:35,681
But Annie's answer was good.

449
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:36,989
Annie's answer...but,

450
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,067
It was: "if you are lucky".

451
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,587
But maybe it wasn't a straight answer either.

452
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:44,149
Because the others were really: "I don't like this".

453
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:46,627
Is it possible that Niklas does not appreciate butt sex either?

454
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:48,700
We slept together in Berlin ...

455
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,804
Yes, that's right.

456
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:52,374
Then he took...
-Then he was the one who was on you.

457
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:56,001
No, it was us who slept together.
-Oskar.

458
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,634
[MUMBLES] Yes...

459
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:03,605
Who is your Swedish free pass? A celebrity in Sweden.

460
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:10,285
How many will say Joel Kinnaman...Zlatan? 
-Zlatan I don't think anyone will say.

461
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,028
You don't think so?
-No.

462
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:14,492
Isn't he handsome?
- Well...

463
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:19,039
I don't think you think of Zlatan as a free pass. Or do you?
- Yes, I think so.

464
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,185
Many people probably do.

465
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:21,809
Joel Kinnaman, Zlatan or Persbrandt.

466
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,343
One of them will come up. 
-I think it's one of the Skarsgård guys.

467
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:29,888
Bill Skarsgård can probably come up. I think someone says that too.
-He is not ugly. I think so too.

468
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:33,072
I'm loyal, so there are no free passes for me, to be honest.

469
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:38,807
But since I am single, I would say Viktor Leksell. He is nice.

470
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,593
He is handsome.

471
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:45,087
Number two yes, I have one and his name is Oliver Strige.

472
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:47,353
No but what? Strige!
-Va!

473
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:49,671
Are you kidding me!
-Strige!

474
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,321
What the hell...
-But wait, isn't that a bit too reasonable?

475
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:54,568
Isn't that a bit too close...?

476
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:59,254
Well he is from Gothenburg...but we are talking about Zlatan and Skarsgård and...

477
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,643
Strige?
[Yes?!

478
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:07,377
The funny thing is that both Viktor and Strige are from Gothenburg. They have their free passes in the same city!
-In the same city yes.

479
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:09,000
It's freezing cold.

480
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,251
We can say that we know Oliver Strige very well.

481
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:15,307
It was a bit funny that he was mentioned.
-Yes, it was a bit ...

482
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:17,620
But he's not ugly. He's gorgeous.

483
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,192
Really, but also very busy.

484
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:22,651
That's how it happened.

485
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:28,620
Number five. Well... Danny Saucedo, he's nice to look at.

486
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,195
I wouldn't get a free pass either, but Joel Kinnaman...

487
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,551
He doesn't live in Sweden but he is Swedish.

488
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:38,365
Eight. Benjamin Ingrosso.

489
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:40,173
Wow! Yes, of course.

490
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:43,094
Yes, feline. Who is your free pass?
-Are you kidding?

491
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:45,656
Bianca Ingrosso then.
[FNISS] I knew it!

492
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,242
Then we match a little.
-Okay,

493
00:24:47,242 --> 00:24:53,414
I choose to send home...I think it was number five.

494
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:57,513
Danny Saucedo?
-No! Then I send home the one that was before.

495
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:00,808
No, no, no, no! He switched. 
-Are you sorry?

496
00:25:00,808 --> 00:25:02,185
Uh, no, I don't.

497
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:07,019
[OUTRAGED] No, but I can't do that!
-"Ah okay..."

498
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,306
Everyone is very nice and cute.
[ADDED] In their own way!

499
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:13,171
I think everyone is beautiful!
-Yeah, but...

500
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:17,853
He has to be honest.
-He can't say he's sorry to all of them.

501
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:21,129
It makes your heart hurt a bit.
-Yeah.

502
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:23,643
Such a sad old man...
-No! Was she sad there?

503
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:25,104
Yeah, well...

504
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:30,142
What is your favorite body part in a partner?

505
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,098
Obviously, the heart is the most important for me.

506
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:37,798
But otherwise to look at outside the face then...
[FNISS] The cock.

507
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,640
I would say stomach. Or back.

508
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,405
Number five.
-Beer belly.

509
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:48,736
If you don't choose the face, it might be...hands.

510
00:25:48,736 --> 00:25:50,300
Arms and hands.

511
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,920
Same here if you can't say face then it's probably hands or back.

512
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,171
Number eight.

513
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:03,289
So we didn't say you couldn't say face, so I will say eyes and hands I think.

514
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:06,442
Pretty straightforward answers. 
-What is your favorite part of the girl then?

515
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:11,226
My favorite body part...I have a weakness for nice legs.

516
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:13,344
May I say...mm.

517
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,576
Did he say smooth legs?
-No, fine.

518
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:20,171
I will unfortunately send number five home.

519
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:22,902
"I have a weakness for smooth legs..."
-Hi, Ella.

520
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:24,675
Hey, Ella.
-Do you regret your choice?

521
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:26,809
No, I do not. 
-Okay [FNISS]

522
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:31,101
Niklas!
-What is your fetish?

523
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:34,379
Three left now.
-If you have any.

524
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:38,245
Number one here. To be honest, I don't really have a fetish.

525
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:43,782
I can think it's nice when you're lying in bed and someone is behind you breathing down your neck.

526
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:45,608
But it's not a fetish, I don't have one.

527
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:48,352
Like this. Look there.

528
00:26:48,352 --> 00:26:49,700
[SILENCE]

529
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,814
Did you get the goose?
- Yes, it was...

530
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:54,847
Don't have a fetish either. Number seven, by the way.

531
00:26:54,847 --> 00:27:01,393
But if I must say something, when the guy is good at taking command, have some good confidence.

532
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:04,027
[Now you do the dishes, I tell you!

533
00:27:04,027 --> 00:27:07,360
[And then...

534
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,816
[SKRATT] And after that you cook or!

535
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:15,283
And then we jump in the chamber!

536
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:16,222
A bit of hubris perhaps.

537
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:22,775
Number eight. My students will see this...when you're a bit rough maybe.
-Teacher?

538
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:27,096
What the hell...why are you looking at the camera like that?

539
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:28,284
When you said that.
-Is she a teacher?

540
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:31,526
["My pupils will see this...a bit harsh perhaps?"

541
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,917
She's not a kindergarten teacher, is she?

542
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:37,687
[No, I don't know that...
-But she is a teacher, you know.

543
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:41,168
Okay, are you going to start this then?

544
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:46,076
Ah...
-A little too hard.

545
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:48,110
Not so hard.
-Are you with me?

546
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,754
Niklas was giggling!
-Dududu...so!

547
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:59,605
Nice!
-Shiiiiit.

548
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:08,268
This is hard, but I'm sending it home...breathing down my neck there.

549
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,403
One.

550
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:12,409
"Breathing in the neck"...

551
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:17,560
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Pamela. Do you regret it?
-Yes, I do.

552
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,555
I'm sure we'll see you some other day.
-Yes, I'm sure we will.

553
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:25,341
What would it take for your parents to...
-Come on now!

554
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:28,099
He's a little sweetheart.

555
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:31,277
I rewind a bit.
-Winga Niklas!

556
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:34,725
What does it take for your parents to like me?

557
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:42,668
Big dick.
-Okay number seven then. I think it's like, you treat me well and have a good job kind of thing.

558
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:45,168
Dad is like that: "good job".

559
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:50,712
The most important thing for me is that my nephews like you.

560
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:54,222
And if you are good with children, you go home.
-Good answer.

561
00:28:54,222 --> 00:28:58,734
But my mom, she is very easy like that.

562
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:02,131
So humor, kind of.

563
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:05,436
But the most important thing is that my siblings like you.

564
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,000
I heard something about nephew, wants to have children I think?

565
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,143
Right! No, I said...

566
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:15,329
I don't know what you look like ...
[LAUGHS]

567
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:19,674
Oh, he misinterpreted!
-He hasn't heard her.

568
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:24,146
"Want a baby? I don't know what the hell you look like?"

569
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:26,735
Like that's the problem. They don't know each other.

570
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:31,656
She was just talking about how...how wrong it was. 
-Brorson.

571
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:37,389
So it's most important if my brother's children, my nephews like you.

572
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,801
I spend a lot of time with them.

573
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:42,138
They are a very big part of my family as well.

574
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:45,597
So you are a family-oriented person?
-Yes.

575
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,805
It's important, it's good.

576
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:53,173
First, what did you say again?
-I said that my dad likes a guy with a good sense of humor.

577
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:56,322
My mom is pretty easy to get along with,

578
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:57,458
She changed now!
-Did she say that?

579
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,201
She said daddy said good job, right?
-Yes exactly!

580
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:04,331
"Good job and treat me with respect," she said.

581
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:07,741
And just because she changed and family "yes humor, family, mother..."

582
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:11,501
[ADDED] Yes and that everyone is together and safe in the family!

583
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:16,141
And that you like your brother's children. She has no nephews.
-I'm a bit of a family girl.

584
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:20,083
Changes completely. 
[ADDED] -And I love short blonde guys...so.

585
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:24,513
I have dogs so it's important that they like you.

586
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:27,280
But they're nice, so that...
-How many?

587
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,513
My dog just bit his pants.

588
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:32,483
I have made my choice.

589
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:37,630
I send the dogs home there, number seven.

590
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,705
He doesn't want dogs.
-I like cats.

591
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:43,721
Hey, hey, hey! Hanna. Do you regret it?
-Uh, no.

592
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:48,379
[SCREAMS]
-She was a bit shocked?

593
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,759
She couldn't take it.

594
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,282
"Do you regret it? No. [DRAMATIC INHALATION]"

595
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,357
What happened there?

596
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:54,572
He said he had no regrets.
-She was shocked.

597
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:58,226
Didn't you see the look on her face?
-Take it again, what the hell happened there?

598
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,005
Hey, hey, hey! Hanna. Do you regret it?

599
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:03,866
Uh, no.
[SHOCKED SOUND]

600
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:06,687
[DRAMATIC SOUND] Aaah!

601
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:09,011
Starting to run around...[SCREAM]

602
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:11,792
"Do you regret it? No. [DRAMATIC SOUND]"

603
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:14,072
[LOUD NOISE]
-She couldn't take it.

604
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:18,398
Damn, she expected him to say yes, maybe.

605
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,294
There's only one left.

606
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:26,468
No... that's not good. It will be such a big reveal now.

607
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:31,910
There is only one left now, so let's see who it is.

608
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,848
Hi, Angelica.
-Niklas, do you get a hug?

609
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:34,622
Yes, I'd love to.
-Hi.

610
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:36,377
"Yes, I'd love to"

611
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:39,548
I was so nervous, I thought I would be working today!

612
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:41,066
I'm completely shaky.

613
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,941
Niklas thought there would be another guy there.

614
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:46,693
I called an Andreas...

615
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:48,550
You really went like this and I thought "damn that's rude".

616
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,322
It was because Lucas told me not to look at the girls.

617
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,119
I was like: "why not look at the girls?"

618
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,773
Our employees are not allowed to look at the chicks.

619
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:59,615
What was your name again?
-Angelica.

620
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:01,429
Angelica. And where are you from? 
-Alingsås.

621
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,881
And how old are you?
-I'm 22.

622
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,535
And what about you?
-24, turning 25.

623
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:08,580
They said slightly different ages.

624
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,679
I know, they were just trying to trick me.
-26,25, 24...

625
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:15,140
I mean, I was fooled.
-They were fooled.

626
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,882
Are we doing the outro today or what?
-Yes!

627
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:18,871
You can do an outro.
-Thank you for watching!

628
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:22,359
Have a good time! Now it's a date, sort of.

629
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,552
One left, and you have to marry her.

630
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:37,313
