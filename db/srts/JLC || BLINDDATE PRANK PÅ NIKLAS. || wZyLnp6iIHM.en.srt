1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good morning!

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:08,225
Goood morning!
 -God morning, good morning, good morning

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:10,950
[Singing] "Good morning world, here I come!"

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,639
Oh what an echo it is!
 [Vocalizes]

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,021
"B-B-B-B-Borka B-B-Borka" [vocalizes]

6
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:22,553
Welcome to you should be to today's section where we run blind dating.

7
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:28,155
Here will be girls who are going to blind dating a guy sitting behind that protection

8
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:31,681
And the guy who will sit on the other side today, it's Andreas-

9
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,691
-A tictoker from Malmö.

10
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:36,886
Well it is not.
 Niklas, it's you.
 -Yes!

11
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:39,777
You're going to blind dating today.

12
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:41,422
You are the one who is going to sit there.
 -Japp.

13
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:43,605
[Silent laughter]

14
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:45,736
This is so good pranks.
 -Boom!

15
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:48,722
We prank.
 -Prank channel.

16
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,860
First we took you there with the camper ... -Yes yes.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,965
Then Niklas went on it.

18
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:54,348
Soon he will come in again with an ax and threatens Niklas.

19
00:00:54,348 --> 00:00:55,042
[In chorus] just that.

20
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,205
Because it's his brides.

21
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:58,281
We will react to this.
 -Ah.

22
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:02,059
We have no idea how the blind dating has gone for Niklas.
 -No.

23
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:07,135
Anton who helped film this has cut this together as a draft and we will see how the hell is.

24
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:10,032
You and I, Lucas, we ... -went in and masturbated yes.

25
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:12,290
In another room, so we didn't see this.
 -No what it was wrong.

26
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,846
On each other.

27
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:18,832
This, we may say is a little fiveish thing and what are the others called ...?
 -Sidemen

28
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:20,795
But we hook it up, we test.
 -Yes Yes.

29
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:23,710
They are so damn awesome at it so we, we test.

30
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,452
[Casted Voice] Fucking Copycat, that is.

31
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,417
Check out Nikla's reaction now.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,381
No No Niklas.

33
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:33,465
Yes, drive!

34
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:35,467
So Niklas is a new single.

35
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:40,388
It's fun that Anton cut that music, because it's like Niklas never met a girl in his life

36
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:42,934
[Laughter] It sounded like Jönsson League.

37
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,711
[Hums]

38
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:48,099
Isn't it also like he is very happy and tear -eyed?

39
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,949
[Made up] "Should I?"

40
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,616
Have bought a car for Niklas.

41
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,821
You need to date.

42
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,609
Should I go on blind dating?

43
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:57,514
Do you know what the fun is?
 Niklas has been involved in writing the questions.

44
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,525
[Himmar Niklas] "We must have really sick fucking questions!"

45
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:04,237
So Niklas, you can settle down there.

46
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:06,168
Anton will soon come and film all this.

47
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,668
What should ....?

48
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:11,898
Yes!
 There will be lots of girls and you will date them.

49
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,722
One of these could be your future wife, Niklas.

50
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,365
I'm in shock ...

51
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,641
Sit there.
 -Do I do this?

52
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:19,728
I was sweating now.
 [Out of picture] Yes.

53
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:22,724
This is how it will work now: you ask these questions ...

54
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:25,076
Now check, the legs just bounce.

55
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:30,503
... and then based on their response, which is the worst, so you say "No, number Tres answers I don't like ..."

56
00:02:30,503 --> 00:02:31,888
Disappear.

57
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:33,518
How to send her out.

58
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:37,317
So there is one left, and you have to marry it.

59
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:40,217
Oh, he jerks.

60
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:44,045
[Laughter, nonsense sound]

61
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:46,374
He couldn't keep up.
 [LAUGH]

62
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,056
Looked like he was standing and toxin.
 -No, but he probably did.

63
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:50,198
Now comes the brides.
 -I just have to check.

64
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:51,496
What happened there?

65
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,355
[Laughter] does he piss?

66
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:55,570
Here comes the brides yes.

67
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,250
Here they come.

68
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,010
[Expectant music] -I can't cope.

69
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,456
He couldn't stay for three minutes.

70
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:04,568
Down there is Annie, she may recognize from Tiktok.

71
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:05,969
Also from Kungsbacka.

72
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,020
So is Niklas.

73
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,224
What the hell?

74
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,449
My name is Pamela, I am 20 years old and live in Stenungsund at the moment.

75
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,769
Hello!
 Vanessa, 22, from Alingsås.

76
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,791
Caroline, 24 from Helsingborg.

77
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,450
Denise, 22 years old from Helsingborg.

78
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,449
Ellen, 24, lives here in Gothenburg.

79
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:29,654
Vilma, 23, comes from Gävle but lives in Gothenburg.

80
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:33,753
Angelica, but my friends say Angie, 22 years old and is from Alingsås.

81
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:35,196
Hanna, 20 ...

82
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,366
Angie?
 Doesn't anyone say?
 Are they saying Angie?

83
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:40,334
Isn't it more difficult to say?

84
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:41,993
I usually call Jolie it ...

85
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:44,374
Who is Jolie?
 Angelina Jolie?

86
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,388
Angelina Jolie.

87
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:48,518
From Tranemo huh?

88
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,850
No!
 Ambjörnarp.

89
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,100
Ljungsarp.
 -Ljungsarp.

90
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,581
Before moving to Hollywood.

91
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,763
From Stenungsund.

92
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:56,532
And Annie, 23 from Gothenburg.

93
00:03:56,532 --> 00:03:58,707
Okay, should I ask the first question?

94
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,413
What does our first date look like?

95
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,021
It was a very good question.

96
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:05,789
Activity.
 Feel free to find something ...

97
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,845
Then maybe go ... -Why looks Niklas so damn angry?

98
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:11,026
So: [laughter]

99
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:15,036
No, but check, this is not a tagged date.

100
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,317
[Added] “Vafan do you say”

101
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,516
[Added] "Activity, are you stupid in ..."

102
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:22,959
Do you know what the fun is?
 I think Niklas decided to be hard from the beginning.

103
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,020
I do not know what it is.

104
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,993
[Niklas says something outside the room] -Ye?

105
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:29,457
What did you say Niklas?

106
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:30,976
He is outside and panic now.

107
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:34,143
[Niklas] She fucking bitten my pants ...

108
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:37,189
A little funfact: He has brought one of the brides to the office now because they are together.

109
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,358
She is completely crazy and has broken his pants.

110
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,001
Has she broken her pants?
 -Angie?

111
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,244
Try to leave her.
 -She just jumps around.

112
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,494
Oh damn.
 -It's always so at the beginning of a relationship Niklas.

113
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:50,349
Was it Angie he talked about?
 -Yes.

114
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:54,187
Damn.
 Now Stella has bitten..Ah ...

115
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:55,867
She can't calm down ...

116
00:04:55,867 --> 00:05:00,244
Eat and eat, that's what I had to give.
 -I would say we sit down at a bar.

117
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:04,078
Then we run a blue and white match at Ullevi.

118
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:12,044
Then maybe if it gets a little, ah ... feeling then maybe you go to a hotel room.

119
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,014
Have a little good or so maybe.

120
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:18,284
What did you say?
 -A bar, blue and white and then hotel room?

121
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,445
Damn ... what a fucking date.

122
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,174
What does she mean by that?

123
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:25,235
Hotel room ... isn't it prayed there?
 -They have bedded?

124
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:27,899
Do you care if it is bedded or not?
 What are you saying?

125
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,006
It is well bedded for ... sex?

126
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:32,252
[Made] but hotel rooms, is there a flat-screen TV?

127
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:37,533
[Talking in the mouth] -It is bedded for it ...

128
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,970
[Himmar Lucas] hotel room, then it is bedded ...

129
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,933
It is very straightforward if you say so.
 -Do you never stay in a hotel?

130
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,657
Have they bedded there or?
 -It's sheet and everything then or?

131
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:48,270
Blue -white and ... damn what she was driving there.
 -Do you know what I think too?

132
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,389
You must have a pretty good budget on that date.

133
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,051
After all, several thousand go there.

134
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:56,317
I would say that ...

135
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,648
He is skeptical!

136
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:01,116
[Laughs] Blue White ... hotel room ...

137
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:03,030
Everyone gets giggled and Niklas will be so:

138
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,866
[LAUGH]

139
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, when we drive.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,112
That we play paddle or bowels,

141
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:13,102
And then out and eat but there will be no hotel room first ...

142
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:15,488
Okay number four.

143
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:18,628
We would sit down on some shy hook, take a bee,

144
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,968
And maybe play billiards afterwards.
 Casual as well.

145
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:26,718
Number five.
 No, but I think we go to some cool bar,

146
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,521
And order ... are they alcoholics?

147
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:33,191
Hole bunch?
 -Why does it look like Niklas wants to shoot himself in the head every time they answer?

148
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,741
He is backwards.
 He doesn't want to talk about alcohol.

149
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:38,056
Why doesn't he smile?

150
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:40,140
He looks very happy.
 -He is nervous.

151
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,225
Look at him.
 -He is nervous yes.

152
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,780
He sweats.
 -Or is this Niklas when he's happy?

153
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,585
... orders drinks for each other.
 A little fun to see what you have for a drink the first date I think.

154
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:53,793
Number six.
 I'm probably thinking ... -
 Drink flavor?

155
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:58,339
So, I order a Bloody Mary for you.

156
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:03,248
Well, it's not that it's an ice .. -Then it must be really sick drinks.

157
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:07,950
It is if anyone pulls ten Long Island, then maybe you are like this "you and I" but about anyone ...

158
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,921
But if anyone chooses gin and tonic or rum and cola ...

159
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:15,892
No, but then I drink drinks ... -Va?
 [Giggle]

160
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:19,009
No, but I just drink if there is bedded.

161
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,679
No, but I don't date girls who don't drink Jägermeister.

162
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:24,723
No, but I'm the opposite.
 They don't drink joluca ...

163
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:27,538
Oh!
 How lucky you had the lid on Calle.

164
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:29,090
Damn ...

165
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,383
Oh ... then Lucas had to clean here.

166
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:35,077
Should we let it go a bit now?
 Damn what we pause.

167
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:38,595
Group dating with some of my friends and some of yours.

168
00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:42,460
Either go out and take some drinks and maybe go out to the club,

169
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,496
If not, I probably would have liked to drive some tennis or paddle.

170
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:56,093
I had driven something sick so with a little pulse, a little Liseberg, Escape Room, such a fucking fun.

171
00:07:56,093 --> 00:08:02,703
Ah, eight.
 It is assumed then it is summer, but I enjoy bathing.

172
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:06,157
Everyone speaks Gothenburg.
 [Gothenburg] "Likes and Bath"

173
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,616
... home and watch a horror movie.

174
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:11,814
Number nine.
 I had probably said a classic bar round.

175
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:15,354
Just walk around and test different bars and drink drinks.

176
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:18,037
It must be alcohol involved.
 -Yes absolutely.

177
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:21,682
Of these then, which one suits you best?

178
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:22,606
Me?

179
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:24,434
Yes, as the first date as well?

180
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,638
Number 22. -Yeah, I thought you meant what a girl.

181
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,133
[Laughter] No, no ...

182
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,526
[Made] You have a sandwich table in front of you, who do you take?

183
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:37,250
Which date do you think ... no, they have said what first date they want to go,

184
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,074
Which first date do you think sounds nice?

185
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:42,225
So eh ...

186
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:44,564
Blue -white and hotels sounded najs.

187
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:48,588
You know what.
 Annie's date, that you bring poles.

188
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:53,954
Think it is great ... because then it will not be so "it is just you and me here" but you are a good bunch.

189
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:57,098
I can tan with my polar bear and they can tan, so.

190
00:08:57,098 --> 00:08:59,302
So it is a top idea.
 [In chorus] mmm.

191
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:01,509
I like it with the hotel room.

192
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:06,194
[Inaudible] -No you just want to sleep in a newly bedded bed.

193
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:07,512
Yes.
 Is it bedded?

194
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:10,251
So a classic pub round.
 -I have a question then.

195
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:13,823
I think it was number three who said bowla.

196
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:15,872
Is it true?
 -I'm shit on it.

197
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,312
I have no other questions I think.

198
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:19,958
Number four said billiards.
 -Tiljar, okay.

199
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,620
It's fine, that's fine.
 -What did you do on the first date?

200
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,282
It depends on the person you meet, but preferably you do an activity.

201
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,895
Not bowling though, I hate.

202
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:33,793
Then I start by sending home number three.

203
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:36,018
Unfortunately.
 -Bowling.

204
00:09:36,018 --> 00:09:40,042
She from Helsingborg.
 -Hon has thus taken the car from Helsingborg.

205
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:43,080
Niklas sends her out with her head before.
 -I think it was I who sent her here.

206
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,591
She was so damn tagged.
 I think she was the most tagged in the conversation.

207
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:50,006
"It's going to be so damn fun," she said.
 -Seven hours in the car she sat.

208
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,855
She was in for three seconds.
 -Mm.

209
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:55,374
Just because she happened to say bowling.
 Thanks anyway!

210
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:57,899
Lucas, you like to bowl.
 -Ah.

211
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:01,751
I am engaged.
 -It doesn't matter, it's just bowling.

212
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,343
Yes we can do that.
 [In chorus] mmm.

213
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:06,474
I don't mean to bowl ... are you going to bowl with her?

214
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:09,365
Yes?
 -Yeah?
 [LAUGH]

215
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:12,269
Hello!
 -Hello.
 Do you regret your choice?

216
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:15,503
Eh ... no I don't.

217
00:10:15,503 --> 00:10:17,121
But we drive next.

218
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:20,289
What the hell Niklas?
 Damn what sad.
 -He looked at her ...

219
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,901
He checks from the top down.

220
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:25,450
I don't think that was the point, he thought ... -No it wasn't.

221
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,496
This is what I mean, I think Niklas wants to be a little hard here.

222
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,876
It is good.
 -That's really good.

223
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,852
Oh!
 That's damn good.

224
00:10:32,852 --> 00:10:36,280
But it's a little ... a bit stiff huh?

225
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,948
No, fuck.
 -Next.

226
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:42,332
Drag your best ragging replica.

227
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:44,186
Oh fuck.

228
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:48,197
I just say a basic here but give me one more chance then on the next.

229
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:52,889
Are you google?
 Because you are exactly everything I am looking for.

230
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,067
Okay...

231
00:10:55,067 --> 00:11:00,491
When I pick up the most eye contact and so "hey how nice you are".

232
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,760
"Maybe you want a shot?"

233
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,925
[Laughter] -What did she say?

234
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:06,862
Was it ragging?

235
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:09,034
They are too cute.

236
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:12,343
It was still a bit of fun so:

237
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:15,381
"Ah I think you're fine, do you want a shot?"

238
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:18,310
[Laughter] You can't do that everywhere.

239
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,293
Say you are single, someone comes up to you, a cute girl:

240
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:24,609
[CONTAINED VOOK] "Hello you're fine, you want a shot".
 You just had: Yes! "

241
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:25,993
It had easily worked.
 -Yes Yes!

242
00:11:25,993 --> 00:11:28,283
It's shit charming.
 -Yes.

243
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,092
"You're fine, you want a shot".

244
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:35,040
When she ordered two, peel her, take her shot too, I got two.

245
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,868
When in world history a girl has gone to a guy and said "you're fine, do you want a shot?"?

246
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,000
Does it really happen?
 -Number two has done it a lot of times.

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,339
Do you think so?
 -Yes that can probably happen often.

248
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,128
It feels like you do it if you are properly packed.

249
00:11:47,128 --> 00:11:50,242
Had I been single, I would have been the worst at picking up.

250
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,736
Incredibly bad.
 -Rag me once.

251
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:55,254
It's a penny now.

252
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:57,146
Sit there.

253
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,803
I am a bartender.
 Should you have raw juice?

254
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,141
[Light voice] I'm so damn horny!

255
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:05,887
[Laughter] -What did he say?

256
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,881
Horny?
 Huh?
 -You stand with the bartender?

257
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,204
I do not know why...

258
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,465
I thought she was there, it is three o'clock at night ...

259
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,041
We start over.
 -Okay.

260
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,093
Then it was a raw juice for you here.
 -Yes thank you.

261
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:19,383
Well can yes beat me down here?

262
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:20,640
[CONSIDERED VOOK] Okay.

263
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,259
What did you say?
 -Okay.

264
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:28,974
I think you are incredibly nice.
 Your beard, how thick it is.

265
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:32,440
Eh ... may I offer something to drink?

266
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,829
Yes, I want a tequila sunrise.

267
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:37,788
Do you want a tequila Sunrise?
 Does she say so?

268
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:41,506
Is that the first thing ...?
 "Do you want something to drink? Yes a Tequila Sunrise" [laughs to]

269
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,631
I thought she likes it.
 Is it Conchita Wurst?
 - Mmm.

270
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,766
Imagine your fucking beard.
 Had I met a girl with that beard ...

271
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,738
Imagine what a beard, but also think which cock.

272
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:53,651
Okay....

273
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,596
We are on the second question.
 -Number four.

274
00:12:56,596 --> 00:12:59,076
Tjena biscuit, do you stand there and crumble? [Giggle]

275
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:02,141
I can't pick up unfortunately, that's why I'm here.

276
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,663
That was a good answer.
 -Number five, eh ...

277
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:07,748
I also run without words I think, I like eye contact,

278
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:12,004
Preferably long eye contact.

279
00:13:12,004 --> 00:13:14,483
Napa -07 thus.

280
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:18,152
... chemistry I think, then we take the talk from there.

281
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:23,125
Number six, there is absolutely no ragging replica really.

282
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,678
It's just too "corny" I think.

283
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:30,529
So it's a small rhyme: roses are red, violets are blue.
 If I want a Birkin- do you buy it then?

284
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,142
Oooh.
 -Najs, then you got a bag on the purchase.

285
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:36,999
Number seven then, I can run a ragging replica.

286
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:41,750
Birkin is a piss -expensive, which Loy got.

287
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,102
Bag for 400 thousand.
 -Yeah it's still charming.

288
00:13:45,102 --> 00:13:47,283
I would say that too.

289
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:50,288
First date.
 Birkin.
 -Ah.

290
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:54,583
Did we go to the same school?
 Because I can swear that we have chemistry.

291
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,587
It was a bit good huh?
 -It was good!

292
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:01,463
So kind of so: "I've lost my number, can I have yours?"

293
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:03,279
So so.

294
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,171
I also have no ragging replica, I run a lot of eye contact.

295
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:10,528
Maybe a little boring, but it seems to work anyway.

296
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,968
...or not.
 -Wh that goes?

297
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:15,283
We know Niklas.
 Who is going?

298
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:19,399
Do you know what? "I've lost my number, can I have yours?"

299
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,265
But at least it is a ragging replica.

300
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:24,792
But is it a little smart anyway?

301
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:27,727
Yes it is great, it is a classic ragging replica.

302
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:29,389
I think five people go.

303
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:33,414
I think five or one.

304
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:37,456
I think five is for ... the others were very laughing but she was like that:

305
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:40,417
She felt a little adult.
 -Very adult.

306
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:43,258
I think Niklas is looking for something more ... -He likes children.

307
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,623
[LAUGH]

308
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:48,936
I thought they were good, most.

309
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:53,301
Then I send ... I can't remember what number.
 Four or five.

310
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,620
The biscuit line.

311
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,655
Well, Denise, nice.
 -It was the second Helsingborg citizen?

312
00:14:58,655 --> 00:15:00,489
Yes I do.

313
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:02,605
Typical.
 -Nelest time maybe biscuits work.

314
00:15:02,605 --> 00:15:04,796
What "I do"?
 -He regretted.

315
00:15:04,796 --> 00:15:06,030
He said yes.

316
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,722
Damn how fast he was there!

317
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:11,759
It felt like a Niklas bride.
 -Ioke hair color.

318
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,960
Why is everything going so fast here?

319
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,074
They ask no question except "Do you regret your choice?"
 "yes!"

320
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:21,885
I think it's nervousness.
 -Yes, nervousness.
 They just want to go from there.

321
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:24,131
Appearance?

322
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,775
Blonde, 25 years, like to sport ...

323
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:30,205
Gym cod preferably, I like to work out.
 -She looked stiff.

324
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:37,068
I like blonde guys, so I'm not so ... the look doesn't matter that much, but a little long-

325
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,503
Blonde guys.

326
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:41,629
Does she know that it is Niklas on the other side?

327
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,213
We had printed that the guy is blonde.

328
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:48,463
Advantage for her.
 Smart girl anyway!

329
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:52,030
Longer than me, nice lips and nice eyes.
 It is important.

330
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:56,353
Number five.
 Scandinavian look, preferably longer than me.
 I'm 1.71.

331
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:59,973
Blue eyes I think is nice.
 -Scandinavian appearance?

332
00:15:59,973 --> 00:16:05,147
Femman has very clear requirements.
 -Yes, preferences.

333
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,080
Could that be why she is single?

334
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,331
You have to think what you want, but it limits ... -very specifically.

335
00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:14,776
You limit most of the world.

336
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:18,182
It feels like she has very high demands.

337
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:23,021
You recognize that in people who are singles with too high demands, they never meet anyone.
 You have to lower the garden a little.

338
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:26,009
Uppercut.
 -Red in the kidney.

339
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:30,067
I like long guys, preferably over 1.90.
 -There it happened.

340
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:33,147
It's a plus, but no dealbreaker.
 They may like to have brown hair,

341
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:36,147
I have blond hair myself so don't think it's as-sexy with someone who looks like me.

342
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:39,192
He will send her now.
 -Thered broad -axled.

343
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:40,531
It is also a plus at the edge.

344
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:44,890
I'm not so picky, so I would say nice eyes ...

345
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,980
Get a good burn for the summer ... tattoos are najs.

346
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,579
It is this classic.

347
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,980
"I'm not so picky ... but preferably nice eyes ..." -"Good pigment, tattoos"

348
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,476
Yes exactly.
 [LAUGH]

349
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:59,729
Money, housing ... -Abs.

350
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:02,512
[Added] "can imagine skipping cohabitation agreements"

351
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:03,907
"23 Slak"

352
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:06,209
"Contacts ..." Yes, just that.

353
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,965
I think he will send Annie now, number 6. -I

354
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:11,806
It described the opposite of Niklas.

355
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,844
I think he likes number seven.

356
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:15,990
I usually meet short guys, actually, but ...

357
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,481
It is nice if they are long too but,

358
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,965
Blonde or brunette does not matter, but preferably bright eyes.

359
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:24,362
And preferably tattoos.

360
00:17:24,362 --> 00:17:30,580
Yes, preferably some tall guys.
 Preferably not below 1.80.

361
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,084
Nice eyes, preferably tattoos, and preferably good clothing style too.

362
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:37,686
I think it is important that he can dress.

363
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:42,299
Hair color has probably become brunette but it is not very important.

364
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,752
Which number was the last?

365
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:46,627
Oh!
 -Do I just say a thing?

366
00:17:46,627 --> 00:17:50,833
If you want to talk about this with length, then there is no guy ...

367
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:55,907
If guys would say they liked tall girls,

368
00:17:55,907 --> 00:18:02,760
Then it becomes more discriminatory to the girl than it is if girls say so about guys.

369
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,233
Yes.
 -Are you involved in what I mean?

370
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:09,620
You do not set length requirements on a girl.

371
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,031
But it is done fanimej on guys all the time.

372
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:17,569
Is it that the guy should not be shorter than the girl huh?

373
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:19,299
It looks fun.

374
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,848
[Laugh to] Yes it does ... maybe.

375
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:29,718
[Giggly] isn't that ...?
 -If a girl is 1.90, should she only meet two -meter guys then?

376
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,657
Ah exactly.
 -Yes unfortunately.

377
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:36,446
No, I'm kidding, it doesn't matter.
 -Yes then it will be.

378
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:41,635
But I think it is very common for the girl not to want the guy to be shorter.

379
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:45,296
I would have had to take notes if I were to sit in there.

380
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:50,310
You liked long guys, and I don't know if I'm going to expos myself but I'm not over 1.80.

381
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,265
So there will be a damn problem here.
 -You aren't that tall or?

382
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,615
No I'm not that long, no.

383
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:56,333
But it's okay, you don't have to be so long.
 Only you are longer than me, okay?

384
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,367
How tall were you?
 -Number one, I'm 1.70.

385
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,925
You may have dug your own grave there.

386
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:04,287
Or I'm just kidding, it goes well whatever you are.

387
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,737
What is your type?
 -What my type is?

388
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:14,596
I don't have any kind if they are blondes, brunettes, red -haired or whatever, it doesn't matter.

389
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:16,573
Preferably shorter than me.

390
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,554
However, I have met people who are as long as me so it is not very dangerous.

391
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:23,310
But then just ... -He sounds a little nervous.

392
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,584
[Mimics Niklas] The guy!

393
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,541
But she seems too nice, number one.

394
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,806
She seems absolutely incredible.

395
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:32,046
She was a little late too.
 [Mimic girl 1] "Yes I drove around ... Dududu"

396
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:37,542
I saw her that she ran around there everywhere ...

397
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,867
... and look like this:

398
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,763
"There you are!"

399
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,883
"You may be longer than me, doesn't matter"

400
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:50,305
If you do not have humor, then I do not know if we will click.

401
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:53,628
I will send number nine.

402
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:57,947
Hello!
 Wilma.
 -Hello.

403
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,682
Nice.
 Do you regret your choice?
 -Yes I do.

404
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:06,197
Is it something you really don't want to do in bed?

405
00:20:06,197 --> 00:20:12,923
Gosh!
 -Number one.
 Yes there are actually quite a lot of things but one thing I absolutely won't do is ...

406
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:16,664
There are the second hole.
 Absolutely not.

407
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:19,157
What is going on?
 -This is a little hard to look at.

408
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:21,955
What the hell is happening?
 -No I need a coffee I think.

409
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:26,941
[Laughter] Now when she said the second hole ... "Well I get to take a cup"

410
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:32,152
Damn what sick .. I think it was Niklas ... -Yes it was Niklas who came up with that question.

411
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:34,401
The funny thing was that the day before ...

412
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:38,073
It was the same day before the recording we were in the office and went through questions,

413
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:39,963
Then Niklas said: "It must be raw!"

414
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:42,858
[CONTINUED VOOK] It must be the sickest fucking questions then!
 -Bdsm.

415
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:46,278
He dug his own grave a little there.
 -Do you have a cup?

416
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,094
Are we going to?
 -Yes.

417
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:51,384
Then we were back with a cup in our hand.

418
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,019
Absolutely not, think it is really-sonajs.

419
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,887
Yes it depends on a little who it is with,

420
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,507
If it is with someone you are comfortable with,

421
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:03,738
There is some stuff you may not want to do with someone you are not comfortable with.

422
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:07,800
It depends on a little but yes, it is kind of that you said.

423
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,191
Number five.
 Yes, no fight, no kind, I don't like to take that.

424
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:15,780
And don't give.
 -Do Riml-feel anyway?

425
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,806
I like to jump that.

426
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:19,308
Okay number six.

427
00:21:19,308 --> 00:21:23,323
What does she mean?
 Speech on ... or?
 -Yes but some ... some ... eh ...

428
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,137
Some people drive damn hard.

429
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:28,502
But no fight?
 -It had been totally sick after all.

430
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:33,677
[Laughs] You lie with a girl ... -Fear take a neck swing on her.

431
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:36,508
No, but it was reasonable.
 -Yes.

432
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,764
So tail sex and fights on the first three.

433
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:45,718
Spontaneously, I think it feels uncomfortable to answer this question as I haven't seen you yet.

434
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:47,769
A little early stage.

435
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:50,794
There are things I don't like, but ...

436
00:21:50,794 --> 00:21:54,678
You will know that if you are so fortunate, I think.

437
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:58,148
Number seven then ... you have to explore it a little yourself.
 -Good answer.

438
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:00,562
But I would never drive anal.

439
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,406
[Girl] anal?
 Nah.

440
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,836
Feet go away.
 No foot fetish here.

441
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:08,616
It was exciting answers.

442
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:11,987
I send number six home.

443
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:14,381
Ouch.

444
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:19,108
Hello!
 Annie.
 Do you regret?
 -Yes I do.

445
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:23,260
But I think like this: Aj .... Oww.

446
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,870
I thought Niklas would be tough and say that he does not regret his choice all the time.

447
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,622
He regrets everyone except the first.
 -Yes no it was a little ...

448
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:35,681
But Annie's answer was good after all.

449
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:36,989
Annie's response ... but,

450
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,067
It was so: "If you are lucky so".

451
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:42,587
But maybe it was not a straight answer either.

452
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:44,149
For the others were really like that: "This I don't like"

453
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:46,627
Is it perhaps that Niklas does not appreciate star sex then?

454
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:48,700
We slept together in Berlin after all ...

455
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,804
Right.

456
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:52,374
Then he took ... -then it was he who was on you.

457
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:56,001
No, we were sleeping together.
 -Oskar.

458
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,634
[Mumbles] YES ...

459
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:03,605
Who is your Swedish free pass?
 A celebrity in Sweden as well.

460
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:10,285
How many will say Joel Kinnaman ... Zlatan?
 -Zlatan I don't think anyone will say.

461
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,028
Don `t you think so?
 -No.

462
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:14,492
Isn't he good looking?
 - In other words...

463
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:19,039
I don't think you think of Zlatan as a free pass.
 Or do you do it?
 - Yes, I think so.

464
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,185
It probably does many.

465
00:23:20,185 --> 00:23:21,809
Joel Kinnaman, Zlatan or Persbrandt.

466
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,343
Some of them will come up.
 -I think it's some of the Skarsgårds.

467
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:29,888
Bill Skarsgård can probably come up.
 I think that too says.
 -He is not ugly.
 I think so too.

468
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:33,072
I am loyal, so there are no free passes for me if I am to be completely honest.

469
00:23:33,072 --> 00:23:38,807
But since I am single, I would say Viktor Leksell.
 He is nice.

470
00:23:38,807 --> 00:23:40,593
She is beautiful.

471
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:45,087
Number two yes, I have one and his name is Oliver Strige.

472
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:47,353
No, but huh?
 Strige!
 -Weah!

473
00:23:47,353 --> 00:23:49,671
Are you kidding me!
 -Stige!

474
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,321
What the hell ... -But wait now here, isn't that a little too reasonable?

475
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:54,568
Isn't that a little too close ...?

476
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:59,254
Yes he is from Gothenburg ... but we talk about Zlatan and Skarsgård and ...

477
00:23:59,254 --> 00:24:00,643
Strige?
 [In chorus] yes?!

478
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:07,377
The funny thing is that both Viktor and Strige are from Gothenburg.
 They have their free passes in the same city!
 -In the same city yes.

479
00:24:07,377 --> 00:24:09,000
It is icy after all.

480
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,251
Oliver Strige we can say that we feel very good.

481
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:15,307
It was a little fun that he came to talk.
 -Yes it was a little ...

482
00:24:15,307 --> 00:24:17,620
But he is not ugly.
 He is shitty.

483
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,192
Really, but also very busy.

484
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:22,651
So there it happened.

485
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:28,620
Number five.
 Yes but ... Danny Saucedo, he is nice to watch.

486
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,195
Yes would not drive a free pass but Joel Kinnaman ...

487
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,551
Now he does not live in Sweden, but he is Swedish.

488
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:38,365
Eight.
 Benjamin Ingrosso.

489
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:40,173
Oh!
 Yes of course.

490
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:43,094
Yes, catty.
 Who is your free pass?
 -Are you kidding?

491
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:45,656
Bianca Ingrosso then.
 [Giggle] I knew it!

492
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,242
Then we match a little.
 -Okay,

493
00:24:47,242 --> 00:24:53,414
I choose to send home ... I think it was number five.

494
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:57,513
Danny Saucedo?
 -No!
 Then I send home the one that was before.

495
00:24:57,513 --> 00:25:00,808
No!
 He changed.
 -Do you regret?

496
00:25:00,808 --> 00:25:02,185
Eh, no I don't.

497
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:07,019
[Upset] No but I can't cope!
 -"Ah okay..."

498
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,306
Everyone is very nice and cute after all.
 [Done] in its own way!

499
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:13,171
I think everyone is really nice!
 -Yes, but ...

500
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:17,853
He must be honest.
 -He can't say he regrets all.

501
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:21,129
You get a little pain in the heart.
 -Yes.

502
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:23,643
Such a sad guy ... -No!
 Was she sad there?

503
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:25,104
Yes...

504
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:30,142
What is your favorite body part of a partner?

505
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,098
Obviously, the heart is most important to me.

506
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:37,798
But otherwise to look at except face then ... [giggle] the cock.

507
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,640
So I would say the stomach.
 Or back.

508
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,405
Number five.
 -Beer stomach.

509
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:48,736
If you do not choose the face, it may be ... happens.

510
00:25:48,736 --> 00:25:50,300
Arms and hands.

511
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:55,920
Same here if you can't say face then it is happening or back.

512
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,171
Number eight.

513
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:03,289
So we did not say that you could not say face so I will say eyes and hands I think.

514
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:06,442
Quite straight answers.
 -What is your favorite on the girl then?

515
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:11,226
My favorite body part ... I'm weak for nice legs.

516
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:13,344
May I say ... mm.

517
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:15,576
Did he say Lena Ben?
 -No, fine.

518
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:20,171
Unfortunately, I will send home number five.

519
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:22,902
"I'm weak for Lena Ben ..." -HE, Ella.

520
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:24,675
Hello.
 —Do you sing your choice?

521
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:26,809
No, I do not.
 -Okay [giggle]

522
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:31,101
Niklas!
 -What is your fetish?

523
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:34,379
Three left now.
 -If you now have someone.

524
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:38,245
Number one here.
 Frankly, I actually have no fetish.

525
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:43,782
I think it's najs when lying in bed and someone is behind and breathing one in the neck.

526
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:45,608
But it's not a fetish, I have none.

527
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:48,352
Like this.
 Check it out.

528
00:26:48,352 --> 00:26:49,700
[Groaning silently]

529
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,814
Did you get goose?
 - Yes it was ...

530
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:54,847
Also have no fetish.
 Number seven, by the way.

531
00:26:54,847 --> 00:27:01,393
But if I have to say something then when the guy is good at taking command, have some good confidence.

532
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:04,027
[Barsian] Now you take the disk I tell you!

533
00:27:04,027 --> 00:27:07,360
[Laughter] and then so ...

534
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,816
[Laughter] And after that you cook or!

535
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:15,283
And then we jump in the chamber!

536
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:16,222
A little hybris maybe.

537
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:22,775
Number eight.
 My students will see this ... when you are a little hard -handed maybe.
 -Teacher?

538
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:27,096
But damn ... why are you looking into the camera like that?

539
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:28,284
When you said that.
 -Is she teacher?

540
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:31,526
[Mimics] "My students will see this ... a little hard -handed maybe?"

541
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,917
Surely she is not a preschool educator?

542
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:37,687
[Laughter] No I don't know ... -But she's a teacher you know.

543
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:41,168
Okay are you going on this then?

544
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:46,076
Ah ... -a little hard.

545
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:48,110
Not so hard.
 -Are you?

546
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,754
Niklas got giggled!
 -Dududu ... so!

547
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:59,605
Nice!
 -Shiiiit.

548
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:08,268
This is difficult, but I send home ... the panting in the neck there.

549
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,403
One.

550
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:12,409
"Panting in the neck" ...

551
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:17,560
Hello!
 Pamela.
 Do you regret?
 -Yes I do.

552
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,555
See you certainly some other day.
 -Yes we do that safely.

553
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:25,341
What is required for your parents ... -come again now!

554
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:28,099
He is a little golden boy.

555
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:31,277
I flush back a bit.
 -Winga Niklas!

556
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:34,725
What is required for your parents to like me?

557
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:42,668
Big cock.
 -Okay number seven then.
 I think it's kind of treating me well and having a good job type.

558
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:45,168
Dad is so: "Good job".

559
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:50,712
For me, it is most important that my nephews like you.

560
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:54,222
And if you are good with children, you go home as well.
 -FIN response.

561
00:28:54,222 --> 00:28:58,734
But my mom, she is very easy.

562
00:28:58,734 --> 00:29:02,131
So humor, type.

563
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:05,436
But the most important thing is that my siblings like you.

564
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,000
I heard something with nephew, want children, I think?

565
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,143
Well!
 No I said ...

566
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:15,329
I don't know how you look ... [laughter]

567
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:19,674
Well, he interpreted wrong!
 -He haven't heard her.

568
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:24,146
"Want children? I don't know how you look?"

569
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:26,735
Like that's the problem.
 They don't know each other.

570
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:31,656
She just talked about that ... what a wrong it was.
 -Nephew.

571
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:37,389
It is therefore most important about my brother's children, ie my brother's arelands like you.

572
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,801
I spend a lot of time with them.

573
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:42,138
They are a very big part of my family as well.

574
00:29:42,138 --> 00:29:45,597
So you are a family -like person?
 -Yes.

575
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,805
It's important, it's good.

576
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:53,173
First, what did you say again?
 -I said my dad likes a guy with good humor.

577
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:56,322
My mom is pretty easy to be taken with,

578
00:29:56,322 --> 00:29:57,458
She changed now!
 -As she?

579
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,201
She said Dad said good job?
 -Yes exactly!

580
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:04,331
"Good job and treat me with respect," she said.

581
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:07,741
And just because she changed and family "yes humor, family, mom ..."

582
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:11,501
[Made] Yes and that everyone is the same and safe in the family!

583
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:16,141
And that you like brother's kids.
 She has no nephews.
 -I am a little family girl so.

584
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:20,083
Changes altogether.
 [Made] and I love short blonde guys ... so.

585
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:24,513
I have dogs so it's important that they like you.

586
00:30:24,513 --> 00:30:27,280
But they are kind, so ... -How many then?

587
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,513
My dog just bit his pants.

588
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:32,483
I've made my choice.

589
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:37,630
I send the dogs home there, number seven.

590
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,705
He doesn't want dogs.
 -I like cats.

591
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:43,721
Hello!
 Hanna.
 Do you regret?
 -Eh, no.

592
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:48,379
[Screaming to] -she was a little shocked?

593
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,759
She couldn't take it.

594
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,282
"Do you regret? No. [Dramatic Inhalation]"

595
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,357
What happened there?

596
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:54,572
He said he didn't regret it.
 -She was shocked.

597
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:58,226
Didn't you see her mine?
 -Take about it again, what the hell happened there?

598
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,005
Hello!
 Hanna.
 Do you regret?

599
00:31:01,005 --> 00:31:03,866
Eh no.
 [Shocked sound]

600
00:31:03,866 --> 00:31:06,687
[Dramatic sound] Aaah!

601
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:09,011
Starting to run around ... [laughter]

602
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:11,792
"Do you regret? No. [Dramatic sound]"

603
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:14,072
[High sound] -she couldn't take it.

604
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:18,398
Damn, she expected him to say yes, maybe.

605
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,294
There is only one left.

606
00:31:21,294 --> 00:31:26,468
No ... It wasn't good.
 It will be such a Big Reveal now.

607
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:31,910
There is only one left now, so we can see who it is.

608
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,848
Hi, Angelica.
 -Niklas, do you get a hug?

609
00:31:33,848 --> 00:31:34,622
Yes, the very good.
 -Hello.

610
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:36,377
“Yes giant Äre”

611
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:39,548
I was so nervous, I thought I would work today!

612
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:41,066
I'm totally shaky.

613
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,941
Niklas thought it would be another guy there.

614
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:46,693
I called a Andreas ...

615
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:48,550
You really went like this and I thought "Damn what unpleasant"

616
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,322
It was because Lucas said I would not look at the girls.

617
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:52,119
I just: "Why not look at the girls?"

618
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,773
Our employees must not look at the brides.

619
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:59,615
What was you called again?
 -Angelica.

620
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:01,429
Angelica.
 And where are you from?
 -Alingsås.

621
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:03,881
And how old are you?
 -I'm 22.

622
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,535
And you?
 -24, turns 25.

623
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:08,580
They said slightly different ages.

624
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,679
I know, they just tried to fool me.
 -26.25, 24 ...

625
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:15,140
So I was fooled.
 -They were cheated.

626
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,882
Are we doing outro today or?
 -Yes!

627
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:18,871
You can make an outro.
 -Thank you for looking!

628
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:22,359
Farewell!
 Now it will be a date, type.

629
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,552
One left, and you have to marry her.

630
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:37,313
