1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,000
"So cute!"

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,040
Like.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,840
She's back from India today! 
I completely forgot.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,600
That's true. It really is freezing outside.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,320
So why do we share things?

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,960
For the same reason 
we've always shared information:

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,320
To communicate something 
about the world, yourself, or your values.

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,040
Before, these discussions would 
probably stay around the dinner table-

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,160
-but today it's quick and easy to share 
information with a lot more people.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,320
That's why it's so important 
that what you share is true.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,560
The article you just shared, for instance. 
That's fake.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,000
Really? Wow. All right.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,000
OK, so what should I do 
to keep it from happening again?

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,200
Always be critical of what you read 
and share, and be responsible.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,720
What you share does affect 
someone else's view of the world-

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,440
-so you really have to support 
whatever you share.

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,760
Keep this in mind 
when you share things

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,720
Who has written or said it? Is it someone 
you know? Someone you trust?

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,280
And why are they saying it?

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,680
To tell a story, to influence your opinions, 
or to get you to buy something?

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,560
To entertain you, to scare you, 
or to be mean to someone?

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,520
Ask yourself this before sharing:

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,440
Is this true? Is it important, 
to you or to other people?

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,560
Is it good for you or for other people?

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,880
Ask yourself the same questions-

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,240
-when you come across a new Facebook 
group or a blog, or see a YouTube clip.

27
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,360
Is that mascara really the best 
that person has ever tried?

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,680
Or could they be sponsored?

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,040
Think back to what it was like 
25 years ago.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,560
You probably wouldn't have known how 
Olle, 23, from Mellerud felt about Trump-

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,040
-or what your cousin had for breakfast.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,320
These days, you can find out 
at the touch of a button.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,560
Social media makes more perspectives, 
views, and info available to more people.

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,480
That's a good thing in a democracy, 
but every user has a responsibility.

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,600
Maybe I shouldn't share this 
if I'm not completely sure...
