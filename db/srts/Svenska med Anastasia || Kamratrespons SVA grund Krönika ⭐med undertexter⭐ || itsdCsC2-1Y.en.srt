1
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:15,000
You have written a text that we should look at.

2
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:20,462
I can say that there was not much that was good in that text.

3
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:25,230
There were so many grammatical errors

4
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:28,892
And so many words of words!

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,306
I wonder how have you really made it to Sva Grund?

6
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:38,284
How can you study there?

7
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:43,188
Look here!
 Now I'll show you one thing.

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,291
Look at this sentence.

9
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:48,849
This is a main sentence.

10
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:51,034
What kind of order do you have in it?

11
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:53,899
You start with time.

12
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:58,192
What must come after time in Swedish?

13
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:01,765
You have to write a verb here.

14
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,699
If time is the foundation in the sentence then a verb must come.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,774
This is not acceptable at SVA Grund level!

16
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,375
Look at your entire text, look at the structure.

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
There are almost no pieces!

18
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,875
The sentences are not whole.

19
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:28,378
There is no subject and verbs in several sentences.

20
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:31,674
It is actually difficult to understand what you want to say!

21
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:35,558
You are not kind!
 You are mean!

22
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:39,597
I'm just trying to help you!

23
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,307
You must be able to withstand some criticism!

24
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:49,448
How should you be better if you can't hear what you do wrong?

25
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:54,091
Haven't you heard of two stars and a desire?

26
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:56,537
What did you say for something?

27
00:01:56,538 --> 00:02:00,000
Two stars and one wish.

28
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:01,047
What is it?

29
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:09,607
You tell two positive things and one thing you can get better at.

30
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,732
But you just say I'm wrong!

31
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:28,072
Now let's talk about that chronicle that you have written.

32
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:36,201
I was going to start by summarizing the content just to see if you think I have understood it correctly.

33
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:49,087
As I interpret it, you have written about when you discovered that so many Swedes love nature.

34
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:52,925
That it is almost like a religion for some Swedes.

35
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:55,113
Is it true?

36
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:57,984
I thought - what a good topic!

37
00:02:58,071 --> 00:03:03,343
I really like it and I agree with you, I have also thought that it is so.

38
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:08,700
You see that there are so many Swedes who are out and about in nature all the time.

39
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:12,867
You really recognize what you write.

40
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:21,000
You start so well, it will be exciting right from the start.

41
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:29,704
When you are out in the woods and you describe these people so heavenly alive and well.

42
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,830
That's really good.

43
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:36,890
And then comes the message.

44
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:41,169
Nature can also be religion, almost.

45
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:45,357
Something that gives a human being very much.

46
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:52,638
It really is connected: the story itself, your example and the message.

47
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:55,648
There is a clear red thread.

48
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:59,365
You could say that.

49
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:11,237
I remember that our teachers talked about being personal but not private.

50
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:15,854
This feels like such a topic.

51
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not like this to wonder - what did she have done?
 And what debt does she have in this?

52
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:28,711
It is more like an observation firmly described in a personal way.

53
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,764
So it was great I think!

54
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:38,484
We would have a painting language too.

55
00:04:39,507 --> 00:04:46,061
I found some places where I thought you might have described ...

56
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:52,764
When you are out in the woods, it may be easy to describe nature.

57
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,771
I find it difficult to describe, with a painting language.

58
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:00,599
Do you have any ideas?

59
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:05,501
Yes, for example, here you just write that you were out in the woods.

60
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:11,725
But you can try to come up with a good adjective that fits the forest.

61
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:16,294
For example, if it might have rained before

62
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:20,754
Then you can say that the forest was wet.

63
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:27,195
It is a difficult word, I have heard some Swedish say that word.

64
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:37,557
You can come up with your own adjectives such as - the newly bathed forest.

65
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:44,526
A forest cannot bathe, but you can always test if it works.

66
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:47,469
We can test it on our teachers if they think it's ok.

67
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:50,922
It sounds like a good idea, thank you very much!

68
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:55,671
In a few more places you can put it in.

69
00:05:55,672 --> 00:06:00,635
Or you can take a bye.

70
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:04,513
"The forest in which it had just rained in"

71
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:07,237
Although it may not sound so neat.

72
00:06:07,238 --> 00:06:08,914
I understand what you mean.

73
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:15,539
The forest with the dense leaves and the green vegetation.

74
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:19,686
It will be a prepositional phrase, I think the teachers have said it is.

75
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:27,616
That's really good!
 And then there are some grammatical errors that I can also help you with.

76
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,442
We can take it later, we go and drink some coffee first.

77
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:35,246
Thank you for your response!
 You are welcome!
