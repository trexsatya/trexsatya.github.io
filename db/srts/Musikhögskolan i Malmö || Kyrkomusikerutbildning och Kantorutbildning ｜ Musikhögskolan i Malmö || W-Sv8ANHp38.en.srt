00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:20,560
The best thing about this education has been several things, but one of the absolute best has been the heat and community at the school.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,560
Competent teachers, talented teachers like us ... We read so many subjects.

3
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,100
It is not just organ, but classic piano, hearing piano, singing and choir.

4
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:46,080
I have been very pleased with the quality of education in all subjects.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,560
It may be that you have individual lessons on Monday and so practice on it.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,380
Then you have Tuesday in driving, where you are in a group together, and then maybe you practice it.

7
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,380
And so Wednesday ... there is great variety every day.

8
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:12,380
Each day contains something else from the previous day,

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:22,180
which makes this education completely unique in its kind, both as a musician education,

10
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:31,240
But in general, I have never been so stimulated and inspired by my previous years at university.

11
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:54,960
My name is Noa Edvardsson and I study the last semester of artistic candidate in church music here in Malmö.

12
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:10,760
We have a very good position between our students.
 After all, we have both a candidate and an office line that you read at the same time, so we can help each other and peep each other.

13
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,440
And then we have a very good collaboration with the churches here so we have to come out and play and substitute and get better.

14
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:25,490
Organ knowledge and precisely that width with these great teachers on all the instruments you have too,

15
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't think there is anywhere else in Sweden than just in Malmö.

16
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,560
You are tired but happy every Friday because it is intense but always fun.
