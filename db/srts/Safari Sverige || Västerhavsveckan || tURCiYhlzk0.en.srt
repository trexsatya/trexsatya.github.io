1
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.960
Västerhavsveckan is an initiative from the entire west coast

2
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.280
Where the purpose is to emphasize wildlife underwater and explore environmental awareness.

3
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.600
The North Sea Week was started in 2008.

4
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.040
It is a theme week for the marine environment that Västra Götaland's environmental committee initiated.

5
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.680
We want to raise sea awareness with our visitors.

6
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.160
The sea means a lot to us.
 Without the sea we have no life on land either.

7
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.160
We in the environmental owners took the opportunity to document and experience the week.

8
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.000
My name is Fredrik Gröndal and I am a teacher and researcher at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

9
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.440
I am also a station manager for Kristineberg's marine research station.

10
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.440
The boat we have been out now is one of our research vessels.
 We have two.

11
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.160
Then we have a larger ship called Skagerak and which comes here after the summer.

12
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:32.120
We only go in special places to save the bottom, so we are very careful when we work.

13
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.480
What I am doing very much is jellyfish.

14
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:44.160
When I started working with marine biology and doctorate, it was ear jellyfish and fire jellyfish.

15
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.160
I was the best in it, then.

16
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.880
After exploring Oskar von Sydow and getting to meet Fredrik Gröndal

17
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.680
We went on to an eelgrass bed in an area called Bökavik.

18
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.840
Me, Christian and Stefan put on swimming feet and snorkels to dive.

19
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.320
To see the beautiful eel grass beds wander around on the bottom of the sea,

20
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.920
All sorts of herring and jellyfish were absolutely amazing

21
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.360
There is so much more below the surface than we think.

22
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.160
We still have the same problems that we had in 2008, for example, how do we get new food from the sea with algae.

23
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.800
We are still talking about plastic and debris in the sea, acidification, eutrophication and overfishing.

24
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.120
Some things have been better over the years.

25
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.920
But, even though we are aware of the problems, a lot is getting worse.

26
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.840
We have to work a lot more for our sea.

27
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.160
More and more people use the sea.
 We need the sea for food.

28
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.600
There are more and more recreation boats for recreation.

29
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.920
Fishing.
 Everything, everything needs much more space.

30
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.600
We have to get a balance so that we in a sustainable way use the sea and not destroy it more than what we have done.

31
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:27.600
About the middle of the week, two of the environmental owners Bosse visited a Hönöbo with a heart for seal safaris in Gothenburg's northern archipelago.

32
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.840
Now we will take you out on a guided tour.
 It is Harald, my granddaughter, and it is the third season he runs so he is experienced on this.

33
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.120
I am completely calm and can consider myself telling where we are somewhere.

34
00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:08.320
In 2008 we were about 30 players.
 This year we are over 100 players.
 We have expanded with Halland, Skåne and Denmark.

35
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.960
We are more and more who want to join and that is proof that the issues are becoming more and more important.

36
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:25.000
The important thing is to understand what is down there in the sea because we do not see it and we have far too little knowledge about it.

37
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.080
Seeing children playing with junk may seem something unusual.

38
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.560
Fantastic children, young people, adults and together we create instruments.

39
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.320
We have no special rules for it.

40
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.400
So there are only ideas and it is so exciting.

41
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.960
Imagine that a plastic can can be turned into a ukulele and a yogurt can becomes a drum.

42
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.880
Together with the artist group Sepandarmaz, children create musical instruments with junk from the sea.

43
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.240
We can become a dialogue between children across cultural boundaries.

44
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:33.920
I am passionate about the sea and feel that we have a long way to hike and we have to change our own behavior.

45
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:44.640
I see our over -consumption that leaves traces both here but also in Africa and other poorer countries

46
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.360
Which happens very badly because we consume too much in the Western world.

47
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.720
It's something that drives me pretty much.

48
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.760
Then of course I want a beautiful sea that I can enjoy, swim in,

49
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.000
Snorkel and discover that there is this huge life under the sea.

50
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.480
Then I get to learn something new every year and that is what is so fun about working in such a project.

51
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:20.280
Because I also learn all the time and the curiosity you have and develops never end.
 I think that is wonderful.

52
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.560
The island of Måseskär is located at the far end of the sea band outside Orust.

53
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.400
The trip goes via Kärringön where we change a boat.

54
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:38.400
I have a chat with Tomas Liebig, a dedicated biologist who is happy to share his knowledge.

55
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:46.240
Actually, we should call the island of TrueSkär because here is more trout than seagulls.

56
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.160
The trotting we have in the largest number is herring.

57
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.000
This year, 200 pairs of herring are hedged here.

58
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:05.600
It has been good for them.
 There are a lot of kids that may be heard in the background, the small ones feed by their parents.

59
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.880
There is a lot going on on Måseskär under the flag of the North Sea week.

60
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.240
And here you use rainwater.

61
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:19.520
Guidance on life as a lighthouse keeper, a lecture on the mythical storm vault,

62
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.080
But we listen to Tomas.

63
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.920
What is very special about Måseskär is that outside the island there are two sea currents that shock on each other.

64
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:38.640
It gets a stir in the water.
 It is released a lot of nutrition.
 We get plenty of plant and zooplankton.

65
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:46.560
Plenty of small fish thus tobis, small herring and then larger fish.

66
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:56.080
During the 30 years that Tomas regularly certainly on the island, he has seen how bird life has become different.

67
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:04.880
There is a lot that has changed.
 It is sparse and sparse between proper ice winter.

68
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:13.600
A huge change is that we get more bird species that winter in the area.

69
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:20.040
Birds that moved south before the millennium shift, we find here all year.

70
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.960
It is dax to get to the mainland again, but we will be back

71
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.920
Maybe this spring when the herring box and the other migratory birds return to Måseskär.

72
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.840
We are Fridays for Future.
 We are co -organizer for the North Sea week.

73
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.560
Now we have a demonstration for the sea where we will cycle around Gothenburg.

74
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.880
Do you know why we should cycle at the demonstration

75
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.240
Because we want to say that we should take care of the sea.

76
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.360
What does it say on your flags

77
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.040
We hope to awaken a consciousness in the public.

78
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.680
We hope that the media will understand how important it is with the sea.

79
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.680
We hope that politicians will understand.

80
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.680
We simply want attention.

81
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.960
And we should have fun and support each other so there is not so much anxiety and lonely.

82
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.800
The sea is required to save the climate and the climate must be saved to save the sea.

83
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.840
So it's all about stopping eutrophication, sustainable food from the sea, quitting with large -scale fishing.

84
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.000
In the North Sea also lives a small algae called meat leaf.

85
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.200
It is red and it tastes fried egg.

86
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.200
The meat leaf hall requires us to protect the sea.

87
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.960
Our second requirement is about sustainable food from the sea.

88
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.360
First, fish sustainable.

89
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.880
We need to get rid of bottom line and other destructive methods that are actually subsidized today.

90
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.480
Instead, we want the state, the municipality and the region to support small -scale fishing.

91
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.120
And also test on new food varieties.

92
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.760
Humanity stands and falls with the sea.
 It's so simple.

93
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:05.640
Fish sustainable should be obvious

94
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:20.240
Although I myself live on an island, I must say to experience the west coast like this and see all the amazing nature

95
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:27.440
Is still as extraordinary as the first time I saw a sunset here.

96
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:35.240
After coming home from the North Sea week, we must summarize it with a single big plus.

97
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.960
Being able to join and create a future for the sea and interest in its nature is absolutely wonderful.
