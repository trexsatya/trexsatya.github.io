00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03.840
My name is Evelina and I plug in software technology.

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07.424
I would like to say that what you learn is to solve problems.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm on my master now. And then, for example, I have read some neural networks

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,128
- Teach a computer to see the difference between a cat and a dog.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,948
Data security - then you have tried to imagine in

6
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:26,624
What it is like to be a hacker and have to try to make different attacks.

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,976
Liu has, of course, to say, a very good student life

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,816
And I really think so. There are so many associations at LiU.

9
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
It is usually said that there is an association for each person.

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,216
In Lithe BlÃ¥s, we are a student orchestra of type 40 people.

11
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,008
And then we have a ballet of 10 people.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
Everyone can join. You don't have to be able to play anything. And ballet, it sounds like you should dance ballet then

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,504
But it is definitely not. It's choreographies, but ...

14
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56.064
It's not about being good. It's about having fun!

15
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03.488
There is a kind of belief that in order to be able to plug something computer technically

16
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07.328
So you already have to have a super big interest in computers or games.

17
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08.608
That's what we learn here!

18
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,424
Yes, it's hard, but it's also fun.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
That is what is so fun with programming,

20
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,824
For rewards you get all the time. And that is what we do a lot on software technology.

21
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,152
You just have to think it sounds a little fun, a little interesting.

22
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,224
Or if you think puzzles are fun type, because it is a bit that

23
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
everything's about.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
See relationship and try to find a way to solve them.

25
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
And so you are looking, and it will go well.

26
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,488
It did it for me anyway.
