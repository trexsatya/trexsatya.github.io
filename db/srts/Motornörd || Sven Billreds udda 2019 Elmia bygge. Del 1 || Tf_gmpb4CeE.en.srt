1
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,780
Hello!
 Hello!

2
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,700
Tjena, Douglas.
 Sven Billred.

3
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,340
-I have heard that you are going to do a project?
 Yes it is true.

4
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,780
-When should it be finished?
 Hopefully to Elmia 2019.

5
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,860
It should go.

6
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,520
-Is there any sketch on what it should look like?

7
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,320
Well, most of it is already in the head.

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,340
But then I found a picture on the internet on a car.

9
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,940
This one is quite similar.

10
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,780
I will not use any bonnet or screens.

11
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,600
The style itself will be like this with Boat-tail at the back and the front with similar lanterns.

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,100
-What do you have for background?
 The fact that you have built more cars can prove the wall.

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,600
Well, I have built a 1927 Chevrolet that I have used for 10 years.

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:43,880
I also have a Willys from 1939 which was a 4 door that I have built into a coupe.

15
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,180
Exactly after the original.
 And that's the only one in Sweden.

16
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,200
There are some Willys Cuper from 1940-41 but they are unusual.

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,900
-Cool!
 If you are wondering what sounds, it is a fluorescent lamp that creak.

18
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,740
It's an old garage.
 I've been here for over 30 years.

19
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,420
It probably needed to be renovated.

20
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,500
-What are you going to build?

21
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,040
It's this car.

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,640
From the ground up it is a 1929 chevrolet truck.

23
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,300
I have been able to use the frame and it will be a so-called boat-tail racer.

24
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,140
Which they were built in the 1920s to the United States.

25
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,280
With your own engine.
 A straight twelve!

26
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,000
Which I don't think is somewhere.
 I haven't seen anyone anyway.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,200
So it will be an exciting challenge.

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,780
-How do you come up with that idea?

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,460
I don't know ... you want to be odd.

30
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,660
It is among the strangest and the coolest I have seen.

31
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:49,960
And that's the point.
 I try to build as much as I can myself.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,740
Most of what is visible on the car will be hand -made.

33
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,240
That is the big challenge to do something of its own.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,780
-I wish I had your knowledge.

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,240
It is SmÃ¥land's stubbornness most.

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,500
I have put in a year's work.

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,780
And on average 4 hours a day.

38
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,760
It's every free time I have.

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,580
The biggest advantage is that there will not be a drop of varnish on it.

40
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,000
The entire body will be built in aluminum, ground down and polished.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,100
Everything will be polished aluminum.

42
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,580
It mostly depends on myself.
 I will not be dependent on anyone else.

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,340
-Can you show us around a little neighbor?
 Yes, we can start here.

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,300
Here I have started, the frame is reinforced, targeted and rusted.

45
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,860
The engines are mounted.
 They are not assembled but sit in place.

46
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:56,560
The lamps are a copy of Wood Lights as they are called in the United States.

47
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,600
They were very common in the 20-30s on prestige cars.

48
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,420
Very difficult to get hold of and terribly expensive.

49
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,480
They are handmade.

50
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,300
They are made of aluminum and brass.
 Behind here you have the blinker.

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,920
Inside, there should be 2 lens lights from a motorcycle.

52
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,140
2 pcs 50 mm to half and high beam.

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,760
If you had to change a lamp.
 Now this is this joint lighting so it is not often needed.

54
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,160
Hinges so you can open.
 LED flashers and here the lamps should sit.

55
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,240
I have made my own brackets that should be in Art Deco style.

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,220
Then I had to make my own mold in wood.

57
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,280
Then I handed it in to Vetlanda foundry that made 3 so I have one in reserve.

58
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,840
So you can't buy.
 -Oh my God!

59
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,280
Since the front lights were special, I had to do the special taillights.

60
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,780
Then I made these in aluminum with some brass.

61
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,600
Inside there is LED lighting from an MC.
 Blinkers, parking and brake light.

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,560
-What do you get the ideas from?
 I want to do something no one has done.

63
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,880
Ideally, there should be no one who has done anything like it.

64
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,840
-I think you are pretty lonely.
 I haven't seen anyone else.

65
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,220
The radiator is the only thing I have not manufactured myself.
 It is an aluminum cooler.

66
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,840
The cooler shell and the grill are its own manufacture.

67
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,360
The grid will be water cut in stainless steel.

68
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,760
It is going on with this pattern.

69
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,820
The grid will resemble a net but be much more stable.

70
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,080
This is a sample piece that has been cut into water.

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,960
The suction and the plates that sit here are water cut.

72
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,340
The exhaust pipe is backed by Ferrita in stainless steel.

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Now it should be welded.

74
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,440
It will be the big job when it will also be polished.

75
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,900
There are many hours left on that exhaust pipe before it is finished.

76
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,820
Here I have more waterborne details.

77
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,960
And they should be welded together and sit here.

78
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,560
There will be the suction pipes.

79
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,540
There will be a tube along the engine where 3 carburetors sit.

80
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,040
-Hher God what a job.
 Yes it is a puzzle.

81
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,580
-And everything should be welded and polished.
 Yes.

82
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,700
-It will take an hour or two maybe.
 Hahaha.

83
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,360
Here is the size of the rear wheel.

84
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,000
There are 17 "rims but it was not in the right size.

85
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:57,040
So I got to buy these rims and cut up and narrow off the rim so they should fit the tires I bought.

86
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,440
You can see on the inside where the cormorant is.

87
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,180
A snobbring will be mounted so you do not see the welding joint.

88
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,240
It should be founded before I put on the snob bridge.

89
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,300
The rutram and here is the shape of the cab so I'll see how it will be.

90
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,660
All this is made of aluminum that is filled with chemical metal to gain stability.

91
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,520
Then it becomes like a molded piece.

92
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,480
The cab will be glued on this plate.

93
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,020
So you can fold it down like this.

94
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,280
There is a lock on here on top.

95
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,120
It will be a brass plate with keyhole.

96
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,260
And then a spring in stainless steel.

97
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,120
This spring is provisional.

98
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,860
The principle is that you use a spring as a lock.

99
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,520
An exhaust system with silencer in stainless steel.

100
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,040
With a classic fishtail piece.

101
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,900
A little strange design on the muffler.

102
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,080
-The doors then?
 They become completely newly made.

103
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,360
With your own frame and leather.

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,900
The door will be in this size that I have drawn out.

105
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,075
-Baktill so the 30s look like.

106
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,320
Yes, this is a model called Boat Tail.

107
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,780
It is that it looks like an up and down turn a boat.

108
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,400
In most cases, they did this in one piece.

109
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,660
I have done this as luggage so I can open.

110
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,940
This is the frame for the luggage door itself.

111
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,760
It is mostly for me to be able to pick up the cab ...

112
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,240
... Remove it and put it in.

113
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,640
The luggage is made according to the size of the cab.

114
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,620
-What is the next part of projects?
 Now I am doing the skeleton on the body.

115
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,200
These are these parts that are bent and heated.

116
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,240
All the pieces will be welded firmly.

117
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Then it will be dressed in aluminum.

118
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,960
These pieces too.

119
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,720
First, I have to complete the skeleton.

120
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,760
It is a lot of millimeter fit so it gets right from the start.

121
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,100
Here there will be lists.

122
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,700
This is a stainless steel prototype.

123
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,340
5 lists will be here.

124
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,720
I do this to make it a little life in the body and not just smooth sheet metal.

125
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,500
And it works as a reinforcement so it becomes more stable.

126
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,400
Then we have the interior ...

127
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,200
Then I made my own chairs in aluminum.

128
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,000
In a bomber Seat piece.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,880
The dashboard is own manufactured and the rose polished.

130
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,600
Here there will be a tachometer.

131
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,300
With a pointer from a mora clock.

132
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,880
So it is big and clear.

133
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,500
-We look at the engines too.

134
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,240
There are 2 engines from Chevrolet Nova at 194 cubicum.

135
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,480
The engines were very nice when I bought them but will be completely renovated.

136
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,040
Straight sexes were often replaced to V8or.

137
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,820
Then the engines had not gone very far.
 These engines have not gone beyond 3000 miles.

138
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,040
They were very nice on the inside.
 Will change pistons and layers, etc.

139
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,980
The engines sit together on their own frame.

140
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,620
So they are silently mounted in this frame.

141
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:59,160
That part is suspended with rubber suspensions in the truck frame so it becomes a unit.

142
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,060
-How do you get the engines go together?
 With 2 machine reefs.

143
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,500
One is turned like the flywheel and the other as the flywheel damper.

144
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,320
But reinforced, the weakest link on this engine will be the flywheel damper.

145
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,120
There, the shaft is the thinnest and there I have good size and larger packing boxes.

146
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,980
And more powerful locking.

147
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,320
It is connected with a double chain.

148
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:36,620
Water pumps are removed so that there are electric pumps that circulate one engine at a time.

149
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,480
There are double outlets on the cooler.

150
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,500
That one becomes the front engine and the other to the rear.

151
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:50,640
-The valve cover, have you taken it from a Finnish ferry?
 Hahaha!

152
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,100
It is own manufactured.

153
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,000
I made a tool so I could smoke this pattern.

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,060
I did this on a smooth plate and bended with small bends.

155
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,380
This is what you can grind out and polish.

156
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,840
This is oil filling for the engines.
 There will be 2 pcs here.

157
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,360
This one turns into the front engine and this one to the rear.

158
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,500
-You are the man of details.
 That's the fun.

159
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,560
You can come up with something then manufacture it.

160
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,040
These are window hooks used on windows on the inside.

161
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,600
It is spring loaded and you can adjust the hardness.

162
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,480
They will be locks for inspection hatches on the engine.
 I thought the style fit well.

163
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:53,520
Most screws and bolts are recessed.

164
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,800
But original was everything riveted.

165
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,740
Then I have turned rivets in brass.

166
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:08,180
And will be mounted here and glued.
 So it looks riveted as it was original.

A therapy work when you are a little tired.
 Then you can stand at the lathe and do these.

168
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,980
Only ordinary brass is polished.

-We others watch the football World Cup ... This will be something cool.

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,660
I hope no one else has done anything like it.
 I can almost guarantee that no one has.

171
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,580
-Then we'll see if there have been any progress when I come back.

172
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,520
I hope so.

173
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,955
-Thanks for now.
 Hello!
