00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,080
MotornÃ¶rd = Engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,020
Vetlanda Sweden, August 2018.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,700
Project Inline Twelve.
Road to Elmia 2019.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,720
Decimo segundo.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
it's Portuguese.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,600
With its own engine, an inline twelve!

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:42,160
Sven Billred odd project. 
PART 1.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,780
Hello!
Hi!

9
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,700
-Douglas.
Sven Billred.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,340
-I heard something about you doing a project?
Yes it is true.

11
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,780
-When will it be finished?
Hopefully to Elmia 2019.

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,860
It should be possible.

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,520
-Is there any sketch of what it should look like?

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,320
Well, most of it is already in my head.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,340
But then I found a picture on the internet of a car.

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,940
This one is pretty similar.

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,780
I will not use any fenders or a bonnet.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,600
The style itself will be like this with boat-tail
rear and the front with similar headlights.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,100
-What's your car background?
All the cups on the wall tells me that you've built cars berfore.

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,600
Well, I built a 1927 Chevrolet
which I have used for the last 10 years.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:43,880
I also have a 1939 Willys that was one
4 doors that I have built into a Coupe.

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,180
Exactly after the original.
And it is the only one in Sweden.

23
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,200
There are some Willys coupe from
1940-41 but they are unusual.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,900
-Cool! 
The strange sound you hear is an old fluorescent lamp.

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,740
It is an old garage.
I have been here for over 30 years.

26
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,420
The garage needs a renovation.

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,500
-Show us what you are going to build.

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,040
This is this car.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,640
It is basically a 1929 Chevrolet truck.

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,300
I have been able to use the frame and
it will be a so-called boat-tail racer.

31
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,140
Boat-tail models was built at 1920-30s in US.

32
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,280
With its own engine.
An inline twelve! (straight twelve)

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,000
Which I don't think exists anywhere.
I haven't seen anyone anyway.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,200
So it will be an exciting challenge.

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,780
-Where does such an idea come from?

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,460
I don't know ... I want to do something odd.

37
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,660
It is among the strangest
and the coolest thing I've ever seen.

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:49,960
And that's the point.
I try to build as much as I can myself.

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,740
Most of what is visible on the car
will be handmade.

40
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,240
That's the big challenge of doing something your own.

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,780
-I wish I had your knowledge and skills.

42
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,240
It's usually just my stubbornness...

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,500
I've put in a year's work.

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,780
And on average 4 hours a day.

45
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,760
That's every spare time I have.

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,580
The biggest advantage is that it 
will not be a drop of paint on it.

47
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,000
The entire body will be built
in Aluminum, sanded down and polished.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,100
Everything will be polished aluminum.

49
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,580
It depends most on myself.
I will not depend on anyone else.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,340
-Can you show us around?
Yes, we can start here.

51
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:41,300
I started with the frame is reinforced
and I have removed all rust.

52
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:48,860
The engines are mounted but they 
are not assembled but are in place.

53
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:56,560
The headlights are a replica of wood lights
as they are called in the United States.

54
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,600
They were very common in prestige cars in the 20-30s.

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,420
Very difficult to get hold of and terribly expensive.

56
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,480
They are handmade.

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,300
They are made of aluminum and brass.
Behind here you have the indicator light.

58
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,920
On the inside, there should be 2 lens lights from a motorcycle.

59
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,140
Two 50 mm for high and low beams.

60
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,760
If you need to change a lamp.
However, this is LED-lighting so it is not often needed.

61
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,160
Hinges so you can open the cover.
LED-indicators and here the headlight should sit.

62
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,240
I have made my own brackets that should be in art deco style.

63
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,220
Then I had to make my own mold in wood.

64
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,280
Then I handed it to Vetlanda foundry
who cast 3 pcs so I have one spare.

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,840
So you can't buy them.
-Oh my God!

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,280
Since the headlights were a bit special, 
I had to make special taillights.

67
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,780
Then I made these in aluminum and small pieces of brass.

68
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,600
On the inside there is joint lighting from an Motorcycle.
Indicators, parking and brake lights.

69
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,560
-Where do you get the ideas from?
I want to do something that nobody has done before.

70
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,880
Ideally, there should be none
who has done something similar.

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,840
-I think you're pretty alone.
I haven't seen anyone else.

72
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,220
The radiator is the only thing I haven't made myself.
It is an aluminum radiator.

73
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,840
The radiator shell and grille covers are self-made.

74
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,360
The grille cover will be water-cut in stainless steel.

75
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,760
It's in progress with this pattern.

76
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,820
The grille will resemble a grid but be much more stable.

77
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,080
This is a sample piece that has
been done with a water jet cutter.

78
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,960
Intake and plates which are located here
are created with a waterjet.

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,340
The exhaust pipe is bent by Ferrita in stainless steel.

80
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
It should now be welded.

81
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,440
It's a big job and it should also be polished.

82
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,900
There are many hours of job until
the exhaust pipe is finished.

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,820
Here I have more waterjet details.

84
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,960
They should be welded together and sit here.

85
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,560
It will becomes the intake.

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,540
There will be a pipe along
the engine where 3 carburetors are located.

87
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,040
-Jesus, what a job!
Yes, it's a puzzle.

88
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,580
-And everything has to be welded and polished?
Yes.

89
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,700
-It'll take an hour or two...
Hahaha.

90
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,360
Here is the size of the rear wheel.

91
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,000
There are 17 "rims but they were not in the right size.

92
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:57,040
I had to buy these rims and cut the rims 
so they would fit the tires I bought.

93
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,440
You can see the joint on the inside.

94
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,180
Trim rings will be mounted
so you don't see the weld joint.

95
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,240
It should be primed before I put on the trim ring.

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,300
The frame and here is the shape of the convertible.
so I'll get an idea who it will look like.

97
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:22,660
All of this is done in aluminum that is 
filled with chemical metal for stability.

98
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,520
Then it becomes like a molded piece.

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,480
The convertible will be glued to this sheet.

100
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,020
So I can fold it down like this.

101
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,280
There is a lock on here on top.

102
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,120
It will be a brass plate with key holes.

103
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,260
And then a spring in stainless steel.

104
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,120
This spring is temporary.

105
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,860
The principle is that a spring is used as a lock.

106
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,520
An exhaust system with silencer in stainless steel.

107
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,040
A classic fishtail piece.

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,900
A strange design on the silencer.

109
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,080
-What about the doors?
They will be completely hand build.

110
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,360
With its own frame clad in aluminum.

111
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,900
The door will stay in this size.

112
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,075
At the rear looks be from the 30's.

113
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,320
Yes, this is a model called boat tail.

114
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,780
It's that it looks like an upside down boat.

115
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,400
In most cases, they did this in one piece.

116
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,660
I've made this as luggage space so I can open it.

117
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,940
This is the body of the truck lid itself.

118
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,760
It's mostly build because for the convertible...

119
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,240
...when I remove convertible I can put it here.

120
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,640
The trunk is made according to the size of the convertible.

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,620
-What is the next part of the project?
Now I'm doing the skeleton on the body.

122
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,200
It is these parts are bent and heated.

123
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,240
All the pieces will be welded.

124
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,360
Then it will be clad in aluminum.

125
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,960
Even these pieces.

126
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,720
First I have to finish the skeleton.

127
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,760
It's a lot of millimeter fit
so it will be right from the beginning.

128
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,100
Here it should be moldings.

129
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,700
This is a stainless steel prototype.

130
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,340
Five trims will be here.

131
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,720
I do this to make it a little more 
alive and not just smooth metal.

132
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,500
And it works as a reinforcement
so it becomes more stable.

133
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,400
Then we have the interior...

134
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,200
I made my own seats in aluminum.

135
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,000
A classic "bomber seat".

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,880
The dashboard I have made my
self and it's rose polished.

137
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,600
Here I will fit a tachometer.

138
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,300
With a pointer from a Mora clock. (longcase clock)

139
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,880
It will be big and clear.

140
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,500
- Let's look at the engines too.

141
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,240
There are 2 Chevrolet Nova
engines at 194 cubic inches.

142
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,480
The engines was in very good condition 
when I bought them but they will renovated.

143
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,040
Inline six were engines were often changed to V8.

144
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,820
The engines was like new.
These engines have gone no further than 18.000 miles.

145
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,040
They looked very nice on the inside.
I will change pistons and bearings etc.

146
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,980
The engines sit together on their own frame.

147
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,620
So they are solid mounted in this frame.

148
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:59,160
That part is suspended with rubber suspensions
in the truck frame so it becomes a unit.

149
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,060
-How do you get the engines running together?
With two machine drives.

150
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,500
One is turned as the flywheel and
the other as the flywheel damper.

151
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,320
But reinforced, the weakest link on this 
engine will be the flywheel damper.

152
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,120
The shaft was thin but I changed it to 
a bigger shaft and added larger gaskets.

153
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,980
And more powerful locking.

154
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,320
It is interconnected
with a double chain.

155
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:36,620
Water pumps are removed so there are electric 
pumps instead which will circulate one engine at a time.

156
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,480
There are dual outlets on the radiator.

157
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,500
That one will be the front engine
and the other to the rear.

158
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:50,640
-The valve cover must be from a cruise ship?
Hahaha!

159
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,100
It is self-made.

160
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,000
I made a tool so did I
could shake this pattern.

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,060
I did that a from smooth plate
and slowly bent it.

162
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,380
It will be grind and polish.

163
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,840
This is the oil filling for the engines.
It will sit two oil caps here.

164
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,360
This one turns into the front engine
and this one to the rear.

165
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,500
-You are the man of details.
That's the fun bit.

166
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,560
You can come up with something then manufacture it.

167
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,040
These are window sockets like used on the inside.

168
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,600
It is spring loaded and
one can adjust the hardness.

169
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,480
They will have locks for inspection hatches on the engine.
I thought the style will fit the car well.

170
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:53,520
Most screws and bolts are recessed.

171
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,800
Back at the 30s everything riveted.

172
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,740
I have made brass rivets.

173
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:08,180
And will be mounted here and glued.
So it looks riveting as it was original.

174
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:14,800
A therapy job when you are a little tired.
Then you can stand by the lathe and do these.

175
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,980
It's just ordinary brass which is polished.

176
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,960
-We are watching the World Cup...
This is going to be something cool.

177
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,660
I hope no one else has done anything like it.
I can almost guarantee that no one has.

178
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,580
-We'll see if there have been any
progress when I come back.

179
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,520
I hope so.

180
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,955
-Thanks for now.
See ya!
