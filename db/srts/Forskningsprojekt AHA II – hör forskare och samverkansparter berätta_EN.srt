1
00:00:03,362 --> 00:00:05,740
- Aha II is an innovation project.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,629
- It is financed by Drive Sweden, which is one of Sweden's 17 innovation programs.

3
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:16,324
It is about human -centered future mobility -

4
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:21,083
–And how we can create new design, visions, concepts, and scenarios -

5
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:26,795
- Based on people's values, knowledge, hopes and fears.

6
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:32,801
–Ad by the main goals of the AHA II project have been contributing a human-centered perspective-

7
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:38,401
- To the possible future or scenarios that we see grow.

8
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:42,681
- We have done this through a process that has been characterized by much cooperation -

9
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:48,288
- Where we wanted to bring together different partners and perspectives with citizens -

10
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:53,071
–And research agendas, to develop a common understanding -

11
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:55,112
- Above what would be the best way to work forward.

12
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:04,322
–A "Urban Living Lab" is used to create a place that can bring together citizens -

13
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:09,265
- Or different stakeholders in a creative and collaborative process.

14
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:18,225
We wanted to use the lab in ways where in different contexts we met people we did not know -

15
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:26,189
- So that the stakeholders and municipalities were also forced to get involved from the perspective - -

16
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,824
- Snakers than from their usual approach.

17
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,485
We asked questions about how we can design solutions with people instead of them.

18
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:45,435
- In our two Urban Living Labs as we established in Helsingborg and Gothenburg -

19
00:01:45,435 --> 00:01:48,625
  - We were brought to a lot of time with the people in place.

20
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:53,258
We have done field work in different ways, we have done workshops.

21
00:01:53,258 --> 00:02:00,307
Together with our stakeholders, we have co -created insights on the material -

22
00:02:00,307 --> 00:02:02,629
- As we then returned to the citizens.

23
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:10,092
  What we have noticed is that social sustainability is a key factor in future mobility.

24
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:14,375
  It may have been ignored so far -

25
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,353
- For what we have noticed is that we need to think about the existing social structures -

26
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:22,087
—To these places and communities -

27
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:25,810
- Otherwise, maybe we just implement, or try to implement -

28
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,160
- Technology that struggles it apart.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,911
The concepts we have created are based on the social values of these places and communities -

30
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:45,480
–And we have seen that they look a little different compared to the usual technical functions -

31
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,286
- As is being done right now.

32
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:51,230
- As we all know and as most people understand -

33
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,180
- So we have a mobility problem all over the world.

34
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,047
We transport things too much and people too much -

35
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:57,655
- And too often and in the wrong way.

36
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:04,486
To solve it, not only for our immediate area, but for the future of the planet in principle -

37
00:03:04,486 --> 00:03:07,181
- So you understand when you are in such a project -

38
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:13,139
–Th that can't be done by making every own party more of what they do today-

39
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:19,536
—This it must be done in some form of consensus together to make it functional for all -

40
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:22,508
- For both cities and people and our nature and planet.

41
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:28,528
  I think that is an important long -term impact such a type of initiative has.

42
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,367
And there should be more, and that should continue.

43
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:35,496
The fact that we sit in the same room where I represent a car manufacturer -

44
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:40,063
- Together with city planners at different levels and we start creating a common language -

45
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:42,541
- We get to know each other's different perspectives on development -

46
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,925
- The time perspective we have on development.

47
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:49,306
- A car will be developed for ten years. A city needs considerably longer -

48
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:50,928
to plan infrastructure.

49
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:55,462
The car industry has developed cars for private individuals who own car -

50
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,027
–And that uses them in a limited way.

51
00:03:58,182 --> 00:04:01,475
–But if we collaborate with other parties such as cities -

52
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:06,511
- Can we create the conditions for sharing a car, charging a car, self -driving cars and so on.

53
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:13,035
A surprising result has been that there is so much value in a trip.

54
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:16,856
A journey is not just getting from point A to B -

55
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:21,503
–What there are a lot of social aspects linked to the trip -

56
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:26,045
–And that these values linked to values that people have -

57
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:28,447
- also controls people's choices.

58
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:33,164
In the ethnographic studies we hear people's own stories.

59
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:40,000
For us who are planning the road transport system, it is very important to find out -

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,882
- For we think and have planned for it to be as effective as possible.

61
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:47,933
–But we need to learn to think in a different way -

62
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:54,345
- And see what it means for our business that the social values are so important.

63
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:57,563
I think we have an increased understanding of each other's challenges -

64
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:05,810
- There maybe companies go in with their solutions that they believe and think that society needs -

65
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,487
- or that the individuals demand.

66
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:12,938
- And we are planning a city from our perspectives and how we usually do.

67
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:17,697
But in the AHA project one has been based on man in itself and the needs of man-

68
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,000
–And that's probably what has been, for me personally anyway -

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,476
- Very interesting to think about it instead.

70
00:05:22,476 --> 00:05:25,260
Does this actually work for those who will use this in the end?

71
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,657
Can we do something together where we both meet -

72
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:30,216
What actually needs the residents and society?

73
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:37,411
In order for it to be a mobility that is valuable to every human being in the future -

74
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,124
- Then we have to understand each other and we must actually have -

75
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:45,799
- May not be exactly the same vision, but we must have an understanding for each other.

76
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:50,964
Today I think we many people think we know what we do -

77
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:58,833
- So that I, from a company's side, I think know what the city stands for and has -

78
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,833
- And the same thing back.

79
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:05,537
- This makes us many times develop and produce things -

80
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,178
- As we are not really matched with.

81
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:12,142
When the academy comes in and has a research project -

82
00:06:12,142 --> 00:06:17,798
- So it becomes a neutral ground where we can actually discuss and debate.

83
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:22,404
- Out of this, we actually have several other likely partners and stakeholders -

84
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:25,987
- As is around us who must also be part of this dialogue.

85
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:31,671
It has been super important to actually meet -

86
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:36,501
- And talk and discuss mobility and what we want.

87
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:43,039
- For first, I would say that we created a method that actually brings together -

88
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,815
–Odic stakeholders around a human -centered -

89
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:50,166
–And also planet -centered agenda.

90
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:55,841
- For the other, we have created these two concepts -

91
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:58,874
- That could be applied in any environment.

92
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:04,543
But in order to enter the implementation phase you really need to be careful -

93
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:07,622
—The to the people you design with -

94
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:13,575
–And bring in those elements into the concepts and create actual -

95
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:19,566
- I would not call it solutions, I would say opportunities -

96
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:24,900
- For people to use these things according to their own logics.
