00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:05,467
Hello there! Warm welcome to Lund University and debate in Lund,

2
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:10,976
The forum where some of the university's sharpest brains get the chance to

3
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:17,120
Freight off with you and with carefully selected and invited guests.

4
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:24,234
This is a television program in which we do not hesitate to make visibly simple things even more complicated.

5
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:27,067
We do this because this is a university, we are not afraid of it.

6
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:30,688
We want to turn around and turn things, preferably with you and we do

7
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
According to the principles that debate in Lund has been established for over ten years now.

8
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,594
We have debated exactly everything you can think of under heaven and earth

9
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:43,734
but we try to do it in a way that leaves you with new questions

10
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
And not just ready -made answers.

11
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,853
To succeed, you need to have a fantastic panel that you should just get to meet.

12
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:52,434
My name is Andreas Ekström,

13
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:55,734
Is a program manager today and is available everyday at Sydsvenskan's editorial staff.

14
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,432
We turn to the stage! We have a debate that will be about meritocracy today.

15
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:08,064
And to take on what we first Martin Wolgast, a psychologist and researcher. Welcome Martin!

16
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
Thanks so much.

17
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,034
Nina Björk has been able to hike up to the Academic Association today because you are Lundabo.

18
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:17,280
Warm welcome!

19
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,231
While the author and columnist Lena Andersson has been allowed to travel anyway from Stockholm,

20
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,727
We thank you for that. Welcome here.

21
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,300
Last but not least we also meet Max Benner

22
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,634
which is the principal of the School of Economics at Lund University.

23
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:33,152
Hello Mats, welcome.

24
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,575
Since we are going to discuss such an interesting topic as meritocracy, I think we believe

25
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,355
must start by defining the question itself, all panelists should do so,

26
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,975
What we mean by meritocracy.

27
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,047
The best thing, however, is that we have to find out

28
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,143
How these four have qualified to sit in this panel.

29
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
You are a little curious about that anyway.

30
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Martin Wolgast,

31
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,127
which is here at Lund University. Now you have to tell us a little neighbor what it is like

32
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:09,000
motivates and what to merit you to be with an evening like this one.

33
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,067
Yes, that is an interesting question. I suspect it is because I have written and published

34
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,183
a part about discrimination in working life

35
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
And how social inequality is recreated.

36
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,300
Among other things in a report that we released last fall

37
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:30,367
Where, among other things, we discuss meritocracy and ideologies about eritocracy

38
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,234
And their role in recreating inequalities.

39
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,000
It sounds extremely merit I think.

40
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Nina Björk.

41
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,634
You came out with a book last year that I suspect may have to do with your merit

42
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,063
for this evening but you have to decide for yourself how you want

43
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Present yourself on this issue.

44
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
Yeah i'd probably think that is

45
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,537
And not just that I could go here.

46
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:53,791
I wrote this one

47
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,334
"If one loves freedom" and the first chapter in it is called

48
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,215
"When does the competition for meritocracy start?".

49
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,311
So that's probably why someone thought of me.

50
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,400
I think so, too, I who have some insight into the process has gone.

51
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
Lena Andersson, you have written

52
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,039
about many things, many carrying

53
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,645
Cutting points you have moved to in the public debate for many years in Dagens Nyheter,

54
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,671
Now Svenska Dagbladet.

55
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:25,023
What can it be that makes meritocracy a question for you?

56
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,600
Yes, but an important point here is that it is the editorial staff that knows the answer to that question.

57
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,434
So there is someone who chooses who should sit here.

58
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:37,055
I haven't chosen it myself.

59
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,151
They asked me but if I should take and guess what it is about it is enough to

60
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,000
I wrote about it, a text last year,

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,807
There has been some debate about this so I wrote a column.

62
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,000
And then I was apostropized in one

63
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,667
Underline in Swedish last winter, I don't know if it matters.

64
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,700
As you answered later.

65
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
Any philosopher who wrote about this,

66
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
We were both wrong, I think he thought.

67
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,007
You should have room to prove the opposite here now just right, of course few

68
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,567
Rub yourself against the views as well.

69
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:13,407
Mats Benner, who leads the School of Economics, which is the Faculty of Economic at this university.

70
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
What places you on this chair?

71
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
I lost a bet.

72
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
I do not know.

73
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,879
I am also wrong, maybe

74
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,719
and have been interested in me litigant for the question of

75
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,700
Knowledge is power or whether power is knowledge.

76
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,940
You have a solid background in researching research, if you express it, so,

77
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,200
Tell us a little about it, what are you looking at there?

78
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:45,067
The research is absolutely absolute. It's all about, maybe not the truth, but approach it.

79
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,167
At the same time it is a social process,

80
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,223
it is about

81
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,063
Groups, constellations and other things and how those two things are interconnected.

82
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:58,367
One raw meritocratic and the other raw social.

83
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,000
Would you be able to say, I do not know.

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,375
No, but I thought that sounded very interesting. I think we can find a little different

85
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,934
Both common views and disparate views in this gang.

86
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:18,034
If we start by saying that you may say each thing that

87
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,367
motivates why a metro -crocatic system has its points.

88
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,800
You do not have to fully decide that you are connecting to all forms of,

89
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,034
You do not have to be so drastic or complete in this answer but we start some end.

90
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,023
What are the obvious benefits of having a system based on we

91
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,815
formally merit us for assignments?

92
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:41,700
It would be a partial component in such cases in what is usually mean by meritocracy.

93
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:47,467
It would be to have some kind of prejudicial recruitment

94
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,634
Or some kind of prejudice -free selection process.

95
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Can you?

96
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
No.

97
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,234
Okay, you'll have to immerse just here.

98
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,343
Nina, what can be good about looking at the formal merits?

99
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Yes.

100
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,791
That we don't think "yes, but I know her or him",

101
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,100
I can pay to get this place or punch in any context.

102
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
About the same thing as ...

103
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,383
What does Lena say? As defended the system perhaps the clearest of all of us here.

104
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,500
Thus, this with meritocracy is a conceptual confusion as with many concepts but

105
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,867
It is an organizational principle for how to appoint

106
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,767
Positions where demand is greater than the supply.

107
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,400
Any principle must be had for how to go about

108
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
And this is a principle.

109
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,300
It replaced historically then that

110
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:58,400
The aristocracy received the items that they considered was best.

111
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,343
But it was also a kind of meritocracy because then they thought they were the best.

112
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,234
For genetic reasons?

113
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:09,500
Yes, for genetic reasons. So meritocracy is a very natural system for us,

114
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
We find it natural to

115
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
The one who is good at something does it.

116
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
So it is very difficult to get around it.

117
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,627
And it must also be the same in the university world that you specialize in,

118
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:22,200
there the meritocracy is the only one almost as one recognizes openly

119
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,567
is what determines who gets a job.

120
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:25,568
That's how it is.

121
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,991
No, it's good for talking to Churchills

122
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,087
Definition of democracy: The worst system we have minus everyone else.

123
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:40,200
So that it is extremely incorrect and hollow and other but what is the alternative?

124
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:42,047
Yes, about what Lena said, burden.

125
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,911
But it is fun because now you take us into the next step that you are curious about.

126
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,239
Give up what is bad then give you what we lose.

127
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,634
What is not good about this way? If you start in your world, the university world.

128
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:57,400
But it is probably the illusion that it is complete,

129
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
Without it, it is like all systems that it is important to

130
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,234
Carpentry and hammer based on its imperfections.

131
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,134
If you look at the meritocracy, after all

132
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
This panel had looked different 40 years ago.

133
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,834
I don't think anyone with the experiences we have been sitting in such a panel then.

134
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,059
Why not?

135
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,263
Because there were other norms and conceptions of what was interesting

136
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,767
Positions and attitudes then.

137
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,735
In your world it is so that you can appeal, you are looking for a job,

138
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
a lecturer, one is looking for a professorship

139
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
and so you don't get it

140
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,967
Since someone else has been considered in overall assessment more suitable, thus has better qualifications,

141
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,023
Then you have an opportunity in the university world to appeal this decision

142
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
And so do many.

143
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,567
Everything former but it occurs.

144
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:53,727
But then at least I react as a layman on the basis that

145
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,700
I do not want to hire someone who not only accepts that he or she is not selected in that situation,

146
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,367
Keep on and appeal, I don't want an accident into the gang.

147
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,967
It is a merit for me that the relevant appeals,

148
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,831
It is directly a cultural influence of the culture that exists in appeal.

149
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,434
What does it look like at the university?

150
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:13,667
It is fine, that you can question. It is

151
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:18,700
positive with meritocracy, that you can have a discussion about which qualifications are valida

152
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,839
And how it has been assessed.

153
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Because that's what the appeal is about.

154
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Of course there is after all

155
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,591
Emotional overtones in appeals but they are still a kind

156
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,634
Opportunity to question notions of what is good and right.

157
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,783
May I say I have,

158
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,600
My entrance to the meritocracy is to

159
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
it is the way of our time to

160
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:53,367
Legitimize an unequal society and just as you said, historically it would not be we who sat here.

161
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,467
But before, one could legitimize inequality in a society by the fact that

162
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:03,034
Say that some people were actually more worthy than others, by burden.

163
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,223
Men stand over women, the white race superior other breeds.

164
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,855
Then one could refer to God's will or nature, it is founded,

165
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
It is natural, biologically determined.

166
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,067
Then it also becomes natural to take an unequal society if people are very worthy,

167
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,607
Then society should be a pyramid and a hierarchy.

168
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
But today we think that all people are equally worthy,

169
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,495
No one is automatically born to a superior position.

170
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,767
Then you might think you don't want one,

171
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,634
If all people are equally worthy that you do not want a pyramid without a flat ground.

172
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,534
But many people think that it is important with inequality and that we

173
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,752
shall continue to live in an unequal society.

174
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:49,439
How do you do it when you then assume that everyone is equally worthy?

175
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:56,034
Then I mean that one uses the meritocracy as a legitimation for the new inequality,

176
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,167
to defend inequality.

177
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,400
To maintain an unequal system.

178
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:06,200
Yes and that the meritocracy is nevertheless

179
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
founded in things that one does not recognize.

180
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
The defenders of meritocracy say it will be about

181
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,551
the individual's own achievements, own merits,

182
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
own choices, own efforts

183
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
so that an individual should not be placed

184
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,534
somewhere because of skin color or sex.

185
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,534
I have a feeling that you could get fire support from Martin Wolgast at that point.

186
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,900
No, because it's not about being, or of course, that's for sure,

187
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,434
that you discriminate, you have prejudice and therefore do not see the same merit as the same

188
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:40,100
Depending on who has done it, so to speak.

189
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,734
But I mean the meritocracy could not disregard inheritance

190
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,343
Because we are not born the same,

191
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
We are not genetically the same

192
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:56,511
and some people have a greater apt to learn the things that just our time reward,

193
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,534
Just as some people were stronger and snabbers when it was important,

194
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,167
so some have an innate

195
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,334
Easy to learn merit paths through school and understand what the school is all about.

196
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,529
Or a congenital skin color that can come on well maybe.

197
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:14,434
What do you say about it Martin?

198
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:17,503
I think it's important to keep some things apart here.

199
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,800
I mean that meritocracy is something more than what Lena defined it as,

200
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,159
a way to add individual services.

201
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
We have other concepts for that,

202
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
we could call it for

203
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:31,000
that we try to recruit on skills or something similar.

204
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,367
Meritocracy for me is, if one is to understand it in a larger context, is a way to distribute,

205
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,799
Based on what principles we want status, resources and power

206
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,359
Should be distributed in our society in a broader way.

207
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,667
And then, just like Nina, I think that then meritocracy says that it should

208
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,039
is based on some kind of principle as we

209
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,135
legitimate based on the fact that one has earned the position you have,

210
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,439
based on efforts and talent or something similar.

211
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,800
I think that is a very difficult position to defend

212
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,900
When we see what society looks like. I mean that meritocracy

213
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
is problematic for that number one:

214
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,767
does not work in practice.

215
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:16,895
We are born to overly unequal conditions both socially and

216
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,434
Genetic factors that Nina highlighted.

217
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,567
I also mean that it is worrying to try to strive for increased meritocracy

218
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
in that way because

219
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
What we risk getting into is that when we do

220
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,234
So we reinforce the place these differences.

221
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:38,399
It will be this legitimation and maintenance of the hierarchies instead.

222
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
We see that quite clearly in research that the greater, the greater

223
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,034
The greater extent one encompasses meritocratic principles, the more negative one is to measures such as

224
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:51,467
would benefit disadvantaged groups and equalize differences in society.

225
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,500
But how else should you get up then,

226
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,063
If one does not have these conditions, if you do not have these

227
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
genetic or these good parents.

228
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:06,300
So you should still get out without contacts, without your social habituation, how to do it?

229
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
Then the meritocracy is your only rescue?

230
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Or?

231
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Yes but ...

232
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
One often assumes that we must have inequality

233
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
But we don't have to.

234
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,134
And if we think about what meritocracy is,

235
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:26,783
It is to place the most suitable person in the right place.

236
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Fine, fine.

237
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
It is possible but the National Encyclopedia,

238
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:36,255
Should I quote “Meritocracy Definition:

239
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
Social order in which individuals are ranked

240
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:45,727
and social rewards, income status, distributed according to ability and merits, often valued

241
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
after the training fair's qualifications. ”

242
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:52,127
So it is not only a suitable person in the appropriate place but it is also that the person

243
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
should be able to get

244
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
other rewards than to

245
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
be in a place there

246
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
It hopefully comes into its own.

247
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:06,975
Without different rewards it would be easier to

248
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,534
realize the freedom of the individual,

249
00:18:10,534 --> 00:18:13,334
To do what it actually has to do.

250
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,423
For now if you choose certain roads,

251
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,775
If you have the opportunity to choose certain roads, then you get so much. One gets money,

252
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
You get status, you also get longer life,

253
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
Several years with health.

254
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,199
You know everything that follows from having

255
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,234
A high -paid position in society.

256
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,855
If you didn't have it, we would certainly

257
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
still probably have so that some

258
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:43,467
Qualities that you have are more fun to develop and work with.

259
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,935
But it should be no more than it is fun to do what you are good at.

260
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,467
And it would require an equal society.

261
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,615
I think you emphasized this with merit a little too much.

262
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
In English

263
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
distinguishes between merit and value,

264
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
So that one has moral,

265
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
one can be very

266
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:10,900
Good, dutiful, you do what you need to.

267
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:16,863
There is a great moral merit in this but do you have any value for someone else

268
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
Is not obvious.

269
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
The system we have

270
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
is based on that

271
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,919
people are chosen to things, if you look for things you want to do

272
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:35,551
and so we are in a market where there is free competition and so you pay people for it

273
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,135
they do and so corresponds to that

274
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,463
what someone wants, corresponds like someone who wants to do it and so

275
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,234
occurs an exchange of money.

276
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
And everything that comes with this.

277
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:54,751
So I think it is mixed up with this that you

278
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,311
is deserved by that.

279
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,718
You don't have to be.

280
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:03,711
I agree with you, there are different things. And some defends, after all,

281
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Now I mean,

282
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
my criticism of meritocracy

283
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,300
is aimed at those who defend it as a fair system.

284
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,734
And with merits then that in some way you should do valuable and such.

285
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,534
But it is a moral defense. The second defense is:

286
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:24,191
“Yeah, it was so that someone was prepared to pay,

287
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Yes, then it became so ”.

288
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
It is a market principle and it can be

289
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,908
But then you have also said that the people who are going to decide

290
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:34,431
What someone else should do are the ones who have money.

291
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,610
So you decide that an individual is a money holder.

292
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,567
No, it is the one who needs a service that is.

293
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:41,087
Yes, if it doesn't have money

294
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
So it may need as much as possible.

295
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,848
Yes, but if you buy a service otherwise ...

296
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:45,439
Yes, but buy.

297
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:52,867
So then we have decided that the market principle is that

298
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
Individuals act as

299
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,215
money holders and sheep

300
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
Access to other people's services,

301
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
power resources in relation to its money holding.

302
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
And it's no one,

303
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,700
That in itself is a morality, you have to store it in that case and say

304
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,087
“I think it's right

305
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,634
That anyone who has money should have it better ”.

306
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
Can you break in here? According to the debate rules, you just have to throw in so I do.

307
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,448
Looking at the history behind the concept

308
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:35,600
Meritocracy, after all, was a criticism of an ourritocracy meritocracy.

309
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,432
The name when determined that there were certain proportions

310
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,000
that were study -motivated or not study -motivated,

311
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,534
It was really a criticism

312
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,488
against not introducing it as in Sweden to compulsory school in the UK.

313
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,584
The argument was that one third is needed that is

314
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,960
Manual Labor, one third is needed who are officials and need a third as

315
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,967
Consumers for happy life, roughly.

316
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
So you could say it was

317
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,920
a kind of reconciliation around that

318
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,200
The talent is like static.

319
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,481
The whole idea of our elementary school that is some kind of meritocratic meritocracy,

320
00:22:18,481 --> 00:22:19,904
at least as a idea of origin,

321
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
It was that

322
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
There is a so -called talent reserve.

323
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:30,834
So there are experiences, roles and positions that are not recognized by today's system,

324
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
It is important to avoid being filtered away

325
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,734
in the name of a static division of places and positions.

326
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:46,784
We all feel close to the hope that there are meritocratic features in meritocracy, much like

327
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
democracy,

328
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,600
Someone said jokingly that one quit

329
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,600
say the truth of the Riksdag after the right to vote became general,

330
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,584
Because then you could no longer say as it was.

331
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
And of course it was a huge meaning,

332
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
a disadvantage of democracy,

333
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,032
It was no longer the elites that speak to each other.

334
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,834
Why couldn't you tell the truth when the right to vote became general, they meant?

335
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:15,667
Because then Parliament consisted of all possible

336
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,808
places and positions and experiences. Then it was no longer the elites,

337
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
This was then said out of a

338
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,934
Not a meritocratic perspective, that it was better than when they were fixed positions.

339
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,367
An ideal way with a meritocratic system understands its own limitations.

340
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,008
She says there is now something we miss here, there is talent or

341
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
competence or something else.

342
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,947
There is a very famous example of that.

343
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:44,896
I think it was the Symphony Orchestra in Toronto that was first with this,

344
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,736
That when you hire musicians, you simply start letting them play behind a screen,

345
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:53,088
they may go in without shoes so one could not imagine if it was a man or a woman who stepped in

346
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,834
to the instrument and then they got to play.

347
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,184
Then they recruited much more women than you did before.

348
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
But what we have to hold on is if we talk about the principle or how it is implemented,

349
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
implemented in reality.

350
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,800
It is still all the time in all examples we arrive at

351
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,312
That you should try to take the most appropriate.

352
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,200
It is very difficult to get around.

353
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,067
Yes, but the meritocracy consists of two parts and

354
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:20,000
I agree that you can call it something else.

355
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:23,449
The suitability section is part and the reward part is another part.

356
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:27,701
Then it is also as you say you can have a point of view

357
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:30,834
that the most deserving will come at the top

358
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,571
or so one might have the point of view that

359
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,963
"Yes, it doesn't have to be deserving, it was lucky perhaps he found something

360
00:24:35,963 --> 00:24:37,700
As many with money want '

361
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,680
And then it comes at the top.

362
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,067
Then we have no human assessment scales or needs,

363
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,592
Then do not think but then we count and so it comes at the top.

364
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,128
And there are different things.

365
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,456
Comes at the top of the form of getting money do you mean?

366
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:57,088
Yes, it gets money and it gets power. If you buy other people's labor, you get power after all

367
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
And it gets status and so on.

368
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,256
I don't like that system either.

369
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,144
The problem with the meritocracy that one describes an unequal society as it is fair,

370
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
Like it could be fair.

371
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:16,800
Even if you do not know if it is a woman or man and then you hire more women means that,

372
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,974
the defenders of meritocracy would also say that it is not good

373
00:25:22,974 --> 00:25:25,248
Because there should be no discrimination.

374
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,808
But I mean it can never build on

375
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:33,400
Something other than inherited factors and then there is nothing that separates the meritocracy ...

376
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,048
Then there is nothing that legitimizes our inequality

377
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
in a different way than when legitimized

378
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:45,216
inequality in the past but there are still inherited factors over which individuals do not have,

379
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,100
It does not choose this.

380
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,600
But when you say this legitimizes an unequal system,

381
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,900
so do you base it on the idea that man's

382
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,267
Natural conditions are equality, Rousseau.

383
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:04,014
And then we are destroyed by society.

384
00:26:04,014 --> 00:26:06,600
I don't know if it is natural or unnatural but it is something we can strive ...

385
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,700
The word legitimize, it sounds like someone is insidious.

386
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,838
I think it's insidious because no one is saying

387
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:19,700
"We want an unequal system based on unfair things like birth".

388
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,067
Yes, it does if you ...

389
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:21,661
You might do it.

390
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:22,200
Yes I do.

391
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,367
Then I think it is honorable of you.

392
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:25,920
I do this because freedom leads to inequality,

393
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
So it is.

394
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,784
So if people are allowed to be free and shape their lives, it will not be the same life.

395
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
No.

396
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:37,000
And then we can say that we have a society that can make these different lives

397
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,013
Really can be different.

398
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,767
You like to do it, I like to do it but no one should have to die earlier than anyone else.

399
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,912
But there will be different status, we will never come from different status for people will value

400
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
this.

401
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,734
What you have done is to see through the social liberals.

402
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,152
Because they feel so bad that their freedom leads to inequality.

403
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,834
That is what you have seen in your texts.

404
00:27:00,862 --> 00:27:04,534
I think that is good that they feel bad but I think they should know that they are feeling bad.

405
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:12,600
But you ignore it, that it will be, you are not social liberal ...

406
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,718
If I get to break in then I think

407
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:18,912
That it is very interesting to discuss ideas on a principle level

408
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
but the risk is that we somehow forget

409
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,000
the social reality that the ideas are in

410
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,067
And in what social function in some way.

411
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:34,934
There I think there is a great contrast to meritocracy,

412
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:40,672
Parts of what was meritocracy anyway, this is not being able to inherit positions through burden.

413
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
Yes, it was radically once in a while,

414
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,256
Today it is not very radical.

415
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
Today I mean that an ideology

416
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,934
who say that, which I think meritocracy is, so it is used socially, politically,

417
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,728
In the political conversation,

418
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,056
who say that successes in society are determined by

419
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:01,664
one's performance in one way or another, that's the society we have, in some way.

420
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,760
It is a system, it is an ideology that

421
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,302
Defends and recreates the differences.

422
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:12,400
I also think you see it clearly empirically.

423
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,034
In recent decades, we see a trend towards increased inequality, increased segregation.

424
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:22,400
In research you can see that it also leads to that,

425
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
In a society that is segregated you get less

426
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,800
insight into the living conditions of others

427
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,128
And the unequal conditions that can shape people.

428
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,248
Which in turn leads to the fact that you think "I have made a lot of effort for what I have achieved",

429
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,200
Because you compare with others who have had the same conditions I have had.

430
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,160
These are the ones I can compare myself to

431
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,534
And then you see that I have plugged really hard, I have struggled and I have one and the other.

432
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:53,632
And then you get an increased confidence that the profits I have made, what I have achieved,

433
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:57,472
I have done this because of my own efforts,

434
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264
one encompasses to a greater extent

435
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,209
meritocratic ideal or that one thinks that is what is to rule

436
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:07,267
And that society also a ruling on meritocratic factors.

437
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,034
Which in turn leads to the fact that one thinks that when it comes to political suggestions

438
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,880
which is about equalizing differences in

439
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:19,488
Living conditions and conditions so do you think "why should we do it? I have fought for this"

440
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:24,534
And then you have a closed circle back to continued increased inequality.

441
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,912
In this way I mean that it is interconnected and then you can

442
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,756
discuss based on the kind of principle idea world,

443
00:29:29,756 --> 00:29:33,568
it already made Plato who meant that we should have a meritocratic

444
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,968
System then we need to abolish the family and everything because that is where you end up in the end

445
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:44,576
If one is to discuss based on some kind of ideal, as well as the world of ideas in some way.

446
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:49,185
It is a way to go and we can discuss it from such a strict philosophical perspective

447
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:50,720
And what consequences it could have.

448
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
Another perspective is to see

449
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:58,912
What does the social reality look like, what does the ideology of meritocracy for functions out

450
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,704
At our workplaces in our working life?

451
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,288
And there I mean that it is no longer,

452
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,944
It no longer fulfills the function that meritocratic ideologies break down hierarchies

453
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
but on the contrary,

454
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,267
It preserves hierarchies in our organizations.

455
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:19,002
Then opponents must be able to claim that there should be hierarchies.

456
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:25,024
The best doctor is happy to be the manager of the other doctors, it feels like the health care is getting better then.

457
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,034
Or maybe the best manager should be the manager?

458
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,967
Yes, you can think of that too but it is not certain that every person who has good

459
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:33,472
Manager characteristics are a good manager in everyone, but you have to measure it.

460
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,520
It is not unthinkable that the one who has it

461
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,848
The biggest expertise will also be the best to decide the most.

462
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,634
Can you imagine Nina, a system where you keep the hierarchy in that,

463
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:52,416
It is inevitable with a certain social status, we have war right now, you can then be a trauma surgeon in Ukraine

464
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,256
So follows a status of it but you do not receive a higher salary than the one who does other tasks.

465
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,536
Can one imagine separating,

466
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,864
Status you can never do anything about in any society but you can do anything about economics.

467
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,728
Can you imagine, what keeps a meritocracy that only rewards status but not money?

468
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,312
Yes, I want us to have equal pay for different work.

469
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,734
And that's exactly it. But that does not mean that I think we should draw about who should ...

470
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:16,934
But then it will be that some will be managers, some will have

471
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:19,296
Greater freedom to shape their work life maybe.

472
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,112
You don't get around that outcome.

473
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:28,000
It is clear that some will have more fun jobs.

474
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,034
But when you give one everything,

475
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,400
thus one gives both money, status, longevity

476
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,704
And own power over everyday life and everything.

477
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,776
Then it becomes like such a direction.

478
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
But I think you can compensate.

479
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,534
If we are going to go into cultural things as well.

480
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:49,467
I'll tell you a little story about Mats Benner sitting away on one edge.

481
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:54,624
About 1.5-2 years ago, Lund University would appoint a new principal.

482
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,492
It goes in a very special way that you know.

483
00:31:57,492 --> 00:32:01,024
It is based on people nominating the colleagues they think could be appropriate.

484
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
Then it is an advanced process with many steps.

485
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,422
Then I think Mats Benner was genuinely shocked to find himself on the so -called short list,

486
00:32:09,422 --> 00:32:11,264
with a small few candidates left.

487
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,408
When Mats was interviewed in Sydsvenskan and so he could only with difficulty as well as deal with

488
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,504
That he was so moved and like it was very shocking.

489
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,766
I wonder if it wasn't extremely merit, Mats, that you genuinely

490
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:28,034
Be so surprised that so many people think you were a good principal candidate.

491
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,976
And now you are the principal at the School of Economics as well.

492
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
It makes me think

493
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:37,120
What Peter Englund in the Swedish Academy once said when I interviewed him and asked him

494
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,568
"How do people do, they tell you that they want to join the Swedish Academy or not?"

495
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,752
And then he said with some cold:

496
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,034
"The rise is not a merit".

497
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
These are strong words.

498
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,767
I want to hear a little about the university culture, that's why I took this story.

499
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:55,767
Can't you imagine that there is a kind of triangulation here?

500
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,034
Meritocracy and market have a little

501
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:05,500
tricky relationship with each other but they both respond to some

502
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,096
driving force or ambitions we have.

503
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
Thus the meritocracy that we want

504
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,034
Read or write or we want to mark ourselves in one way or another.

505
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:20,567
The market is still a kind, yes.

506
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,712
It has turned out that there is a certain person ...

507
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,552
There is some connection between reward and effort.

508
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,184
But when meritocracy and market are roughly mixed, I can only mention as for example, on,

509
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,840
And it is a guessing competition to the moderator, what percentage of the grades at Princeton University

510
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:42,144
Is A, so the highest rating?

511
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,500
Certainly much more than we think, I would like to be 40, 50%.

512
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,000
70%. And counting.

513
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,640
Because there you pay there to get a tip rating.

514
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,248
Because it costs $ 60,000 a year and read there so there is a strong

515
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,767
Power and Åtundan.

516
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:04,218
It is a corrupt system, after all, we must say that.

517
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:10,434
It is clear that they live in a certain critical balance those two.

518
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:13,376
What I would like to add the third, now I do not say that I am devoting myself to it,

519
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,936
But you could call that care.

520
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,100
So a kind of care about the profession or what you do.

521
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:25,233
What I thought if you are now asking me right up and down,

522
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:27,712
Why did I be so shocked because it is clear that

523
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
the care of a university it is that

524
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,416
It is a kind of workers' municipality you can say or a worker collective.

525
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,200
It is governed by colleagues for colleagues but

526
00:34:40,255 --> 00:34:44,607
In and for society. It is a huge confidence really. So then I mean,

527
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:49,216
Then you can't immediately think that this should I lead over or

528
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,032
boss over without here I must have confidence

529
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:57,334
And it should be merit with the ride.

530
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,736
But one cannot imagine that it is actually that some people's

531
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:05,344
Håg stands for a strategic management assignment and they merit by having

532
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,591
Leadership tasks at a lower level and then you say now I am prepared for this, now I am enough

533
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:11,744
Up my hand, now I'm prepared to take responsibility. This is how it works the rest of society normally.

534
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,792
One goes from being

535
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,167
Any CFO to be Deputy CEO to be CEO by showing "I want this".

536
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:20,704
But when appointing university rector and pope

537
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,752
Can't show that you are interested.

538
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,056
It is culturally interesting anyway.

539
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,034
But it is very difficult to know what that task really is.

540
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,456
The one sitting and

541
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,016
imagine what it means to lead

542
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,832
In any business I would say but not least

543
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:42,208
A creative and somewhat unpredictable business, universities are wrong with it.

544
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
Without it, it is important to be within some kind of balance between

545
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:50,067
The one I myself am the organism that I am a part of.

546
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,704
I think it's the three really,

547
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,752
So pure meritocracy

548
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,700
need some kind of relationship with the market

549
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,176
But they also need a kind of care so that you do not end up in that situation ...

550
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,528
One should not resemble the outside world at that point.

551
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,842
No, but it becomes clear.

552
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:12,928
If we return to Plato, he also writes in the same book that the person who will control the state

553
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
may not want to do that.

554
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,560
So this an ancient, deeply human

555
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
Insight that there is something suspicious that you want power.

556
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
There is something suspicious about it.

557
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,496
One should not want to control over others,

558
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,800
You should go there reluctantly.

559
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,634
Do the panel think it is a good principle, overall?

560
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,552
Yes, too much yster in enthusiasm is always a bit strange.

561
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,034
Whatever the matter? Well, I don't think so.

562
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,208
If we go back, that is, too,

563
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,034
Present positions always the lectures of others. You have to be able to go back.

564
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:54,912
For it is the reverse meritocracy that one can accept another position

565
00:36:56,192 --> 00:37:00,034
If you now think it is on loan.

566
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,415
But what is justice then?

567
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:07,712
Yes, but the mathematically objectively best suited person is not there

568
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:12,832
for particularly many assignments after all or for different types of status regulation without it is about someone

569
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:19,232
Vag cocktail with different ingredients when we finally decide what is fair or merit.

570
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,500
Can we bare a little in what we mean by justice?

571
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,608
Does Lena want to start?

572
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,000
No, it's too hard.

573
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,467
I think that too, that's why I ask you.

574
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,288
The whole state is about justice or

575
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,592
righteousness as the Swedish translation is

576
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:42,167
And they do not come up with what it is so it is a very difficult concept.

577
00:37:42,167 --> 00:37:51,167
You could say that justice is that the person who is deserving of something should get it, you can say is justice.

578
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
And then what it is to be deserved is another issue.

579
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:00,448
But in any case it is very natural to us I would like to say that

580
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:05,312
Know when someone is very undeserved. So do we think why should it do that?

581
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,616
So we seem to have any feeling of legal?

582
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:11,456
However, for example, when the hosts get a Caribbean sail that was

583
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
Current 35 years ago

584
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,832
That they would get to come up with better thoughts in life.

585
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,550
So it became a scream even though it would then be positive for their rehabilitation

586
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,734
and return to a non-criminal life

587
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,096
So maybe you think they would have to go to

588
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,400
The North Pole or something that is

589
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:34,752
Hard, not so nice, not enviable.

590
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,920
Here you can say that you have made an effort by not becoming a criminal, it is a kind of effort.

591
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,968
For some anyway.

592
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:52,300
No, but for everyone. You still have to decide to follow the law and take care of yourself.

593
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,700
So it's not just that, now I disappear here.

594
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,700
Yes, you do a little neighbor.

595
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:04,367
I think you should think that justice and injustice are not in nature, it is as it is.

596
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,264
Some are born with some abilities, you can't say that is unfair.

597
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,312
It is not unfair that someone

598
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,867
Is good that way so that it is rewarded in our society.

599
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,456
However, when that,

600
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,016
But when it's so

601
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
because of this as just

602
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,904
existed that people have not decided so people can either decide to

603
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:30,500
Yes, we shall reinforce this or we should not reinforce the advantage anyone can have through their birth

604
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,608
or the disadvantage of being born

605
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,900
handicapped or something.

606
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,400
There, man comes in and there you can create justice or injustice.

607
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,264
For justice and injustice

608
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,872
Is always a human issue, always a social and cultural question not a natural issue.

609
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,593
But you have also used the concept of "the competing man" at some point when we have talked

610
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:50,528
Before this.

611
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:55,156
A meritocracy also means that we stand side by side on a starting line

612
00:39:55,156 --> 00:39:57,440
And then we will get to some kind of goal.

613
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,034
Anyone who comes first comes in different ways to be privileged.

614
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
How does it take

615
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,320
The contemporary man to live in this constant competition?

616
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,448
Is it that it must be so all the way from

617
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,008
That we were monkeys or is it a chosen system?

618
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,267
So I don't think there's a

619
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,664
necessity in that communities are based on competition that people's

620
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,504
Natural relationship when you meet another person is to compete with her.

621
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,552
I do not think so.

622
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,344
In our society it is, after all,

623
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
We live in a competitive society and it starts ...

624
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,512
That's what you talk about social liberals. They have a little trouble taking the competition to start when

625
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:37,367
You start the six -year business, that's when you start qualifying and competing for the grades

626
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,912
And so on, it turns out,

627
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,960
They do not arrive at the starting line at the same time.

628
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
We must compensate for that.

629
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:47,616
Then we have to remove the children from the parents so that the competition can be fair.

630
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Not many people want to.

631
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,760
Then it is also the case that if we say we should have a competition

632
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:57,034
Then we also say that we have to behave in the same way

633
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,150
To win, to achieve success because one cannot have a competition there

634
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,696
Each and every other goes on their own desire.

635
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:07,840
Have you arranged a competition in running and someone feels they want to jump instead of running,

636
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,167
Now the races start and then it starts to jump, it will not win that competition.

637
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:16,234
All competitions make us uniform,

638
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:21,400
They force us to behave in the same way, strive for the same things.

639
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,534
It is interesting Martin, after all,

640
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:27,634
Then I have to ask you as a scientist, you look around among your colleagues,

641
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:30,368
You read international literature in the same research field as you.

642
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,530
How homogeneous and heterogeneous manage the university to be

643
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:37,024
When you still observe these methods?

644
00:41:37,034 --> 00:41:40,608
After all, you live in the same psychological and social reality as everyone else.

645
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:45,667
It is very homogeneous and that is what I mean we need to see,

646
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,288
People do not run around and make decisions in a vacuum.

647
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,312
So it is not

648
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:55,711
a result of free choice that it is three times as common for children to highly educated parents

649
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
Studying further after high school

650
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,551
As a child of low -educated parents.

651
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,111
It is not a result of, so to speak,

652
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,030
choices that are met in any social vacuum without it is pattern

653
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,511
which is shaped by the society we live in.

654
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
And that is the same

655
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,399
In the academy, where we are constantly trying to identify

656
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,727
very objective ways to measure

657
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,543
Merit and then we still know that,

658
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,335
from research for example,

659
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,092
An equivalent performance with is judged differently depending on who it is that makes it,

660
00:42:26,092 --> 00:42:27,967
It has been seen in so -called

661
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
expert assessments that

662
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:39,667
a man with a certain level of merit, certain amount of publication and so on

663
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:42,559
is considered more qualified than a woman with the equivalent.

664
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,067
And we also see a bias for example in

665
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,519
the connection between how merit you are and what return you get on the merits that also

666
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,799
goes in line with those

667
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,847
hierarchies as we see in society

668
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,633
Based on gender, ethnicity or whatever we now choose to call it.

669
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,733
It goes very well for a lot of women.

670
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Absolutely.

671
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,623
How did it go then?

672
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
How do you think then?

673
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,255
In relation to what you said, they are selected.

674
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:17,167
But there are women everywhere, general directors, CEOs.

675
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:19,679
It is not perfect system, of course, but at least

676
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,200
so it looks like a higher merit level is required

677
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,600
For women to get the same, to be judged as as competent as a man.

678
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:37,343
It's interesting, you also lifted this "what can you do then?" and is not then that at least

679
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,927
The bad system that Mats was in.

680
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:46,567
I think an interesting factor to discuss there is this with quotation

681
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:49,533
Because it puts things at their tip a bit.

682
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,703
If we were to use any other principle, what would it look like?

683
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:58,627
Or supplementary principles are often. One merit 85 or 90 % of students

684
00:43:58,627 --> 00:44:02,033
Then you create a small quota for a small part of it.

685
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:07,767
And then I thought, it was done a rather interesting study, then it was in itself

686
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:13,033
a political science study that looked at the effect of what happened to competence

687
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,719
before and after starting to apply quotation

688
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:19,583
And then it was seen that competence increased after they began to use quotas

689
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,143
when adding these assignments.

690
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,215
The reason for it increased it was not that they

691
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,775
women who were recruited what more competent

692
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,567
Without the men

693
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,407
As recruited, on average, was more competent.

694
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:39,039
That is, one broke against an implicit quota that is going on in society

695
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,647
there so to speak less competent men are quoted in but we do not call that quotation

696
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,951
Because that's what we're used to in some way,

697
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,583
that you are disadvantaged or favored depending on what you are called, for example in Sweden

698
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,300
or what origin one has or what gender you have.

699
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,983
But I also have to ask, historically, humanity has some

700
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,799
very bad experiences of saying

701
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,847
over there are the Muslims,

702
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,639
over there are the Jews,

703
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,199
Over the blacks, there they are white.

704
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,437
It is often easy to destine if a person is a man or woman

705
00:45:10,437 --> 00:45:13,855
And it was not quite as combustible to say that so many should be of each gender,

706
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,133
It's a little easier,

707
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,433
We don't really have this genocide history

708
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,839
When it comes to this. The moment you say you should not,

709
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,447
To quote you must also start defining people after race for example,

710
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,983
And that's the last thing you want.

711
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:35,103
How, then, does it make it methodical if you still have to quote something? It is very common.

712
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:40,223
I'm not saying that quotation is always a good method but when it comes to that question, I think,

713
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
So so long

714
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,599
"race" within quotation marks is a social reality,

715
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:50,463
thus as long as it is obvious that in our society it matters

716
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,023
what skin color you have or what origin one has

717
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,583
So we have to dare to see and talk about it.

718
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:02,239
We just can't start at the end to close your eyes to it and pretend that there is not as long as it is a

719
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,263
Social reality.

720
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:07,567
Is it enough as a definition to identify?

721
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,407
Yes, then we'll see, okay so which ...

722
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:15,514
Then we must be able to talk about issues both in workplaces and in society at large

723
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:17,599
where we also dare talk about inequalities based

724
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,967
On social perceptions of race, so to speak.

725
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:27,300
One thing you have to remember is actually the one who chooses a person.

726
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,878
We have a system where you are not only assigned a place, the one who also

727
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,983
are free to choose the one they want for their

728
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,767
workplace or to one's

729
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:40,127
training or whatever it is to be chosen.

730
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:47,400
That person also owns a maneuvering space to want someone

731
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,367
which they think fits.

732
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
You mean that there should not be rules that it should adapt to?

733
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,533
So as you talk, it has no freedom.

734
00:46:56,533 --> 00:47:03,667
It is something you are placed in different places in a completely regulated system.

735
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,233
But this is a free person who should choose for his company.

736
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:10,233
I haven't said that.

737
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:13,233
It is an argument for freedom.

738
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,967
Yes and against quotation.

739
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,015
Yes but it's not an argument,

740
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:22,879
I'm not saying, I haven't said anything about quotation but I say that

741
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,719
If a person is to choose, okay, I don't know,

742
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
I have not thought through it but

743
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,327
Then that person gets the position it wants it to have.

744
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,887
It receives no more reward than that.

745
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,700
It is again this that we reward different positions ...

746
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:43,100
But it is a reward to get the job, it is a reward in itself to get the job you want.

747
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,400
As the one who decided, it was now your example was.

748
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,300
But you have applied for it, it is a mutual process, you are looking for something and then one chooses one out.

749
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,455
It is mutual, both will be ...

750
00:47:56,455 --> 00:47:57,439
Now you are talking about

751
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,231
the freedom of the person deciding.

752
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,791
Yes and so you are free to apply for your job too.

753
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,839
Yes, that's all.

754
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,867
If it is as you say then there are discrimination factors

755
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:08,004
That makes not everyone has the same chance ...

756
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:10,239
It is the selection itself that is discrimination, one always discriminates against

757
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,543
When choosing someone over someone else,

758
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,767
It is always a discrimination.

759
00:48:14,779 --> 00:48:17,822
It is an exclusion you can say but it does not have to be discrimination,

760
00:48:17,822 --> 00:48:20,933
If we now like meritocracy,

761
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,295
So it is not one,

762
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
So it doesn't have to be a discrimination if the most qualified gets it.

763
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,975
However, if the person who gets it comes from one

764
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,303
Social group that does not usually get it then it is after all

765
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,600
One way to think, yes otherwise it would have been discrimination.

766
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,367
I think we must also hear, because we started with the question of what benefits there are

767
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:46,000
With the system, probably must start with hearing a little more from the away flank,

768
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:50,367
Are there times when meritocracy is inappropriate?

769
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,333
So I don't think you should be so afraid of imperfection,

770
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:58,623
What we talk about is, after all, as well as ways of discovering ...

771
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:05,433
I mean for me, meritocracy will always go before bureaucracy,

772
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,300
So you point out in the opposition for it becomes,

773
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,703
at least in the contexts that deal with that

774
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:18,335
create or develop, it is another matter if there is a pure management because then you can

775
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,333
Define the roles over time.

776
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,431
One should not be afraid of,

777
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,809
Yes but as I said, no one speaks Scanian in this panel,

778
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:28,831
It looks a bit anyway, at least me.

779
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,159
It is still possible to implement this in Lund during

780
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
Lund University's banner.

781
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,000
So it is clear that it happens as well as shifts.

782
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,727
It's fun that you say it because it would be absurd if we thought in advance:

783
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,100
"None of these speak Scanian, it is not possible, we have to quote in a scan speaker."

784
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:55,199
There has been a meritocratic adaptation of the debate format, we need not be

785
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
plain.

786
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:59,807
We don't have to be

787
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
Super homogeneous without we can ...

788
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,903
There is some kind of, after all,

789
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
Yes but it is extremely imperfect but there are many examples of this, search processes are crazy.

790
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,655
I mean, if you look at highly meritocratic

791
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,727
systems like American universities so they had for a long time

792
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,000
so -called Jewish quota,

793
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,151
For one would not have too much Jewish students and too much Jewish teachers

794
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:32,933
Because there was too little party and too much studies.

795
00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:40,033
So you had a quota, not to take in but to exclude?

796
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:45,033
Paul Samuelson who received the economy award ended up at MIT instead of Harvard for

797
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,911
The Juda rat was filled.

798
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,733
When are we talking now?

799
00:50:49,733 --> 00:50:51,233
Late 40s, after the war.

800
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,847
It is in the same vein, so also Lund University has a fair

801
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:58,233
Shameful history when it comes to receiving Jewish students.

802
00:50:58,233 --> 00:51:01,105
One should not be so scared of imperfections for

803
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,807
We discover time, after another,

804
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,647
imperfections in the meritocracy and work them in.

805
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,719
No, I mean it's not an imperfection just like that either.

806
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:19,100
In a pluralistic society there are a lot of things, if debate in Lund was

807
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,143
That you should be a scan, then you have decided to recruit.

808
00:51:22,143 --> 00:51:24,543
There is nothing wrong with, for example, in association there,

809
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,871
I saw something in Sweden around, there was an association for

810
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,151
People named Kenneth,

811
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:36,063
I do not feel discriminated against not being allowed to be there.

812
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,463
Fantastic discrimination case, it is wonderful.

813
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,863
If a criterion for being here is to be scan

814
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,900
And maybe have someone to knowledge

815
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,567
Then it is so and you have to ask if there are other debates you can join.

816
00:51:55,567 --> 00:52:00,506
But these are factors that do not relate to something important in our society that it looks like today.

817
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:03,711
However, the example that Mats lifted with American elite university is that

818
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:09,087
decisive for whether one of them has been passed on, it is a shortcut to extremely well -paid positions

819
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,135
And a lot of status and power in society.

820
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:15,700
And there, for example, it is, you called it extremely meritocratic institutions,

821
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
And there it is so that

822
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,839
The top percent

823
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:24,133
has an equal proportion of the places there, ie in terms of income and wealth,

824
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:29,467
Has the same proportion of the places there as the lower 50%.

825
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,598
And then we may think it is meritocratic. Then I mean it's meritocratic

826
00:52:33,598 --> 00:52:34,943
Because it is so meritocracy is used.

827
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:40,063
One could also see it as it is not meritocratic for meritocracy

828
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,599
should be an abstract

829
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,439
Idea that we could formulate in some philosophical way.

830
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:48,833
But it is a philosophical idea and nothing else.

831
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,833
I know it but you have to see how it is used, what it has for social function.

832
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,233
You have to talk about what you should have instead.

833
00:52:54,233 --> 00:52:59,733
An equal education system compensatory,

834
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,667
that tries to bridge differences and which are inclusive.

835
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:07,667
Then will some stand back then?

836
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:12,761
Children of academics may not go to university.

837
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:14,367
That's not what I say, I say like this:

838
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:19,600
that the problem of quotation and that type of efforts or that you have reserves places,

839
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,774
It is that they come very late in an event, to try to intervene

840
00:53:23,774 --> 00:53:25,375
very late in a event

841
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
Which creates a certain outcome.

842
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,727
The earlier we can intervene, the better it is.

843
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,965
So it is important to try to build an education system from the beginning

844
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:35,103
which is compensatory

845
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,151
For example, and that provide more opportunities

846
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:40,991
to inclusion. Then it may mean that you do not treat everyone exactly the same.

847
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,551
Then we need to bet more money in schools

848
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,367
In areas where you have, so to speak, ...

849
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:52,933
Can so be, only you don't prevent anyone, that's the important thing.

850
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,047
No, but this one with man

851
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,375
buys on the market what you want,

852
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,935
You don't think you should be able to buy

853
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,727
The places at elite university?

854
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
That the richest should get.

855
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:08,267
I don't think it's a particularly good university idea, as is the university's thought,

856
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:09,919
I do not think so.

857
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:15,000
So there are areas that will stay out of the principle that the richest

858
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,063
should have their needs satisfied?

859
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:20,700
But it is not just the richest, I am not the richest and get all the needs satisfied.

860
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,682
But that the rich people should be able to buy

861
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,133
A good, something they want for their money.

862
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:30,655
There are boundaries, for example, they should not be able to buy a place at Harvard.

863
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
They can apparently.

864
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,200
Yes, but you think it's wrong?

865
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:35,519
I don't know if I should legislate against it.

866
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
I do not think so.

867
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:43,400
I think it's a stupid idea for a university because it's about knowledge.

868
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,295
However, I think those who hire them then should see how they have come there.

869
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,599
But may they do it?

870
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,133
So, just because you have money you don't have to be stupid.

871
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,975
No and it may not be that difficult to do it either.

872
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,303
The university's idea is knowledge

873
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,167
And not to buy a place.

874
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:02,349
The American universities

875
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:11,333
In fact, it is true that the largest universities do not increase their number of students but reduce them.

876
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,455
It is about selling term fees so terribly expensive, it should be so exclusive

877
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,833
To have a degree from, for example, Princeton.

878
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:23,135
It should be few. Then you think we have made great progress during the pandemic with what one calls

879
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:26,463
Massive online courses, mox, with a ugly expression.

880
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:31,039
Then such universities could graduate incredibly many people who can be proud of

881
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:32,863
to have gone on Harvard or Princeton

882
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,655
Or brown but you don't.

883
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:37,727
It is because one wants to maintain the economic value in this, of course,

884
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,600
hardly the merit value, without it must be a funding thing

885
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,100
Which makes you choose to do so, I guess.

886
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
Yes.

887
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:48,567
Philosopher Jonna Bornemark wrote a book called "The Unfortunate Renaissance"

888
00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:50,783
Which was embraced by many.

889
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:57,029
At least I perceived when I read it, it's a simplification, well

890
00:55:57,029 --> 00:56:00,367
any kind of willingness to defend parts of

891
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:04,351
The social sciences and humanities from these absolute numbers.

892
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:08,600
To somehow see that there is a variable any time,

893
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,007
so you have a giant recruitment process and choose

894
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,847
the best person but then something happens so that the person in question is very sad that day,

895
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:19,455
Thus, the human variable that causes the models to fall.

896
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:23,551
How do you relate to it as a leader? I ask you Mats if you have

897
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
Responsibility as a managerial assignment.

898
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:33,375
Next question.

899
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
It is difficult.

900
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:40,959
Incredibly difficult. What I get for, as you probably understand is when the variable makes the system

901
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,959
imperfect and how to relate to it.

902
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,567
It is the core that I am looking for.

903
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:51,455
If you are going to defend the meritocracy, you think it is the best we have,

904
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:56,100
How do you do it to stand it up if you do not want to quote for example, then there are other ways.

905
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,855
You talked about imperfection before.

906
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,647
How do you do to

907
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:03,700
Understand this so that it still manages as the least bad system we have.

908
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,047
But that is precisely this kind of

909
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:10,399
Interventions and discussions about what we do. But that is for taking

910
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
Harvard exemple then that is

911
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:19,100
Complete exceptional example so a kind is going on

912
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,943
border work, one borders to

913
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,039
Cambridge's poorest part, Harvard University.

914
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:32,633
What is there to pick up there, where is there, how can we give back to that environment?

915
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,023
What I myself at least try

916
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:42,655
think, I try to live by Groucho Marx's old Maxim that I never join the associations such as

917
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,935
Accepts me as a member.

918
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:46,538
Then we have this with the Åtundan again.

919
00:57:46,538 --> 00:57:51,333
So one should question contexts that feel very homogeneous.

920
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:56,991
Very much of what undermines meritocracy it is when it goes into homogeneity

921
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,551
When it's at it's best

922
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,415
So it has a look for the unique and the special and the remarkable.

923
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,231
As we approach the hour full here I will

924
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:11,839
Ask you, we have many students here in the audience and certainly many via television too,

925
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:16,703
If you come to Lund University or any other university and will qualify.

926
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:21,191
You come as 19, 20, 21-year-old, you choose courses and programs and

927
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:23,615
So one should drive forward towards becoming an adult,

928
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,867
prevail in a broad sense.

929
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:30,271
So we now have meritocracy, we also have lots of people who say you should build your network,

930
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,599
Engage yourself socially and get many friends that you can benefit from.

931
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,903
If you were to give an advice

932
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:40,487
to the student who will be new to Lund this fall and will take on all that there is

933
00:58:40,487 --> 00:58:42,303
in a life as a university student.

934
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583
To balance then

935
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:48,703
Contact network construction with this merit, plug against the exam versus to spend time with ...

936
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,287
What is an approach? Do you want to give good advice? Maybe you can start Martin.

937
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:02,527
Yes, I would say that one should try to take advantage of the time you have received

938
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,533
And try to have fun.

939
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,900
The merit can be solved later. Nina?

940
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:15,033
It depends on what you want to achieve but if you want a job then you should well

941
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,119
Find out what the companies think it is possible to make profits in

942
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:21,700
The future and so are invested in training in that area.

943
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,552
If you want to be happy, you may want to do in some other way but

944
00:59:25,552 --> 00:59:28,100
one must still think that one must have some money

945
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,431
So it's a balancing act.

946
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:33,247
You should study what you are interested in and do it properly.

947
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Mats?

948
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,831
Throughout for

949
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:43,700
People who have gone well in the world I have noticed it is that they have taken the wrong door.

950
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:49,887
They came late to an enrollment or they happened to go to a house other than they thought and then

951
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,203
did they do their best

952
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,703
In the house they entered.

953
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,867
Was a little curious, was a little bold.

954
00:59:56,868 --> 00:59:59,359
It is interesting because now you say that the choice does not play a huge role, but it is like the effort later.

955
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
A bit like Lena, do what you do properly.

956
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,687
Yes.

957
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:07,295
Isn't it a wonderful summary word for your discussion about meritocracy.

958
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:11,135
We can measure in different ways but do what you do properly.

959
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:15,487
I think we thank the panel with these wise words. You have met

960
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:20,351
Martin Wolgast, Nina Björk, Lena Andersson and Mats Benner

961
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,833
And you have looked at debate in Lund from Lund, the Academic Association.

962
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:27,775
A few times a year we show up in a box near you.

963
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,079
Thank you for watching, thank you for coming here.
