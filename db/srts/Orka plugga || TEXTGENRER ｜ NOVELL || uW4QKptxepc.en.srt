1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,640
A short story has a single, clear plot.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,240
Novels tend to be longer, more complex, 
and have more slowly unfolding events.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,360
In a short story, the protagonist 
is usually introduced very early on.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,600
There is no upper limit 
for how long a short story can be.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,800
It can be anything from a couple of pages 
to over a hundred.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,320
Keep this in mind 
when you're writing a short story.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,680
Make sure you have a theme throughout. 
Stick to the plot, and don't digress.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,040
Plan the story before you start writing.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,960
Think about the characters, 
events, settings, and ending.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,560
Would you like to convey 
any particular message or moral?

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,440
Introduce the characters and any conflict 
between them as soon as possible.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,120
Come up with good settings and details.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,760
It's a good idea 
to use pop culture references.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,480
For example, don't just write 
that a character is listening to music.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
If you specify the song or artist, 
it can evoke something in the reader.
