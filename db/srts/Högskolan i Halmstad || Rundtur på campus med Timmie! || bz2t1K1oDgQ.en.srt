00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:07.795
Hello and welcome to Halmstad University!

2
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:10,532
Fun to see you! Come on and I'll show you around a bit.

3
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,360
We start with a little detour right away, come here!

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,027
Hi Victoria, fun to see you!

5
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:19,654
Hi Timmie, the same!

6
00:00:19,654 --> 00:00:23,552
Can't you tell those who watch. Who are you and what do you do?

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,576
Absolutely

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:29,205
Victoria is my name, and works as a study and career counselor here at the university.

9
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:33,338
I often have guidance calls with students who are interested in-

10
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:34,895
-To Start studying here at Halmstad University.

11
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:37,770
But also with students who are already reading here with us.

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,383
There will be a lot of questions about admission, eligibility-

13
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,579
-and what you can do after reading a program-

14
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,336
-If the labor market and career and such issues.

15
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,200
You sit with some others who are also sitting in here.

16
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:53.030
Can you tell us a little more what you all do?

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,854
Exactly, it's not just us, study counselors sitting here-

18
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:59.215
-It is also student health and educational support.

19
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,350
So, for example, if you need support and help with your health-

20
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,172
-And your feeling so you can book a conversation with Student Health.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,267
If you have a disability then you can get educational support-

22
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:14,055
-During your study time here, which can facilitate the studies.

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,080
What good that you are here on campus, it is an asset I think.

24
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,267
But we shall move on through the glass aisle-

25
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:23,988
-So let's see if we can meet some more people.

26
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:28,723
Now we move on here in the glass aisle and we'll see ...

27
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:31,647
As you can see here, we have a service center.

28
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:34.031
We'll go in and check if anyone can tell you a little-

29
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:35.941
-If what they do here at the service center.

30
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,278
Hi Ida!

31
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:38,194
Hello Timmie!

32
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:38,874
How's it going?

33
00:01:38,874 --> 00:01:40,145
That's good, thank you!

34
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:43.306
Can you tell us a little what you do here at the service center?

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Absolutely!

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,800
As a student you are welcome here if you have questions about-

37
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,872
-Studies, college or your education.

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,161
If we can't answer, we will help you further.

39
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00.103
Here you can arrange access cards, study certificates or pick up your exam-

40
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,719
-When you wrote your first exam.

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03.648
Perfect!

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06.208
This is exactly what you do here at the service center.

43
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,159
I have picked up a number of exams here, I can announce.

44
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,072
But come, now we'll move on.

45
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,765
Hello then Ida, thank you for being able to join.

46
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,553
Hello then, thank you!

47
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,570
Next in turn is the student union and they make sure we have-

48
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,096
-Good and functioning education here at the university.

49
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
And above all the study social.

50
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
And it's something you will see more of in autumn-

51
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
-The zero, above all!

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27.602
Come on and we'll see what they say.

53
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Hello!

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,624
Fun to see you, what is the best thing about the student union?

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,105
All engaged students, of course!

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,827
It's the most fun, when the students come here and say-

57
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,121
-Heah I have an idea, can we test this? And then we say "Yes, we look at that!"

58
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,118
So we look at whether it can be implemented.

59
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:49,344
But it is the best, committed students, like yourself.

60
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,312
Yes but I agree. Awesome male. Thanks so much!

61
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,640
Being engaged during their studies is one of the most important things.

62
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03.040
Now we will move on, so come along and we will see what we find at the library.

63
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,345
Now we go to the university library so come along here.

64
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:15,210
At the college library you will spend much of your time.

65
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,444
We will meet Elizabeth here.

66
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,610
Hello!

67
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,496
Nice to see you.

68
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,336
Can you tell us a little what students do here and what they get help with?

69
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,384
You can get help with most things here actually.

70
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,480
There is room to sit here and plug both individually and in groups.

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,200
We have some group rooms.

72
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,600
We have a lot of books but most of us have-

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,441
-Very much of what we have, that's digital too.

74
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:45,536
So then you can get help from finding in all that material-

75
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,269
-So you find what you need.

76
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52.705
Then we also have some machines if you want something to chew on-

77
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:54,871
-When you sit here, and some water and such.

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01.055
Nice working environment and access to find help.

79
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06.488
A place where you spend a lot of time as a student, can you say?

80
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:07,296
Do not you agree?

81
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,334
Yes! Now during the last period has been a bit empty here-

82
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,184
-So we have missed all students.

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
Usually, it is usually very full.

84
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,260
Especially certain times of the day.

85
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,510
Yes but really, and to you this fall we look forward to-

86
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,966
-To have you all in place here.

87
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,669
But we will move on. Thanks so much Elizabeth!

88
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,543
Now move on and take us to House R.

89
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,237
Now we are back the glass aisle because of course we should not miss any things-

90
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:35,375
-White we go to house R.

91
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,271
We will now go into house E and F.

92
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,929
And there, among other things, the design studio will be-

93
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,391
-And electronic lab and electronic center Halland.

94
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,373
To my right side we have the restaurant found here at Campus-

95
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:49,600
-Som have good food.

96
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52.548
But come now we will go and look at the lab.

97
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57.471
Now we are in the electronic lab.

98
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00.819
Students who are here are in the process of that-

99
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,359
-Test and create circuit boards.

100
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
And the circuit boards can look like this.

101
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,390
Students also program these.

102
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:12,850
So do you want to become a student and work with them-

103
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,391
-It's really the big thing that was about here.

104
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:19,231
There is a lot of activity here in the lab.

105
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,509
But with that said, we will move on to the Electronics Center Halland.

106
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,654
Now we go into the electronics center and there you have to wear other shoes.

107
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,263
Now we will change shoes a little quickly.

108
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,153
These are special shoes for getting-

109
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:40,223
-Go into this lab.

110
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
So come along now.

111
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
This then Electronics Center Halland.

112
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,252
Here we have two pieces of chambers where you measure-

113
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,978
-Electromagnetic fields in different ways.

114
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01.019
And we will now go into a chamber called Maxwell.

115
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09.919
This is what it looks like in this chamber-

116
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:16,025
-And here students can measure, wireless, electronics structures.

117
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
And as you can see, there are plates on the walls and roof-

118
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:25,418
-In ordinary cases should students close the door to measure-

119
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
-The constructions in here.

120
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32.093
This is something very unique to Halmstad-

121
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:35,165
-And Halmstad University, that we have something like this.

122
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,132
In both this chamber and in the other chamber-

123
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,423
-which is here next to you can see-

124
00:06:40,423 --> 00:06:45,366
-To in there, you measure electronics magnetist fields in a different way.

125
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52.633
Among other things, through how it can affect the electricity grid.

126
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58.917
Here, several students may be able to do-

127
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01.317
-Among other things their degree projects.

128
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04.467
May be allowed to go in and test different constructions.

129
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:09.666
So if there is something you want to do and study at Halmstad University.

130
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,151
This is the second chamber.

131
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,350
In this little box you can measure and connect electronics products-

132
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:26,406
-And see how they can affect the electricity grid.

133
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29.535
This chamber is called the noisy chamber.

134
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
Compared to the chamber we were in before where it is more quiet.

135
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,911
Here happens and a little more stuff that can ...

136
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,543
... then tests and measures how ...

137
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,979
... electricity products and the fields then affect other things.

138
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,520
Incredibly awesome.

139
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54.521
Now we go past the design studio and here are students-

140
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:57.006
-Which reads digital design and innovation.

141
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:59,743
This is their project room.

142
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03.071
Here they work with real cases, with business-

143
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06.439
-In otherwise for their degree projects or the like.

144
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09.727
This really happens.

145
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,243
Join us, now we move on.

146
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:17,997
Now we are finally in houses and now you should look at the health lab.

147
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,228
At the Health Lab is: Clinical Exercise Center-

148
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:24,191
-The behavioral science lab, apartment and media lab.

149
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:26,761
Join us and we will see what it looks like.

150
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,761
Then we will see here, now we are in the health lab.

151
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:39,679
The first thing to visit is what we call the apartment.

152
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,555
Join us and we will see if we enter the apartment.

153
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,229
You did not do here, but we test the other door-

154
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,943
-So it will probably work better.

155
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,015
We didn't do that either.

156
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,737
But wait a bit and we'll see if we can't get in anyway-

157
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,391
-Yes but, look now it was open.

158
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00.671
Let's see.

159
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02.975
This is the apartment-

160
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07.859
-Here can students who, among other things, read to Socionom-

161
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,403
-Fa experience what it is like to have conversations in the home.

162
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,007
You can create a simulation in here.

163
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,143
As you can see up here, there is then a camera-

164
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,238
-So that other students can follow what is happening here-

165
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,326
-In in apartment.

166
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,318
The apartment is equipped with what one can find in a home-

167
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,278
-There is a living room, a bedroom in there.

168
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37.630
To the right we have a large mirror and that is in there-

169
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,071
-When the observer room is located.

170
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
Now we will move on to the next part.

171
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,434
Then we'll see, now we're going to the clinical training center-

172
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
-It's in here.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56.046
Follow.

174
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58.606
Here we have ...

175
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:05.696
.. where the nurses can simulate what it is like to work-

176
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:06,975
-On real patients.

177
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,071
There are dolls in the beds-

178
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,661
-And, among other things, can the nursing students-

179
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:18,830
-Test what it is like to take blood tests, and other types of method-

180
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,356
-To save a patient or to help a patient, of course.

181
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:29,110
They can useful everything that is here, to simulate reality.

182
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,009
Join us and we go out in the open part of the health lab-

183
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,601
-and here there is everything from study places to group room-

184
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:43,032
-To sofas and even a kitchen that the students can use.

185
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,444
It is so wonderful that we have these types of labs.

186
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,397
But we will now go into the media lab. So hang with it.

187
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,764
Now let's go into the media lab, come!

188
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:58,215
But first, we will of course start "recording in progress".

189
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,750
Come and we go into the studio.

190
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08.435
Here we have the media lab and the studio.

191
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,743
Here, among other things, Media and Communications Student-

192
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,637
-Make your own shows, ie record real television programs and other things.

193
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
Maybe a small talk show if you wish.

194
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,799
This is how they can really test what it is like to work.

195
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,029
It is not only in front of the camera that one is working-

196
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,967
-What also behind, about what it is like to stand and film-

197
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
-It's about lighting-

198
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,135
-And how to get the message you work with in different ways.

199
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,247
Come on and we'll move on.

200
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:51,160
Now we will go out of the media lab and go to the e-sports lab.

201
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:59,260
Now we are at the e-sports lab and we have a collaboration with-

202
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,136
-Movemented children and adolescents in Halland.

203
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:06,783
This is among the newest we have here at Halmstad University.

204
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
Join us for now we will go into the new cafe.

205
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:16,708
Now we are in the cafe. The newest cafe we have here in Hus S.

206
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,133
Here you as a student can buy both moderate lunches-

207
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:22,655
-To some good snacks in the afternoon.

208
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:26,495
They have incredibly beautiful and study -friendly environments here.

209
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
Now we will go into Fab Lab.

210
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
So now we are in Fab Lab here.

211
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Hi Tim.

212
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,201
Hey Hey.

213
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,479
How's it going?

214
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,865
Yes, it's just good thanks.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,903
I was going to ask if you could tell us what you are doing here?

216
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,727
Fab Lab is the university's prototype manufacturing lab.

217
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,214
Fab Lab as in Fabrication Laboratory as it stands for.

218
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,794
Fab Lab comes in originally from Mit Boston-

219
00:12:53,794 --> 00:12:55,679
-So we are not the only ones in the world there are-

220
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,078
-Or we are one of over 2000 labs around the world.

221
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,263
But here we create opportunities for the students to-

222
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:06,293
-working practically in both courses but also research-

223
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07.711
-And help in such a vis-

224
00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:09.503
-But also private projects.

225
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:16,710
If we look at the 3D printer who stands here next to us-

226
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:21,023
-The students can make a case a prototype in education.

227
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,829
But also make new curtains or whatever you want in the apartment-

228
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,283
-Eximes.

229
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
How exiting.

230
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,689
Fab Lab is one of all our labs.

231
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,466
But now we will move on, so follow along.

232
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,245
So now we are in Hus S and Hus S is one of the newest house-

233
00:13:45,245 --> 00:13:47,093
-As we have here on campus.

234
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,935
It is completely renovated from very old premises.

235
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:54.303
The house was clearly in the middle of the pandemic.

236
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,911
So it is still very unused premises.

237
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,727
Incredibly beautiful environments.

238
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,454
Come on and we'll go in and look a little more about what it looks like in house S.

239
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:17,855
Now we go into the big hall.

240
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,927
Come on and let's see what it looks like.

241
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
Here we have from smaller group rooms to project room-

242
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,703
-We have universities that are interactive-

243
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,007
-We also have large hearing rooms.

244
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,581
And now we will go into what is called the movement lab.

245
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,759
Join here now and we will get to the finish line.

246
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,704
Now let's see what it looks like in here.

247
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:01.848
Now we are in the movement lab and here students get to test-

248
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:07,559
-How it is to work with training physiological principles.

249
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,147
This is about testing strength, condition-

250
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:18,153
-And other, and be able to analyze them with measuring instruments available.

251
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,111
In order to be able to see how to perform better-

252
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,374
-or if someone is performing a little worse-

253
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:27,999
-How they can work on getting a normal function.

254
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
It is something that one both research-

255
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,911
-And that students can work a lot with in here.

256
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,263
But that said that we will move on so follow here and we will go.

257
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,795
Okay now we go to DLC.

258
00:15:43,622 --> 00:15:47,199
Now we are in digital laboratory center DLC.

259
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,015
Now let's look at what it looks like.

260
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
And here you as a student can work with your digital skills.

261
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,000
Here are everything from different types of equipment to-

262
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02.303
-Strengthen digital development.

263
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05.651
From a blackbox to smaller meeting room-

264
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:12.543
-To we have small studios to work with physical products-

265
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
-which can be digital.

266
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,126
Also how to teach as a teacher student in digital environments.

267
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,595
We have a nice pod studio that was recently inaugurated.

268
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,415
This is how you as a student can also join in and play-

269
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,779
-A real pod.

270
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,894
This is something we need even more here at the university.

271
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,486
Then we will move on to something completely different.

272
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:41,254
Come.

273
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,703
Now we are somewhere completely else and where we are now is on-

274
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:49,073
-The sports center like a gym located on campus.

275
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:52,991
It is Eleiko certified and is located in the university's premises.

276
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,207
A great opportunity for you as a student-

277
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:56,831
-Exercising close to your studies.

278
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,225
One floor up here is one for a cafe.

279
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:04.709
We have several cafes here on campus, to buy some snacks.

280
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,680
Come and we will end this hike.

281
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:13,727
Now we have made a proper tour here at Campus-

282
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,808
-I hope you've got to see what it looks like here-

283
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:22,392
-But there is of course so much more to discover.

284
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:25,267
I look forward to you looking for an education here-

285
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:26,666
-At Halmstad University.

286
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,831
So maybe we will even be seen this fall.

287
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,978
Thanks for this hike! Bye.
