00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,280
NUANCED ARGUMENTS 
AND COMPLEX CONNECTIONS

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,200
You form arguments in many 
school subjects and other situations.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,160
That means you develop your thoughts 
and opinions about something.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,760
To help you develop within a subject-

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,560
-your teachers always consult 
the knowledge requirements.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,480
For social studies, these state that "the 
student has to form nuanced arguments"-

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,880
-"and describe complex connections 
between different factors"-

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,840
-meaning how different things are related. 
And that can be a bit tricky.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,640
Here's an example of students 
forming nuanced arguments-

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,560
-and explaining complex connections 
on the topic of influencing public opinion.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,840
They will use relevant terminology-

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,520
-and address different factors 
affecting a person's influential ability.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,800
They will offer concrete examples 
which they will also analyse.

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,120
Complex connections are formed when 
they reflect on how factors are related.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,040
Right, we have to name the factors 
that affect a person's influential ability.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,920
Starting a group on social media 
for like-minded people is easy.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,080
But how do you make a real impact? 
It's about power.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
It still matters who you are 
and who you know.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,400
Interesting start. They use terminology 
that is relevant to the subject-

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,320
-and have already mentioned two factors 
that affect a person's influence.

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,400
In this case, 
those factors were status and network.

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,520
Can they use an example 
to elaborate on that?

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,200
True, status does matter.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,840
If a celebrity I like speaks out for 
or against something, it influences me.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,640
And not just me - think of all the people 
following that person's updates.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, many followers equals power.

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,360
On the one hand, celebrities get 
loads of followers right away.

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,880
On the other hand, social media levelled 
the playing field with regard to influence.

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,880
If the timing is right, I think anyone 
can go viral and influence public opinion.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,560
Their discussion is becoming nuanced.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,040
Students are analysing examples of how 
social media can be used for influence.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,720
They use "on the one hand/ 
on the other hand"-

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,880
-to describe different sides 
to their argument.

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,240
Developing your thoughts in several 
steps forms a chain of reasoning.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
That brings us to complex connections:

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,560
How arguments and examples 
are related.

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,680
Let's see how our students illustrate that.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,880
Let's forget about the celebrity 
and try a new perspective.

39
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,080
If two regular people 
want to achieve the same goal-

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,560
-like improving school lunches, is there 
a difference in who we may listen to?

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,320
Sure. How you convey your message 
matters, for instance.

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,080
Maybe your upbringing has prepared you 
to present and phrase arguments well.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,080
So you could say a person's 
socio-economic background matters-

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,560
-since it affects their expression.

45
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,640
But a person can also be 
more or less credible.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,040
I don't think background matters if the 
person was present at a certain event-

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,280
-either as a victim or a witness.

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,560
How a person's statements are received 
depends on things like gender and looks.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,440
The same story may be received 
differently depending on who tells it.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,800
Also, a person's background can 
determine who that person knows.

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,600
Even if you're not famous, your network 
can be more or less influential.

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,320
That affects your chances to reach out.

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,440
And you have to reach 
someone powerful.

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,440
So you have to be strategic 
and choose the right channels.

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:46,680
Right. Complex connections are created 
by explaining how factors are related.

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,440
That helps you describe similarities 
and differences in several steps.

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,520
Our students are discussing 
complex connections-

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
-from a socioeconomic standpoint.

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,760
They connect the background to other 
factors like credibility, gender, and looks.

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,920
They've also mentioned 
networks and strategies.

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,600
But let's leave the example and examine 
the knowledge requirement.

62
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,120
As in any subject, you need to know 
terminology that is relevant to the task.

63
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,520
Find out what the important terms are 
before you get started.

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,760
Identify factors that somehow affect 
the topic you are discussing-

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,400
-and explain how those factors 
influence each other.

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,640
Offer real examples. Show that you know 
what you're talking about.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,440
Things are rarely black and white, but 
can usually be viewed in different ways.

68
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
What perspective did you choose?

69
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,600
Finally, how are your arguments 
and examples related to each other?

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,360
Describe connections by highlighting 
similarities and differences-

71
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,760
-thereby pointing out connections 
that are more or less complex.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,480
Being able to show connections and 
forming a nuanced argument is useful-

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,480
-in several school subjects 
and in situations outside of school.
