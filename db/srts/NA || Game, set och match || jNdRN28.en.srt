1
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.760
Do you keep track of all the papers now?

2
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.720
I grant you this big loan because I trust you.

3
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.320
Here I thought to have mirrors.

4
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.720
Here is the solarium.

5
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.920
I get room for over 15 people.
 This is a full service salon.

6
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:29.160
I thought it would be called "Sara's hair, skin and grill".

7
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.240
Behind the foot care you can buy thin bread rolls.

8
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.680
- You get the craving for the solarium.
 - You must have professional help.

9
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.120
I actually have an economic consultant - Tom Lindvall.

10
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.520
Then I don't have to worry!

11
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.760
He helped us with rationalizations.

12
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.600
He kicked everyone who was over 40.

13
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.040
He is fearless.
 He has written a book on personnel policy.

14
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.520
"Man, a necessary evil".
 He has good ideas.

15
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:25.080
He wanted you to leave me and Max so you could work more.

16
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.440
- He sounds deadly ... - just kept your invoices and receipts.

17
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.120
I do!
 Expenses and income - U and I. Order and ready!

18
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.760
I thought you would put the invoices in a cover, not in two freezer bags!

19
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.800
- It's simple and clear.
 - And easy to freeze?

20
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.200
I'll meet empty in ten minutes.
 Keep your fingers crossed!

21
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:11.320
- To not have a feeling in the body.
 - He sat in my office and cried!

22
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.560
Because he was not allowed to dismiss the foreign department ...

23
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.400
What you seem happy.
 Have you raised the postage?

24
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.160
No!
 Today is a special day.
 The state has shown me its appreciation.

25
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.960
- The document states my importance.
 - parking fines?

26
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.760
No!
 I have been elected for this year's postman in 1994.

27
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.760
That tram set?

28
00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.280
"For loyalty, punctuality and feeling of duty" ...

29
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.040
... signed by the postmaster.

30
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.800
It is only because you do not argue about working hours.

31
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.800
- He buys the diploma for 19:50.
 â€“20!
 Plus 15 for the frame.

32
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.800
It was your turn to get a diploma.
 Everyone else has received.

33
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.960
- Not Mardell.
 - Mardell is 13 years old and prying.

34
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.760
It's so typically your banking people!
 You don't know what loyalty means.

35
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.640
- But you know that?
 -You can always count on me!

36
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.880
- Help me with the history test.
 -I do not have time.

37
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.360
- I have to go away and work.
 - What are you so important?

38
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:05.880
We drink wine.
 - At seven you have interrogated Max and the food is on the table.

39
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:14.280
Do not worry!
 - Should we surprise mom and do really nice in here?

40
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.240
- No ... - good, then I watch TV.

41
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.880
- hear me now.
 - Not now, it's a match ball!

42
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.840
- This test determines my rating.
 - It sounds exciting ... okay, okay.

43
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.960
What was the name called ... rode in to the king and to some extent ...

44
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:56.560
- Read in the book.
 - There it sat, 6-4!
 We won!

45
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:04.520
- This history test is important.
 - Here you are involved in creating history!

46
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.320
Sweden can win the Davis Cup!

47
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.200
- How is it, Lina?
 What will it be?
 - Something with mash.
 The meatballs burned up.

48
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:25.080
- Good, mom that I've done them.
 -What a night!
 Now I'm completely exhausted.

49
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.880
- I interrogate our son.
 -Sorry.
 How did it go?

50
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:39.640
- Yes, Edberg had problems in the beginning.
 -I understand exactly.

51
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:47.720
With all my commitments, I have the right to take a short time rest.

52
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.000
Four and a half hours, more specifically.

53
00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:01.000
- He knows the entire World War.
 - The test is on the French Revolution.

54
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.080
- And food haven't you done?
 - Now you are skeptical again.

55
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.600
-It's done!
 - What are you offering then?

56
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.280
- Something with mash!
 - "Something with mash" ...

57
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.280
- Margherita or Capricciosa?
 - Vesuvio.

58
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:45.080
Why do you ask me to cook when you still buy pizza?

59
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:53.880
- No one likes to be moss.
 - It was the meatballs that were burned!

60
00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:01.640
- Why are you forcing Lina to cook?
 -Who else?
 Max plugged.

61
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:08.280
- We have to set up for each other.
 - I don't do anything else.

62
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.600
I have proof of that.

63
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.680
- Why do you have the diploma in bed?
 - I value it!

64
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:27.640
- The manager chooses me over others.
 - Because you never dare to say.

65
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:37.480
- Don't you mark that they take advantage of you?
 - You say, with your banking paper!

66
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:44.400
These are Sara's loan documents and I'm worried.

67
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:52.320
- She doesn't have any order!
 - But you happily lend money!

68
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.080
- She has done a lot for me.
 - Cut you?

69
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.800
Bolded and permanent ...

70
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:08.800
How can the bank lend such sums without collateral?

71
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:16.560
- Someone has been in the bail for her.
 - What is so damn stupid?

72
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.560
You, Gustav.

73
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:27.080
Don't get angry now.
 I must not write like that myself.

74
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:34.520
For her hair salon you risk everything we own and have?!

75
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:41.320
- The garage and the plot we must keep.
 - Have you been crazy?!

76
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.640
Don't get like that now!
 If it goes well we get part of the cake.

77
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.960
- Can we cut ourselves free?
 - No, but cheaper.

78
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:04.080
I couldn't even do anything so stupid.
 What do you think the kids say?

79
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:12.240
- Mig they know anyway where they have!
 - The anticipation at the fridge or on the sofa.

80
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:19.800
This is the security child needs.
 I don't play Hasard with our future.

81
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.480
You played away the holiday box!

82
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.960
We didn't have to travel away.
 It was very nice in the garden!

83
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:37.160
- I create cohesion.
 - You should not be so sure.

84
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.920
- Lina asked when she had to move.
 -Never.

85
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.320
Soon she is of legal age and decides on herself.

86
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:57.920
I have been of legal age for 20 years, and have never had to decide anything.

87
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:05.920
Soon she has a boyfriend with her to sleep over here.
 What are you doing then?

88
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.200
I open with a light left ...

89
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:19.200
- What do you think they do at their parties?
 -I do not know.
 I am not invited.

90
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.800
What did you do at the parties yourself when you put out the light?

91
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.960
Ate popcorn.
 You couldn't see anything.

92
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.360
- What did you do yourself?
 - I don't think you want to know.

93
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.360
Good night.
 Sleep tight.

94
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.560
-Say it now.
 -Sleeping!

95
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:57.320
- No, say first.
 -Do not you know?

96
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.920
- Why don't you want to tell?
 - I ate chips!

97
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:14.320
- It is a smoking ban here, Pettersson.
 - Did you see tennis yesterday?

98
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.800
Wimbledon did you see in Benka's garage?

99
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.920
There I could concentrate on the game.

100
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.880
Are you going to see the match tomorrow in the cellar?

101
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.040
It's working day tomorrow!

102
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.640
Sweden is in the Davis Cup final!
 Should you call yourself sick?

103
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:46.880
A good postman does not!
 Then he is rewarded.

104
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.680
I have four those there are fog.

105
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:57.120
You were the only one who had nothing.

106
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.600
I was the only one worth it!

107
00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:09.600
- The diploma serves an important purpose.
 -Yes.
 I use mine as a cutting board.

108
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.160
Mine will hang among my other honors!

109
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.480
Next to the swimming bourgeois brand and the driver's license ...

110
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.800
I know you're a lonely person.

111
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.440
Who can watch tennis whenever he wants.

112
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:40.920
- In the morning I'll watch the Davis Cup.
 - Then people will have their weekly magazines!

113
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:47.720
I remember when you didn't hand out the mail order packages.

114
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:55.800
You were disappointed because you didn't get your plot.
 I fixed another.

115
00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:01.800
It was not the werewolf the kids were waiting for.

116
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:08.360
--Max cried.
 - Lungs are discerning nowadays.

117
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:15.800
- Therefore, I have not acquired any.
 - No woman wants to live with you.

118
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.840
I enjoy being free ...

119
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.440
Saying those who don't know what love is!

120
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.000
When I saw Lena on the school ball, I knew she was the woman for me.

121
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:40.560
- She didn't get away when you offered.
 - The girls were in line for me!

122
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.760
- Did you sell sausages?
 -Right.

123
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:51.600
I fell for Lena directly.
 Since then we have loved and respected each other.

124
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.520
That, you!
 It is trust and honesty!

125
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:06.120
Like during the ice hockey World Cup when you called and said I received cardiac arrest.

126
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.960
It was 2-2 and Sundin was expelled.

127
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.440
At 10am tomorrow, the match begins.

128
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.080
Then I'll be in my couch and watch the Davis Cup.

129
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:29.120
Yes, you lie there!
 I will make sure that subscribers get their magazines!

130
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.920
Shit in it.
 They still watch the Davis Cup ...

131
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.360
- When is France's National Day?
 â€“14 July.

132
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.160
-Why?
 - Because it says so in the book!

133
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:57.160
- What could have happened?
 Has Sara traveled away?
 - With 200,000 you get a good bit.

134
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:05.080
- You don't understand the seriousness of this.
 -Yes.
 You have mortgaged the whole house.

135
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.720
But it is Dad who goes there.

136
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:17.120
- Yeah, then it was clear.
 - What did he say about the salon?

137
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:25.120
That it was hell too yellow.
 Both chairs and curtains must go green.

138
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:33.080
- The business idea, what did he think of it?
 - He wanted to buy himself right away.

139
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:40.200
- Undealable, then we are saved!
 - Hi, Sara, do you want to borrow more money?

140
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:47.360
Take it easy.
 The consultant liked Sara's business concept.

141
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.880
-Where are you going?
 -What does it look like?
 To work.

142
00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:01.280
But it's the Davis Cup final.
 I bought pallets.

143
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:08.720
Have I once sick leave to watch sports?

144
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.760
- Our wedding night.
 -Yes, yes, but it was Borg-Panatta.

145
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:23.360
Now I have to rush.
 - Good luck with the test, Max.
 - Does anyone want to be pushed?

146
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:32.360
Have a nice time in the hot car so I'll cycle out in snow and slush.

147
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.040
- Here, Lina.
 -Not that!

148
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:44.240
- Yes, it has old grandmother knitted.
 - She's blind.

149
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.480
It took two years to finish.
 - Do you buy food?

150
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:56.520
- Yes, what do you have another husband?
 - Write on guarantee paper.

151
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:23.920
Edberg, Stich, Agassi and so Becker, Sampras ...

152
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:42.040
Time for the decisive match.

153
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:48.920
It will be an exciting final, an racker.

154
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:55.040
Hello, Conny.
 Do you have any parent at home?
 Not that?
 Good.

155
00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.680
Did you find someone who can help you?
 Olle?
 How nice!

156
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:07.960
Look at the address tags and hand out the newspapers.

157
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:15.760
You get 200 when you are ready ... where.
 But dress up properly.

158
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.320
Wait, I forgot one thing.

159
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.760
Dad, have you seen my bus card?

160
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.400
I thought I saw it at the phone.

161
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.800
Say nothing to Mom ... Max?
 Wait!

162
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.880
No!
 Hello!

163
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:43.800
... American backhand side ... Edberg goes online.

164
00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:53.320
- Max buys nasal drops on the way home.
 -Thanks.

165
00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:00.600
Why did you stand out in the cold for so long?

166
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.720
Edberg was superb.

167
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.560
You have certainly received pneumonia.

168
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:17.520
- I saw my whole life passing the review.
 - Stack, were you boring?

169
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:25.080
- Do you know what happened?
 - Yes, I've been close to dying.

170
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:33.200
No, no, something much worse.
 Someone has tried to break into my house.

171
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:41.280
- What the hell would I do?
 - Where did you get in the windows?

172
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:49.560
- Why in hell didn't you open?
 - There is that Tom and I lay in the bath.

173
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:56.880
- It was so sad in his office.
 - Does Tom Lindvall align in your bathtub?

174
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:02.800
No, he stands in the kitchen and cooking.
 Something oriental.

175
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.200
Why does all men fall for you?

176
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:13.520
Could it be the new balm shampoo?
 Tom wants us to become companions.

177
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.520
"Sara's hair, skin, grill and capital management".

178
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:27.280
- Needle ... - Can I borrow 400,000 more?

179
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:35.400
- I should cut the whole family for free.
 - I can kill you for free.

180
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.480
Come on when the salon makes a profit.

181
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.520
Tom thinks I will go a long way.

182
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.840
It is enough to go home.

183
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.120
No, now I go up and bed down, so you can play about me.

184
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:03.120
- How did it go with the weekly magazines?
 - I have solved that.

185
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:10.880
- How did it go for Max on the test?
 -Canceled.
 Miss looked at tennis.

186
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:17.880
Of course it is shameful.
 Grown ups!

187
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:25.200
Yes ... but it's not the same.
 I've arranged it.

188
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:33.040
Next time it is tennis on TV you will be on sick leave as usual.

189
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:42.440
- What do you have there?
 - magazines.

190
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:50.200
Olle and Conny stand in the school yard and sell them for a penny each.

191
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:57.840
- Sure it's cheap!
 - They have two bags full.
 Hurry up!

192
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.120
-Hell.
 -Go to sleep.

193
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:10.080
We can afford to buy our own magazines.
 Yes, yes ... take a ladies' world then.

194
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.400
