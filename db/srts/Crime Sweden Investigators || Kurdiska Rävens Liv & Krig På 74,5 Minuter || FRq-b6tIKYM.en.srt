1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,970
Imagine that you are a very close business partner of someone.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,939
You make a lot of money together.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:12,911
What would they have to do to you to get you so upset that you get rid of their mother?

4
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:16,080
Let's find out the answer now.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,620
How does the child of refugee parents go from being a boy to finally settling in a small dark, cold and Nordic country,

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:41,133
to growing up over 30 years later to a man who finds himself in the middle of cross-border politics and diplomacy, the most wanted and ruthless criminal and leader of a feared gang wreaking havoc across multiple continents.

7
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:52,108
Bosnia, Tunisia, Turkey, Norway, Iraq, Sweden, Iran, the whole world has been the playing field.

8
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:59,448
This is the story of the Kurdish fox and the foxtrot. And where is he now?

9
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:28,904
When the Foxtrot network, once a unified crime syndicate, split, one of the most violent periods in the history of organized crime was unleashed. The now fractured Foxtrot network has split into two hostile phalanxes, with ten central targets of highest priority for each gang.

10
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:40,880
At the heart of this bloody conflict are two men: Rawa Majid the Kurdish Fox and Ismail Abdo the Strawberry.

11
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,853
They, along with their followers, have turned their former bonds of friendship into a battle to the death.

12
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:53,824
Ask yourself, could you kill the mother of your worst enemy?

13
00:01:53,824 --> 00:02:05,967
Benzema has previously been painted as the Kurdish Fox's right-hand man in the Foxtrot network, now it seems that the wind has turned, at least if you look at the surface.

14
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:10,523
Has Benzema distanced himself from the Kurdish fox and foxtrot and made peace with the Strawberry?

15
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:14,007
all these questions you will get the answer to!

16
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:22,811
drug smuggling, kidnappings, arson, assaults, bombings, shootings and fake deaths.

17
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:25,516
This tragic story has it all.

18
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:34,356
We know how the wave of violence started a conflict with the Dalen gang about, among other things, the city of Sundsvall and the region's drug market.

19
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:52,070
One man in particular has a strong hand in what happens in Sweden in 2023, making him one of the most wanted men in Sweden.

20
00:02:52,070 --> 00:03:05,181
This is the story of Rawa Majid, 37 years old, better known as the Kurdish Fox, the leader of the Foxtrot network.

21
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:25,897
Rawa Majid is of Kurdish descent and was born on July 12, 1986 in Iran. His parents fled when the Iran-Iraq feud intensified. Only a few months old, Rawa came with his family to Uppsala.

22
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:41,376
Uppsala is a small city about 70 km from Stockholm, Sweden's capital. Rawa did well in school as a child. After finishing school and turning 18, he opened his own small business in Uppsala.

23
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:58,156
However, his career in crime began not long after. In 2010, he was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for several drug offences. This included handling cocaine that he imported from the Netherlands.

24
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:15,703
In February 2015, he was granted early parole. He owned an ice cream kiosk in Uppsala which he later used for money laundering. However, the freedom of the Kurdish fox was short-lived. Just months after his release, he violated his probation and was imprisoned once again.

25
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:20,640
In 2018, he was released again and banned from leaving Sweden.

26
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:35,118
One of the Kurdish Fox's cousins, Shad, was the leader of the Headshot League, or HSL. Shad was shot dead in his car in Barkarby 5 June 2018.

27
00:04:35,118 --> 00:04:52,466
A double murder occurred in Kista in 2017 when the leader of the gang Lejonen, was shot dead in his car together with another young man on 8 March.

28
00:04:52,466 --> 00:05:12,215
Shad's brother, Kurdish fox's cousin, Lanko was convicted of the double murder. After Shad's death, there was even speculation within the family that the Kurdish Fox was somehow involved in the murder of his own cousin Shad.

29
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:20,154
For some reason, threats directed at him, the Kurdish fox got permission to leave Sweden.

30
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:30,129
He was allowed to travel to his parents' country of birth, Iraq, and eventually registered in his mother's birthplace, a city in the eastern part of Kurdistan, Iraq.

31
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,635
The Kurdish Fox picked up where he left off and began smuggling and selling narcotics again.

32
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:53,414
It wasn't until 2020 that he had appeared on the radar as a major drug trafficker in Sweden. After the police managed to hack into the encrypted chat services he used, he became a wanted man.

33
00:05:53,414 --> 00:06:02,321
Sweden is one of Europe's richest nations and was previously one of Europe's most peaceful nations.

34
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:15,164
Recently, Sweden has fallen into an unprecedented wave of violence. Throughout 2022, 391 shootings were recorded and 2023 was no different.

35
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:29,576
In the month of September 2023 alone, eleven people were shot dead. These gangs recruit young adolescent boys, some as young as 13 years old, to carry out missions.

36
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:35,280
Rawa Majid is better known as the Kurdish Fox, leader of the Foxtrot network.

37
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:44,254
The central and important members could at least be identified early on by their golden fox rings and chains they wear.

38
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:53,828
The Foxtrot gang mainly focused on bringing in large consignments of various drugs to Sweden and then selling them on to other gangs.

39
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:59,533
They are now also notorious for not shying away from using brutal violence.

40
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:15,312
At least since 2020, the Kurdish Fox had total control over the Foxtrot gang and its operations. In November 2021, Swedish police together with Iraqi police started an operation and raided the house that the Kurdish fox was in.

41
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:21,417
Unfortunately for them, he had been tipped off and the fox was gone.

42
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:40,932
The Kurdish fox seems to have political connections and contacts in this area of ​​Iraq, they seem to be trading favors for favors at this point anyway. In March 2022, he is moved to Turkey under a false name and by buying expensive real estate there, he manages to become a Turkish citizen.

43
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:48,705
His name then slowly but surely starts to appear more and more in the Swedish media.

44
00:07:48,705 --> 00:08:05,185
After two large shipments of narcotics were seized by Swedish police on February 11 and 14, a conflict started between the Kurdish fox, his Foxtrot network and the Bandidos MC in Sweden over who would take the loss for these lost drug deliveries.

45
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:19,696
Within two weeks of the lost and seized shipments of narcotics, the Bandido MC clubhouse in Brandbergen, south of Stockholm, was fired upon with an automatic weapon.

46
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:33,941
On March 4, 2022, an innocent hairdresser was shot dead in his car outside the same clubhouse after the shooters misidentified him as a Bandidos member.

47
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:38,244
Among other things, members of the Zero network were convicted of this murder.

48
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:46,551
Two weeks after this murder, the Kurdish Fox ordered his minions to get ready for new actions against the Bandidos MC

49
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:56,659
March 28, 2022 a young man can be seen entering a gym in the middle of Stockholm City and then running down the stairs to the gym's basement level.

50
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:13,606
His mission is to shoot a certain Bandidos member who is training at this gym. About to do so, another man inside the gym, Fredrik, a completely innocent man who was familiar with the Bandidos member, tried to step in and stop the young lad.

51
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:21,112
Several shots are then fired inside the gym. On surveillance footage, you can see visitors running up the stairs in total panic.

52
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:27,083
You can also see the intended target, the Bandidos member, being limped out of the gym.

53
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:35,056
The shooter also ran back up the stairs and even tried to escape through the wrong door before someone guided him in the right direction.

54
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:47,666
Fredrik who tried to help died of his injuries in hospital a few days later. The hired killer turns out to be only 16 years old when he did it.

55
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:59,609
Rapper 5iftyy, who belongs to the Bro network, which is allied with the Kurdish fox and foxtrot, is seen in a music video wearing a t-shirt that reads, among other things, "Free Frunze" who was the 16-year-old killer.

56
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:17,623
In April 2022, a gardener in a park in the Turkish city of Marmaris found a bag that someone had left behind. The bag contained wads of cash and was handed over to the police.

57
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:23,528
Police counted several currencies with a total value of over $12,000 inside the bag.

58
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:37,239
After checking the security cameras in the vicinity of the park, the police managed to identify a man named Miran Otoman. They invited Miran to the police station to collect the bag.

59
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:48,414
He introduced himself as a shipping tycoon, but the police decided to run his ID through all their databases and discovered that this was an internationally wanted man

60
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:58,389
Interpol had a red notice for him. The man in front of them was the wanted Kurdish fox.

61
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:10,865
The Turkish police arrested him at the same time they raided his villa where they found unlicensed weapons, large sums of cash and luxury items such as designer clothes, watches etc.

62
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:20,573
But this was not the end of the Kurdish fox. He had bought Turkish citizenship for around $400,000 in 2020.

63
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:35,018
Turkey has become a haven for criminals as they can buy citizenship by investing in real estate in the country. Despite the fact that Sweden, together with Interpol, has requested his extradition, the Turkish authorities have refused to do so.

64
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:47,461
Following this, Swedish police shared an extensive police report on the Kurdish fox and his Foxtrot network in order to help Turkish intelligence prosecute him.

65
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:59,404
Information about the whereabouts of the suspects, pictures of them and what they are accused of and more evidence. The report was highly confidential and could only be read by certain police officers.

66
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:15,917
The document was leaked, the Kurdish fox got access to the report, it turned out when later in 2022 a gang member was arrested in Sweden and on his iPhone was found the highly confidential report they had made to help Turkey.

67
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:21,121
But the worst was yet to come.

68
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:27,092
Towards the end of 2022, a conflict between Foxtrot and the Dalen network began.

69
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:39,702
Michael alias the Greek is a 25-year-old man who, despite his young age, is said to have managed to become a leading figure in the Dalen network, he is said to live abroad for his own safety.

70
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:50,678
The police describe Dalen as a criminal network that, among other things, originates and operates in Enskededalen, but also in Skarpnäck and other areas in Stockholm.

71
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:56,649
They also have branches in other parts of the country, including Sundsvall and Gotland.

72
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:02,554
They engage in drug trafficking, violent crimes, weapons crimes, extortion, etc.

73
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:11,794
That they are active actors in violent conflicts is also a well-known fact through, among other things, investigations and intelligence.

74
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:21,736
The fact that members often wear bulletproof vests, even with heavy plates to withstand heavy ammunition, is also a clear indication that they are in violent conflict with other criminals.

75
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:30,709
The police's belief was that Mario Golzar, aka Super Mario, was until recently the leader of the Valley Network and their various areas.

76
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:41,685
He is said to have supplied the areas and networks with large quantities of narcotics. However, Michael, aka the Greek, has probably largely taken over his role as a leader,

77
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:51,493
including because Super Mario was imprisoned when he was convicted of drug smuggling and also for his involvement in the kidnapping and blackmail of the famous rapper Einár before his death.

78
00:13:56,497 --> 00:14:05,737
Rapper Thrife is described as a high-ranking member of the Dalen network and he is considered to be just below Greken in the hierarchy.

79
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:09,707
He is often seen with the rest of the older core members of the gang.

80
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:15,979
Another well-known Swedish rapper, Haval, is also considered by the police to be a high-ranking member of the Dalen network.

81
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:26,420
Haval has already served several prison sentences, most recently for his involvement in the kidnapping of the now-deceased rapper Einár.

82
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:34,393
We know how the wave of violence started, a conflict with the Dalengänget about, among other things, the city of Sundsvall and the region's drug market.

83
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:45,969
In the middle stands KP, a 21-year-old man who has been singled out as the key person and the extended arm of the Kurdish fox and foxtrot in the area regarding the conflict in Sundsvall with the Dalen network.

84
00:14:48,971 --> 00:15:00,881
KP has initially been part of the local Dalennättverket grouping in Sundsvall. Then after an argument with his old friends and Dalen, he switched teams and went over to the opposing side Kurdish Fox and Foxtrot.

85
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:15,859
When KP, who became central to the major indictment in 2023, felt badly treated by his cronies, the seeds were sown for what is now being played out during one of the country's largest gang trials to date.

86
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:26,935
KP is suspected of having coordinated several attempted murders through shootings and explosions, all in order to eventually expand Foxtrot's control over northern Sweden's drug markets.

87
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:32,773
“He's not going anywhere. Inshallah. Tomorrow he will already be in the crocodile's mouth." A message sent by KP.

88
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:45,016
The recipient of this message was a person hired to spy on an intended murder victim and chart his habits and then report this back to KP.

89
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:49,219
et starts with some chat messages in November 2022.

90
00:15:49,219 --> 00:16:04,031
The conversation starts with KP feeling badly treated by his old friends in the Dalen gang. That's KP's version of events, and he also alludes to accusations that his old friends tried to "cheat" him, trick him into a death trap.

91
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:12,337
He writes to a key person in the Dalen gang, you will have war now. I'm gonna fuck you. And you will see.

92
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:22,979
On December 2, 2022, there will be a shooting in Sundsvall. The recipient of the messages is shot at together with two friends. He is hit by several bullets, but survives.

93
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:30,952
KP is thus believed to have taken lethal measures against his old friends and now he belongs to the Foxtrot gang constellation.

94
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:43,929
This is confirmed by the fact that he himself talks about Foxtrot's goal on Snapchat to become the biggest drug dealers and suppliers in northern Sweden and wipe out the competition.

95
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:53,870
But what both parties think they are saying to each other in secret, encrypted messages online is in reality under police surveillance, step by step.

96
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:13,853
Then 19-year-old Yosef Key was very close friends with gangster rapper and superstar Einár at the time of his death. Einár had just turned 19 the month before when he was betrayed, chased and shot dead outside his apartment in Hammarbysjöstad in Stockholm.

97
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:31,834
In addition to the fact that after the murder of Einár Yosef still seems to have a continued close relationship with Einár's half-brother, Einár's name or nickname Nisse is mentioned several times in the criminal investigation by Yosef or by others involved in the murder plans against the rapper Thrife, a member of the Dalen network.

98
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:42,709
Does this assassination mission have anything to do with the murder of Einár. Is it Revenge or is it connected to something else entirely? or both?

99
00:17:46,712 --> 00:18:01,290
On December 13, 2022, after being under surveillance for several weeks, Yosef was observed under police surveillance. Yosef acted nervously, jogging a few stretches and looking around a lot. Yosef bent down and placed something next to a couple of pots outside the gate.

100
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:16,236
Yosef was then stopped and checked on the same street. He was arrested when police discovered he had hidden a weapon, a loaded Glock, outside the gate. Joseph's phone was confiscated and very interesting things were later found there.

101
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:24,809
Through external and internal intelligence, Joseph can be connected to several addresses.

102
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:36,785
House searches are therefore carried out in several places. The police find ammunition and narcotics in an apartment in the basement and the storeroom, the police find several kilos of amphetamines, hash, etc.

103
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:50,263
They were seized in connection with the house search being carried out. Gazmend and another man came walking towards the building. They were checked by police personnel and taken in for questioning.

104
00:18:50,263 --> 00:19:03,006
Gazmend is the same man whose name is on a long enemy and death list created by the Dalen network. Seven months later, Gazmend was shot dead on a balcony in Ulvsunda on July 10, 2023.

105
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:14,548
Yosef Key is also on this death list. It appears that Yosef Key had a close relationship with the now murdered Gazmend and Einar's half-brother.

106
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:33,030
Having been in custody since mid-December 2022, there are several interesting chats that touch on the then-ongoing major gang conflict in Stockholm with, among others, the users Ghost worldwide, Animal shopping and El Zorro, one alias of which belongs to the Kurdish fox.

107
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:50,010
According to the investigative report, Yosef is in a group chat called Team Nisse, aka Team Einár on the encrypted network Signal. The following content consists of, among other things, the planning and preparation regarding a murder of the rapper Thrife.

108
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:59,751
The chat material shows that several attempts are made to locate where Thrife lives or is staying. They are trying to assemble a hit squad of at least three men to carry out this murder.

109
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:18,733
The sender, a person with the username Ghost worldwide in the encrypted chat app Signal is then said to be a high-ranking man within the Foxtrot organization, takes the lead in instructing Yosef how to plan Thrife's murder in the chat material.

110
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:34,145
It is also stated by Ghost Worldwide that a "japping" or murder must be taking place as an unknown rapper allegedly said very disrespectful things about Einár in a TikTok video, both Ghost worldwide and Yosef Key are wondering who this rapper is.

111
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:48,656
The user Ghost Worldwide writes that the Kurdish Fox is basically Upplands Bro or the Bridge Network, and that they were very close friends of the now murdered Einár.

112
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:59,432
Yosef was convicted of the crimes and sentenced to seven years and ten months in prison for his involvement in the conspiracy to murder gang-linked rapper Thrife.

113
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:14,443
Now we go back to KP and Sundsvall, the origin of the extremely brutal conflict between Dalen and the Foxtrot network. The feud stems from a battle for control of the drug market in certain cities and regions.

114
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:25,419
Sundsvall had long been supplied with drugs by the Dalen network. Then Foxtrot tried to enter the market, which led to the beginning of this conflict.

115
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:29,389
The valley network was not going to back down.

116
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:42,299
Police investigators have been able to follow what is happening in real time through data monitoring, while the various sides begin to plan and map out how to kill their enemies. A total of ten murders are believed to have been planned and to help him, 21-year-old KP had his own death list.

117
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:55,443
According to information, he had not been at the address for a long time and was believed to be abroad. He has several ongoing conflicts. One hypothesis was that he was involved in the murder of Einár.

118
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:59,412
"I stand with Scar, brother it sounds *bang*"

119
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:17,994
They were childhood friends, but ended up on opposite sides of a conflict. Gang member and rapper Dumlee was shot dead on 25 December 2022 in Rinkeby, Dumlee was with Einár when he was shot dead in October 2021 and was formally suspected of being involved in the murder.

120
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:27,868
So one theory was that now even Scar, 23 years old, is subject to reprisals because of Einár.

121
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:34,340
Scar is described by the police as a person with great capital for violence.

122
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:49,852
From the beginning he was considered a running boy for the Dalen network, but he was soon responsible for security at larger meetings and as the one who was armed at these, also acting as the Dalen network's responsible for handling and moving the gang's weapons.

123
00:22:49,852 --> 00:23:01,328
It soon became clear that he began to act as a climber or perpetrator in violent crimes, something that he seems to find satisfying. He sees himself as a "sicario" assassin.

124
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:10,235
Scar has also acted as a bodyguard for the Greek, Michael, the leader of the Valley Network, both in Sweden, but also when they went abroad.

125
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:24,747
Scar is said to have carried out acts of violence, shootings and murders on behalf of his Dalen network, but also carried out missions for payment and favors for other networks that are allied with the Dalen, for example 23ST from Farsta.

126
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:33,320
The police authority's overall assessment is that SCAR is part of a criminal network, the Valley for Organized Crime.

127
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:39,825
Scar is suspected of being a target for attacks during the conflict with the Kurdish Fox and Foxtrot.

128
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:51,835
A hand grenade is thrown into the doorway where Scar and his family are written. In addition to that, Scar is also suspected of being an active actor in acts of violence against Foxtrot and their allies.

129
00:23:51,835 --> 00:24:00,942
After the attack on Scar and others in the gang, the conflict between Dalen and the Kurdish fox is a fact. Several shootings and explosions targeting homes in Stockholm occur.

130
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:11,951
In the early morning hours of New Year's Eve 2022, an apartment building address linked to the rapper Haval, a member of the Dalennävterket, has its gate blown off by a bomb.

131
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:24,594
The valley network then begins to plan revenge against the opposing side. They recruit climbers and torpedoes from all over Sweden who, in exchange for payment, will carry out various acts of revenge on their behalf.

132
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:32,903
Here are some of the incidents that the police believe the Dalennävretnet is behind.

133
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:50,915
Among other things, the police have compared the names and addresses of those who have been exposed to crimes against a so-called "death list" that they found on an arrested gang member's mobile phone. There are names and addresses of people whom the Valley Network at the time considered to be on the opposing side and are their enemies.

134
00:24:52,917 --> 00:25:01,423
January 2, 2023. Early in the morning, an explosion occurred in Bagarmossen in Southern Stockholm. Someone threw a hand grenade into a stairwell of an apartment building, causing shrapnel damage as a result.

135
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:11,832
The aforementioned Yosef Key connected to the Foxtrot network and his brothers are listed at the address.

136
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:19,304
Yosef Key is on the Dalennäverket's list of enemies when he was convicted of murder plans on the Dalennäverket's rapper Thrife.

137
00:25:19,304 --> 00:25:33,015
An 18-year-old rapper from Huvudstad in northern Stockholm who was signed to a record company controlled by the Dalennätverket is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison for throwing the hand grenade.

138
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:42,789
January 5, 2023. A hand grenade is thrown into the stairwell to the address of the apartment building in Farsta, south of Stockholm. A person on the death list lives there.

139
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,759
The conflict between Dalen and Foxtrot escalates significantly.

140
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:59,202
On January 12, 2023, shortly after 04:00 in the morning, a door and the facade of an apartment building in northern Stockholm are sprayed with bullets. It is an attack on the Greek and the address he is connected to.

141
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:10,178
January 14. On Saturday morning, bullet holes were discovered in an apartment door in Märsta. Another attack on the Greek.

142
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:20,586
January 16. At 19:38. A shooting takes place in northern Stockholm in Hagalund on the home court of the NBA gang.

143
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:32,562
A then 21-year-old rapper was found at the scene lying with gunshot wounds, enlift data the victim was shot from behind. He was shot several times and taken to hospital with serious injuries.

144
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:47,007
Now 22-year-old rapper Lee Blockboy, who then belonged to the NBA gang from Hagalund, is shot with several shots and seriously injured, but survives the assassination attempt. The rapper's name was on the death list.

145
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:58,249
According to reports, this was due to an internal split within the NBA gang where they took different sides in the Foxtrot and Dalen gang conflict.

146
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:09,058
January 17. On Tuesday morning, a restaurant on Södermalm in Stockholm was damaged by a powerful explosion from an explosive device. The restaurant is connected to relatives of the Greek.

147
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:22,902
January 18. A new bomb is placed and an explosion occurs the next day, on Wednesday morning, this time at a company property in Kista in northwest Stockholm. This attack is also directed at the Greek.

148
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:35,812
Early in the morning of January 18, the Greek himself enters into a discussion with KP. First he tries to persuade KP not to run with the Kurdish fox.

149
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:43,418
“Do you think the fox cares about your family?” he asks in the chat conversation. “This is about you going with the fox against me.”

150
00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:46,338
"You're getting into something that won't end well."

151
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:57,329
KP responds to this message by writing, “we will go to war with you in the street. But since we can't find you because you're hiding, we have to lure out your whores.”

152
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:12,274
“This pisses off the Greek. The Greek writes back that KP will soon cry blood and that relatives and family are also in danger because of KP's choice. "The fox only has 15 yearlings."

153
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:19,113
“I have snipers, real killers.” “You will be hunted for the rest of your life. You are dead."

154
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:36,594
Soon after, the police can follow how KP is suspected of having planned a murder of a member of the Dalen. The 21-year-old and the Foxtrot gang rely on using and hiring freelancers, mainly very young men and teenagers from other parts of the country, to help them carry out violent attacks.

155
00:28:36,594 --> 00:28:44,233
For payment, three so-called steps, people who carry out the deed, travel from different parts of Sweden up to Sundsvall.

156
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:59,545
They are assigned to detonate a bomb outside the home where the target from the local Dalen network lives. Three other young men, "shooters" also travel from different cities up to Sundsvall

157
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:04,516
They have been assigned to carry out an assassination on another member of the Dalen gang and they have a Glock with them.

158
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:19,428
Finally, two bomb experts from the Stockholm area travel up to Sundsvall who have previously helped them to supply the Foxtrot network with explosives. "Blow up his entire whore balcony," writes the alias Hamado from the Foxtrot network.

159
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:32,305
During the planning, those within Foxtrot agree that the cubs will carry out the deed. It appears obvious in the investigation that it is a stated strategy to use minors as soldiers.

160
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:44,814
They are either lured with money, status tricked or threatened to take on these assignments while some young people actively seek freelance assignments, they want to do this.

161
00:29:46,816 --> 00:29:59,826
KP is very clear that you cannot back out once you have agreed to an assignment. When it appears that the girlfriend of one of the intended victims may be in the residence to be attacked, the perpetrators receive the following orders from KP.

162
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:03,882
"Kill her too if you must."

163
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:05,898
"It's not a problem."

164
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:13,771
21-year-old Wafi is a local rapper in Sundsvall and also a high-ranking member of the local Dalennävterket phalangen in the city.

165
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:28,349
At one point, KP tries to use an older woman to lure out his former friend Wafi so he can be shot dead. But KP will go no further than planning because on January 26, everything changes.

166
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:38,857
Until then, the police have followed every step of the planning and hours before the attacks, the police raid a number of homes and properties in Sundsvall.

167
00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:47,831
The police find thermos bombs, automatic weapons and pistols, among other things. Several of the now over 20 defendants were arrested there.

168
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:59,040
KP himself denied all the allegations and claims that the mobile phone and chats linked him and which of the police's biggest evidence against him is not his.

169
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:10,015
In books that he has borrowed, notes have also been found where there is no comment all the way through, apparently as a call to other detainees not to answer the police's questions.

170
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:20,857
January 19, 2023. Three incidents take place on the same day. Several shots are fired at an apartment in Farsta in southern Stockholm.

171
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:33,901
Several shots are also fired at an apartment door in Husby in northern Stockholm. On the death list, the address in Husby is listed as "Foxy far" aka the father of the Kurdish fox.

172
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:44,776
even a shooting at a house also takes place in a smaller, exclusive neighborhood outside Uppsala. The target in the house is on the death list with address and name.

173
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:58,620
This is the same residence and area where a completely innocent 24-year-old female student dies when the address is subjected to a bomb attack and several nearby houses are destroyed during September 2023.

174
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:05,726
On the evening of March 2nd, the television program Wanted is broadcast. Two young men are wanted for crimes.

175
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:16,935
They are suspected of carrying out the January 19 shooting, the drive-by attack targeting relatives of the Kurdish Fox. The residence is fired upon from a car with automatic weapons.

176
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:27,043
The TV program publishes the names and pictures of the suspects. 3-4 hours later there is a knock on the door of a house in Tullinge, south of Stockholm.

177
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:39,653
A man in his fifties, the father of one of the wanted young men, lives there with his family. He opens the door and is immediately shot several times. A moment later he is dead.

178
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:49,194
Serdar, the victim, is believed to have been killed only because he was the father of the 25-year-old man who police say shot at the relatives of the Kurdish Fox.

179
00:32:49,194 --> 00:32:52,230
A swift and brutal revenge exacted by the Kurdish fox.

180
00:32:52,230 --> 00:33:03,072
January 2023, a hand grenade is thrown into the stairwell of apartments in Skarpnäck in southern Stockholm. They can also be found on the death list with given apartment numbers.

181
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:12,712
In the first 26 days of 2023, there had already been at least 13 bombings and one shooting each day.

182
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:18,984
Explosions, shooting, arson and other excessive violence.

183
00:33:18,984 --> 00:33:27,103
In the past year, Swedish news has been dominated by such headlines and gang violence has taken an unprecedented hold on Sweden.

184
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:38,600
According to police data from 2023, the Zero network was established shortly before 2020 and originates from Jordbro, which is located on the south side of Stockholm.

185
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,573
This neighborhood has been home to many notorious criminals throughout history. They eventually became an ally of the Foxtrot network.

186
00:33:46,573 --> 00:34:00,284
The Foxtrot network is led by the Kurdish Fox. According to Swedish police, the Foxtrot network organized large-scale drug smuggling to Sweden for wider distribution both within Sweden and outside its borders.

187
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:11,626
Cocaine, cannabis and other drugs are often marked with fox symbols. At first, the police believed that the Kurdish fox was only involved in drug smuggling.

188
00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:24,169
It wasn't until 2021 that the police realized that much of what was happening in Sweden could be linked to the Kurdish fox and how he went about taking over existing markets and controlling them.

189
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:31,875
One of the most significant alliances was apart from the Bridge network with the Zero network.

190
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:45,353
Initially, the Zero network began distributing and selling drugs for the Kurdish fox. But later, the Zero gang became even more important in supplying young boys from the area to carry out violent attacks against Foxtrot's enemies.

191
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:59,931
A member of Zero called herself Louise Gucci. Born in 2004, Louise Gucci was a young man early on involved in crimes such as violent robberies and small-scale drug dealing, while slowly falling deeper.

192
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:06,870
Louise Gucci became one of Foxtrot's most important men when it came to coordinating attacks against enemies of the Kurdish fox in Sweden.

193
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:24,383
On January 20, 2023, Louise Gucci orchestrated the attack targeting gang member and rapper Thrife's ex-girlfriend. Thrife is closely connected to the Greken and Dale network, a gang that Foxtrot is at war with at this point.

194
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:32,557
The attack was recorded by the two youths who carried it out and posted on social media for all to see.

195
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:56,909
It was Louise Gucci who recruited the two 14-year-olds to carry out the attack, supplying them with firearms and instructing them in detail what to do via text message.

196
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:10,387
Just one day later, on January 21, 2023, an eyewitness filmed something that happened in broad daylight in Enskededalen, the base and home ground of the Valley Network.

197
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:24,364
A young man runs for his life between houses in the neighborhood while being chased by two young boys, one of whom carries a firearm and shoots at the young man. The young man shot at was a random 20 year old.

198
00:36:24,364 --> 00:36:32,204
The two boys who chased and shot at the victim were two 15-year-olds from the Jordbro area, who belong to the Zero network.

199
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:44,814
They had received instructions from Louise Gucci to kill any youth who looked like a gang member. Examples of people either wearing a Gucci cap or an expensive designer jacket were given as description.

200
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:54,922
Basically, shoot anyone you think might be a member of the Valley Network. Just one day after this incident, Louis Gucci recruited a 20-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 14-year-old for yet another mission.

201
00:36:54,922 --> 00:37:04,796
Again, they were supposed to shoot someone in the Valley network on Louise Gucci's orders. The 20-year-old was driving the car and the other two would be the shooters.

202
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:15,438
However, the police intervened just in time because they had this gang member's address in Hammarbyhöjden under surveillance. The police tried to stop the car, but the suspects tried to flee.

203
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:28,182
After a short car chase, the suspect's vehicle crashed in the Gulmarsplan roundabout. All three were eventually caught and firearms were found in the car, and the police suspected that they had just stopped another assassination attempt from happening.

204
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:33,686
Shortly after this event, Louise Gucci was arrested.

205
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:45,495
January 26, 2023. Explosion at a property in southern Stockholm where a company has its premises. A person on the death list is a plaintiff in this case.

206
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:59,840
January 27, 2023, an explosion at the gate of an apartment building in Akalla in northern Stockholm. An address linked to the rapper 5iftyy from Upplands Bro and gang member in the Bro network allied with the Kurdish fox and Foxtrot.

207
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:17,521
In several other arrests, the police seized several mobile phones. By examining these cell phones, they were able to gain insight into a web of thousands of signal messages that revealed how these attacks were orchestrated.

208
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:31,699
This information obtained led to Louise Gucci being accused of helping to coordinate another attack, a murder that took place at a sushi restaurant on January 28, 2023 in Skogås on the south side of Stockholm.

209
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:39,171
The police were alerted to a shooting that had taken place in a small but crowded restaurant.

210
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:47,978
The victim was a 15-year-old boy who was shot in the face by another 15-year-old boy who did not know the victim at all.

211
00:38:47,978 --> 00:39:05,959
Although Louis Gucci was already in jail days before this incident took place, he was a prime suspect as messages showed that in the days leading up to the encounter he was asking where the targets might be and if anyone had extra information on him. However, he was acquitted in the trial.

212
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:23,506
The motive for the murder of the 15-year-old boy was revenge. He is said to have been involved in a shooting against one of the family members of the Kurdish fox. Almost immediately after that incident, retaliation was planned.

213
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:32,647
Louise Gucci was ultimately sentenced to 18 years in prison for her part in these aforementioned attacks.

214
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:47,959
The shooter, now 16, but at the time of the crime he was only 15 years old, was convicted of the murder but because of his age was given the maximum sentence of four years. He was paid SEK 100,000 for the murder.

215
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:53,797
These young boys commit these cruel acts for relatively small amounts of money.

216
00:39:55,798 --> 00:40:05,073
For the convicted shooter and murderer, Zikke, the money was more than enough to accept the job and afterwards flex with the money. He had taken several pictures of himself and displayed wads of cash.

217
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:23,854
CCTV footage from NK's department store in central Stockholm shows him using cash to buy himself a brand new moose knuckle jacket and new shoes. Rapper Adouli was present at Zikke's trial and was also kicked out.

218
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:35,363
January 29, 2023. An explosion in the stairwell of an apartment building in Bro in northern Stockholm. The rapper Moewgli and his brothers from the Bridge Network are written on the address.

219
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:54,979
Prosecutors have now brought charges against nine people who are suspected of having contributed in various ways to public destruction through bombs and explosions in January 2023. The accused were all men and were between 17 and 30 years old at the time of the acts.

220
00:40:54,979 --> 00:41:11,425
All events are connected to the conflict between Dalen and the Foxtrot network. The so-called bomb maker for the Dalen side of the conflict was arrested when explosives were found during a search of his apartment in Kungssängen in northern Stockholm at the end of January 2023.

221
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:21,667
The rappers Haval and Thrife are linked by the police and are considered high-ranking members of the Dalen network.

222
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:38,813
The rapper Pékénio, real name Amin from the gang 23ST, is also suspected of involvement in the bombings. The 23st gang is closely allied with the Dalennätverket and has at one point been considered to be the same gang by the police.

223
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:51,657
The rappers 5iftyy and Moewgli from Upplands Bro belong to the Bro network and are allied with the Kurdish fox and the foxtrot network, something you can clearly see in their music videos.

224
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:56,161
The totally ruthless and deadly conflict erupts in December 2022 between Foxtrot and the Dalennaverket.

225
00:41:58,162 --> 00:42:06,769
March 2, 2023. Several shots were fired at an apartment in Farsta in southern Stockholm. Second attack against the same address.

226
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:16,377
March 16, 2023. Someone pours flammable liquid and sets fire to the stairwell in Skarpnäck. Second attack against the same address.

227
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:23,949
During the same day, a huge explosion occurs and someone blows up the entrance to a house in western Stockholm.

228
00:42:33,957 --> 00:42:45,933
The father of rapper 5iftyy, who was also targeted on January 27, lives at the address. As previously mentioned, the rapper from the gang 23st allied with the Dalennaverket has been in custody since that day and has been suspected of this crime.

229
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:59,277
For two consecutive days, a designated key member of the May network, Furkan becomes the intended victim of an assassination plot.

230
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:03,714
The May network is, at least at this point, a close ally of the Foxtrot gang.

231
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:22,095
Furkan's name is on the death list. On March 19, 2023, outside the apartment building on Östbergabackarna, a car with masked people inside is stopped, three young men from Linköping, a murder squad, are arrested and later sentenced to prison.

232
00:43:22,095 --> 00:43:30,035
Furkan was lured to come and look at an apartment where the murder squad was waiting for him to arrive.

233
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:47,015
A fake estate agent was used to lure an unsuspecting Furkan there. The next day, March 20, 2023, Furkan who is still unaware of the events of the previous day is contacted again by the fake real estate agent.

234
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:57,023
He says he has another apartment for Furkan to look at, in Bromma. On the way there, Furkan is stopped by the police and arrested a few hundred meters away from the fake apartment showing.

235
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:10,600
The police are sending additional patrols to the address Furkan was going to. At the scene, two black-clad and masked men on electric scooters are waiting.

236
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:19,510
Both flee when they see the police arrive. One of them throws a gun but is caught after a short chase on foot.

237
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:28,681
The arrested man is called JJ, 22 years old and a member of the 22ST gang. The police take his phone when he is caught in the act, on JJ's phone the police later find the so-called death list.

238
00:44:28,681 --> 00:44:34,319
The other perpetrator manages to escape from the scene and is not caught.

239
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:51,666
During the following investigation, Scar, age 23, a known member of the Valley Network, is seen on surveillance footage in the taxi he left the area in. The taxi picked up Scar near the spot where the masked man escaped the police and shortly afterwards in time.

240
00:44:51,666 --> 00:45:10,548
Scar has since left the country, according to the police. JJ is sentenced to seven years in prison for preparation for murder. In total, at least 16 serious crimes have been committed and documented between January and March 2023 against twelve of the 41 people on the death list according to the police.

241
00:45:15,552 --> 00:45:22,057
Two of the men who were charged as perpetrators of several of the bombings directed at the Foxtrot network are from Malmö in southern Sweden.

242
00:45:22,057 --> 00:45:30,764
One of them is called Samer. Two of Samer's brothers were shot dead in Malmö in separate shootings.

243
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:38,136
Samer's third brother, Meysem, was tricked by his best friend on the day of one of the brothers' funeral to Dansörgatan in Malmö,

244
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:57,719
where he was left alone in a car by his friend and then shot five times. Despite serious gunshot wounds, the brother survived the assassination attempt thanks to his bulletproof vest. His best friend was convicted of aiding and abetting attempted murder and aiding and abetting another murder of the "Sheep".

245
00:46:01,722 --> 00:46:17,468
Samer can be seen having conversations with a female acquaintance about who has paid them to carry out these bombings against Foxtrot. Samer singles out the famous rapper Haval, who was one of the targets of the violence in late 2022, as responsible for ensuring that he would be paid for his mission.

246
00:46:20,437 --> 00:46:30,678
In a chat conversation he also mentions the rapper Thrife. The conversation turns to talking about why Haval and Thrife, who are famous rappers, do such things.

247
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:47,124
Samer says the two rappers weren't the ones who started it. Foxtrot blasted Haval's gate and fired at Thrife's front door, recording it. The police have branded both the rapper Thrife and Haval as gang members, and that they are both in the inner core of the Dalenna network.

248
00:46:47,124 --> 00:46:57,166
When the conflict between the gangs has been in full swing for a few months, in April a 25-year-old man who was connected to the criminal network Foxtrot is attacked.

249
00:46:57,166 --> 00:47:13,345
On April 17, 2023 at 6:59 p.m., the police received a call regarding a shooting in the middle of Umeå. A witness states that he heard several shots and at the same time the witness saw a person collapse to the ground.

250
00:47:15,347 --> 00:47:25,955
Patrick is then found shot multiple times. In connection with the incident, several eyewitnesses observe and film a person leaving the crime scene on an electric scooter in an easterly direction.

251
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:41,000
The victim was shot three times. A few hours after the incident, Oliver and Liam and three women were arrested for suspected involvement in the shooting.

252
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:49,407
Shooter Liam and Oliver pose for a picture 33 minutes after Liam shot the victim three times, leaving him to die.

253
00:47:49,407 --> 00:48:07,021
They are connected to the local Dalennaverket phalanx in Umeå and are considered to be behind it. The trial runs until December 2023. The victim survived the attempted murder, but in September 2023 he was arrested by the police task force.

254
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:26,737
The victim, Patrick, is sentenced to two years in prison by the district court for serious drug offences. The police have singled out a 23-year-old man as the mastermind behind the attempted murder in Umeå, he is suspected of inciting attempted murder, serious drug and weapons offences.

255
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:42,983
It is about an organized operation where they want to control the drug market in northern Sweden. Oliver visits John alias Don Svenson, the alleged mastermind behind it all, on at least one occasion in Spain before the assassination attempt.

256
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:59,963
In a picture in the preliminary investigation, it can be seen that John has published a picture of himself insulting the Kurdish fox and Foxtrot. There are several photos from Oliver's stay in Spain on his phone.

257
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:10,905
There are, among other things, pictures of a meeting with John, Robble and the rapper Wafi from Sundsvall from the same occasion. The rapper Wafi is connected to the local and allied gangs of the Dalennävternet in Sundsvall.

258
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:19,879
Sundsvall's area has not been calm since the big operation in January 2023.

259
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:35,858
An incident on July 9 turns out to be a continuation of the gang war when two teenage boys were found seriously injured. The boys were found on Sunday evening bleeding and badly injured after they sought help in a villa in Sidsjö in Sundsvall.

260
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:55,807
A 20-year-old from Sundsvall is both suspect and victim in the same case. Just as with the big police operation last winter, he is the one who, according to the suspicions, was the target of a planned shooting. Twelve people are on trial after the gang settlement in Sidsjö in Sundsvall this summer.

261
00:49:55,807 --> 00:50:03,180
Three are suspected of preparation for murder, eight of kidnapping and six of attempted murder - among other things.

262
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:17,758
According to the police's investigation, Foxtrotsidan once again planned for one of Dalen's men in Sundsvall to be killed. It is about a 20-year-old who for several years belonged to the top tier of the Dalen network's Sundsvallsfalang.

263
00:50:17,758 --> 00:50:30,368
He is also still among the suspects for the still unsolved shooting death in Korsta in Sundsvall in December 2020 when a 33-year-old man was shot dead with several shots, also the rapper Wafi and KP were suspected of this murder.

264
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:45,613
Three young shooters – aged 14, 15 and 16 – had been recruited by the Foxtrot side to kill the 20-year-old. A 24-year-old Karlshamn resident with Sundsvall's past had arranged housing for them.

265
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:51,585
But talk of the plans began to circulate in the criminal circles, and eventually the information reached the target himself - the 20-year-old.

266
00:50:51,585 --> 00:51:10,566
On the evening of July 9, a group of Dalen trusts led by the 20-year-old searched for the three hired shooters, overpowered them and took them away. They were badly beaten for a couple of hours, and two of the teenagers were left to die in the residential area of ​​Sidsjö in the middle of the night.

267
00:51:12,535 --> 00:51:19,540
Bleeding heavily, they sought help in a house, and the injuries were so serious that they were sedated at the hospital.

268
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:32,217
A total of 12 people with connections to the two networks are charged in the case, which has two parts. It is about, among other things, preparation for murder on the one hand, and attempted murder and more on the other.

269
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:40,190
The minor of the three hired shooters - who is thus under 15 - is a criminal suspect but is not charged because of his young age. He becomes a case for the social authorities.

270
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:51,232
The 21-year-old rapper Wafi was one of the targets to be murdered last winter, but he is now charged with, among other things, the attempted murder of the two boys in Sidsjö.

271
00:51:51,232 --> 00:52:10,681
KP was the central figure in the prosecution in 2023 since he left his former friends to become loyal to the Foxtrot gang. In October 2023, KP, whose real name is Soran Merzai, was found guilty on several charges and sentenced to eleven years in prison for preparation for murder.

272
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:23,658
After the incident in Sundsvall during the summer of 2023, the conflict between Dalen and Foxtrot seems to be slowing down, it feels almost quiet after six months of daily events.

273
00:52:23,658 --> 00:52:28,671
What happens behind the scenes?

274
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:41,305
In addition to the many enemies the Kurdish Fox has created in other gangs and networks, internal conflicts within Rawa Majid's own Foxtrot network began in the summer of 2023.

275
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:50,245
Disputes and disagreements within the Foxtrot gang started for various reasons. The members began to turn on each other.

276
00:52:52,247 --> 00:53:04,457
Ismail Abdo, 33 years old alias Strawberry, was once close to the Kurdish fox. The 33-year-old comes from a very wealthy family. He has big money behind him.

277
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:14,098
The Kurdish Fox and the Strawberry have been working closely together for the past few years and they know each other's weaknesses.

278
00:53:14,098 --> 00:53:18,034
They know where the other's relatives live and where weak points are.

279
00:53:18,034 --> 00:53:30,344
After several violent actions against each other abroad, kidnappings, assaults and shootings, there is a shooting in Istanbul on September 6.

280
00:53:30,344 --> 00:53:40,619
On surveillance footage, you can see that two men arrive on a moped and one of them jumps off and fires several shots at five people.

281
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:47,557
These five people in turn shoot back. No one was seriously injured, but the stakes were raised.

282
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:52,661
The following events for the next 30 days seem to come straight out of a movie.

283
00:53:52,661 --> 00:54:05,772
In Sweden, the day after the shooting, as immediate revenge, Ismail Abdo's mother, a woman in her late 50s, was shot dead in her home in Gränby, an area of ​​Uppsala.

284
00:54:05,772 --> 00:54:11,777
For obvious reasons, the intensity and brutality of this conflict soars after this.

285
00:54:13,778 --> 00:54:24,253
Bombings and shootings in Sweden and abroad occur daily after this, a few days after the murder of Strawberry's mother, a shooting directed at Rawa Majid's mother-in-law takes place.

286
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:30,191
An unknown assailant fires several shots from outside into the home of the Kurdish fox's mother-in-law.

287
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:44,069
Then, two days after the shooting, a man with no connection to the conflict was shot dead in the stairwell of his apartment early in the morning in Uppsala. The young man on his way to work was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

288
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:51,541
The intended target was a family member of the Kurdish fox who lived in the same apartment building.

289
00:54:51,541 --> 00:55:06,020
On September 11, 2023, gang violence in Sweden claimed one of its youngest victims to date. The remains of a 13-year-old boy were found in a wooded area in Haninge on the south side of Stockholm.

290
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:16,661
The boy had been reported missing a couple of days earlier and the youngster was said to have gang connections, one of which was to the Foxtrot network before the internal split.

291
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:31,440
In the summer months before this incident, the remains of Mohamed Suleiman and Layth Al-Azzawi were found in the northern and southern Stockholm region. Both boys were 14 years old and had been murdered.

292
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:40,580
The police and the media speculated that both boys, who were friends with each other, were reselling weapons they had received from the Foxtrot network.

293
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:48,520
When they were unable to retrieve the weapons, the leaders of the Foxtrot were out to make an example of them and eliminated them both.

294
00:55:48,520 --> 00:56:02,231
No other country in Europe has seen anything like it in modern times. Although Sweden has struggled with gang violence for years, the outbreak of shootings and bombings in September has been incredibly brutal,

295
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:16,175
three people are murdered in just 12 hours due to gang violence and the same conflict. Sweden's outdated and naive laws are not designed for brutal gang wars and child soldiers.

296
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:25,716
The Kurdish fox is still at large, isn't it? In any case, he is out of the hands of the Swedish authorities.

297
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:36,058
While Louise Gucci is in prison for following orders from the Kurdish fox, the internal conflict within the Foxtrot network has taken place six months later.

298
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:49,568
For example, foxtrot was once close to the so-called Zero network. But as the internal conflict continued, the Zero network decided to follow Ismail Abdo's Strawberry side.

299
00:56:49,568 --> 00:57:06,482
It wasn't long before Benzema or Mustafa who was then still a member of Foxtrot also became a target. On September 25, shortly after nine o'clock in the evening, there was an explosion in the stairwell of an apartment building in Hässelby, and this explosion was very powerful.

300
00:57:10,485 --> 00:57:20,159
It was made and placed with the intent to cause serious damage to the targeted apartment and possibly the people inside. Three people had been injured and taken to hospital.

301
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:26,235
It turned out that this attack was directed at Mustafa or Benzema's family members.

302
00:57:30,234 --> 00:57:39,208
9 hours later on September 26 at six in the morning, a bomb exploded so powerful that the entire front of the apartment building flew off.

303
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:55,887
According to the bomb squad that arrived at the scene, the building was so damaged that some parts could collapse completely. Despite the magnitude of the explosion, only two women suffered minor injuries. The goal was again related to Benzema / Mustafa.

304
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:59,357
This time it was a family member of his wife.

305
00:57:59,357 --> 00:58:10,766
With the increasing number of brazen attacks, it was only a matter of time before more people who had no connection to the feud became victims.

306
00:58:10,766 --> 00:58:19,540
During this time, the Zero network has distanced itself from the Kurdish Fox and Foxtrot. They are now on Ismail Abdo aka Strawberry's side.

307
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:34,952
something that makes this extra clear is that the rappers 5iftyy and numerouno release a song and music video called "gulag", 5iftyy belongs to Foxtrot and Nummeruno is from Jordbro and is connected to the Zero network.

308
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:45,427
The video is released towards the end of August, then in September the rappers stop following each other on Instagram and dissing each other online.

309
00:58:56,402 --> 00:59:03,908
September 27. On Wednesday evening, the police received several calls about a shooting in southern Stockholm.

310
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:13,315
An 18-year-old man had been shot multiple times, execution-style, on a lawn at the Mälarhöjdens IP in front of a large number of witnesses, including teenagers and young children.

311
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:26,993
The 18-year-old was treated at the scene, but his life could not be saved. The victim is a rapper, Adouli. He just turned 18 the month before.

312
00:59:26,993 --> 00:59:32,431
According to reports, the rapper was linked to the Foxtrot conflict and he was apparently on the side of the Kurdish fox.

313
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:47,242
The shots were intended for the rapper. Among other things, the rapper wrote on his Instagram "Free Zikke", a reference to the 15-year-old who was convicted of murdering a 15-year-old inside a sushi restaurant in Skogås in January 2023. The

314
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:56,049
murder of the rapper was filmed by one of the perpetrators.

315
00:59:56,049 --> 01:00:11,295
In the video, shots are fired from several men sitting inside a car. A little to their right, a young man lies still in the grass. The video was published and spread on an Instagram account.

316
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:21,770
At 23:54 just before midnight that evening, the police were called to another shooting in Jordbro, south of Stockholm.

317
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:38,750
In Jordbro Centrum, someone opened fire with at least one automatic weapon from a car and the police find two people with gunshot wounds at the scene, completely innocent victims and not connected to crime or the Foxtrot conflict at all.

318
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:53,562
A 23-year-old man was so seriously injured that he died a few hours later. After the fatal shootings on Thursday morning, the police received a call about a huge explosion in a residential area outside Uppsala.

319
01:00:53,562 --> 01:01:03,236
Two houses were completely destroyed in the explosion, which was so powerful that three adjacent houses were also damaged.

320
01:01:03,236 --> 01:01:12,777
A 24-year-old woman, a student who lives in a neighboring house, was seriously injured by the explosion and she dies of her injuries.

321
01:01:12,777 --> 01:01:25,287
12 hours, three people murdered in the conflict. The bombed address in Uppsala has previously attracted attention when the same house was fired upon with an automatic weapon from a car in January 2023 in the middle of the then wave of violence between the Dalennävterket and Kurdiska Räven's then-intact Foxtrot gang.

322
01:01:34,294 --> 01:01:45,569
In October, Friday the 13th, an hour past midnight, a 16-year-old boy breaks into Louise Gucci's older brother's house in southern Stockholm.

323
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:59,414
His older brother is a 40-year-old man, completely unrelated to any crime or his younger brother's gang activities. He is even a famous musician and part of a music group known for their positive messages and spreading joy.

324
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:10,556
After somehow getting into the house at night while several adults and at least three children were home, the boy opened fire with an automatic weapon,

325
01:02:10,556 --> 01:02:19,897
after the smoke cleared, two women were dead. Big brother's mother-in-law who was in her sixties and a twenty-year-old woman are the victims.

326
01:02:19,897 --> 01:02:25,434
There was another adult and three children in the house as well, who fortunately were not physically harmed.

327
01:02:25,434 --> 01:02:39,412
Less than an hour after the incident, they managed to arrest the suspect who was sitting in the back seat of a taxi. It is not uncommon in Sweden for suspects to flee the scene in a taxi, often booked by a third person or someone anonymous.

328
01:02:39,412 --> 01:02:55,925
The police stopped the taxi and inside was a 16-year-old boy. He tried to escape on foot, but after a struggle he was captured. The police searched the boy's pockets and they found ammunition and magazines in the trunk of the taxi. In a bag, the police found an automatic weapon.

329
01:02:55,925 --> 01:03:14,607
They suspected that this was the murder weapon that had just been used. The arrested suspect, a 16-year-old boy from Linköping, was then also suspected of another murder just 24 hours earlier with a very similar approach.

330
01:03:14,607 --> 01:03:30,419
The 16-year-old boy suspected of gunning down a father inside his home in a shooting in the middle of the night on October 12, the man died from his injuries. The man's wife and child also suffered gunshot wounds during the incident.

331
01:03:33,422 --> 01:03:39,393
The victim could not be linked to any criminal activity. He just seems to share the same last name as a gang member.

332
01:03:39,393 --> 01:03:50,335
On Sunday evening, October 15, a well-known Swedish rapper, 5iftyy known for his gang connections to the Bridge Network and Kurdiska Räven, announced that he would have an Instagram Live.

333
01:03:51,336 --> 01:03:59,309
This would take place at 20:00 in the evening Swedish time and a special secret guest would appear. Many thought it would be the Kurdish fox.

334
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:13,086
In the same vein and week of all the murders, shootings and bombings, there is a rumor, especially online and in the media, that the Kurdish fox has been arrested abroad in Iran.

335
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:21,159
and that his so-called right-hand man in Foxtrot, a man who calls himself Benzema is now dead.

336
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:32,135
There was reportedly a huge price on Benzema's head. According to these rumors, Strawberry orchestrated Benzema's arrest and subsequent killing in Iraq.

337
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:42,443
A short video circulated online showing a bloody man sitting in the driver's seat of a car, this person appeared to have been shot dead.

338
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:52,217
When Benzema's friends started posting Instagram and Snapchat stories containing rest in peace and pictures of Benzema, the rumors seemed to be true.

339
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:07,196
October 15, 2023. Rapper 5iftyy goes went live on Instagram. After half an hour of playing some new music to be released, the rapper and his friends revealed that the guest had joined the live.

340
01:05:07,196 --> 01:05:22,842
The guest was none other than Mustafa aka Benzema, alive. He was sitting on a chair posing with a gold colored AK47a and there were three masked men with automatic weapons posing as bodyguards. He claimed that 300 men guarded his house.

341
01:05:27,846 --> 01:05:38,521
Benzema made several interesting statements during his life. Benzema then claimed that the strawberry is a police informant, that he has worked together with the police in several countries.

342
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:55,234
He also claimed that the strawberry paid $1 million to have Benzema killed in Iraq. Benzema got wind of this and, with the help of a hired camera crew and actors, faked his own assassination in Iraq and then collected the prize money for his own life, which he claimed was $1 million.

343
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:12,214
He proclaimed that he would donate half a million dollars to charity and that the other half of Strawberry's money would be used by Foxtrot in the war against Strawberry himself.

344
01:06:12,214 --> 01:06:24,190
Benzema also said that the strawberry alias Ismail Abdo only kills completely innocent people and has not harmed a single person who is actually involved or connected to this conflict with the Kurdish Fox and Foxtrot.

345
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:35,166
He claimed that the strawberry was behind the bombing that killed a woman, a 24-year-old student who lived next door to the house that was blown up in September.

346
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:50,378
He also claimed that the Strawberry and the Zero network were behind the execution of 13-year-old Milo, the boy who was found shot in the head and dumped in a wooded area on the south side of Stockholm in mid-September.

347
01:06:50,378 --> 01:07:07,358
Several members of the Bro and Foxtrot network were arrested at the end of October in Tunisia. Five Swedish citizens were arrested because they had several pistols and narcotics in their possession. The police also seized nine mobile phones.

348
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:23,837
The gang members are currently under investigation by a special judicial authority dedicated to the fight against terrorism. They are being investigated as suspects of terrorism. The criminal classification may be due to the fact that for several years the Tunisian police have specifically targeted a phenomenon known as Islamic gangsterism.

349
01:07:23,837 --> 01:07:39,817
This has arisen in suburbs and poor villages where drug trafficking and radical Islamism have intertwined and cartels have collaborated with jihadist groups. Several acts of violence in the Foxtrot conflict have been carried out by the Bridge Network on behalf of Rawa Majid.

350
01:07:39,817 --> 01:07:51,793
October 23, 2023. On Monday morning at 05:42, the police received several calls about an incident in Enskededalen, an explosion at an apartment building.

351
01:07:51,793 --> 01:07:59,432
Now deceased superstar Einár's former close friend and rapper Hamko and his brothers are listed at the affected address.

352
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:13,744
Hamko and his brothers have previously been involved in the Dalen network before the internal split within the gang took place. Hamko and his brothers' names and the address they are written to were on the death list that has been circulating.

353
01:08:13,744 --> 01:08:25,086
Now 21-year-old Hamko has just served a prison sentence. Hamko, his older brother and a friend were convicted of an attempted murder of a 14-year-old boy in 2020. The

354
01:08:25,086 --> 01:08:31,258
14-year-old was walking with two friends when a car suddenly stopped and shots were fired.

355
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:43,601
The 14-year-old was shot in the abdomen and the boy was close to death, but managed to survive. Since Hamko's recent release from his prison sentence, he has said he will release new music

356
01:08:43,601 --> 01:08:51,574
and has posed for pictures with what police call a gang leader of the Farsta-Fagersjö network, a 24-year-old man known as Chris.

357
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:59,213
As old alliances are abandoned and new alliances seemingly formed overnight, only time will tell how things will end.

358
01:08:59,213 --> 01:09:06,185
October 31, 2023. We are in Bosnia and the city of Sarajevo.

359
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:16,660
On Halloween and Tuesday afternoon, there is a shooting after 4 p.m. Masked people on a moped opened fire in a residential area in Sarajevo and then left the scene.

360
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:25,634
A Swedish citizen, 30-year-old Harris Österdahl, died at the scene.

361
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:40,179
Another Swedish man was shot in the abdomen in the shooting and taken to hospital with minor injuries. According to police, both victims of the Sarajevo shooting, Harris and Elvir, belonged to the Kurdish Fox side of Foxtrot.

362
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:52,355
Harris and Elvir were both shot during the shooting in Istanbul on September 6th. Both were arrested after the shooting, but were later released and then quickly left the country and traveled to Bosnia.

363
01:09:52,355 --> 01:10:02,863
Harris, the victim, was a figure from Stockholm's criminal underworld and the murder is linked to the internal conflict within Foxtrot.

364
01:10:02,863 --> 01:10:15,507
That same evening at 19.30 a 26-year-old Swedish man was arrested. Later in the night, two more 19-year-old men, Swedish citizens, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murder.

365
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:28,017
According to records in 2020, after serving two years in prison, Harris joined the Foxtrot network. Several of the acts of violence in the conflict have affected family members or outsiders who are not related to the conflict.

366
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:34,555
This was the case earlier in 2023 when Harris' family was the target of an attack.

367
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:49,801
The detained 26-year-old Swedish man, Oliver, is also suspected of an earlier shooting in Turkey. Oliver is believed to have worked as a sort of hitman for the Foxtrot splinter faction led by Strawberry Ismail Abdo.

368
01:10:49,801 --> 01:11:04,612
Oliver is suspected of having carried out at least three acts against Foxtrot gang members since the split. After the shooting in Istanbul, Oliver is suspected of having followed five other Foxtrot members, including 5ifty and Elias Bäck, to Tunisia.

369
01:11:04,612 --> 01:11:13,720
However, Tunisian police arrested the five Foxtrot men before anything happened and after that Oliver traveled to Bosnia and sought out two of the Swedish men from the shooting in Istanbul.

370
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:33,936
26-year-old Oliver has appeared in several investigations on Swedish soil as well. He has been convicted several times in drug cases and has also been suspected of both murder and attempted murder recently. Among other things, he has been linked to the wave of violence that hit the Swedish city of Kalmar in 2022.

371
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:45,511
In early 2023, he was arrested on suspicion of a murder in central Kalmar in February 2022, but was released in the summer of 2023 when the suspicions against him could not be substantiated.

372
01:11:45,511 --> 01:12:03,059
The murder of the 22-year-old in February 2022 is considered to be the starting point for the wave of murders and shootings that followed in Kalmar during 2022. Earlier this year, Oliver was also acquitted in a trial that included aiding and abetting criminals in an attempted murder case.

373
01:12:03,059 --> 01:12:12,066
Oliver is believed to have previously been loyal to the Kurdish Fox, but is now believed to have switched sides in the internal Foxtrot conflict and is acting on behalf of Ismail Abdo.

374
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:16,970
Two young men aged 19 are the suspected shooters.

375
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:22,374
One of them is from Jordbro, south of Stockholm and is connected to the Zero network.

376
01:12:22,374 --> 01:12:33,916
The other is from Malmö in southern Sweden and he is also suspected of being the shooter when 19-year-old Giovanni was shot and killed in Vasastan in central Stockholm on September 13.

377
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:48,395
Benzema or Mustafa has now spoken out again saying that he and the Kurdish Fox or Rawa Majid met in prison twelve years ago and have been business partners for a long time.

378
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:52,431
Benzema claims he was never Rawa's right-hand man, but more of an equal partner.

379
01:12:52,431 --> 01:12:59,070
He also says that he has retired from the Foxtrot network and has started his own organization called La Liga.

380
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:11,680
After this war between Rawa Majid and Ismail Abdo, people got tired of all the shootings and bombings, especially that completely innocent people and family members were affected.

381
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:22,288
November 28, 2023. The shooting occurred just before 5 p.m. at the Mossehallen sports hall in the town of Moss in Norway, which is located about five miles from the Swedish border.

382
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:32,930
At least 7-8 shots must have been fired at the scene and the person shot was a Swedish citizen. The police were looking for at least two perpetrators who allegedly left the scene in a dark car.

383
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:41,403
The victim, a 33-year-old man, was hit by several shots and his condition is described as serious but that he would survive.

384
01:13:41,403 --> 01:13:53,246
The man is registered in the Stockholm area and in 2022 he received a sentence for minor drug smuggling. Before that, he has been convicted of, among other things, drug offences, assault and theft, and has also been convicted of a number of crimes in Norway.

385
01:13:53,246 --> 01:13:59,051
According to information, he is connected to the Foxtrot network.

386
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:07,024
Since this is happening in real time, who knows what the fate of the Kurdish fox and the Foxtrot network will be?

387
01:14:07,024 --> 01:14:09,063
