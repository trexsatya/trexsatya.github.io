1
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:05,625
An ordinary day starts with me looking over

2
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,500
What orders have been received.

3
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:11,458
Then we jointly go out and control the systems.

4
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,375
There are two types of techniques at an airport.

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,166
Those who screw on the aircraft

6
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,916
And those who screw at the airport.

7
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,291
I belong to the latter.

8
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,708
My systems never leave the ground.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,875
They are attached to everything from air traffic controllers in the tower

10
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,916
to the pilots.

11
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,166
We make sure the airport can be used.

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,958
I have always had a technical interest

13
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,375
so it is perfect to work with a great variety

14
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:38,541
of systems.

15
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,541
I get a good mix of the technical and military.

16
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,625
And in the role of officer get a job

17
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,791
With leadership and education.

18
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,291
What the Armed Forces means to me

19
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,416
is hard to put words on.

20
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,208
It is rather a feeling

21
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,583
that my job makes a difference

22
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,375
For myself and others.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,708
My name is ludvig

24
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,625
And I am a management system officer.
