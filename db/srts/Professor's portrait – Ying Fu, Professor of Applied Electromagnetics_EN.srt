00:00:01,314 --> 00:00:05,680
Meet ying fu, professor of applied electromagnetism

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,360
Hello! My name is ying fu and am professor of applied electromagnetism

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,920
  at the Academy of Information Technology.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,264
What is your research about?

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,200
For the most part, at least 50 percent, I research and work with technological development

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,960
in quantum technology and communication technology.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,170
Quantum technology is advanced in the sense that

8
00:00:36,475 --> 00:00:41,200
We try to work with photonic technology to pick up signals.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,720
The simplest examples are today's infrared cameras that we can use for

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,744
to measure body temperature. Instead of using regular thermometers at close proximity on patients,

11
00:00:54,744 --> 00:01:00,080
Can we now meet remotely, like a fairly quick screening.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,840
So this is mainly quantum technology, advanced photo detectors.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Another part is communication. We need fast communication,

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,920
For example, out in the field. Then you do not carry a large machine or drive big cars.

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:27,600
In most cases, we talk about distant areas, such as health care systems in remote locations.

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,400
So part of this with distant areas is, of course, that the people live there.

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,800
Not all people live in big cities. So we have to give all people proper care.

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,480
The second question is in the big cities. You get sick and you go to the hospital.

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:58,640
But there are many patients around the cities and in the hospitals so you get a health -related infection.

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,600
So that's today's problem with viruses. You are already ill, and then you are exposed to extra viruses and

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,640
Then there is a great risk that you will be worse. So don't go to the hospital.

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,120
We try to provide a type of diagnostic small unit with quick communication.

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:27,600
We try to find solutions for the smart city and the smart home. We live healthy and we live longer.

24
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:33,200
What is your most important role as a professor?

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,560
An important task is to disseminate information. The real information about

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:49,440
education, for example, knowledge, that we are researching and received money

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,080
From society so we try to give the community back the right information and education.

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,080
This dissemination of knowledge is very critical. At the academy I am happy to coach

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,240
The junior researchers and colleagues, doctoral students.

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,160
And in the teaching of the young, for the labor market of the future,

31
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,560
So we look at the opportunities for what future jobs will look like with today's technology.

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,600
We are moving towards a new society with a lot of new technology. We need to adapt

33
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,920
us with the right knowledge so that children and young people

34
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
After education can get a good job and a good life.

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,840
We have this role, an obligation to society, to provide information.

36
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,280
What are you doing in your research?

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,840
Most often, my research activities are about collaborations with companies.

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,400
A biomedical sensor with AstraZeneca. They develop new technology for drugs such as

39
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,320
inhalations against asthma. So they must be able to determine the effectiveness of these drugs.

40
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,000
I try to develop some technical meters that can

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,960
determine the effect of these drugs.

42
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,760
Many fun gadgets! Early we built a small portable machine

43
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,720
for the Swedish Road Administration to assess roads in the spring.

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,440
In the winter we have a lot of snow, and we spread a lot of salt to melt the snow.

45
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,080
But it is corrosive material, not good for the bridges.

46
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,482
So the machine is testing bronze

47
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,240
Lifetime and corrosion to see how long it can survive, another 50 years.

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
So these small machines are needed everywhere. We see the results quite clearly.

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,000
And I try to develop many small units to

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Products at some companies.

51
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,200
Why the area applied electromagnetism?

52
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,240
Partly it is about an interest. Another part is about the development needed

53
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,560
of society. So this is the challenge for sustainable social development.

54
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,320
We live in a world with great challenges.

55
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,680
We have the energy issue, we have the health care issue.

56
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,720
We also live longer so we have an aging population that places demands on society.

57
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,360
And then I've talked about this with my interest. I like technology, so from the beginning

58
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
When I was little and later at university

59
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,120
Have I always liked to play with these electronic things, photonic things, photos, cameras.

60
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,400
So photograph a great deal, such as the moon

61
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,560
on the night. I can do it with my mobile phone. So I play at home around the clock.

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,000
But then I get paid to play with these things that I love. It is the best!
