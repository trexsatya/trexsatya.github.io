00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01.840
Hello Hello

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,375
I hope everything is fine with you.

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,375
In this movie I was going to talk a little

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,700
About pronunciation and practicing pronunciation

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,000
I got a comment for

6
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:18,545
A while ago, I think it was before Christmas

7
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:21,325
There was someone on the channel here who

8
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:24,615
told he felt sad

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,720
because his pronunciation was not so good

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,560
So when he then tried to talk to Swedes

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,660
so they didn't understand what he is saying

12
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:36,105
or they do not understand what he is saying

13
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:39,335
And then became

14
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:42,485
the result that he pulled

15
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:45.505
back and became silent instead

16
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,615
because it is hard to try to talk and not be understood

17
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:52.075
and this I think many can recognize themselves in

18
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,405
somehow

19
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57.305
And the question then is how to do

20
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:02,275
I can say directly that I

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05.320
focuses a lot on pronunciation in

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08.440
my classes when i am teacher

23
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:11,965
But I wish I was

24
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:14,855
Even better at teaching in pronunciation

25
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:18.565
that I had even more control over

26
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:21,725
both the theory behind and how to do

27
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:25,085
It's something I work on but

28
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:28,355
That's why I thought about referring to two teachers

29
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,075
and scientists too, writers

30
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,695
would I say that is

31
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:37,145
very good at this with pronunciation, as I know

32
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,765
and it is partly a man named

33
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:41,095
Olle Kjellin

34
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,175
and he has written books about pronunciation

35
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:48,155
both more theoretical and more practical

36
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:50,285
For those who want to train

37
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:53,135
He also has several Facebook pages called

38
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:55,365
Swedish pronunciation and

39
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57.815
Swedish Prosody in Pratic and there is someone

40
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:00.785
In English too

41
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:03.955
I put links to his pages in this movie

42
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:07,395
There is another man named Bosse Thorén

43
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:10,435
that lectures a lot about pronunciation and

44
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:11,605
pronunciation education

45
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,855
I don't keep track of his books

46
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:17,335
But I'm sure there is a lot

47
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:18,925
to pick up there too

48
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:22,785
So there you have two tips on

49
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,245
Good people to check out

50
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,015
If you want to know more about how you can practice pronunciation

51
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,375
in a good way

52
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,975
and I was going to summarize

53
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35.945
Little Olle Kjellin's method card

54
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:39,085
at the end of the movie, because he has a very

55
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:41.305
clear and concrete method

56
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:43,445
For how to practice pronunciation

57
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:46,175
And he writes

58
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,735
good about it yourself on their Facebook pages

59
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,560
and in their books

60
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,760
So my tip is really to check out

61
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:55.845
what he writes but I can do

62
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:58.045
A little summary as well as I understand

63
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00.835
As I understood his methods

64
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:04.725
But before I do

65
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:07.565
So I thought I can summarize

66
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:11,140
the three most important things with Swedish pronunciation

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,000
For I believe that

68
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:16,405
If one knows about

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,620
what to listen to or listen for

70
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,360
and what to train on

71
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,600
so you can get pretty far on it

72
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:30,675
Olle Kjellin's method requires discipline

73
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:33.565
And motivation, I think it's great

74
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:36,785
But I have never really exercised like that

75
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:39,475
hard as he thinks one should

76
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:43,025
When I have trained other languages; I have tested

77
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:46,405
a little, but it really requires you to work hard

78
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,755
So if you can't cope

79
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:51,825
So you can still think of three things and

80
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:54.865
Exercise a little more relaxed on three things

81
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:58.505
and there are then three points and the first

82
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00.445
is the most important

83
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03.695
and the most important thing in Swedish pronunciation, that's the difference between

84
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,520
Long sound and short sound

85
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,160
both if you listen to one word at a time

86
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,500
single words

87
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:16,935
So if I say

88
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:17,935
work

89
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:21,225
work

90
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,515
So it is very important to get the rhythm right

91
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,125
work

92
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:28,515
Both the melody

93
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:32.005
and itself short and tall affects

94
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:35,015
so it's something you should listen to when you learn new words

95
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,640
and listen to when you hear people talk

96
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,760
and even more important than just the words

97
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,745
So it is to listen to whole sentences

98
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:46,195
So for example if I say

99
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:48,125
I live in Gothenburg

100
00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:51,785
I live in Gothenburg (then da da daaaa)

101
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:55,315
that rhythm is very important

102
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:58.045
and very often when people don't understand you

103
00:04:58,045 --> 00:05:00.715
so is it because you have the wrong rhythm

104
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:01.815
in the speech

105
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:05,785
so listen to it

106
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:09.065
listen to examples and try to mimic and train the rhythm to

107
00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:11,235
It is so important in Swedish

108
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:14,725
the second then is how you form

109
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:15,925
the mouth

110
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:19,515
And then you might think mainly about vowels

111
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:22.515
A, o, u, å, ä, e

112
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:25,525
And so on, that is perhaps the most important thing

113
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,225
to get the vowels right

114
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:30,725
But there is even when you do

115
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:33,735
The consonants so you also have a shape on the mouth

116
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:36,455
that can sometimes affect

117
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,455
your pronunciation

118
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:38,915
so

119
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,145
it is others are simply

120
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,745
work out on vowels, practice on getting the mouth

121
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,435
shape right, the mouth is flat

122
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49.405
or round and so on

123
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:52.805
work out on it and

124
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:54,575
Your pronunciation will be better

125
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:58,575
Number 3 is what is called reductions

126
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:01,135
or you can only say that

127
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:04.085
Some letters are silent

128
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:07.495
so if you look at a text then there is

129
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:10,485
a lot of letters like we

130
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,495
not pronounce when we talk

131
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,725
and this is important

132
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:19,385
many slopes with it or do not understand that

133
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:22,665
Like, real Swedish is to remove

134
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,625
those where * the words * the letters

135
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,625
such as “R” at the end of many verbs when we speak

136
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,575
fast

137
00:06:29,575 --> 00:06:32.065
or there may be other things like

138
00:06:32,065 --> 00:06:34,645
g inside of words and so on

139
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:37,785
It's something you simply get to listen for

140
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:40,585
If you do not have a teacher who can show and explain

141
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:43,875
so you get to listen when people talk and compare to

142
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:46,345
text and understand that

143
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:49.065
that word we write like that, when we talk

144
00:06:49,065 --> 00:06:51,515
naturally, normal, at normal speed

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,520
so we don't pronounce those * words * the letters

146
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,925
And your Swedish will sound much better

147
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:58,985
unless you do it either

148
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:02.165
Your Swedish gets choppy

149
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05.440
and stopped, it stops

150
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07.360
For example, if you say

151
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09.940
I live in Gothenburg

152
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
It's not called "I live in" " - it's called" Jabor "

153
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,165
or “Jabori”

154
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,545
And so on, there are many examples, but believe me

155
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:22,495
If you choose which sounds you should not pronounce

156
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:25,715
so that you don't pronounce as

157
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:28,385
as a reading output

158
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:31,175
As it looks in a book, your Swedish will let

159
00:07:31,175 --> 00:07:34,155
More Swedish and people will understand you better

160
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:37,725
so these are these three things, listen to

161
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,615
long sounds and short sounds

162
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:42,775
train on shaping the sounds

163
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:45,855
vowels especially properly

164
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:48,625
and number three, learn which

165
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,925
sound you should not pronounce

166
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:54.615
or which letters, not sound, which letters

167
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:57,685
you should not pronounce, don't talk like a book

168
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,325
Talk naturally

169
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:01.885
Ehm, yes

170
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:05.685
and Olle Kjellin's way of training on this

171
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07.615
It's about this way

172
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:11,325
You will find either sample sentences

173
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,335
on the web in any language course or

174
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,245
retrieves from someone ... whatever

175
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:20,055
a news broadcast, a movie or something

176
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:23,425
or you get a Swedish person to

177
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:26,045
record sample sentences for you

178
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:29,205
not very fucking but not very long

179
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:32,095
a little just long like that so that

180
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35.045
You may get ten sentences for example

181
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:38,385
that have the natural

182
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,645
the parts of Swedish pronunciation in themselves

183
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:44,515
you get the rhythm, you get the different vowels

184
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:47,615
you get these reductions, that it is silent

185
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:51,455
you have ten sentences

186
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53.095
you have the recorded

187
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:56,795
somehow so you can listen to them many times

188
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:59,765
The best way is if you have them

189
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:03.955
some kind of computer program so you can

190
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:06.875
repeat them many, many times

191
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08.535
But you can also have a small file

192
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,325
in your mobile for example and that you

193
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:12,200
playing again and playing again

194
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,100
and listen and listen

195
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,580
So first just listen

196
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,675
and then train to mimic these sentences

197
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:22,655
giant, giant, huge times

198
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:24,645
until you pronounce them perfectly

199
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:28,815
So if I had one of my students

200
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,625
so could a sentence might be

201
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,645
I live in Gothenburg in Sweden

202
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:37.565
I live in Gothenburg in Sweden

203
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:40,715
And then you really should repeat it

204
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:41,955
The sample sentence

205
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,795
A thousand times maybe

206
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,900
five thousand times maybe i don't know exactly

207
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,760
Check out what Olle Kjellin says, you should train very much

208
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:54,075
and in a few sentences

209
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,315
As one learns to say perfect

210
00:09:56,675 --> 00:10:00.005
and then it will help you pronounce all

211
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:03.825
sentences with the correct pronunciation late

212
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:07.495
so this is something you can test if you are justified

213
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:09.985
and really want to train good pronunciation

214
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:13,045
record some sentences or pick up any sentences

215
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,385
from the net

216
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:18,365
Listen, listen, listen - train to repeat

217
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:19,685
a thousand times

218
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:23,115
Are you a little lazier as I am

219
00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:26,335
So you think of these three points

220
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,915
and in everyday life you train

221
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:31,905
on trying to get it right by listening and mimic

222
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:35,025
things you hear on TV and radio

223
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:38,235
and when you listen to real people talking

224
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,625
But then not coming

225
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42.565
your pronunciation become as good

226
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:45,825
If you make this concentrated

227
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,975
focused and intensive effort

228
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:50,715
Like Olle Kjellin

229
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:54,125
recommend, then your pronunciation will be better

230
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,615
I am pretty sure of

231
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:58,965
That said, check out what he writes, check out his books

232
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:02.015
you won't regret it

233
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:04,745
he has a lot of good tips

234
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:08.165
so this about pronunciation

235
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:11,225
If you are a beginner or if you have friends who are a beginner

236
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:14,685
tell them to

237
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:17,475
focus on pronunciation from the beginning

238
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:20,185
Don't think you should learn it later

239
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:23,225
Without trying to learn a good and natural pronunciation

240
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,955
From the first day you train Swedish

241
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:28,905
It is much easier to learn right

242
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,315
from the beginning

243
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:33.535
than to try to learn one more time

244
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:36.535
When one first learned wrong

245
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,505
and received bad pronunciation habits

246
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:42,625
so tip all your friends

247
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,595
Start training on the pronunciation today

248
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:48,005
and don't give up without fight it until it's so good

249
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,795
As you can only cope and can

250
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52.815
yes

251
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55.805
It was well

252
00:11:56,795 --> 00:11:59,735
As I said, ask, comment

253
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:00,735
so

254
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:04,475
can we discuss if there is something special you are wondering about

255
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,385
In the comments

256
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:11,145
Have a good time and we'll see you again soon.

257
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:12,415
Bye
