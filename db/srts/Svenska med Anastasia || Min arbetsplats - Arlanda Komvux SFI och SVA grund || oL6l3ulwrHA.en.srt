Hello everyone! Hello!

2
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:17,351
Today I want to tell you about my workplace, about my job.

3
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:26,820
a workplace - my workplace

4
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:38,637
This is my workplace, my school.

5
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:53,589
I work at Komvux.

6
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:05,806
What does municipal adult mean?

7
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:15,000
Komvux means municipal adult education.

8
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:25,185
Education for adults.

9
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:30,145
What do adults mean?

10
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:41,265
Komvux corresponds to compulsory school and upper secondary school.

11
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:59,882
Komvux is a school for adults who lack knowledge corresponding to primary and secondary school.

12
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:05,116
At komvux you can study Swedish.

13
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:13,470
You can study SFI (Swedish for immigrants)

14
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:24,742
When you finish SFI, you can continue studying at SVA basic.

15
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:29,213
SVA = Swedish as a second language

16
00:02:51,205 --> 00:03:00,800
You learn to read and write from the beginning of SFI course A.

17
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:16,987
I teach Swedish at SFI course C and SVA basic module 3 and 4.

18
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:26,475
Before that I worked with SFI course A.

19
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:43,234
Right now all students study at home, online , due to Covid-19.

20
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:54,851
They study digitally with a mobile phone or computer.

21
00:03:56,488 --> 00:04:00,925
The school is located by a fire station.

22
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:09,000
Look what firefighters do - they go sledding!

23
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:19,514
I enjoy my job very much.

24
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,928
I love my job!

25
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,043
It's visible, right?

26
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:33,100
Do you study Swedish at school or online?

27
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:36,443

28
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,295
Look what nice snowmen we have!

29
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:50,656
a snowman - two snowmen

30
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:59,025
We also have a nice tree for birds.

31
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:05,518
They got scared of me and flew away.

32
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:12,092
Otherwise, there are usually many small birds here.

33
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:17,729

34
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:21,812
