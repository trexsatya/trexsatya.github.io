 C. Head Tapers - Our Family Day is soon over.

157
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.920
The C. Head talk was not a successful premiere.

158
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:40.640
You and I have talked about having a neighborhood party.
 Fun that it got rid of!

159
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:48.400
C. Head talk we invite everyone will come: C. Head Tapers Pettersson, Postmaster Melander ...

161
00:17:52.680 --> 00:18:00.200
He and Pettersson talked for a long time.

162
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.720
C. Head talk - the place I have applied for!

163
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:12.640
You can apply for the job as a waitress in the new cafeteria!

164
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.080
The c. sound door clock calls who is it?

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.600
C. Head talkative self is basically done with it.

172
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:10.560
C. Head talk - How was it at the party?
 Boring?
 - It was really successful.

173
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.320
I probably did away with the end.

174
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.920
The post is forwarded, but we have not received any letters.

175
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.400
It turned out to be Pettersson's fault.

176
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:33.720
- He got rid of his promotion ... C. Head talk - Göran!

189
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.080
With a handy man it can get really cozy.

190
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.080
Dad wanted to make a bar of the ping pong table.

191
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.040
Lucky no one was injured ...

192
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.400
What idea did he have yesterday?
 Family Day?
 Again?

193
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:13.720
Dad has a lot at work and has not become accustomed to the new neighbors.

194
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:20.200
Sorry darling.
 It got stupid yesterday but we can't ignore the neighbors.

195

209
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:54.720

 C. Head talk - you should pull the pipes then!

226
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:39.080
The only thing you need to think about is to bend the pipes -
