1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,940
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,900
- How are you today?
- Good.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,740
What are today's plans?

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,680
- Swim school.
- Yes.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,040
I'm in "Märkestagarna" (badge takers)
and he's in "Baddarna" (the whoppers).

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,120
- What's "Märkestagarna"?
- You swim and earn badges.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,620
- Is it difficult?
- Yes.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:38,740
I should swim 8 meters (8.7 yd) under water
and that's really, really hard.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,020
- Can you do that?
- No, but I will today. I have promised myself that.

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:54,540
- Alma, did you just say 800 meters?
- No, 8 meters.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,440
I thought you said 800 meters.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,800
If you swim 800 meters under water,
then you would die.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,880
- How is dad doing?
- Not good.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,920
- He's in some pain, he has sprained his neck.
- Yes.

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey.

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:24,900
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine. My neck is just a little sore, so I'm resting.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,840
If you follow our Instagram, then you know that
daddy Axel injured his neck at the trampoline park.

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,640
Yes.

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,560
We didn't vlog that day,
we were just there to jump around.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,140
- Axel did a backflip into a foam pit.
- Mm.

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,860
I filmed it with my phone.

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,140
Yes.

23
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,660
My neck hurt so much that I really thought
I had broke something, so I didn't dare to move.

24
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,760
The staff thought so too.
They called 911, and the ambulance came.

25
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,480
The paramedics couldn't get you out on their own
so firefighters had to come. It was crazy!

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:20,800
Four firefighters and two paramedics
got me out of there while I was strapped to a stretcher.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,960
We have received very many Question of the Day
on Instagram about how you are doing.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,400
I went to the hospital in the ambulance, they did an X-ray
and nothing was wrong, so I could go home.

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,300
- So now we sort of have a sprained dad.
- Yes.

30
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,900
- You won't rest all day, you have to move around.
- Yes, a little bit.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,720
We will get food ready for a picnic
and head to the lake.

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,260
First up is Harry's swim school,
then Alma's "Märkestagare" (badge takers).

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,760
What a sunny day.

34
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,600
- Nice, right?
- Yes.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,660
- We aren't spoiled with sunshine.
- No.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,340
- The weather has been pretty bad in July.
- Yes.

37
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,260
- We are a bit late. You have to run to your group, Harry.
- Yes.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:26,580
- I'm not that good at doing the cannonball.
- No, it... it... I know that.

39
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,880
- But I can float.
- Yes, you can. You are very good at that.

40
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,360
Hey, hey!

41
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,020
The swim school kids are warming up.

42
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,800
Let's go the other way!

43
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,080
- All my children, come!
- How?

44
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,060
Trot like Pippi's horse.

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,260
Good!

46
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,540
Well done, Harry!

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,820
It's not that hot outside today.

48
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,060
Harry, you have to eat something
after swim school. You did so good.

49
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,900
- I'm cold.
- I understand that. It's not particularly warm outside.

50
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,300
No, it's only warm in the sunshine.

51
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,240
- Alma, soon it's your turn to get in.
- No.

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,000
- Yes!
- No!

53
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,940
- Nice, Alma! You are so close. I'm over here.
- Oh!

54
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,800
- You have been all the way over there.
- It's too far out, and it's harder than I thought.

55
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,500
You can do it!
Just really push off the edge.

56
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,360
- Oh, look how far you came this time!
- You are so close!

57
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,920
You got really close.

58
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,500
Come on, Alma!

59
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,100
Keep going, keep going.

60
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,480
Oh, look! Do you see where you are?

61
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,460
No!

62
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,900
That was amazing!

63
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,260
I give up.

64
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,180
The water was cold but I dived anyway.

65
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,240
- Give me a towel!
- Oh, dear! Here you go.

66
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,020
She didn't quite make it,
she was so close!

67
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,120
But the fact that you are diving from the edge
and you are not holding your nose is amazing!

68
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm very impressed.

69
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,840
Harry is massaging my neck.
It's so sore.

70
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:30,200
He is actually a very good masseur.
He uses his whole body.

71
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,940
It feels very good, Harry.

72
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,640
You can make money by massaging me,
did you know that?

73
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,220
I don't want to make money,
I just want screen time.

74
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,640
Oh. Well, then you can
earn screen minutes.

75
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,900
I want to watch YouTube
and play games.

76
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,300
Of course he does.
That's what all children want, right?

77
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,300
We drove to Gustavsberg
to wash our car.

78
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,060
Well, it's not really our car.

79
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,220
We have a collaboration with Mitsubishi
who are letting us have this beauty over the summer.

80
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,960
I never want to return it.

81
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,300
We are road tripping in it.

82
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,620
It's a plug-in hybrid which means that we can
take a cord and connect it to a power outlet.

83
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:56,140
Then we can drive for 25 miles and when the power runs
out we continue to drive on gas. It's amazing, I'm in love.

84
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,700
Now that we are staying at our cabin
we are driving almost exclusively on electricity.

85
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,860
It's absolutely amazing!
It's so good for the environment.

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,740
- You will vacuum the inside.
- Yes!

87
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,440
- It's very messy in there.
- Can I vacuum?

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,080
Yes.

89
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,800
This is what we will do more of with the kids.
They will get to work more this summer.

90
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,100
There we go,
thank you so much.

91
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:30,160
Because daddy Axel is injured and behind the camera,
he will now act as our supervisor, so listen to him.

92
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,700
- Okay. Help mom take out all the loose objects.
- Okay!

93
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,800
Put it here.

94
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,640
- Should I put this in the trash?
- Just put it there.

95
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,420
Look what I just did! I opened it all by myself.
I pushed that button up there.

96
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,480
Good!

97
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,940
- Oh, dad packed cleaning supplies for the car.
- Yes.

98
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,820
Look at all this cargo space.

99
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,420
- Look! My phone.
- It's not yours, it's dad's.

100
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,680
- But it's my phone case.
- Alma hasn't got her first phone yet.

101
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,420
- Harry, are you ready?
- Yes.

102
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,340
- It will start vacuuming.
- Yes.

103
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,440
- Hold it tight and look at it.
- Yes.

104
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Now!

105
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,900
- The inside of the car is now clean.
- Yay!

106
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,140
Good job, everybody.

107
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,300
- I found money on the ground! 5 SEK (50 cent).
- That's good.

108
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,900
- You're rich.
- Yes, so lucky.

109
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,240
We are now driving to where we can
wash the outside of the car.

110
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,140
If you wash the car, then I can
build a tree house with you later.

111
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,380
- Yes!
- Cuisine...

112
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,820
- "Cuisine"... Cuisine Frances is coming over.
- Yes.

113
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,580
Cousin.

114
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,000
I know - cousin. I have trouble speaking
sometimes, you know what I'm like.

115
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,040
It happens.

116
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,660
Can you really build with a sore neck?

117
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:34,040
Yes, it feels pretty good. I'm a bit stiff,
but I'm thinking that I can be the supervisor again.

118
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,980
I found this one.

119
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,900
Good job, Harry! This will be great.

120
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,800
- I found one!
- That's so good.

121
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,060
- Mine wasn't that big.
- No, but mine was very big.

122
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:42,000
You can use any and every plank when you are building
a tree house. You don't have to follow any rules.

123
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,740
- Daddy, take this one.
- Yes, we will probably put it to good use soon.

124
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,920
- We need to find the door.
- Oh right, the door.

125
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,000
- The blue door.
- Mm, the blue door.

126
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,980
- It's behind the pile.
- Yes, see if you can lift it.

127
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,940
I found a plank!

128
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,640
The blue door that Harry is talking about used to
be on the old playhouse that I demolished a while back.

129
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,300
I actually did a time-lapse of it, take a look.

130
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,560
This one, yes!

131
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,340
I found something for the floor.
This one is for the floor.

132
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,120
- Harry found something for the floor.
- That's good.

133
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,120
- But there are two nails in it.
- Oh, really?

134
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,640
Yes, they just happen to be there.

135
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,160
God, it's so heavy. I have to drop it
and then lift it again.

136
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,140
It went well. Daddy! Daddy!

137
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,960
Oh God, Harry!
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

138
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,160
- I'm strong, right?
- Very strong!

139
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,740
- Much stronger than you.
- Yes, much stronger.

140
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,440
Oh, don't get it on your feet!

141
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,800
- There.
- We can build the kitchen with it.

142
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,340
I can't carry any more.
That's for the floor.

143
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,440
- That one too?
- Yes, because it...

144
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,100
- I think we have enough planks for the floor now.
- Yes.

145
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,780
Let's continue tomorrow.

146
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,780
- You think so?
- Yes.

147
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,200
Okay, let's do that.

148
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,820
Now it's time to go to sleep.

149
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,900
How is your neck, daddy?

150
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,600
It feels very stiff,
but it's getting better and better.

151
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:48,120
I don't have any problems with that, that it's hurting,
because I am so grateful that it went well.

152
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,100
So am I.

153
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,640
Thank you for watching this video!

154
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,300
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

155
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:07,980
Leave comments, subscribe and ask questions,
and take care until next time.

156
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,940
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!
