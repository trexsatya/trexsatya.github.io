1
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.000
In two weeks I am at Highbury Park.

2
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.320
In London there is as much to see.
 But you should live centrally.

3
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.080
- I live perfectly!
 –In piccadilly then?

4
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.840
Adjacent to the entrance to the football stadium.
 There is my hotel behind it.

5
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.760
- Can you follow the training from the ceiling?
 -Yes.
 When did you decide for the trip?

6
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.560
22 years ago.

7
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.000
- How many corn flowers should you buy?
 - How many are we at work?

8
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.600
- Take a hundred, so you know that is enough!
 -Fifteen.
 And a wreath to Annika.

9
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.800
–170 SEK.
 - You then, Dad?
 -Lets see...

10
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.920
-One.
 –Vadå one?
 You are my dad.

11
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.720
- It's your duty to buy!
 - It was neat.

12
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.520
- What does it cost to do one like that?
 - Something crown.

13
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.640
- Why pay ten then?
 - It goes to charitable purposes.

14
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.880
I support those who want to give people a more bearable life!

15
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.360
- The engineer's national association!
 - Mom bought ten yesterday.

16
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.160
Mom is a manager and has a higher salary!
 But okay, I'm not going to be impossible.

17
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.960
Give me two.
 I can sell the other at work.

18
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.320
-Hi mom.
 -Hey sweetie.
 How are you?

19
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.400
- So there.
 It's a little difficult now.
 - With 23,000 a month you can withstand wear!

20
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.000
25,000. My staff's future is at stake.

21
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.600
-Is it true?
 –25,000?
 You haven't told you!

22
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.400
- It's uninteresting at the moment.
 - Now we can afford the sleeves ...

23
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.840
I may have to dismiss some.
 We have to cut down on costs.

24
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.680
The manager of my last building had to dismiss ten.

25
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.200
They broke both arms on him.

26
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.000
Honey, come now.
 The cabbage dolmes are on the table.

27
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.000
It's the best I know!

28
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.640
- What have you cooked for good then?
 –Wa?

29
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.440
- It's your food week.
 - It's so boring with food weeks.

30
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:11.400
Mozart wrote his symphonies because anyone said it was his music week?!

31
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.800
- Do you want to be starving?
 - I arrange this.

32
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.680
No more pick -up pizzas!

33
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.480
Hello!
 These cabbage dolmes ... how many do you have?

34
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.040
- Fantastically what Annika can!
 -What then?

35
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.640
Cabbage dolmen is difficult.
 Either the mince becomes dry or the cabbage too soft.

36
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.440
- But these were perfect.
 -I do not know...

37
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.960
-What are you reading?
 - Personal list.

38
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.560
- I might be able to dismiss friends!
 - The executioner compiles its death list.

39
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.760
Do not say so!
 Imagine if you have to kick someone you got to know!

40
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:21.120
We don't have time to get to know each other.
 The schedule is a screwdriver.

41
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:31.080
Why do we always start talking about your job, even when I have problems?

42
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.080
My job may be more interesting.
 Okay...

43
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.880
This is not your fault.
 You're just a cog in a machinery.

44
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.680
- What machinery?
 - The community.
 We are against them!

45
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.600
- We against the managers!
 - But I'm a manager!

46
00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.040
No real.
 Real managers feel good about kicking people.

47
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.840
It was the stupidest ...!

48
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.800
That on TV yesterday - it shone in his eyes as he closed the factory!

49
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.600
- He cried, Gustav.
 He was ruined.
 -Okay...

50
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.600
- How many have to stop?
 -I do not know.
 Four maybe.

51
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.400
Think like this: They should be happy that you are a manager.

52
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.600
You can give them encouragement to move on in life.

53
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.400
-Do you think so?
 - It can be a new start for them!

54
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.520
They had not dared to quit themselves.
 They thank you enough!

55
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.320
- Don't you surprise now?
 - Yes, but what the hell should I say?

56
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.800
Sleep now, you have a lot to do tomorrow.

57
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.560
Do you think we should have nuclear power?

58
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.760
Well ... we are fine as we have it.

59
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.640
We have nuclear power.
 Should we discontinue it?

60
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.040
You do as you wish.
 Now Mom is probably surprised.

61
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.640
- It smells good!
 –Tandooric chicken ...

62
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.920
- Mom has banned take -out food.
 - only pizza.
 We have to be kind.

63
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.640
- So the gift is for her?
 - To the whole family.

64
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.800
How many May flowers should you have?
 Five bucks each.

65
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.000
Five?!
 I paid ten!

66
00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.000
She is harder to fool.

67
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.280
-How many?
 -No.
 I can borrow dad's.

68
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:16.680
Hello, old man, come in.
 Have you received the list on who should be dismissed?

69
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:23.520
- Yes, there was just one.
 - It wasn't that dangerous!

70
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.920
It was me.
 My name was the only thing on the list.

71
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.640
But you are the manager.

72
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.960
That's just that.
 They will get rid of all local managers.

73
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:48.240
- They can't do this!
 - "Withdrawn services, Vivalla:"

74
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.240
- "Lena Svensson, office manager."
 - But ... you have to say away.

75
00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.600
- Protest!
 - It's no idea.

76
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:08.000
Soon they call and say that everything was a mistake.
 Phone signal

77
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.240
–Max Svensson.
 Certainly.
 - From the bank.
 -What did I say!

78
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:25.560
- Lena.
 Okay.
 Certainly.
 Yes thank you.
 Bye.
 -Reach?
 Good news?

79
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:33.160
So there.
 If the moving boxes are not out tomorrow, they throw the shit ...

80
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.960
- It's inhuman!
 - Yes, a week you should get!

81
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:46.440
- That it would end like this ... - Can't you go back to the cash register?

82
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.840
No, you have to have a little pride.

83
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.360
Yes.
 The parachute also facilitates.

84
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.840
Parachute?
 I have no parachute.

85
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.600
Are you crazy?!
 No parachute?!

86
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:11.920
I was offered one, but refused.
 You thought it was immoral.

87
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.280
It is immoral when you have a job, yes!

88
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.320
-I have no!
 - There is only one rescue.

89
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.920
The bottle.

90
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.920
The union!
 I go to my trade union!

91
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:39.640
- But I don't work at the post.
 - If an employee is affected, everyone is affected!

92
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:46.640
- You should experience solidarity!
 - Dad has a gift for you.

93
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.840
- Wait with it ... - Now I'm happy for anything.

94
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.840
- Don't turn too much to turn ... - what is it for something?

95
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.640
A sleeve key set.

96
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:12.560
- A hyls wrench kit?
 - I leave it back immediately.

97
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.000
Can't this be anything?

98
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:32.400
"You can keep order for money. Get down to the square at 13."

99
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.000
Åke's raffle.
 I think I stand over ...

100
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.320
I don't think they can do this!

101
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.960
- "Do you have a car, are used to stores ..." - thanks, that's enough ...

102
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:58.760
I will use my contacts.
 I write to companies I have worked with.

103
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:06.560
Good!
 Just like Göran.
 Whatever death a project is - he does not give up.

104
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.320
-Thanks.
 Did you have nothing to do at home?
 -No.

105
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.920
I can be here for three more hours.

106
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.120
- Where is Gustav?
 - Hos his trade union.

107
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.080
"You can't dismiss people anyway."

108
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.680
It's Dad a living proof of!

109
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:43.520
How did Dad go?
 Could they help mom?

110
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.800
No Unfortunately not.
 There are rules for curse ...

111
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.600
- I had not paid.
 - You got no tips?

112
00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:02.520
-Yes.
 "Father to hell, black foot!"
 - Thanks anyway, Gustav.

113
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:10.040
When you need the union for once, they leave one in the gutter ...

114
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.280
–... because you forgot the fee!
 - When did you last pay?

115
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:23.880
Get to see ... When did the old king die?
 Well, now we have to address the problem!

116
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:30.040
See it positively!
 Now you can do everything you dreamed of:

117
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.040
- fix at home, bake ... - I have never baked?!

118
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:43.360
Now you have the chance!
 Learn to make small nut meringues with jam in the middle.

119
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.920
- Gustav, do you know what this is?
 - The recipe?

120
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:55.720
This is my track record!
 I have 20 years of banking experience.

121
00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.440
The only thing that is required now is action!

122
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.640
-You are right!
 -What should you do?

123
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.440
Take a sandwich.

124
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.120
- Gustav, it will never go.
 - Well then ...

125
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.920
- It feels hopeless.
 -No.

126
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:37.760
They have Peter Barnes as a goalkeeper.
 No problem.

127
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:45.360
Hello!
 Over 12,000 women are unemployed only in our municipality!

128
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:53.040
- You are not a woman.
 You are the manager.
 - I was the manager.

129
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.640
I got the job because they knew me.

130
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:04.040
Do they have your track record?
 You have 20 years of experience.

131
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:11.760
They want hungry 25 -year -olds, not a two -child mother who got fired.

132
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:18.240
Sooner or later something shows up!
 Can I get to sleep now?

133
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.040
- Gustav ... - what is it?

134
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.640
What do you say if I have to be home?

135
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:37.680
- Bli's housewife, you mean?
 - If nothing shows up, so ...

136
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.680
It is not shameful to take care of man and children!

137
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.840
I'm talking about a few months.
 Half a year the most.

138
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.840
But what a year!
 You will see your children grow up!

139
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.400
Many women will envy you.

140
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.960
No, maybe I went too far there.

141
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.960
- We get 15,000 less a month!
 -Yes.

142
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:17.560
We have managed in a salary in the past.
 We can get rid of unnecessary things.

143
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.560
The kids' stuff, e.g.

144
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.360
I have canceled your football trip.

145
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:35.960
- It was a birthday present!
 - You get to see the match on TV instead.

146
00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:42.960
- You can't mean that!
 - And we can't afford Eurosport.

147
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:50.840
Your Dreju course then?
 1,800 ate the forest.
 You can't even use the replacements.

148
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.240
- It's no swaps, it's vases!
 - All 200 leaks.

149
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.040
It's charming.

150
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.400
It's nice for me to work with my hands!

151
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.360
Itch me on my back then!

152
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.000
- Gustav ... - what is it?

153
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.760
It's been a long time since we were arguing about money.

154
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:32.360
I know, I'm a great selfish.
 We should help and solve this.

155
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:42.040
Tomorrow I pick up my cartons.
 Then you and I and I and the kids start about!

156
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.560
Right.
 A new life stands at the door.

157
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:55.080
It should actually be nice to be able to tell the truth to some some.

158
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.680
In the moment of farewell, one should be honest.

159
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.600
- Do you want to borrow the baseball tree?
 - No, we have a fire ax in the dining room.

160
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.600
Good night.

161
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:23.840
- What is it with Dad?
 -Do not know.
 He has been happy today.

162
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:32.200
- He probably knows nothing about the trip.
 - Here come sandwiches and chocolate!

163
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.200
- What is it with you, Dad?
 - You are hungry?

164
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:46.120
- Did you know that Mom canceled the trip?
 - She did it right.

165
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:52.960
Now I am needed at the family.
 Imagine what we may be with!

166
00:18:54.120 --> 00:19:01.760
Mom is at home, becomes treasurer, then manager, and then comes back home.

167
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:09.440
It is hardly you hang out.
 You understand what this means?

168
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.360
- You will be difficult in the future.
 - We have to reduce expenses.

169
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:23.240
- But we can do.
 Do you know why?
 - "Because we're a family."

170
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:29.200
Are you glad that mom has no job?

171
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:37.200
I make the best of a disaster.
 They can lead to something better.

172
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:44.680
- Are we reslauing ourselves without mom's salary?
 - How does Mayflower Sales?

173
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:53.480
- She's been away for three hours.
 - It takes time to kill everyone ...

174
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:59.280
I know you think I'm boring sometimes -

175
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:07.160
- But one day like this is probably everyone happy that my postal cycle is here ...

176
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:17.840
-Hey sweetie.
 Do you want chocolate?
 - No, the moving boxes have to go away now.

177
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.640
There is no must in your life anymore.

178
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:30.040
- Do you have to quit?
 - You were not enough.

179
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.240
Only one regional manager is needed.

180
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.400
Nothing gets better because you are eating this.

181
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:46.200
That's me.
 I am the new regional manager.

182
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.440
-Congratulations Mom.
 I knew it!
 - Dad had to scare us up really.

183
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:05.240
- I start in Örebro on Monday.
 - You had been fired, it said.

184
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.040
I was moved.

185
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:16.840
Gustav, follow along and carry moving boxes.
 I tell you more in the car.

186
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.840
- I got a service car.
 –What for someone?

187
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.440
-It is red.
 - I don't ask for the color.

188
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.240
Nämen Herrejösses!

189
00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:37.480
A Volvo 850!
 Kids, up and switch to the fine clothes!

190
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.600
Dad got a new car.

191
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.400
Welcome to the flight to London.

192
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:59.360
Our duty -free goods are presented in the folder in the chair pocket in front of you.

193
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.440
Excuse me ... Should you have your peanuts?

194
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:26.440
-No.
 It's fine thank you.
 Oh, did you get honey roasted?

195
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:39.560
- Is it a video game, right?
 - No, I sit and work a little.

196
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.360
I don't have that.

197
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:51.640
I'm going to football.
 It is my wife who offers the trip.
 She is the manager.

198
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.760
- It sounds fun ... - region manager for Örebro Sparbank.

199
00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.360
One of the best managers in Sweden.

200
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.920
Good women have emerged.

201
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:14.320
I don't know that much.
 But Lena is special ...

202
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:21.400
- And she is the world's best wife.
 - Yes ... Yes, there you see ...

203
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:31.680
- Should I reveal a secret?
 - If it's a necessity ...

204
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.480
I love her.

205
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.000
-Did you know what she said?
 - That she loves you?

206
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.680
That we have to change the boiler.
 What do you say about that?!

207
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.480
Despite the job, she does not forget the needs of the family!

208
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.760
I am impressed with you who can handle her success.

209
00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:03.560
- You should be safe in himself.
 - You have your own career?

210
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:11.160
Oh yes, I'm a postman.
 Then I do some business aside.

211
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.600
A May flower?

212
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.800
