1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
I saw that there were some in the meeting here.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.960
Are we mixed in the public sector, even among those who are not in the folk high school

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.820
I think like this, I would like to ...

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.380
It will be like a package here, you talk about packages.

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.720
Me and Fredrik Carlsson are well

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.320
Open Source in personnel manifestation.

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.100
But we...

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.920
This hour that is now we will

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.980
talk about

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.280
Collective digitization

11
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.100
With slightly different angles.
 But if man

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.400
see it as a whole so I try to

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.440
not mention that as I know that

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.600
Fredrik will mention.
 So maybe there will only be a few questions about what I portray that will be answered

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.740
in Fredrik's presentation that comes immediately after.
 We have worked very closely with that.

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.320
If I can start with collaboration then, now I have

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.360
taken a little neighbor what we ourselves

18
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.980
Within SDI has talked about collaboration.

19
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.360
If you take off there, what is it really in practice

20
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.900
that is different from

21
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.940
The theory so ends up

22
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.760
Unfortunately, often here.
 And I notice that

23
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.600
In my work and those I talk to, whom I interview in research.

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.420
That it doesn't get real

25
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.440
solution

26
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.540
Without us ending up in some kind of ceremony and we

27
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.660
looking for similarities, we try to position ourselves, perhaps under consciously, but

28
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.580
It is very much about ensuring influence at low cost, a little "Fear of Missing Out".
 It seems to be a collaboration forum,

29
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.380
There I have to be there so I don't miss anything.

30
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.900
Most often you miss after all

31
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.180
actually nothing because

32
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.800
You stop by problematizing and repeating

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.360
truths, but maybe not so much

34
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.920
come to action without bringing

35
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.240
Models and methods but they rarely apply.

36
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.540
What would then be the solution to it

37
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.140
What is it that is needed when you really go from then

38
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.300
We talk to each other, we like each other, we have some kind of collaboration, we may even start working together.

39
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.340
It doesn't really

40
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.460
Solve the challenges we face, it's just looking at what it actually looks like.

41
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.320
So we say that something else is needed, something is needed that

42
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.000
makes us much more resources effective and that we also equalize the differences that we see in many different ways.

43
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.800
Then comes a collective digitization with a definition

44
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.940
that has not previously existed in the context of digital transformation.

45
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.280
That it is a method for inter -organizational business development.

46
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.100
Yes, maybe we have even known it before, but

47
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.260
Digitization is about automation and innovation, but the new here is that this requires supplementary strengths.

48
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.100
Bottomed on common values and that we have a smooth control.

49
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.440
I will end with some concrete examples of that

50
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.000
in my daily work.

51
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.340
Together with regrets, regrets and Sunsvall

52
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.940
is the guinea pig for collective digitalisation.

53
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.000
There is incredibly important

54
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.840
to distinguish precisely this supplementary strength that

55
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.120
itself

56
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.480
Requires that we change logic.
 I will talk a lot about having to change logic.

57
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.780
What do I really mean by that

58
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.580
To shift logic

59
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.120
Yeah, well

60
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.940
Maybe what sets collective digitization with collaboration.

61
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.560
There we do not have really varying logic that

62
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.100
a goal.

63
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.940
If we need to change logic, you can ask.

64
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.780
Yes, this is a bit tricky indeed for

65
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.840
not infrequently I meet after all

66
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.660
context where one thinks this goes all the

67
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.800
Excellent within the existing logic.

68
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.200
The challenges we face, you have seen figures as 125 percent we will perform with 75 percent of resources.

69
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.360
We also have economies that fall like stone.
 I came very recently from one

70
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.160
Meeting in my daily work

71
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.700
In Sundsvall municipality there

72
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.760
The economy looks sad.

73
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.620
We try then, or we, I have my frustration

74
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.480
to use the existing logic to solve that problem.
 It's Baptism.

75
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.280
But not everyone who sees it.

76
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.860
So we need number one then think like this.

77
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.420
Should we change the calculation

78
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.200
Is that that

79
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.860
we can only cheese grinding or that we can cream out of something

80
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.200
We save in summer and lunches or we

81
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.500
holding back in wages on the beat

82
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.780
to survive

83
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.540
this year.

84
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.160
But what happens next year questions that I asked not so long ago and then I get the answer.
 We take that then.

85
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.760
It will be exciting because I know that the conditions will be even worse next year.

86
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.300
So we need to think

87
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.200
Division instead of multiplication.
 Now I take, Robert you can tell me, we talk about how many authorities are in Sweden.

88
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.000
Many states, authorities and all

89
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.080
Municipalities and regions will be about 677.

90
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.820
You take it in

91
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.900
Among municipalities, there are 290 municipalities.

92
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.960
And what we do a lot is that we buy stuff

93
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.340
677 times.
 Or in municipalities, we solve the problems 290 times.
 Then it will be 290 times.

94
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.620
More expensive.

95
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.660
than we do

96
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.720
Otherwise would have to pay.

97
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:40.360
For a solution.
 If we can divide.
 And then you get a little into this with Open Source.
 Can we build solutions that make us

98
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.680
can divide

99
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.280
methods, share things between each other and

100
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.820
Divide the cost.

101
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.700
It does, after all, I would like to say that I think we can manage with the means that actually exist if we start to shift this

102
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.980
the bill

103
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.260
And think

104
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.800
in another logic.

105
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.900
The fish hour then, if you think here is

106
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.920
is this then

107
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.560
677 fish, yes maybe.
 Is there any autistic ability that can see it.
 But

108
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.120
It's pretty good way to move forward

109
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.920
If you now have a threat.
 At the top right we see

110
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.460
A predator like

111
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.880
See that this is a bit tricky to attack this group of fish.
 You get a little more resilient or you can

112
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.180
attack challenges in a different way.

113
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.980
Does not become as vulnerable.
 We can

114
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.340
With the help of collective digitalisation create more equal welfare.

115
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.120
Digitally within

116
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.920
frantesa, because it is after all

117
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.220
much of it we have

118
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.580
Meet by today and more and more in the future is the digital service.

119
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.120
If we get an equal digital service, we will also get a more equal

120
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.140
welfare.

121
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.460
We can talk about a school, a school regardless of municipality.

122
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:56.800
It does not matter if the school is in one or the other municipality.
 As residents, we will experience greater equality.
 It may not be so careful that I

123
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.420
Do everything I can to make my child come into this particular school.

124
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:08.580
We get fully integrated processes or by getting fully integrated processes we will also be able to get a load balancing between

125
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.980
Municipalities.
 We can share the two resources that we have after all and will be more lacking in the future.

126
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.580
We can switch in our common development.
 What we're talking about here is how are we going

127
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.920
balance the ability to

128
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.740
streamline and to innovate.

129
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:33.920
There I see a big difference in the small and large organization where the small organization has others

130
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.940
Prerequisites to

131
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.500
Test cheap.
 We know these

132
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.560
Characteristics for

133
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.900
innovation.
 Being able to make decisions quickly, get a quick feedback bicycle,

134
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.820
Early evaluate whether this is the right way or not.
 It also makes us dare to innovate more because we

135
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.580
get

136
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.660
out more attempts per krona.

137
00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:00.820
Then we get this ambide texture where we create an efficiency in exercise and balance.
 I can say as such as so that

138
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.160
This was pretty much theory when me and Fredrik looked at this

139
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.240
As I now see confirmed in practice.

140
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.780
Very clear

141
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.860
Given this financial challenges.
 I will mention a little more about it

142
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.760
Collective digitization and AI.
 I think this is even more important when we talk about AI solutions that are now starting

143
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:27.420
in a way to challenge digitization.
 Should we really do it what it is intended here now AI comes with a completely different ability.

144
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.280
It sets, I see then, even greater demands that we use the collective

145
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.300
the power.

146
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.960
A little brief about collective entrepreneurship.
 There is not so much sustained in the public sector

147
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.340
Without quite more in the private sector.
 There we know different mechanisms

148
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:51.740
that differs.
 Where more may be about partnerships but still the form of competition basically that not

149
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.020
at least should be in

150
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.840
Public sector in the municipality.
 But you think it's a process

151
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.900
an ongoing process for designing and incarceration a

152
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.720
Stig -dependent collective action on several levels.

153
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.300
Thus, rise addiction on which roads we choose to go.

154
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.080
And

155
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.660
that collective handland means that a unit

156
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.000
for an entrepreneurship or an organization

157
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.820
through innovation

158
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.100
builds something new.

159
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.900
The former organizational form

160
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.000
is the one we innovate.
 How can we create something

161
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.080
new when we pick in two different ones

162
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.140
types of, or different

163
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.440
norms, different types of

164
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.800
Culture or institutions that we talk about here.
 So to go from something

165
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.380
As we know we need to move from

166
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.460
with the help of someone else.

167
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.760
To change the existing institution

168
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.040
but it is

169
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.640
Extremely difficult.
 Maybe someone who has succeeded in it but in public operations and in a municipality so

170
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.020
I don't really know if anyone has succeeded in the same way you can do together then with this

171
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:04.440
the gearing of an organization that has the qualities you want to adopt.

172
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.760
A picture here, I'll say that,

173
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.040
Fredrik

174
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.340
is amazing because he puts

175
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.420
Words on my waffle.

176
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.480
So often i talk about like this, this is it for me

177
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.620
I'm frustrated or I'm happy, it has happened too.
 And so he just "but Marcus, is like this" and then he draws a picture.

178
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.940
He draws another picture that I will show as well.

179
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.460
Institutionally

180
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.260
work, if you think

181
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.120
What I want to do or the institutional contractor wants to do so is to change

182
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.700
to maybe also counteract

183
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.280
Nonsense.
 This is something that we

184
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.060
should end with.

185
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.820
Or

186
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.640
Then we should start with and do instead.

187
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.760
It can be very difficult or it is very difficult.
 It depends very much on which

188
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.620
Position, what power you have if you have informal or formal power.

189
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.440
How legitimate it is

190
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:07.400
to conduct this work.
 Who are you to come and say this or who has decided we recognize it then.

191
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.200
Is there any decision

192
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.780
When it doesn't do it, how to work then

193
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.800
Yes

194
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.340
Can you imagine then

195
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.460
That it requires slightly different properties.
 Now I'm actually talking about

196
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:26.340
Various archetypes of institutional contractors for it is not a person but it is required

197
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.180
an entire team, it requires a whole

198
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.260
Village of this kind of

199
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.300
characteristics.

200
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.620
But if one highlights something that Elissa is doing so well

201
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:43.000
I think in the work of developing visionary

202
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.580
strategies that help shift logic

203
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.120
that's how it is

204
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.540
Abstraction, idealism and long risers of analytical reasoning.

205
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:02.200
She highlights as the most important and in abstraction so you mean that you need to construct a visionary strategy.

206
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.320
And to do so, one must have the ability to free yourself from details.

207
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.360
It is easy to end up in details

208
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.180
and not perhaps then instead focus on

209
00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.480
dimensions at a higher level

210
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:21.400
Which can be a little blurred or a little like this you end up in the fog and I don't really see I see contours but I can't put words into it.

211
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.000
But that one then has the ability to identify structural

212
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.020
element

213
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.820
in a problem.

214
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:38.800
It is an ability that is incredibly important then to make this pretty big step into another logic.

215
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.140
Idealism is about striving for perfection

216
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:49.820
Or archetype that does not link to what others consider practically feasible and this is where this painful life comes there

217
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.640
The questioning is

218
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.420
frequent.

219
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.240
You have to tell us how you mean.

220
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.820
You must give concrete examples.

221
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.400
It is reluctant after all

222
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.500
In that phase anyway.
 It is not going without

223
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.560
It will give up.

224
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.700
But it can be very tricky and difficult to communicate simply.

225
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.260
We have seen this in anxiety Sundsvall there

226
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.880
Initially, we chose to have quite a few people who communicated what we would really do.
 Got the early on

227
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.940
Work argument like to

228
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:32.060
This is about an IT merger or Sundsvall has taken over anxiety IT.

229
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.160
No, it doesn't.
 I recorded videos and

230
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.920
tried

231
00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.260
Quality assured who was told what we did.

232
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.060
Very important that it does not get one

233
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.120
fake picture of what this really was.

234
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.000
Still, try to have the idealistic picture as far as possible.

235
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.580
This long path of analytical reasoning is really more about

236
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.880
To break down this vision to here and now.

237
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:03.280
To put a vision over there we should be but then to be able to link this strategic as well

238
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.640
The idea for tactical and operational actions here and now.

239
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.680
This is something that

240
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.700
need

241
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.280
Occupation as soon as possible.

242
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.900
That then you take anxiety Sundsvall and that I am in Sundsvall and Mattias anxiety as

243
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.440
started talking about this

244
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.720
becomes very difficult.

245
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.020
We are not everywhere.

246
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:32.420
We don't have all answers but trying to talk about these contours

247
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.700
as fast as possible and

248
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.980
get others to

249
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.800
Turn it.
 So this is like

250
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.340
collective action

251
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.400
Even in this process.

252
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.280
And together with Fredrik has the opportunity to put words on

253
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.100
This diffuse and it is extremely valuable.

254
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.180
David and Goliath

255
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.040
Is a picture that we come back to and it feels a bit like that.

256
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.080
I believe too many trying

257
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.480
What is common to us in this research school is that we describe very much these barriers and what are the obstacles

258
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.020
Why can't we just do it differently

259
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.560
What we try

260
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.620
attack in Goliath

261
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.920
And we feel like a David.

262
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:25.860
Hope we get help from above so that we can still handle that.
 But that is a bit so the power play is to

263
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.160
There are incredibly strong structures

264
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:35.800
Institutions that have been around for a long time and quite easy to question.
 It will not change here.
 There are a lot of studies that indicate that we

265
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.360
falls like again

266
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.220
back to a status quo. There is no real incentive in a municipality

267
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.780
or public activity that

268
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.820
Think so much about productivity.

269
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.420
It dissolves.
 We raise the tax or we

270
00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.220
closes a school.

271
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.600
That logic is not in the private sector at all in the same way.
 But there is something in the municipality

272
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.700
As I experience and the state and authority also where I worked before

273
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.580
which is awkward.
 If you take a pardon left there and crises outer hands facilitate.
 There we also have one

274
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.400
Good paper about

275
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.720
Action The Double H Sword of Urgency

276
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.280
by Fred Berg and

277
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:24.940
And Premark that describes that it can actually go in two roads.
 Quite exciting because it is doing it right now.

278
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.240
Ånge chooses a completely different path

279
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:33.120
than Sundsvall.
 And so I'm like in the middle of that.
 So there we try to catch up with interviews.

280
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.200
Very exciting to see how is it what is it?

281
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.980
And be able to put words into it.

282
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.780
So well one

283
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.840
Although painful in a way for me.

284
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:47.980
And my employees, it will be an incredibly good study opportunity to actually see this in practice.

285
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:54.880
But what we need is to do the institutional work and try to change this logic.
 It is legitimacy.

286
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.480
And to counteract

287
00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.240
this

288
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.560
Actually here the logic that makes you

289
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.360
Premiers as well

290
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.640
the existing one.

291
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.980
To establish the existing one.
 To try to respond to it in some way.

292
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:16.640
There it helps if you look up in the picture.
 External parties.
 To get confirmation from outside.

293
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.440
Incredibly important.

294
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.040
To have others to tell you that this is the right way forward or to

295
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.580
that part

296
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.180
gets like some kind of confirmation

297
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.480
from.
 It has been

298
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.600
Very important to me.
 That we became Sweden's dictation of the dictation or otherwise has been

299
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.960
Also a little neighbor to order.
 My managers that i have had a few now

300
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.360
In my job here has said that Marcus, you have to invest in that.
 Because our politicians need to see that

301
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.380
You are doing right.

302
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:53.500
And then you can say that it constitutes it.
 And that one in some way tries to

303
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:59.900
Both understand as well as how to work this existing institution.
 Where the decisions are made, when the decisions are made.

304
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.680
And then be able to see

305
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.940
take these occasions

306
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.780
to see that now is the position to change it

307
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.320
differently.

308
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.640
This can then be done either in one

309
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.180
Existing organization.

310
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.020
But the exciting now with collective digitization is to

311
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.340
Here it gets like a wave play between two different

312
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.660
institutions.
 So that together

313
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:30.820
can institutional entrepreneurs in different organizations create a higher legitimacy or a

314
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.400
higher power.
 A greater power to change

315
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.740
This logic.
 And I think that

316
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.520
As we are doing to have been

317
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.080
for me anyway impossible to do without

318
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.880
the collective part.

319
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.720
Together with the steam.
 This is also found in the private sector in different forms.

320
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:53.340
Leofanten.

321
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.980
What is this picture it was really

322
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.280
an attempt to

323
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.340
describe

324
00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.920
the collective digitalisation as anything other than we

325
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.240
Playing football in a team or we cycle in a cluster.

326
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.840
Here

327
00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.380
We create

328
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:21.260
A new logic that has the best of qualities from two different animals.

329
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.840
We have the leopard which is very fast and smooth.

330
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.400
And so we have the elephant that is big back

331
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.020
Robust but a little slow and sluggish.
 Not like that

332
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.580
Flexible as the leopard.

333
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:40.460
It is the idea of regrets and sunwalks together becomes

334
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.760
This powerful

335
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.060
The creature like

336
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:51.720
manages to be both agile at the same time creating security as I said

337
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.080
linked to the abilities required in it.
 This is some kind of

338
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.960
Create new types of norms.
 It is a process that makes us

339
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.320
In this sense trying to shift logic there

340
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.140
we take

341
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.720
trying to identify the

342
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.860
characteristics that we want to preserve or that we want to infect or as we want

343
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.940
replace other parts with in

344
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:28.320
Actually both each other but I see that here has the little one

345
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.940
The organization, the small municipality, a bigger role to play than the big one.

346
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:38.320
The small municipality really needs the most resources for many other things already there.

347
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.400
Then is valued in an awareness that it is not possible to solve

348
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:49.320
The problems of the future by unstybly or finding short -term savings.

349
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.160
Concrete examples that I can take is to

350
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.260
We have approximately equal financial challenges in anxiety cases

351
00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.820
but regrets choose to handle it on

352
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.900
a way where we use

353
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.000
Digitization, digital transformation to change the business.

354
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.620
Both find financial savings but at the same time also make it better for residents and entrepreneurs.

355
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.420
For example, we have

356
00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.980
a proactive handling of student trips.
 You get

357
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.100
A message on the mobile that you are entitled to school lakes, you want it, press yes.

358
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:27.220
Instead of going in and applying and managing in a different way.
 This saves both resources but do too

359
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.760
life easier for our parents

360
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.080
Out there.
 But in Sundsvall choose

361
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:38.220
On the contrary, it is a bit classic, think that it must be reduced, how can we reduce the pace of development

362
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.760
How can we get

363
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:49.240
Look at IT as the same way as other activities 10 years ago that we don't see it as a force to change

364
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.800
to something new in this logic.

365
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.360
Then i use it

366
00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:01.260
In a way when we sit with the highest leaders and so I just mention this is regret.

367
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.800
Is regret better

368
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.620
Why don't we handle it like this in Sundsvall

369
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:12.280
And then I notice that it creates some kind of shame or reflection.
 How come

370
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:18.680
So what I see the way forward here is that I will do everything I can for regret to be the best in Sweden.
 They should have the most digital

371
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.700
the service.

372
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.320
They shall meet their financial goals, preserve their welfare

373
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.920
And then simply lead in evidence.
 We develop things there

374
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:34.040
And then we peel and let municipal politicians in Sundsvall decide that

375
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.840
introduce those services.

376
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.380
That's what I see the power of

377
00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.440
This type of collective cooperation.
