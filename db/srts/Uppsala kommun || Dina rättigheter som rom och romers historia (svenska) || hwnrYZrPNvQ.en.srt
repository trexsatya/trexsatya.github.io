00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:13.000
The Romans originally come from India.
 Today there are Roma all over the world.
 In Sweden, Roma has lived since the 16th century.

2
00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:25.625
There are many different groups with their own tradition, culture and religion.
 The Romans' own language, Romani Chib, has several different dialects.

3
00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:37.000
The Romans have a long history of persecution, exclusion of harassment and discrimination.

4
00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:44.083
During the Second World War, half a million Roma were destroyed.

5
00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:55.333
Roma have also been discriminated against in Sweden.
 During the 1900s, Roma were described as an inferior breed, based on racial biological ideas.

6
00:00:55.416 --> 00:01:01.333
Many Roma were forcibly sterilized and children were taken from their parents.

7
00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:09.166
Roma were not allowed to obtain housing and many were forced to live in camps.
 It meant that Roma children could not go to school,

8
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:13.250
And adult Roma had a hard time getting a job.

9
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:27.125
Between 1914 and 1954, Roma was not allowed to travel to Sweden.
 The Roma who already lived here could not leave the country because they were not allowed to come back.

10
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:39.541
On April 8, 1971, the first international Roma Congress was held in London.
 Then they agreed on a Roman flag and a national anthem.

11
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:45.083
Since then, April 8 has been International Roma Day.

12
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:59.791
Racism against Roma Antiziganism-and political decisions during the 20th century have influenced the opportunities of the Romans to be part of Swedish society.

13
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:09.291
Roma still find it difficult to get housing and work.
 Roma children face discrimination and difficulties in school.

14
00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:21.166
But.
 Roma should be able to participate in society on equal terms as others.
 That is why in Sweden we have a national strategy for Roman inclusion.

15
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:30.416
The goal is for the Rome that turns 20 in 2032 to have the same opportunities in life as everyone else.

16
00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:45.704
On January 1, 2010, Sweden received a law on national minorities and minority languages.
 As a national minority you have a strengthened

17
00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:53.333
protection to develop your culture and your language.
 You decide for yourself if you want to belong to the national minority Roma.

You as Rome have rights.
