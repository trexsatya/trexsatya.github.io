00:00:00,642 --> 00:00:03,573
Hello everyone!
 Hello!

2
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:06,000
We are home.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,446
We are back from our trip.

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:16,603
Look!
 There is also snow here.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,723
Not so much with anyway!

6
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:25,758
It's cold.
 It is winter.

7
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:40,010
I want to tell you about our trip home.

8
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:45,587
I want to tell you how we went home from Kl채ppen.

9
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:57,842
From my home to Kl채ppen it is about 400 kilometers.

10
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:11,420
It takes 6 hours to go if you count on a break.

11
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,733
In order to stretch the legs

12
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,159
Food break

13
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:34,394
6 hours took the trip there, from home to Kl채ppen.

14
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:43,836
From Kl채ppen home, the trip took about 8 hours.

15
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:52,517
Why?
 Why did it take so long?

16
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:58,619
One thing happened on the way home in Mora.

17
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,091
Look!

18
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:11,622
You know what?

19
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:18,455
We have been punctured!

20
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:36,000
We are not at home.

21
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:39,000
We are in Mora.

22
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:45,154
That's quite a few kilometers home.

23
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:54,277
We have called service.

24
00:02:54,623 --> 00:02:59,096
You can google a phone number.

25
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:07,315
They should come here with a wheel, a tire.

26
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:13,719
They should change and help us.

27
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,957
It will cost a lot of money.

28
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
I don't know how much.

29
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,780
We park the car.

30
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:11,216
From Mora to my home it is about 300 kilometers.

31
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:17,783
4 hours to go

32
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:25,663
We got puncture 300 km from home.

33
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,001
Everyone was tired.

34
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,002
The children were tired.

35
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,210
We were tired.

36
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:37,124
But it resolved.

37
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:42,085
I have a receipt here.

38
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,001
Here's the receipt.

39
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:49,821
We can look at it together.

40
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:59,764
There is a phone number.

41
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:08,000
There is a date.

42
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,702
Time is there too.

43
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:25,673
How much did we pay?

44
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,570
We paid...

45
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,553
one tire

46
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:48,624
mounting of the tire

47
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,836
on -call fee

48
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:16,668
It costs a little more on Sundays.

49
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:36,832
Thanks for the visit and welcome again!

50
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:44,003
It was so kind that we got this help on a Sunday afternoon.

51
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:52,031
We could come home the same day.

52
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:59,675
We had no extra tire but now we have learned.

53
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:05,526
Now we will always have an extra tire in the car.

54
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:12,430
I'm out for a walk.

55
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:14,907
Now I'm starting to freeze.

56
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:17,147
I'm going home now.

57
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:20,874
Thank you so much for looking!

58
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:23,001
See you in the next video.

59
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,081
Bye!
