00:00:03,685 --> 00:00:09,000
  Hi, Elza here from Elza's bookshelf. It is time to summarize the September month's reading.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
  After all, I am going into a read and therefore I have been very picky with what books I take up.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
  I have dnf'at a lot of books in September, so I can say that the books I am talking about now

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
  are really books I recommend. Everyone is just as good, no, definitely not as good,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
  Everyone is good and I recommend them.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
  There are some books, we start at once where I start with what I like at least

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
  And ends with what I like best.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
  What I can say about September is that, since I have been very picky and I am getting into a reading loss

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
  So I have not managed one of the book challenges, and that is dusting off.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
  I dnf'in almost all the dusts of I raised. I have a dust of this month and the goal is to have two and a half.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
  So unfortunately, but that will be anyway.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
  But the books I want to talk about now is actually a dust off, the only dust off this month.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
  I'm talking about The Infinite plan by Isabelle Allende.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
  This is also world literature.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
  I have been given a kind of preference for Allende, I have started to pick up and read her books.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
  I like them very much, it's South American, it's magical realism and it's epic family stories.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
  It's just to be able to accompany a person all my life and I like it.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
  And so does this. This is what we can accompany her husband, with whom she is married, who tells about her life story.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
  And you have to follow him from being a child to being an adult and meeting her.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
  I liked it, gave it a strong third.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
  It was a little too long for its own good.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
  The first half is very, very everyone.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
  Magical realism and some mysterious events.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
  The other half I think falls in line, I must say.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
  But a third and I like everyone.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
  And I recognize her very much in this.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
  Great as well.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
  The next books we are talking about is the time chosen.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
  It's called Breaking Free, or I listen to it in Swedish.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
  It's called my father, the sect leader by Rachel Jeffs.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
  This is a fact literature.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
  We can follow Rachel, who then tells us what it was like to live and live, be born in a sect.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
  Where Warren Jeffs was the sect leader.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
  It is incredibly horrible.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
  Very, very good.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
  I'm not going to talk so much about it, because I've done a reading logg.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
  It is in the description, so you can hear my thoughts about it and follow the trip as I read it.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
  I thought it was great.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
  But I also felt that she had a distance to everything.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
  Which is good, she says in the beginning that I am not a victim.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
  I just want you to know what it was like to live in this sect.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
  That's good, but I wanted to hear more about her thoughts.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
  I am curious about these decisions she makes.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
  I'm curious about how it came with it.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
  After all, she stayed there for a very long time in the sect.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
  At the end it felt really stressed.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
  It deserves a few more pages actually, I must say.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
  It is very short.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
  It was only seven or eight hours long, as an audio book.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
  I think it deserves much more time and the decision to have lived all its life in this sect and then leave it.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
  I had wished that bit should have been given a little more space.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
  That's not the only thing.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
  But the third I gave it.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
  I think this was a very important reading and highly recommend it.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
  Then I will talk about another book that is also another reading logg that I am on and cut now.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
  It is the family of Lamb's return.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
  I can probably talk about Lisa Jewell.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
  I'll probably talk about the first book too.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
  Because this is a second book in a series.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
  The first book is called Family Lamb's secret.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
  You can see this too.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
  So I can't tell you what the return is about.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
  But I take two here and now I feel.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
  It is that you can follow what starts the first book then.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
  The Secret Lamb family.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
  It is that it is a family, quite a well -off family in London.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
  Where a person comes in and things happen in this family.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
  It's horrible. It's brutal. It's incredibly dark.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
  Then you have to come with this.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
  How it happens to the family and how things then end.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
  When the return of the Lamb's return, she ties the bag together.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
  It must solve threads in the first book.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
  On number two, the family Lamb's return.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
  Then she ties it all so that you know what happened next.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
  After these events in this house.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
  Then you have moved forward in time as well.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
  I liked these exciting, exciting, exciting.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
  Probable characters. Great fun.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
  I'm not going to talk so much about these.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
  In any case, the family of Lamb's return.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
  I have as a reading logg. Then you can hear my thoughts there.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
  No, these were great.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
  Exciting, exciting. Recommend them if you like mystery thrillers.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
  Here you have really exciting books.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
  In the book circle we chose to read the classic Pest by Albert Camus.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
  It is written in the 40s.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
  But it is in a city.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
  You have to follow the characters in a city where the plague comes.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
  It is a disease. It's a virus.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
  They become completely shielded.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
  I thought this one was great.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
  I think I think this is so good now because of the pandemic.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
  For the recognition was great.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
  There were a lot of parallels around it.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
  Had I read it before the pandemic, I would have thought it was horrible.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
  I still thought it was good and hard.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
  But I had not received this recognition that I got now.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
  Incredibly well written.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
  It was quick to read.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
  I swallowed this book in two days.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
  I wanted to read about it.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
  When we discussed it in the book circle, a lot of things I had missed out.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
  Or other angles.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
  Everyone had their own version of this book.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
  It was absolutely fantastic to listen to.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
  One of the most interesting conversations I must have been through.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
  It was a great chat about this book.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
  I recommend it incredibly much.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
  It's horrible, it's hard so you have to get used to it.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
  But worth reading.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
  Especially after the pandemic, I must say.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
  Another mystery thriller.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
  I have gone through quite a lot of mystery thriller.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
  Because it's been easy for me.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
  I like it.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
  It has helped me in my reading.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
  This.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
  Jackal.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
  By Erin e Adams.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
  Jackal.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
  I can't pronounce it but you know, that animal.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
  In all cases.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
  Mystery thriller too.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
  A reading logg on this one.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
  I link it down in the description.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
  I think this one is in part 4.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
  And family lame that is part of part 5.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
  With both of two I link here in the description.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
  If you are curious.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
  What is this about then? Now let's see what it's called.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
  Liz Rosher I think we spoke.

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
  She goes back to her small town.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
  She doesn't want to go back there.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
  Because when she was there, her friend became.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
  Kidnapped and brutally murdered in the forest.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
  She doesn't want to go back there.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
  But she has to go back there for her best friend is getting married.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
  So she goes back there.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
  But then.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
  Her best friend's daughter disappears and gets kidnapped in the forest.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
  Then she starts to sneak in this.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
  And realize that.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
  This is something that has repeatedly repeated.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
  Where girls are kidnapped and murdered in the forest.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
  And the common committee is that everyone is African Americans.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
  Who starts digging into this.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
  I have to say that I thought this one was really great.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
  And I loved the end.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
  I was told that the end would be completely like this.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
  That it would flip out at the end.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
  But I didn't think so.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
  I thought this one was good.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
  This is a small supernatural touch on it.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
  So you don't like that.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
  But I think this one was so good.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
  I'm not going to talk so much more about it.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
  I gave it a strong four.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
  I'm not going to talk so much more about it.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
  In the Reading Log I tell you pretty detailed about my thoughts.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
  But I recommend it so well.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
  In third place in September so will

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
  Remarkable Bright Creatures by Shelby.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
  You also see this anyway.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
  We read it in the book club.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
  And I have to say that I stand up and sing in the choir.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,618
  Because I agree with everything about what people have said this.

167
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:11,000
  There is a friendship between a woman and a maid in an aquarium.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
  She becomes friends with the octopus there.

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
  And they find a way to communicate with each other.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
  It's a bit of a mystery to solve here too.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
  Because the octopus knows something that the maid should know.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
  He tries to convey it to her.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
  Very really nice book.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
  I think it's pretty dark.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
  It is not perfectly far from.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
  But a cozy book that was quick to read and you got warm in the body.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
  And I think I like.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
  Had this been another animal, I would not have thought it was very cozy.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
  But just that it is the sea and octopus and I feel at home there.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
  So I think I like it more than I might have done if it would have been another animal.

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
  Just because you know.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
  But I think this one was great.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
  Strong four, recommend it and I think I agree.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
  It is a very nice and cozy book.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
  There are some things, some characters that I don't really believe.

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
  But in terms of story, I think it's great.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
  Recommend it, run on.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
  In second place we have another Mystery Thriller.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
  So totally sick.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
  And another book that has been in a reading logo.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
  So I should not talk very much about it but I still have to pick it up.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
  We will talk about Daisy Darker by Alice Feeney.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
  So this book I have seen a little everywhere.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
  Now at least on Swedish Instagram and such.

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
  This is probably a declaration of love for Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
  As I have to read now.

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
  We can accompany the Darker family who have not met in type 20 years.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
  But now they will gather here on this island and celebrate their grandmother's eighties anniversary.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
  And they are there, they get stuck because it's a storm, of course.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
  And one by one begins to die.

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
  What is going on?

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
  I thought this one was fantastic.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
  The end I thought was great.

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
  But I'm laid in held.

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
  But I should not talk very much about it but I really liked this book.

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
  And I liked the end, I liked the road there.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
  And I was really sucked in taking up Agatha Christie's book.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
  As it is type easily based on.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
  Strong four, I link in the description so you can listen to my thoughts if you want.

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
  And in first place we have Things We Do in the Dark by Jennifer Hillier.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
  And as you know, here is also a Mystery Thriller.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
  And yes, I've made a reading logg for it too.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
  So I'm not going to talk very much about it.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
  But here we have to accompany a girl she is accused.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
  The entire first chapter is about being accused of the murder of her husband.

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
  Because you find her with the man who is dead.

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
  And she is arrested and goes to jail.

218
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
  Not prison but she gets like this ...

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
  You know, she gets stuck.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
  And then you have to accompany her.

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
  And she has to be a little careful about what she says to the police.

222
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
  Because she has a dark secret. We don't know what it is yet.

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
  But it's a dark secret.

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
  And I also know a lot on my thoughts.

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
  I think more than I thought this one was incredibly well written.

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
  Giant welfare built.

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
  The author is fantastic I think.

228
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
  One of the...

229
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
  Yes, this was great in so many layers.

230
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
  And it had many layers.

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
  Very twists and turns.

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
  Two out of three large reveals.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
  Twister, or what to say, I was watching.

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
  But it did not destroy the reading experience.

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
  But this was incredibly good.

236
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
  Great.

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
  Credible and amazing characters.

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
  Some people hate and some you like.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
  And I love this feeling that you can't trust the main character.

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
  I love that feeling.

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
  That said, a strong strong four.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
  I'm not going to tell you so much more about it because I've done a reading logo.

243
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
  That said, I link everything in the description.

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
  So you can go in and listen to my thoughts.

245
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
  More in -depth. Now.

246
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
  September started well.

247
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
  I have started to get into reading.

248
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
  I am incredibly nervous about it.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
  But I am so happy that I have DNF: at books.

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
  For it has meant that these books that I have actually stayed at

251
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
  Have been books that have given me incredible reading experiences.

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
  And as I feel confident in saying that I recommend them to you.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
  But, as you can see, it's been a mix.

254
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
  Unfortunately, Damma has become like that.

255
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
  We'll see how October will be.

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
  I am incredibly careful for October, if I am to be honest.

257
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
  And I can say already that

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
  Wrap-up in October, it can be anything.

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
  Because I don't know if I will listen to my TBR for October at all.

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
  I do not know.

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
  But September has been totally okay.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
  And of course I am really good of how your September has been.

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
  Told to me in the comments section we will hear there.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,125
  We'll see you next week and don't forget to give me a thumbs up

265
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,000
  And please subscribe to my channel, if you don't already.

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
  Farewell. Bye!
