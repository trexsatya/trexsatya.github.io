00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01,440
<b> he has been judged already </b> <b>.
 </b>

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,480
<b> I found him in the criminal record. </b>

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,280
<b> That's why I call and </b> <b> it was up to me even more. </b>

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,519
<b> How should we act in the </b> <b> here situation? </b>

5
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11,519
<b> I'm talking about Emma and Konrad as </b> <b> Two months ago disappeared from .. </b>

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,760
<b> The crime should be judged as gross as the injury was then occurred by an uncontrolled fire. </b>

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,840
<b> and the injury was extremely noticeable. </b>

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
<b> We just disappeared and the situation is still serious. </b>

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,920
<b> But we have to tell the truth and we have missed Youtube and you above all, so much heaven. </b>

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,039
<b> so we got comment daily on what has happened. </b>

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,320
<b> Everything from having raised children, someone has been unfaithful. </b>

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,840
<b> or, what you wonder, have we ended. </b>

13
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:52,800
<b> Watch the entire video because you really don't want to miss this. </b>

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,920
<b> What has happened to us is really sick.
 </b>

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,960
<b> Although we have a wonderful job </b> <b> there is a dark side like many </b>

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,880
<b> Creators choose not to talk about by rescue for it to get worse. </b>

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,880
<b> What we will tell you about now is one of the absolute worst LVI has been through. </b>

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,960
<b> and it all started in 2020. </b>

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,039
<b> We started getting messages and mails by a man who said he was religious. </b>

20
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,960
<b> he talked very much about God, but be kind. </b>

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,800
<b> for he said he liked our videos and my livestream. </b>

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,320
<b> At the same time he began to say that he was talking directly to God. </b>

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,679
<b> that he was like a speaker for God. </b>

24
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,880
<b> Here I feel pretty guilty because I didn't know who the person was. </b>

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,880
<b> But I responded to one of his messages and it opened a total door to a Madr√∂m that became so damn unpleasant. </b>

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,920
<b> Our journey with this channel began in October 2016. </b>

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,400
<b> A jealousy filled with laughter, creativity and lots of love. </b>

28
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,079
<b> But as you noticed in the summer of 2021 it became quiet. </b>

29
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,639
<b> We just disappeared without a word and without any explanation. </b>

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,519
<b> Youtube means so much to us. </b>

31
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:12,599
<b> I've been watching Youtube for as long as I can remember. </b>

32
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,519
<b> Already in 2008 I uploaded my first clip. </b>

33
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,440
<b> It is now that you realize that I have gotten rid of my absolute greatest interest, to tell stories. </b>

34
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:28,000
<b> After several years of streaming, I realized that something important was missing. </b>

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,119
<b> I wanted to create videos that were always there for you. </b>

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
<b> Even when I wasn't live. </b>

37
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,880
<b> I moved to Stockholm to learn all about Youtube. </b>

38
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,400
<b> That's where I met Konrad. </b>

39
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,719
<b> We decided to start this channel. </b>

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,039
<b> When our channel was silenced, it felt like we lost a bit of ourselves. </b>

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,159
<b> We became compelling. </b>

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,320
<b> In his mean he began to focus more and more on Emma. </b>

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,559
<b> he claimed that God had created her to him. </b>

44
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,880
<b> Like I was some thing for him.
 An object. </b>

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,880
<b> he saw all of our relationship as an evil sin. </b>

46
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,000
<b> she was in unfaithful to him. </b>

47
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,239
<b> At first it was so sick.
 I just wanted to laugh it away. </b>

48
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,440
<b> ignore it. </b>

49
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,119
<b> But now I started to get really worried. </b>

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,320
<b> It only got worse and worse. </b>

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,719
<b> Happens enough that the situation had become extremely more serious. </b>

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
<b> to shop for a video. </b>

53
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,519
<b> In this video he sits.
 He seems completely drugged. </b>

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,519
<b> Someone seriously wrong with this person. </b>

55
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,440
<b> he sits and talks about all extreme s*xuel*a stuff. </b>

56
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:51,800
<b> that I have to do with him because he owns me. </b>

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,519
<b> he will make sure we will not </b> <b> be with each other anymore. </b>

58
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,880
<b> If that's the last thing he does.
 It was so extremely unpleasant and so eerie. </b>

59
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,800
<b> and just hear the voice of this crazy man. </b>

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,760
<b> just give me shivers, only I talk about it. </b>

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,480
<b> Here we start by notifying the clip. </b>

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,360
<b> But it obviously gets worse after that.
 What do you think this person did? </b>

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,440
<b> He sits down for ten hours in a car to Stockholm. </b>

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,440
<b> Not just that.
 He Bo sits in a hotel. </b>

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,360
<b> share on the corner.
 Right near where we live. </b>

66
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,800
<b> We're starting to get planned when we got to watch this video. </b>

67
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,679
<b> We felt chasing it.
 One did not feel safe in your own home. </b>

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,519
<b> it's sick don't end there. </b>

69
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,320
<b> he starts filming our house. </b>

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
<b> he even gets into our gate. </b>

71
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:49,119
<b> and to then get into our floor. </b>

72
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:57,159
<b> When it fails, he walks around the house and films straight in through our bedroom windows. </b>

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,559
<b> It felt absolutely insane that this happened. </b>

74
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,519
<b> It was like being stuck in a nightmare that one couldn't wake up from. </b>

75
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:14,119
<b> I was obviously terrified.
 We both got this huge and didn't know what to do. </b>

76
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,159
<b> He could be every fan at this time. </b>

77
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,239
<b> and at the same time we had our dogs. </b>

78
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,840
<b> We had to go out to the apartment. </b>

79
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,519
<b> I just wanted to lock myself inside and at the same time I'm really scared something happens Konrad. </b>

80
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,239
<b> Konrad, if you go out and I know what he would do if he finds you. </b>

81
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,320
<b> What is yet scary is that this person doesn't even hide who he is. </b>

82
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,880
<b> He is completely open and you realize that he has no limits at all. </b>

83
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,599
<b> No, he's totally sprouting crazy. </b>

84
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,840
<b> So, something is seriously wrong. </b>

85
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,400
<b> We couldn't even sleep at night.
 We were just awake at night. </b>

86
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,960
<b> and every fucking sound we heard we thought it's this </b>

87
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,960
<b> the madman standing outside us with the ax hand or something. </b>

88
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,039
<b> all the more thoughts that come into one's head that you just can't shut it out. </b>

89
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:06,159
<b> We had probably had enough by this time and just like this what the hell should we get to? </b>

90
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,960
<b> No, so we simply called the police. </b>

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,559
<b> Now I have got a clip Send me where a person is looking for me and my girlfriend. </b>

92
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:22,280
<b> This person is in our gate and looks and looks for our names he tells him in this video. </b>

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,239
<b> So that's why I call too.
 For it was up to me even more, </b>

94
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,639
<b> otherwise just thought it was a strange fan. </b>

95
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,679
<b>- What does he say then? </b>

96
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,679
<b> What is heard is that he is looking for us and he is looking for us for three, four days in the area where we live. </b>

97
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:40,519
<b> and we had, as I said, called the police and they took this seriously. </b>

98
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,239
<b> Thank goodness. </b>

99
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,519
<b> But here comes the next bomb. </b>

100
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:48,519
<b> This man has been sentenced several times since before. </b>

101
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,679
<b> so not only the disgusting videos and s*xuel*a messages and crazy god stuff. </b>

102
00:06:55,679 --> 00:07:00,119
<b> so our safety was really in danger because he </b>

103
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,239
<b> actually did the crazy things he had also talked about. </b>

104
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,599
<b> Police told us. </b>

105
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,239
<b> to block him, ban him everywhere. </b>

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,840
<b> Give him no attention do not respond to any messages at all. </b>

107
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,119
<b> and whatever you do, don't talk about this out in your social media. </b>

108
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,239
<b> Because we don't know how to react if he would be angry. </b>

109
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
<b> and if he were to get angry what he would do then. </b>

110
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,000
<b> We got to sit there and just pretend, be happy that everything was peaceful and joyful. </b>

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,960
<b> It was great, very busy. </b>

112
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,239
<b> and at the same time it took a lot on our relationship between us. </b>

113
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,119
<b> for we walked around and was nerve wreck and worried. </b>

114
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,760
<b> and we couldn't sleep at night, and the smallest sound as we </b>

115
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,400
<b> heard or movement felt like he would break into our apartment. </b>

116
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,960
<b> and I think you noticed it more and more, to </b>

117
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,800
<b> Videos are getting smaller and smaller and my streams also. </b>

118
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:02,440
<b> and guess if we had a bad conscience after this.
 We were forced to lie to you. </b>

119
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,000
<b> or it felt that way, at least, even though we did not make sense. </b>

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,719
<b> But being loosened that everything was just as usual when it really wasn't. </b>

121
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,239
<b> It was above all extremely difficult for me as a live streamer in the days. </b>

122
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:19,279
<b> I am sitting live stream at TikTok and on Twitch. </b>

123
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,680
<b> and have lots of people every day asking why we don't post as much videos anymore. </b>

124
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,880
<b> From the beginning, people start asking why I didn't join the videos as much. </b>

125
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:33,399
<b> and it is also to not trigger him, appear as little as possible. </b>

126
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,359
<b> I had no answer to any of the several questions.
 We just sat there trying to pretend like nothing. </b>

127
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,640
<b> and this man was since previous criminals and was convicted </b>

128
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,920
<b> Several times for, among other things, serious violent crimes and murder. </b>

129
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,439
<b> so now this idiot was then obsessed with my girlfriend. </b>

130
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,880
<b>- Emma !! </b>

131
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,239
<b>*censored*</b>

132
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:59,199
<b> xxxx ... I know where you live. </b>

133
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:06,079
<b> Through the police we got a contact with a person on the personal protection group. </b>

134
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,000
<b> they work with people who are exposed and who are in such situations. </b>

135
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,119
<b> We were asked by them.
 Do you want to move to protective accommodation, because we can fix this for you? </b>

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,600
<b> until the situation has resolved. </b>

137
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,039
<b> The problem was only that if we had stopped doing so, we would have had to stop all our social media. </b>

138
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:31,000
<b> and basically go below the ground.
 Which is the last thing we wanted because we actually love our job. </b>

139
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:34,520
<b> so it was extremely difficult and it was really something we </b>

140
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,960
<b> had to think through.
 It was no easy decision. </b>

141
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,600
<b> After much about and but then we finally decided to </b>

142
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,680
<b> move to a separate apartment themselves without the help of the police. </b>

143
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,279
<b> may not be the best choice because since we did, we have had to move three times. </b>

144
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,640
<b> because we wanted to be able to continue with our job that we loved. </b>

145
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,359
<b> We had to do anything to feel money and pay the rent. </b>

146
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:02,399
<b> We really tried to keep up but motivation and </b>

147
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,439
<b> The love of creating was completely wiped out after all that has happened. </b>

148
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,159
<b> and he did not give up. </b>

149
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,159
<b> I just felt that in the end I wasn't wrong and I was depressed. </b>

150
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,720
<b> and videos came up more and more rarely. </b>

151
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,680
<b> I just felt such incredible stress and pressure. </b>

152
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,720
<b> I didn't have the whole energy to keep up both Youtube and Stream. </b>

153
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,039
<b> If we are thinking that he seems to focus more on Youtube </b>

154
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,600
<b> than twitch so I chose ok but I continue with Twitch. </b>

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,319
<b> Then we have any income anyway. </b>

156
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:42,800
<b> There I can sit and sit like I don't understand anything or try. </b>

157
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,600
<b> i modder in this point so incredibly bad. </b>

158
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,359
<b> I just felt that I was betraying you and I betrayed myself when I can't cope anymore. </b>

159
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,000
<b> youtube was your life. </b>

160
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,319
<b> hard to talk about? </b>

161
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,319
<b> very hard to talk about. </b>

162
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
<b> Youtube has been my life for so long. </b>

163
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:02,399
<b> Yes. </b>

164
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,399
<b> It's all Konrad talks about. </b>

165
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,119
<b> youtube, youtube, youtube all the time. </b>

166
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,279
<b> It was in the summer of 2021 that we finally made the difficult decision to okay. </b>

167
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,640
<b> He still hadn't stopped by this time and as I said we moved around like just that. </b>

168
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,079
<b> a j*vla lots of shit it happened. </b>

169
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:31,279
<b> Now we take a break, a real break to see if it can make him quit. </b>

170
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,600
<b> We were just hoping that he could lose interest in Emma. </b>

171
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:46,279
<b> Then the time went more and more and we have managed to heal, build ourselves and focus on our lives again. </b>

172
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:49,960
<b> We probably realized it in the end so enough is enough. </b>

173
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,079
<b> Now we want to live and do what we want. </b>

174
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,840
<b> I refuse to let someone j*vla ganning once again control what we do and do not do or get. </b>

175
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,760
<b> It has taken therapy for us to arrive at the point we are now. </b>

176
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,039
<b> I feel so ready to continue with Youtube. </b>

177
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,079
<b> It's all Konrad talks about. </b>

178
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:11,960
<b> i'm legit. </b>

179
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,640
<b> I'm the world's largest Youtube nerd. </b>

180
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,520
<b> I cure holes in her head with video ideas. </b>

181
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,239
<b> Look at this. </b>

182
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,199
<b> i love this. </b>

183
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:21,520
<b> or we both love this but I'm extremely nerd. </b>

184
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,159
<b> you are extremely nerders. </b>

185
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,960
<b> Yes, he is really extreme. </b>

186
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,399
<b> Every day there are new videos here. </b>

187
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,199
<b> In this point you have thought that hundreds of video ideas are what you want to do. </b>

188
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,920
<b> I just feel think about what fun when we post a video. </b>

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,560
<b> Yes, think what a good thing it will be and God what fun we will have. </b>

190
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,279
<b> I'm just glad we are sitting here now and can tell the truth. </b>

191
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:46,520
<b> It has been such a sick thing over our heads for so long. </b>

192
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
<b> I've been able to sit here now and do this. </b>

193
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
<b> I'm just so damn happy. </b>

194
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,359
<b> Yes, 100%</b>

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,760
<b> Now we really hope you want to accompany us on our journey back. </b>

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,479
<b> and you finally you at the truth. </b>

197
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,000
<b> to the big question that everyone has wondered. </b>

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,840
<b> are we still together? </b>

199
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:08,800
<b> Yes. </b>

200
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,279
<b> I didn't know what JI would do ... </b>

201
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,199
<b> Yes, we're still together. </b> <b>*Laughter attack*</b>

202
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,880
<b> and you probably wonder what happened to this madman. </b>

203
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,520
<b> and apparently he should not even be in Sweden anymore. </b>

204
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,119
<b> We have not been able to confirm it. </b>

205
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,640
<b> But that's what his relative says </b> anyway

206
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,439
<b> It ended up with, unfortunately ... I can say that I am not surprised.
