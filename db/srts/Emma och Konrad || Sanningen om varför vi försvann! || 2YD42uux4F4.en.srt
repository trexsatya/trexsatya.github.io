1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:01.440
He has previously been convicted.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,480
I found him in the criminal record.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,280
That's why I call and it was even more.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06.519
How should we act in this situation?

5
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11.519
I talk about Emma and Konrad who two months ago disappeared from ..

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,760
The crime should be judged as serious as the injury was then taken place through an uncontrolled fire.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,840
And the injury was extremely noticeable.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
We just disappeared and the situation is still serious.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,920
But we have to tell the truth and we have missed Youtube and you above all, so much heaven.

10
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,039
So we have been commented daily on what has happened.

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,320
Everything from having children, something has been unfaithful.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,840
Or, what you wonder, we have ended.

13
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:52,800
Watch the whole video because you really don't want to miss this.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,920
What has happened to us is really sick.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59.960
Although we have a wonderful job, there is a dark side as many

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04.880
Creators choose not to talk about it for it to get worse.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09.880
What we will tell you about now is one of the absolute worst LVI has been through.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,960
And it all started in 2020.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,039
We started getting messages and mails from a man who said he was religious.

20
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,960
He talked a lot about God, but was kind.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,800
Because he said he liked our videos and my livestream.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,320
At the same time, he began to say that he was talking directly to God.

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,679
That he was like a speaker for God.

24
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,880
Here I feel quite guilty because I did not know who where the person was.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,880
But I responded to one of his messages and it opened a total door to a MadrÃ¶m that became so damn unpleasant.

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,920
Our journey with this channel began in October 2016.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,400
A jealousy filled with laughter, creativity and lots of love.

28
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,079
But as you noticed in the summer of 2021, it became quiet.

29
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05.639
We just disappeared without a word and without any explanation.

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09.519
Youtube means so much to us.

31
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:12,599
I've been watching Youtube for as long as I can remember.

32
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16.519
Already in 2008 I uploaded my first clip.

33
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,440
It is now that you realize that I have gotten rid of my absolute greatest interest, to tell stories.

34
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:28,000
After several years of streaming, I realized that something important was missing.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,119
I wanted to create videos that were always there for you.

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Even when I wasn't live.

37
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:36,880
I moved to Stockholm to learn all about Youtube.

38
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,400
That's where I met Konrad.

39
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,719
We decided to start this channel.

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,039
When our channel was silenced, it felt like we lost a bit of ourselves.

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,159
We became compelling.

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,320
In his mean, he began to focus more and more on Emma.

43
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,559
He claimed that God had created her to him.

44
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07.880
Like I was some thing for him. An object.

45
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,880
He saw our entire relationship as an evil sin.

46
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,000
She was unfaithful to him.

47
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,239
At first it was so sick. I just wanted to laugh it away.

48
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,440
Ignore it.

49
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,119
But now I started to get really worried.

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,320
It only got worse and worse.

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,719
Happens enough that the situation had become extremely more serious.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To shop for a video.

53
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,519
In this video he sits. He seems completely drugged.

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,519
Someone seriously wrong with this person.

55
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,440
He sits and talks about all extremely s*xuel*a stuff.

56
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:51,800
As I have to do with him because he owns me.

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,519
He will make sure we will not be with each other anymore.

58
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00.880
If that's the last thing he does. It was so extremely unpleasant and so eerie.

59
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06.800
And just hear the voice of this crazy man.

60
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,760
Just give me shivers, only I talk about it.

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,480
Here we start by registering the clip.

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,360
But of course it gets worse after that. What do you think this person did?

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,440
He sits down for ten hours in a car to Stockholm.

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Not just that. He lives in a hotel.

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,360
Share on the corner. Right close to where we live.

66
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,800
We are starting to be planned when we got to watch this video.

67
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:37,679
We felt chasing it. You did not feel safe in your own home.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,519
It's sick don't end there.

69
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,320
He starts filming our house.

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
He even gets into our gate.

71
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:49,119
And to then get into our floor.

72
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:57,159
When it does not succeed, he walks around the house and films straight in through our bedroom windows.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,559
It felt completely insane that this happened.

74
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08.519
It was like being stuck in a nightmare that you couldn't wake up from.

75
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:14,119
Of course, I became terrified. We both got this huge and did not know what to do.

76
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,159
He could be every fan at this time.

77
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,239
And at the same time we had our dogs.

78
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,840
After all, we had to go out to the apartment.

79
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25.519
I just wanted to lock myself inside and at the same time I'm really scared something happens to be Konrad.

80
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:30,239
Konrad, if you go out and I know what he would do if he finds you.

81
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,320
What is still scary is that this person does not even hide who he is.

82
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,880
He is completely open and you realize that he has no boundaries at all.

83
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,599
No, he is totally splashing crazy.

84
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,840
So, something is seriously wrong.

85
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,400
We couldn't even sleep at night. After all, we were just awake at night.

86
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,960
And every damn sound we heard we thought it's this one

87
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,960
The madman standing outside us with the ax hand or something.

88
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01.039
All the more thoughts that come into your head that you just can't shut it out.

89
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:06,159
We had probably had enough by this time and just like this what the hell should we get to?

90
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07.960
No, so we simply called the police.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,559
Now I have had a clip send to me where a person is looking for me and my girlfriend.

92
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:22,280
This person is in our gate and looks and looks for our names, he tells us in this video.

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,239
So that's why I call too. For it was up to me even more,

94
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,639
Otherwise, just thought it was a strange fan.

95
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,679
- What does he say then?

96
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,679
What is heard is that he is looking for us and he is looking for us for three, four days in the area where we live.

97
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:40,519
And, as I said, we had called the police and they took this seriously.

98
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:41,239
Thankfully.

99
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,519
But here comes the next bomb.

100
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:48,519
This man has been sentenced several times since before.

101
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,679
So not only the disgusting videos and s*xuel*a messages and crazy god stuff.

102
00:06:55,679 --> 00:07:00,119
So now our safety was really in danger because he

103
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,239
In fact, did the crazy things he had also talked about.

104
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,599
The police told us.

105
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07.239
To block him, ban him everywhere.

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,840
Give him no attention do not respond to any messages at all.

107
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,119
And whatever you do, don't talk about this out in your social media.

108
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,239
Because we do not know how to react if he would get angry.

109
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
And if he were to get angry, what to do then.

110
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,000
After all, we had to sit there and just pretend, be happy that everything was peaceful and delighted.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,960
It was great, very busy.

112
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,239
And at the same time, it was a lot on our relationship between us.

113
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,119
Because we walked around and was nerve wreck and worried.

114
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,760
And we could not sleep at night, and the smallest sound like we

115
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,400
Heard or movement felt like he would break into our apartment.

116
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,960
And I think you noticed it more and more, because

117
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,800
Videos are getting smaller and smaller and my streams as well.

118
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:02.440
And guess if we had a bad conscience after this. We were forced to lie to you.

119
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,000
Or it felt so, at least, even though we did not make sense.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,719
But being loosened that everything was just as usual when it really wasn't.

121
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,239
Above all, it was extremely difficult for me as a live streamer in the days.

122
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:19,279
I am a live stream on Tiktok and on Twitch.

123
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:25,680
And have lots of people every day who ask why we don't post as many videos anymore.

124
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,880
From the beginning, people start asking why I have not included in the videos as much.

125
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:33,399
And it is also because not triggering him, seems as little as possible.

126
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,359
I had no answers to any of the several questions. We just sat there trying to pretend like nothing.

127
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,640
And this man was since previously criminals and was convicted

128
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,920
Several times for, among other things, serious violent crimes and murder.

129
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,439
So now this idiot was then obsessed with my girlfriend.

130
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,880
- Emma !!

131
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,239
*Censored*

132
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:59,199
XXXX ... I know where you live.

133
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:06,079
Through the police we got in touch with a person at the personal protection group.

134
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,000
They work with people who are exposed and who are in such situations.

135
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,119
We were asked by them. Do you want to move to protective accommodation, because we can fix this for you?

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,600
Until the situation has resolved.

137
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,039
The problem was only that if we had stopped doing so, we would have had to stop all our social media.

138
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:31,000
And basically go below the ground. Which is the last thing we wanted because we actually love our job.

139
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:34,520
So it was extremely difficult and it really was something we

140
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,960
Had to think through. It was no easy decision.

141
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,600
After much if and but then we finally decided to

142
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,680
Move to your own apartment themselves without the help of the police.

143
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,279
Maybe not the best choice because since we did, we have had to move three times.

144
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,640
Because we wanted to be able to continue with our job that we loved.

145
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,359
We had to do something to feel money and pay the rent.

146
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:02,399
We really tried to keep up but the motivation and

147
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,439
The love for creating was completely wiped out after everything that has happened.

148
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,159
And he did not give up.

149
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,159
I just felt that in the end I was not wrong and I was depressed.

150
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,720
And videos came up more and more rarely.

151
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,680
I just felt such incredible stress and pressure.

152
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,720
I didn't have the whole energy to keep up both Youtube and stream.

153
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,039
If we think about that he seems more focusing on Youtube

154
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,600
Than Twitch I chose okay but I continue with Twitch.

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,319
Then at least we have some income.

156
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:42,800
There I can sit and sit down like I don't understand anything or try.

157
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,600
I modder in this point so incredibly bad.

158
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,359
I just felt that I was betraying you and I betrayed myself when I can't cope anymore.

159
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,000
YouTube was your life.

160
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,319
Hard to talk about?

161
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,319
Very hard to talk about.

162
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Youtube has been my life for so long.

163
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:02,399
Yes.

164
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,399
It's all Konrad talks about.

165
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,119
Youtube, Youtube, Youtube all the time.

166
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,279
It was in the summer of 2021 that we finally made the difficult decision to okay.

167
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,640
He still hadn't stopped by this time and as I said we moved around like just that.

168
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,079
A lot of shit it happened.

169
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:31,279
Now we take a break, a real break to see if it can make him quit.

170
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,600
We just hoped that he could lose interest in Emma.

171
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:46,279
Then the time went more and more and we have managed to heal, build ourselves and focus on our lives again.

172
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:49,960
We realized it well so that is enough.

173
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,079
Now we want to live and do what we want.

174
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:00,840
I refuse to let someone j*vla ganning once again control what we do and do not do or get.

175
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,760
It has taken therapy for us to arrive at the point we are now.

176
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08.039
I feel so ready to continue with Youtube.

177
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,079
It's all Konrad talks about.

178
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm legit.

179
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,640
I am the world's largest Youtube nerd.

180
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,520
I cure holes in her head with video ideas.

181
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,239
Look at this.

182
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,199
I love this.

183
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:21,520
Or we both love this but I'm extremely nerd.

184
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,159
You are extremely nerd.

185
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,960
Yes, he is really extreme.

186
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,399
Every day there are new videos here.

187
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:33,199
At this point, you have thought that hundreds of video ideas are what you want to do.

188
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,920
I just know what fun when we post a video.

189
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39.560
Yes, imagine what good it will be and God what fun we will have.

190
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:43,279
I'm just glad we are sitting here now and can tell you the truth.

191
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:46,520
It has been such a sick thing over our heads for so long.

192
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
I've been able to sit here now and do this.

193
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
I'm just so damn happy.

194
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,359
Yes, 100%

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,760
Now we really hope that you want to accompany us on our trip back.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,479
And you are finally humming at the truth.

197
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,000
To the big question that everyone has wondered.

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02.840
Are we still together?

199
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:08.800
Yes.

200
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,279
I didn't know what JI would do ...

201
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,199
Yes, we are still together. *Laughter attack*

202
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,880
And you probably wonder what happened to this madman.

203
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,520
And apparently he should not even be in Sweden anymore.

204
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,119
We have not been able to confirm it.

205
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,640
But at least that's what his relative says

206
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,439
It ended with, unfortunately..I get to say that I am not surprised.

207
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,640
That the case is laid down.
