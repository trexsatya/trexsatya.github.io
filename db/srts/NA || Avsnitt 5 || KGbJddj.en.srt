1
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.600
-Hello!
 -Thanks so much!

2
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.760
Welcome to shrimp frozen!

3
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.920
- You seem to be in a good mood.
 - Yes, I've met a girl.

4
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.880
I'm really in love!
 She is fun, intelligent and looks good.

5
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.240
- I have a photo of her here.
 -Very cute!
 A real tingle!

6
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.480
- Swalling hair.
 - Yes, and nice eyes.

7
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.240
-Full lips.
 - As a photo model.

8
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.800
You are happy.
 So am I.

9
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.040
I have been with Magdalena for a year.
 I really love her.

10
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.480
- I've never met her.
 -No...

11
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.720
I have a photo of her too.

12
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.160
- Sure she is cute?
 - mm.
 Yes.

13
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.080
-Do you think so?
 -Do not you think so?

14
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.640
No ... No, I can't say that.

15
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.880
- She is an ordinary sweet girl.
 - No, now you are deceiving yourself.

16
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.720
- She is below average.
 - What a great you are!

17
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.400
I just say what I think.

18
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.120
- She is kind, intelligent ... --... but not attractive.

19
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.680
This is an automatic photo, but I have one from Greece this summer.

20
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.000
- At the beach in bikini ... –Ah, five!

21
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.120
Oh, she really stinks!
 Take it.

22
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.520
- It's my girlfriend!
 - I feel bad now.

23
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.400
- Connect, that's my girl!
 - Mot her down in the swamp again.

24
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.360
Check out, here she is five years!
 Very cute little girl with braids.

25
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.800
FUL -Alarm!
 FUL -Alarm!
 I see an ugly man, ugly man ...

26
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.680
Can you stop!
 That's my girl!
 HA!
 Can you leave?

27
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.920
Either she does an operation or you kick her out on the street.

28
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.040
-What are you doing?
 - Have you not seen Ricki Lake?

29
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.880
I'll talk to her.
 Can I borrow your phone?

30
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.880
Thanks!

31
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.440
We will become more culturally oriented.

32
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.800
We will help you navigate in cultural Sweden and give you good book tips.

33
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.160
I don't like to read for my dog was overrun by the book bus.

34
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.800
But I like "from monkey to human".
 It is available at the library.

35
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.680
What a lucky thing you live now!

36
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.720
The first people had to learn everything from the beginning.

37
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.040
What can be eaten and which animals are dangerous.

38
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.680
Imagine the first pregnancy - your stomach begins to grow.

39
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.680
"What the hell have I eaten?"
 And suddenly a new person comes out!

40
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.160
You have to be smart: "Sure, I cuddled nine months ago!"

41
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.160
They must have thought about all other reasons: "Have I bathed for too long?"

42
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.720
They had no language.
 How do you think if you don't have a language?

43
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.080
We can't think of how it is but a language, because we think about the language.

44
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.920
Imagine if you see a stone and you can't think "stone".

45
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.640
You can't think "gray" or "hard", but just "uh".

46
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.800
Darwin believed that people started as monkeys and then advanced.

47
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.360
Neanderthal became Cromagnon etc.
 But the types overlapped each other.

48
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.240
There was a time when Neanderthal and Cromagnon lived at the same time.

49
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.080
Imagine a group of Neanderthal!

50
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.720
One beautiful day comes a new kind of man: "Hello. Erik - Cromagnon."

51
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.240
We have moved into the cave here.
 We enjoy it!

52
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.200
We will paint and refresh a little.

53
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.200
Yes.
 We have summer cave down in Österlen ... where we enjoy it very well.

54
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.680
I invented the wheel yesterday.
 Very happy!

55
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.560
Okay ... I'm not going to get long.

56
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.360
Do you have a fire?
 I was just joking!

57
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.520
My book tip: "From monkey to human".

58
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.800
The late summer's most beautiful flower splendor is probably Dahlian.

59
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.960
The dahlias are diverse -

60
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.440
- And lights up the garden until the cold arrives.

61
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.880
The dahlias cannot tolerate very well.

62
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:59.440
The tubers must be taken out of the soil and enter the heat during the winter.

63
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.960
Many who have dahlias leave the tubers left for too long on the autumn edge -

64
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.320
- And then the cold comes and fucks them in the ass.

65
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.920
When the temperature drops, it's time to pick up the tubers from the soil.

66
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.120
Feel free to let some soil come along and polish it when it has dried.

67
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.440
Bring about 10 cm of the stem as well.

68
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.280
Then you bed down the tubers in sand or peat -

69
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:43.240
- And they should be cool and dark until you plant them again.

70
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.520
More difficult than that is not!

71
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.160
- We buy it, huh?
 - I don't like that expression.

72
00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.680
-Oh really?
 "Harder than that is not"?
 - No, the other - with the ass.

73
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.960
Well?
 Does it feel wrong, do you think?

74
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.400
It doesn't fit.
 Can you reformulate yourself?

75
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:18.000
- I could say "going bad".
 - Yes, it's much better!

76
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.320
Okay.
 Let's go with that!

77
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:32.760
There are many psychopaths.
 One of them is the small lander Göran body.

78
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.800
He has tried to ski over the North Pole eg.

79
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.440
This book is about when cycling from Småland to Nepal -

80
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.200
- Claimed up for Mount Everest and cycled home again.

81
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.640
That guy has too much free time!

82
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:02.960
How did Göran reason when he walked around the Småland mill?

83
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.560
"I don't think stay in Småland! A stone fuck got stuck in the plow."

84
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:17.040
He goes to the bike and his old neighbor - Kristina, 85 years - passes by:

85
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.080
"Are you going out and cycling, Göran?"
 - "Yes, I was going to cycle to Nepal."

86
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:32.040
"Are you going to the store, did you say?"
 - "No, I'm going to Nepal."

87
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.640
"Do you think cycling all the way to Nepal?"

88
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.640
"Shut up, sheepary! I'm going to Nepal."

89
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.040
He starts cycling out on the main road towards Växjö.

90
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:53.120
After 400 meters, the chain jumps off.
 "No! I'm going to Nepal!"

91
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.800
The first night at Stadshotellet in Vetlanda.
 He hears the aircraft.

92
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.560
"I'm going to Nepal. Satan!"

93
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.040
Göran Body is a hired lecturer.

94
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.680
He goes around and talks efficiency for SEK 50,000 in half an hour.

95
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:21.080
Volvo's management team thinks: "We will have a conference on efficiency."

96
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.920
"Göran body is very effective."
 He can cycle to Bromma then!

97
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.360
The reason he is allowed to go around is that he was first.

98
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.040
He thought, "I'll climb Mount Everest!"

99
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:44.920
Everyone said, "People have done before."
 Göran said, "I do it without oxygen."

100
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:52.560
"Many have done so too."
 - "Yes, but I'll cycle there."

101
00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:00.120
There is no stopping it.
 His wife and dog will do it too!

102
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.280
He could take the bike to the Kaknästornet -

103
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.040
- Take on an oxygen mask and take the elevator up.
 Nobody has done before!

104
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.320
My book tip: Don't read this book!

105
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.160
What fun we could go out in the end!

106
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.960
They have the best carpaccio in town here.

107
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.160
We want carpaccio for starters.

108
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:47.840
The lady wants chicken tutte and I take Duck myself.

109
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Have you taken part in the wine list?

110
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:57.400
We take a Chateau Margot –87.
 - It makes pirouettes on the gum seal.

111
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.680
Unfortunately, it is over.
 But I can...

112
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.240
You have ruined everything!

113
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.920
Everyone knows the owl is wise, the donkey is stupid, the fox is cunning -

114
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.320
- And the ox has poor local mind.

115
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:28.120
Since childhood, we have been indoctrinated with these prejudices.

116
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.480
Shrimp frozen has tested if they are true.

117
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:39.320
I wanted to test if the owl is wise so I handed out an IQ test -

118
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:45.440
- A high school class in Nacka and a group of owls.

119
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.880
What was the result?

120
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:56.760
First, the high school in Nacka has an IQ below average.

121
00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.920
–And the owls?
 - They don't seem to understand the questions.

122
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:07.000
They just flew around with the holes.

123
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:13.680
They may have emotional intelligence - EQ.
 It has become important.

124
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.120
No, they flapped around and soiled with feathers and feces.

125
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.120
Not like the wisest animals of the forest.

126
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.000
I tested the prejudice "proud as a rooster".

127
00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:35.440
I went to a chicken farm and tried to hurt the rooster's pride.

128
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:43.120
I said I earned better than him and that his hen was a bitch.

129
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.680
Then I started a dirt -throwing campaign.

130
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.240
I walked around among the chickens and spread rumors.

131
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.560
I put up flyers in the chicken farm - this one, e.g.

132
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.640
"The tip's trust at the bottom."
 I continued with this one.

133
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.280
I finished with this one.

134
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.600
But I did not disrupt the pride of the rooster.

135
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.000
Then the prejudice is true in this case?

136
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:34.280
Well ... I went to a cowhage and drove the same gloven word against the steak.

137
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:42.440
They were also untouched.
 So the rooster is no proud than any other animal.

138
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.800
Who has said that the animals are human?

139
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.800
The fables - these devil's glare!

140
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.200
I agree with.
 Most of the fables is pure lie.

141
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:04.520
A fable is about a running competition where the turtle wins over the hare.

142
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.480
It's unrealistic!
 A hare is faster than a turtle.

143
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.960
And when has a hare arranged a running competition?

144
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.480
He can't talk.
 You should fix sponsors, among other things.

145
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:29.120
The fables are just written to make money.
 Commercial shit!

146
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.360
The fables are harmful to children.

147
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:41.760
We have an affected person on a link from Gothenburg - Ulf!

148
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:50.080
- You are located at Sahlgrenska Hospital?
 - Yes, I've been here for two weeks now.

149
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.400
How did it go this crazy?

150
00:15:53.560 --> 00:16:00.880
I went with the kids to Borås Zoo.
 Nice to come home.

151
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:08.320
Otherwise you have to go home with the aunt and she is not related to Einstein ...

152
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.480
What happened this day?

153
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.320
We went to the lion.
 I thought it might be fun for the kids.

154
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.160
The lion male had a tag in the paw.

155
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.840
I thought that if I remove it I will be the friend of the lion.

156
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
- So I pulled out the tag.
 - Did the lion grateful?

157
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.680
He gave me such a fucking bang.
 I flew into the fence.

158
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.560
The lion was on me and the kids cried.

159
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:51.040
He hurt me significantly - a pair of ribs smoke.
 That's the thank you!

160
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.960
- How could it go so badly?
 - You can't trust the fables.

161
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:04.560
You get pissed off!
 I thought I would be friends with the lion.

162
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.720
I don't mind lions.

163
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:15.280
They come here from the jungle in Africa.
 They must adhere to our customs!

164
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.680
Simba is allowed to lie down and eat beef fillet.

165
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.640
There must be limits!

166
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.760
We are at an inevitable point.

167
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:37.160
We have tried to cancel the contract but are forced to have our lifestyle consultant.

168
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:45.440
We would like to point out that the views that Henrik is in front are entirely his own.

169
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.720
They do not represent Sweden's television's view.

170
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.200
Once again: Henrik Elmér!

171
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:07.840
Welcome to "Meet Life with Henrik"!
 The course that can change your life.

172
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
You have to be the blacksmith of your own.

173
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.320
My girlfriend Gunilla ended up with me.

174
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:22.960
But I don't dig myself in bitterness - it's no one helped.

175
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:29.680
Instead, I stand on TV and tell the whole country about the pig Gunilla.

176
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.040
What a stupid her new guy is!

177
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:39.680
Better than being bitter at home.
 Learn this!

178
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:45.960
If you are open, you can always find something positive in a situation.

179
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.440
This summer I fought with a friend and his family.

180
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.480
I have a hard time for that family.

181
00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.880
To top it all, I was involved in their snuff life.

182
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:07.800
I woke up at night because their dwarf rabbit put on my nose.

183
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.840
You would have seen their little son in the morning: "Where is my rabbit?"

184
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.840
In the end, I had to say as it was: "He is with me now."

185
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:29.200
Then I was with the rabbit.
 But I got tired because he wanted sex evenly.

186
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:34.760
I tried to meander, "No, I have a sore nose."

187
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:43.200
The point is that I affirmed what happened.
 You can read about that in the booklet.

188
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:50.720
Unfortunately, the booklets are not finished yet on the damn cock -printing!

189
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:57.120
There is a plot on my course.
 Gunilla's lawyer told me-

190
00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:04.280
- That if I didn't stop talking about Gunilla on TV, they would sue SVT.

191
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.800
I have come across Gunilla.

192
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:14.280
But she is such a good example of how to move on.

193
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.880
Do you know what to do?
 I know!

194
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:26.120
Don't miss next time, because then Gunilla comes here!
 - Do you hear it, Gunilla!

195
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:34.120
You should sit here at my feet and beg for grace!
 - Do not miss it!

196
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:46.720
Tickets!
 Tickets for sale!
 Come and Buy Your Tickets Here!

197
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.520
- DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE VASA -Ship?
 –Yes.

198
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:57.800
It's a Beautiful Ship.
 You Buy Your Tickets Here.
 They Cost 150 Crowns.

199
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.960
That's a bit expensive, isn't it?

200
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:07.000
Everything is.
 You can't live in this bloody country.

201
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:14.760
But It's Worth It - It's A Beautiful Ship.
 300 Crowns for the Two of You.

202
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.720
They have the Tickets inside and they only cost 50 Crowns.

203
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:27.160
Ah, what the hell!
 In Took a Robber.
 It was a chancing.

204
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:33.240
IF IT GOES, IT GOES.
 We're all people!
 You know me.

205
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:37.680
Have fun!
 Enjoy the Ship.
 - Tickets!

206
00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:48.040
- We will meet an interesting artist.
 - We welcome Bengt Johansson!

207
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.520
Welcome!

208
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.360
You experiment with new techniques?

209
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.600
Yes, since I went out Konstfack I have experimented with different techniques.

210
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.680
From the beginning it was the most mosaic and textiles and such things -

211
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.840
- But now I am most interested in sculpture.

212
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:26.320
Especially in living materials.
 So now I mostly deal with meat crafts.

213
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:34.520
We visited Bengt's studio this week and we will have a look at it.

214
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:47.560
- You work with many different materials.
 - It depends on what you want to express.

215
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:53.120
Sometimes it takes heavier materials such as ox or pork -

216
00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:00.440
- And sometimes I play completely freely with calf jam or minced youngsters.

217
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:06.080
You want to exhibit your art like at Millesgården?

218
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.240
It would be wonderful!

219
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.480
- In a park?
 - Well.

220
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:23.320
Can't there arise if you exhibit meat art in public?

221
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:29.880
Well, dogs can be a little well interested in one's art.

222
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:36.360
It can also be smell and flies - though it usually goes pretty well.

223
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:42.720
Last year I made a large statue for the municipality in mixed mince.

224
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:48.600
- It stands in front of the town hall now.
 - Yes, we have pictures of it.

225
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.760
-Hey!
 - Well, Hello!

226
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.200
-Hello!
 - The situation?

227
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:15.160
Yes, a little elaborate and stressed ... but that's good with me.
 How about you?

228
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.920
It is good!

229
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.680
I was at Lasses and Alexandra's wedding.

230
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.240
-How was it?
 - It was successful.

231
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.960
A little stiff in the beginning, just ...

232
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.440
Oh, the but in black!

233
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.600
Are you going to have?
 Well - then I drink!

234
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.280
Otherwise as nice!

235
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:50.520
And after the ceremony, everyone set up for wedding photos.

236
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:57.000
Moonbase Alfa!
 HEY!

237
00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.200
I'm at a wedding.

238
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:08.160
The mitt got it.
 Come here, for the hell!

239
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.760
Then it was offered champagne.

240
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:18.480
Many happy bowls were brought out for the bridal couple.

241
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:26.360
I was a little tired then ... I have pretty much to do, as I said -

242
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.520
- So I broke up a little earlier.

243
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:36.520
Next Saturday, Anders and Sofia are getting married.

244
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.920
It's nice to even develop!

245
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.360
Do you feel more culturally enriched?

246
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.280
Yes, I'm going to write on my book now.

247
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.920
-What is it called?
 -The emigrants.

248
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.080
It is based on a book by Vilhelm Moberg.

249
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:09.920
I have borrowed the action, the characters and all the words of him.

250
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.840
But I write mine with lysyl.

251
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.400
I am also very creative.
 I wrote two poems before the program.

252
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.960
- Do you have them with you?
 -Yes!

253
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.440
-Impressive!
 -Thanks for tonight!

254
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.480
I ... thought about reading a little out of my book.

255
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:40.320
I have written it myself.
 I wrote it when I sat on the kitchen.

256
00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.880
I sat on Kumla for four years.

257
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.200
"I'm not your bitch, Willy," it's called.

258
00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.800
Chapter four.
 Kumla, February 29, 1971.

259
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:07.000
I was tired that morning.
 It was cold as Satan.

260
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:13.040
I would sneak up ... I wasn't drunk - I was sober!

261
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:21.200
I went up to the shower room and it was cold.
 I stood there and ...

262
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.960
I saw that the soap slipped down on the floor.

263
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:34.440
I thought I could pick up the soap.

264
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:40.840
Then I see a big shadow behind me.
 It was Willy, that bastard.

265
00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:47.960
He said "Now you are mine, Gert! Now you should taste the salty!"

266
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.080
I screamed, "I'm not your bitch!"

267
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.480
