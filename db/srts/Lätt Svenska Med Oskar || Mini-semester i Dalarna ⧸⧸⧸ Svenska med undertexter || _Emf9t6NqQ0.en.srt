1
00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:05.454
Have you been thinking about going on vacation to Dalarna sometime

2
00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:09.491
It doesn't have this guy.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.338
He is a dog and only six months old.

4
00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:15.000
His name is Sixten.

5
00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:19.155
He has not thought about going on vacation to Dalarna.

6
00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:27.533
Tonight, on the other hand, he will sleep without me and Amanda for the first time since we picked him up.

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:40.429
For we, we will go to Dalarna in Sweden.
 And we will investigate a landscape full of vast forests, mountains and lakes.

8
00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:47.569
We will also live in an incredibly special little cottage in the middle of the woods,

9
00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.809
swim in a beautiful lake,

10
00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.101
wander up a mountain,

11
00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:58.481
And ride about 65 miles on a motorcycle.

12
00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:03.311
All in less than 30 hours.

13
00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:11.570
And everything to answer the question: is it to Dalarna you are going to go on your holiday

14
00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.369
So we drive.

15
00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.214
But the journey has not even started by the way.
 You should see what has happened so far.

16
00:01:24.194 --> 00:01:34.099
We left at 11 in the morning - it was Sunday by the way - and decided to go to Leksand.

17
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.033
To get to Leksand we have to go via Filipstad ...

18
00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:42.363
... and Vansbro.

19
00:01:43.477 --> 00:01:53.187
It's easy to find with the help of signs, but I also cheated and used GPS on the motorcycle.

20
00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:59.562
We stopped and fished at a resting place just before Vansbro…

21
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.429
Now it gets coffee

22
00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:13.018
… And continued to drive north, through Vansbro and towards Leksand.

23
00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:23.260
Amanda tested holding the camera against the asphalt and then we arrived at Leksand.

24
00:02:25.113 --> 00:02:30.275
If you come from the south, you go into Leksand over a powerful bridge.

25
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:40.117
If you turn right you get down on the quay where there is a restaurant right on the water, and to the left you see Lake Siljan.

26
00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.050
Nice it was here

27
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.093
Amazingly beautiful

28
00:02:53.359 --> 00:03:01.439
We ate at the restaurant Marinan and on the menu there were lots of different to choose from.

29
00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.745
I took burgers.
 Amanda took baked potatoes with shrimp.

30
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.788
Now we are going along Siljan.
 A lake called Siljan.

31
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.397
So that means we take a little detour now.
 But it is the detour that is the trip itself.

32
00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.524
Really.

33
00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:26.749
That's how it is

34
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:35.726
Here, along Siljan, it really starts to look like you think the valleys look.

35
00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:44.050
Open landscapes and red cottages, all painted in Falu red color.

36
00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:57.837
Here, just west of Rättvik, we would definitely have imagined to stay and live overnight, but we had even better plans.

37
00:03:57.837 --> 00:04:04.696
We were going further north, towards Furudal and Näsets Marcusgård.

38
00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:15.155
It was cozy to go on smaller and smaller roads, slower and slower.

39
00:04:15.155 --> 00:04:21.484
Further and further into the forest, until we finally arrived ...

40
00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:27.972
... and was met by this.

41
00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:59.887
Have you seen the story of the ring (Lord of the Rings) when Bilbo says he does not have time with brothers and sisters and relatives,

42
00:04:59.887 --> 00:05:01.566
And families ... he doesn't want any there.

43
00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:04.147
And then Gandalf comes ...

44
00:05:04.147 --> 00:05:06.292
Then Gandalf comes like this ...

45
00:05:06.876 --> 00:05:07.602
Now I'm Gandalf then.

46
00:05:07.602 --> 00:05:08.410
Okay.

47
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.479
How about an old friend

48
00:05:14.035 --> 00:05:15.427
And then he gets duck like this.

49
00:05:15.427 --> 00:05:16.503
Yes exactly.

50
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.650
And then he hits the head in the ceiling.

51
00:05:26.055 --> 00:05:41.513
Näsets Marcusgård is thus located in Furudal and is run by a very nice family who received us, showed around, made sure we had a good time and served breakfast in the morning.

52
00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:45.483
A very unique experience simply.

53
00:05:45.483 --> 00:05:57.162
In addition to our cabin, "Oddi's eye", there are, for example, the tree hut "Supermoon" which looks like this.

54
00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:01.260
It hangs in the tree up there as well.

55
00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:08.412
There will be some others who are going in here in a little while, so we don't go up and look, I think.

56
00:06:08.412 --> 00:06:08.928
No.

57
00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:10.000
We let them be at peace.

58
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.348
But you can also book and sleep in that one.

59
00:06:15.553 --> 00:06:19.377
Then we decided to go and swim,

60
00:06:20.194 --> 00:06:26.426
And I got to show my sick off-road skills on film.

61
00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:27.937
Fun for me.

62
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.580
Then we lit the grill.

63
00:07:19.228 --> 00:07:24.171
The bell pepper lay on the grill just as we did not see.

64
00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:33.899
Then it was evening.

65
00:07:36.237 --> 00:07:38.845
And it was night.

66
00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:47.859
And it was morning.

67
00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.758
And it was time to move on.

68
00:08:29.058 --> 00:08:40.811
We would be even deeper into the forest, towards a place called the pea sauce, and the residents of the residents.

69
00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:48.452
Here I started to get used to driving on gravel.

70
00:08:48.452 --> 00:08:57.140
I got better and better confidence and learned how the motorcycle reacts to different types of substrates.

71
00:08:58.071 --> 00:09:07.732
As the fastest, I drove at maybe 60 km/h, with Amanda on the motorcycle and full packing.

72
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:15.596
Finally we arrived and started wandering up the mountain, towards the residents of the residents.

73
00:09:23.108 --> 00:09:26.081
This sign is not that common.

74
00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:27.424
It's like:

75
00:09:27.837 --> 00:09:33.826
"Welcome in though, feel free to take responsibility so that our animals do not infect."

76
00:09:33.826 --> 00:09:37.188
That it is we who have that responsibility.

77
00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:40.128
Shall we not to close the gate

78
00:09:40.128 --> 00:09:41.277
So that all the cows throw out.

79
00:09:41.277 --> 00:09:42.328
Yes exactly.

80
00:09:42.328 --> 00:09:45.626
Suddenly we arrived at an electric fence.

81
00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:46.126
Okay...

82
00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:51.078
... and became unsure whether to go in or not.

83
00:09:51.078 --> 00:09:53.548
Is it just to go in or

84
00:09:53.548 --> 00:09:57.587
No, I don't really think so.
 Here they have set up electric fences ...

85
00:09:59.762 --> 00:10:04.608
... which means that you simply must not go in,

86
00:10:04.608 --> 00:10:07.029
But we could just, very easily, go down.

87
00:10:08.994 --> 00:10:10.994
Simsalabim.

88
00:10:10.994 --> 00:10:13.325
Now I have magically come across the other side.

89
00:10:13.325 --> 00:10:14.725
I do not know...

90
00:10:18.528 --> 00:10:20.260
Then we might as well continue

91
00:10:20.382 --> 00:10:21.685
A little more.

92
00:10:22.486 --> 00:10:24.486
We go up and check.

93
00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:31.070
Do you also think there may be some kind of bull

94
00:10:32.148 --> 00:10:34.148
Eeh ...

95
00:10:35.694 --> 00:10:38.959
So as in Pettson & amp;
 Findus, that you get chased then ...

96
00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:40.729
It would ...

97
00:10:41.914 --> 00:10:43.914
Yes, there is it then we are ...

98
00:10:44.707 --> 00:10:46.707
Then we are unlucky.

99
00:10:46.707 --> 00:10:49.070
But then we have to skip such a fence just.

100
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:52.001
So really, Amanda, so we have to do it.

101
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.569
Or we must simply drove the bull up.

102
00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:57.215
Just.

103
00:10:57.215 --> 00:10:58.819
Take the bull by the horns.

104
00:10:59.855 --> 00:11:01.344
Hoho

105
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:08.208
Still, someone has been able to build all these old houses.

106
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.154
Here we will see.
 Here we have some kind of sign.

107
00:11:13.819 --> 00:11:15.819
No smoking.

108
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.000
Here's someone.

109
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.548
After all, there are people.

110
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.238
Hello Hello

111
00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:24.105
A little one, yes.

112
00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:26.278
Well

113
00:11:27.032 --> 00:11:28.424
Are you here and work

114
00:11:28.424 --> 00:11:29.719
Yeah

115
00:11:29.719 --> 00:11:31.427
What a nice one was up here

116
00:11:31.427 --> 00:11:35.579
It is very nice atmosphere.

117
00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:38.181
The environment is so soothing.

118
00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:39.347
Yes indeed.

119
00:11:39.347 --> 00:11:39.847
I understand that

120
00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:42.771
Is there the opportunity to buy something to drink

121
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:43.903
Yeah

122
00:11:44.387 --> 00:11:45.365
What do we have then

123
00:11:45.562 --> 00:11:47.562
It's juice,

124
00:11:48.194 --> 00:11:48.937
coffee,

125
00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:50.000
tea,

126
00:11:50.195 --> 00:11:52.203
Coffee giant coffee.

127
00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:55.000
And then, spring water.

128
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.733
But you don't have to pay for that.
 You can get that anyway.

129
00:11:57.733 --> 00:12:01.147
Oh.
 But then we probably take each of the coffee and some spring water then

130
00:12:01.147 --> 00:12:02.644
It sounds very good.

131
00:12:02.644 --> 00:12:04.509
Really.
 God so tasty.

132
00:12:05.785 --> 00:12:07.256
What a nice place you.

133
00:12:07.256 --> 00:12:08.218
Yes, incredibly nice.

134
00:12:14.622 --> 00:12:20.000
If you want to take another walk then there is a lookout tower.

135
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.500
Yes

136
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.000
Do it

137
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.584
Yes.

138
00:12:22.247 --> 00:12:24.855
It may well be a ... 800 meters up.

139
00:12:24.855 --> 00:12:25.931
Yes

140
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:31.212
It is a little easier to go than it is here, because it is not so much cobblestone.
 But it's steep.

141
00:12:31.212 --> 00:12:32.045
Yes.

142
00:12:33.245 --> 00:12:40.304
And then it is a little narrow, steep staircase to get up.

143
00:12:40.304 --> 00:12:44.297
Up goes well, but I find it a little scary to go down.
 Then I usually back down.

144
00:12:44.297 --> 00:12:44.797
Mm.

145
00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:45.362
Right.

146
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.314
But, tremendously nice views.

147
00:12:48.314 --> 00:12:48.814
Yes.

148
00:12:48.814 --> 00:12:50.814
Where do you go through the other gate there?

149
00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:54.492
Yes, then you go straight through here and then straight up the hill.

150
00:12:55.384 --> 00:12:58.041
Then it is up a bit more then.

151
00:12:58.041 --> 00:12:59.294
A little more.

152
00:13:00.784 --> 00:13:03.270
Imagine if you were to be like this ... like a small child now.

153
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.342
"No, now I'm not going anymore. Now I can't cope anymore."

154
00:13:07.342 --> 00:13:07.842
Just.

155
00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:11.286
Then you are fucked.

156
00:13:11.286 --> 00:13:13.379
After all, no one will come here and save us immediately.

157
00:13:15.136 --> 00:13:17.136
I'll take you on your back Oskar.

158
00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.008
You have to go down and pick up the motorcycle and drive up here as well.

159
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:26.339
What did you say

160
00:13:26.565 --> 00:13:27.762
There it is.

161
00:13:27.762 --> 00:13:28.262
Well

162
00:13:29.422 --> 00:13:30.546
Nice

163
00:13:31.179 --> 00:13:32.133
Where you.

164
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.888
Okay.

165
00:14:02.888 --> 00:14:11.965
We have arrived at our final destination, and it is time to answer the question that started this entire video.

166
00:14:11.965 --> 00:14:16.738
Is it to Dalarna you are going to go on your holiday

167
00:14:17.428 --> 00:14:18.896
And the answer is ...

168
00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:21.200
Yes.

169
00:14:21.686 --> 00:14:23.323
Yes.
 We think so.

170
00:14:33.094 --> 00:14:41.235
Well.
 Now we will go home again.
 It may take maybe three and a half hours.

171
00:14:41.235 --> 00:14:48.614
We will go over everything we see here and good much more.

172
00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:58.612
But we ... we say ... We are at a kind of highlight, literally, in this movie and we say goodbye.

173
00:14:58.612 --> 00:15:00.451
Thank you so much for watching,

174
00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:09.663
And thank you to all the nice people who easily support Swedish with us at Patreon.

175
00:15:09.663 --> 00:15:13.004
It is thanks to you that we can do this.

176
00:15:14.161 --> 00:15:16.161
