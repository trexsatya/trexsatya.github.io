It is good to eat seaweed because it has been found to have an interesting nutritional profile.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:13.555
I.a. Has it carbohydrates of various kinds that can have unique self -saps that are good for humans.

3
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:18,542
From a sustainability perspective, it is also good how to grow pliers.

4
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:27.515
You do not need any fresh water, no fertilizers, no pesticides and no land surface.

5
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:33,818
Today we look at different types of pliers. We have brown seaweed, green pliers and red pliers.

6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,797
We at biotechnology develop different products that will reach consumers in our market.

7
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:44,648
But it is also important that consumers like what we develop.

8
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:50,532
With this project, we want to learn more about what consumers really want.

9
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:53,760
We think it is taken by that input today.

10
00:00:54,348 --> 00:01:00,434
When we have been done with the smell we go on the taste and then you can also assess the texture.

11
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:05.461
We want to develop products that can be ingredients in te.x. bread or pasta.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09.724
It could be supplements that you can bring with these nutrients.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,428
Or it may be in its entire form, but we know too little about today.
