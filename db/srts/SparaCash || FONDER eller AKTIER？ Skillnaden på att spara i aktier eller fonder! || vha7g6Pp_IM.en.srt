00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,664
Is it so that before you watch this video, it may well be that

With your address, I will send out the books to you

13
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
In today's video we will talk about

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
Equities or mutual funds, that is

15
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
What to choose

16
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
When you save

17
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
Should you buy

18
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
Shares or should you save in a fund?

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,400
And yes the biggest difference between stocks and mutual funds

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496
When you buy shares, you own indirectly

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
Part of a company

22
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
And if you buy a fund instead

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
Yes, but it is so that you get some of it

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
A bunch of different shares

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,016
Up to 20-50 different companies Maybe you get if it is the case that you invest in a fund

26
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,136
But if you buy a share, it is only the company that you invest in

27
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
If we think about just that statement

28
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
So maybe you understand that

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
There is a slightly higher risk that

30
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
invest in stocks

31
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
than it is to invest in mutual funds

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
When you invest and save your money

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
then you need to think about how much risk you are willing to take

34
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
By investing in shares, you take a very high risk

35
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,712
And when you invest in equity funds, there is also a high risk but not as high as if you had only bought 1 share

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
That is, if that company is doing badly (in which you bought shares)

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
then your entire investment goes to the pipe turn

38
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
But if you buy a fund instead

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
then you spread the risk

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Among different companies

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
You will receive at least 16 shares if you buy a fund

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
I usually say that

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,472
Equity suits you who are looking to take a little more risk who may want to

44
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
it should go up and down a little faster

45
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,408
Also you who want to spend some time analyzing different companies and see which ones are doing well and

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,680
You might be thinking that "this company will do well"

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,760
You like to speculate 
And you want to spend some extra time on your investments

48
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
You may find it fun to invest in stocks

49
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
You might find it fun to follow different companies

50
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,816
And like economics and everything in general

51
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Yes, but then maybe shares are something for you!

52
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
The catch of buying a fund instead of shares instead

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,264
You do not have as great a chance to make as much money

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
if you then buy a fund instead of shares

55
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,294
But a fund is perfect for you who do not have the strength to 
think about spreading the risk without

56
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Want someone else to take care of it for you instead

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
If you want to invest in stocks

58
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,386
Yes, but then maybe it's because you wanted a slightly higher return

59
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,160
For example, I buy shares because I think it's fun.

60
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,816
Not because I think I'm a professional or that I'm good at analyzing different companies but it's a bit like a hobby for me

61
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,400
I think it's quite fun to follow different companies, how it goes for them

62
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
And yes, then mine grows

63
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,032
Savings also over time if the company is doing well

64
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,339
If I find something that I think will go well. 
It's simply about speculation!

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
Instead, when buying a fund

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
This is how you hand over that responsibility

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,000
To the managers who manage the fund

68
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,822
Because you think they're better at finding good stocks than you are.

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,166
If you choose shares - Then you get the following benefits

70
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:45,024
You have the chance to make more money than mutual funds

71
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:49,835
It costs no annual fees or ongoing fees when you own shares

72
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,267
3. You completely decide which shares you want to invest in

73
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,637
When you buy funds, it may be a little difficult to think about

74
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
What shares are actually in this fund?

75
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,240
Because it's not something you can control

76
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,784
So if you want to invest morally or ethically or environmentally friendly or something else

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,459
Then you can not choose it in a fund

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,263
There are various funds that have such classifications

79
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
But

80
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,794
It is actually the fund manager who chooses 
what should be in the fund and not you

81
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,716
But when you buy shares then you can control this all by yourself!

82
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
Disadvantages of shares

83
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,329
Yes, but it is that you have a higher risk than funds

84
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
Also swings quite a bit up and down

85
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
So it's you are not. comfortable with

86
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,359
It might go down 10% in one day

87
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,805
Yes, but then maybe you should have a fund instead.

88
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,104
When you buy a fund, then 
you hand over the responsibility to the fund manager.

89
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,691
To control and set and decide which shares are to be in this fund.

90
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,232
Funds may be for you 
who want to spend a little less time on your savings

91
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,559
And only have an automatic saving where someone else takes care of you

92
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
You may not feel like sitting down and choosing different stocks

93
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,557
And then maybe funds are better suited for you

94
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
A typical stock investor

95
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,225
Yes, it usually sits on needles and often checks how the savings go every day

96
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Myself, I'm one who invests in stocks

97
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,551
But I think it's fun! 
I like to follow the stock market and keep track of how investments go up and down

98
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:15,777
I have no problem if it goes down quite a lot in one day.

99
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:20,480
I think it's quite fun to follow 
how my shares are doing

100
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,327
But you absolutely do not have to choose either or

101
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,239
Without you can have both shares and funds in your savings.

102
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
I myself have both

103
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,067
I have about 80% shares and I have 20% equity funds

104
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,322
There is no fixed rule with the 80/20 principle

105
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:44,436
I just think it's nice to keep it at a roughly

106
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,599
If it is the case that my shares are doing badly, then hopefully my funds will do better.

107
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
The vast majority of them probably make more money

108
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
on investing only in funds other than equities

109
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,583
It is very rare that you see that

110
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
People beat the index (the stock market)

111
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
You need to be good at picking good stocks

112
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
If you want to be able to beat the index

113
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
It takes quite a lot of luck at least over the long term

114
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
In the short term in a year

115
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
So there Yes but then maybe it is the case that you beat the index, but in the long run it is very rare to do so

116
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,015
In fact, the vast majority benefit from choosing a free fund

117
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
In other words, an index fund with a very low fee

118
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
They show over time that they give quite well

119
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
But if you're like that

120
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,815
Do you like to keep on tinkering and investing yourself and find different stocks and companies

121
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Yes, but then maybe it's so

122
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
You should invest in shares with

123
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,006
You absolutely do not have to choose

124
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,601
Without it, it is possible to actually invest in both shares and funds.

125
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,551
If it is the case that you are new to investing and you have neither invested in equities nor mutual funds.

126
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
Yes, but then I think you should start with a fund at least

127
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,610
Funds do not fluctuate as much as equities do

128
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
And it's pretty easy to get started and

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,634
Just put a hundred bucks in a fund at no cost.

130
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,320
So there is no purchase fee and no sales fee on funds.

131
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,936
On shares, on the other hand, you must pay a fixed fee. 
A purchase fee and a sales fee

132
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,342
which is called brokerage while on funds it is an ongoing fee

133
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,246
an annual management fee that is deducted from your investments

134
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
But there are free funds out there that you can use that you can start with if you are a beginner and want to start saving.

135
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:19,539
But then maybe it fits well with a free fund

136
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
To sum it all up

137
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,183
Choose what you think is most convenient to invest in

138
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:29,023
If you like a little higher risks but then maybe you should invest in stocks

139
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,344
But if it is the case that you want to spend as little time as possible

140
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,748
Then it might be better to invest in mutual funds.

141
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
If you want as low fees as

142
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,644
Choose some free index funds

143
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
If you want a little better control and

144
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
Want to invest in funds that

145
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,247
fluctuates a lot and has a higher risk and higher chance of making money

146
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,832
Look at active equity funds then instead

147
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Maybe it suits you better

148
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
And then when you have learned

149
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,511
Yes, but then maybe you can go in and test and buy some shares

150
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
It's entirely up to you - feel for yourself

151
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
But dare to invest - That is the main factor!

152
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,447
Dare to open a savings and just start investing for

153
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
With time, you will learn more.

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,335
I hope you have gotten a little more meat on your bones and regarding the issue of stocks or mutual funds.

155
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,223
Thank you so much for watching, if you give me a thumbs up I understand that you like this video and I hope to see you in the next video!

156
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Hello!
