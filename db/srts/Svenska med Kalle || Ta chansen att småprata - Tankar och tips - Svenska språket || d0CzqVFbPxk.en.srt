00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02.880
Hello Hello

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05.560
Here's a little tip

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,100
As I think I have given before

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,140
But repetition is everything's mother (wrong: repetition is all the mother of knowledge :- D)

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,640
As one usually says

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,440
Repetition is the key to learning

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,000
So I take the risk of repeating myself

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
and I think about this with talking

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,960
and get the chance to work out

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,840
to talk in everyday life

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
so

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,440
I think of such situations

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,060
When you meet a person

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,300
At school, perhaps at work

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,140
Maybe on

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,820
The Language CafÃ©

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,800
Where you now get a chance to meet people who speak Swedish

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
and so we ask things like

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,400
Hello, how is the situation

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,140
How's the school going?

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,280
How's the new job going?

22
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,700
What happens nowadays?

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,780
Is it good with you?

24
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58.620
such things

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,800
and then it is very tempting

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,340
to answer briefly

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05.980
You just like to: Yes, it's good / Yes, it's going well

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,520
nothing special

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,180
But then you actually miss a chance to

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,240
talk a little more and get a little conversation

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,940
and very often when

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
When I meet maybe my work mates

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Although we see you every day

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,820
or

35
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,140
can be friends i meet frequently

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
It doesn't matter if someone asks

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,360
How about you or

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,960
how was your weekend?

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,200
such things

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
then it often becomes a small story

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39.060
from me or the other person to

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,780
If you say, yes it goes well

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,600
I have had a great weekend

44
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,580
We were home and spent time with family

45
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,420
blah blah blah blah blakaa or

46
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,120
If I ask someone: How's the new job going

47
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
Then they tell you a little about that job

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
what new colleagues they have

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59.960
What they do. If there is any difference from the old.

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,340
Maybe something that is a bit difficult or hard

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05.620
or something funny that has happened

52
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
This is simply the tip.

53
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,800
That such simple questions as "How is the situation?"

54
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
How's it going with ...?

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,200
It is an invitation to tell a little more

56
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
So take that chance if you notice that

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,940
The person is relaxed and not just say ....

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Hello and then want to run on

59
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,380
But if it is a slightly calmer situation

60
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,400
so try to be prepared to tell you something

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,560
So for example

62
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,780
If you recently have

63
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
started a new job

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
or received an internship

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,180
And someone asks

66
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,780
how is it going or how is it or so

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
so have some sentences finished

68
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
such as the Dukkan use and tell us about

69
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,300
about the practice or job

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
and so on

71
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
So, I think it's

72
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,740
It can help you build up some such everyday phrases

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01.420
that then can do that when you can

74
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,220
can you take some more steps

75
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06.080
and tell me a little more and find new sentences

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,100
But that everyday spray is very important

77
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,380
This is how we get to know each other

78
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,340
When someone tells something

79
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,540
and so maybe the person reacts to it or

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
will think about

81
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,940
job they have had before

82
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
or will think of a person they feel

83
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
it may be so little that makes

84
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,960
As we say in Swedish

85
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,900
The ball comes in rolling

86
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,240
thus that something begins and continues

87
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,140
It won't just stop

88
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,120
so

89
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,360
bun on a little story about your day

90
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,020
about your new job, about how it is going to school

91
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,900
and the chance is great

92
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,160
that you will get some more fun and longer calls

93
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,800
in Swedish

94
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
ehm, yes, it was

95
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,180
Please write and

96
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57.840
Tell us what you think about this

97
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,000
What calls do you have in everyday life?

98
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
When do you get the chance to talk a little

99
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
About different things in Swedish

100
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
or in Swedish anyway

101
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,400
Write and tell us and so we'll see you again soon
