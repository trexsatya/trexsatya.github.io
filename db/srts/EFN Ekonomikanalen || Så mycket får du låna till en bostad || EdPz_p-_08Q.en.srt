1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07.600
You must have 15 % of the value of the home as a cash contribution.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,480
This means that you can borrow 85 % of the value of the home.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,440
The higher the cash contribution you have, the better you get.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,160
For example, lower interest rates and amortization.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,200
This is how it is.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29.640
Generally, you can borrow 5 to 6 times your gross income.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,160
Your annual gross income.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,880
But the banks look at both your credit rating and your ability to pay-

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,600
-When they will decide how large a loan you can get.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,320
To find out your credit rating, the banks take a credit report.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
You usually call it a UC.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,400
There they look at your income, if you have other debts-

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,720
-And if you have any payment notes at Kronofogden.

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,280
You can have a co -borrower for your mortgage if possible.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,520
If you have other loans and credits you can collect them for a loan.

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
Then you often get a better credit rating.

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,240
If you can, avoid getting many credit information taken on you.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,760
It can adversely affect your credit rating.
