00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,400
There are strategies that you can use
before, during and after you read texts.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,480
Here are some strategies you can use
while you read.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,920
First of all,
turn off everything distracting.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:28,040
If it's hard to get started, or to keep
focus, follow the text with a pen-

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,760
-or place a ruler below the line.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,880
Skim past slow bits rather than
stop reading completely.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,680
Set a timer and read in short spells
with breaks in between.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,560
Start with five minutes
and extend them as you go.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,080
Another good strategy
is to divide the text in shorter sections.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,440
Read one section carefully
and then take a break.

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,160
That way the brain can process
a smaller amount of information.

12
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,720
While reading,
it's important to ask yourself questions.

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,440
What did I just read? What is
most important in this paragraph?

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,840
How is it connected
to what I read before?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,280
Formulate the text in your own words
to understand it better.

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Be patient when you read. Becoming
a good reader takes practise.
