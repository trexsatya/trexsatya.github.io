1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08.040
Sweden's history between the 16th and 19th centuries is divided into four eras.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,240
This is the third - the time of freedom.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,760
During the time of freedom, one goes from a system where the king determines-

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,120
-To a system where more people can participate, and more and more people want to participate.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,400
During the time of freedom, Sweden takes a few stacked steps towards democracy.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,640
It is usually counted from Karl XII's death to Gustav III's coup.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,480
What happened during the time of freedom?

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,440
What was it like to live during the 18th century when more people get something to say about?

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59.640
To understand the time of freedom, we must understand what it was like before it started.

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,120
The first decades of the 18th century, the last part of the Great Power Time ...

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,680
There are few occasions when it has been worse to live in Sweden.

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,280
During the great power, Sweden grew, but now most is lost.

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:25,160
The country is poor, and a large part of the population has died in war.

14
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Karl XII has been shot in Norway.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,640
He could not get married and have some children who could inherit the throne.

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,160
It has been plague and famine.

17
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,120
Ever since the Middle Ages, Sweden has been ruled by powerful kings

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
-But now many want a change.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,480
Weaving war after war does not maintain the country.

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,080
Time for New Times. And how do you get it with a new form of government?

21
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02.920
The time of freedom begins with the new form of government in January 1719.

22
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07.360
Karl XII died just two months before.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,360
It was planned for this, so when the king dies, the plans are put into action.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,320
A form of government is more exciting than it sounds, because the balance of power changes.

25
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,160
The monarchy is abolished and Sweden will now be governed by the Council and the Riksdag.

26
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,720
But was there no royal descendant that protested?

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,960
When Karl XII died, there were two options:

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
Ulrika Eleonora and Karl Fredrik.

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,720
The succession question was not decided-

30
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47.840
-So it was now about which player would be the fastest on the ball.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,640
The fastest is the acid Ulrika Eleonora.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,000
Although she did not want to rule with limited power.

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00.440
The National Council persuades her that it looks better out-

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,320
-If Parliament chooses her.

35
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,000
Then there will be no trouble about the throne.

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,920
Ulrika Eleonora agrees to this, but the first parliament says is:

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,920
We must have a new form of government that she has to relate to.

38
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,280
She is in a form of hostage situation and can only accept it.

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,200
We still have her copy of the form of government with notes.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,000
She never accepted this reconciled position.

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,160
But despite the queen's sour notes, the time of freedom can begin.

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,120
During the time of freedom, we did not say "now we live in the time of freedom".

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,520
On the other hand, it was said that you lived in the freest constitution.

44
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57.880
People were satisfied and said it could not have been better written by angels.

45
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,480
It was illegal to talk badly about the new form of government.

46
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,480
It is now super-famous Voltaire describes Sweden, little Sweden-

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,440
-like the freest country in the world.

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,920
The one who stood back for the country to be free - Ulrika Eleonora-

49
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,880
-Sit only one year on the throne.

50
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,200
Next to him, the queen has a man, her husband, Fredrik of Essen.

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Here, they both keep on the helm as a parable of controlling Sweden.

52
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:40,320
After all, Fredriks and Ulrika Eleonora's plan was that they would cooperate.

53
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,360
However, this does not agree with this, and the Queen chooses to abdicate.

54
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,960
Fredrik becomes Fredrik I.

55
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,200
It is during his reign that royal name stamps are introduced.

56
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,960
There are stamps with the king's signature.

57
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02.720
Documents can be signed by the king without being present.

58
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08.560
The stamp has sometimes been seen as a metaphor for the entire freedom time.

59
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,960
The stamps are highlighted as symbols of how weak royal power has been.

60
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,400
But you needed the king's signature.

61
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,480
We say the kings were weak and powerless at that time.

62
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,080
But we compare with previous kings.

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,400
It is undoubtedly that they are the most powerful politicians at that time.

64
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,520
This is another of the most powerful politicians - Arvid Horn.

65
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,320
He is the office president-

66
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,120
-And leads the work of the Council, the government of the time, which now governs the country.

67
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,280
He wanted the kingdom to be restored.

68
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59.840
Without war, one would rebuild the kingdom and gain financial stability.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,320
Sweden is starting to be led as a more democratic country.

70
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09.160
Two political groups are emerging after headgear.

71
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:16,840
The hats and hats were the origin of what then becomes parties.

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,520
You can see them as two networks that mobilized for different polls.

73
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,520
Who was a bit unclear.

74
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,040
-How do the dawn democracy look like? -Riksdag was a state of the stand.

75
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,120
So it was priests, citizens, farmers and nobility who had their own parliament.

76
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,640
Every stand has a vote, but it's not so democratic.

77
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,400
Many belong to no stand-

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,080
-And the stands represent different part of the population.

79
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,920
Each stand had its own room.

80
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00.720
Delegations of noblemen went to the priests and shared them their decisions.

81
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06.720
"Thanks so much," says the priests, and then they do the same in turn.

82
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,360
But outside these premises, people often stood waiting.

83
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,040
Where the farmer met, there was a staircase that was often full of people.

84
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,760
They stood listening to the decisions that were made.

85
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,880
The 18th century day is quite messy. People are loud and sometimes unsuccessful.

86
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Parliamentary representatives receive no salary, but may support themselves elsewhere.

87
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,360
Corruption was quite common.

88
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,320
That you received bribes or that you embezzled money from the Treasury.

89
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,040
It is easy to keep track of who is who in the Swedish position society.

90
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,920
They sit in different buildings.

91
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,040
But outside it becomes increasingly trickier.

92
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,120
It was important for everyone how to stand in the social hierarchy.

93
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
If you are out walking in any city in the country-

94
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08.880
-Is it important to be able to read if you or someone else should step away.

95
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,720
Is based on the social hierarchy of society in that you were born in a certain stance-

96
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,040
-If it is possible to read which it is.

97
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,960
But also what position you have within that position. Preferably on hold.

98
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,880
During the time of freedom, it becomes more difficult as people start to be able to buy new things.

99
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,880
Some groups begin to make more money and the availability of cheap goods is increasing.

100
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,720
For example, cotton fabrics with prints that look fine without being expensive.

101
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,680
It is perceived as something problematic that can turn to the social order.

102
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,680
It is seen as dangerous that the lower stands dress like something they are not.

103
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00.800
In order not to be chaos, the social hierarchy must be regulated by law.

104
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04.600
It will be abundance regulations-

105
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,760
-which regulates who is allowed to use what types of goods.

106
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,120
To keep on the hierarchies, but also to promote Swedish goods.

107
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,280
If you are born in the peasantry, you must not by law carry silk.

108
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,640
People can be mistaken for your stand.

109
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,680
Citizens can be fined if they carry a guard. Only the nobility must do that.

110
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,840
You are not allowed to dress over your stand.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,240
Those who are at the bottom of the hierarchy come to trial for such crimes.

112
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Especially maids. And the fine is soaring.

113
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,800
Social mobility does not exist in the Swedish Sweden's Sweden-

114
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,480
-But the country has begun to scratch from the chaos in the early 18th century.

115
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,440
Sweden has a popular form of government, a dawn democracy

116
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,160
-And has not been fought for a long time.

117
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,200
Surely that is the top? No, the hats dream of revenge in Russia.

118
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,880
The lead leader Arvid Horn is dismissed, and Sweden is attacking Russia.

119
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,960
Now the country will be restored, but it will be a real failure.

120
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29.560
The war lasts for two years, Sweden wins nothing, and Russia takes Finland.

121
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,880
To get it back, Sweden must agree on concessions.

122
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,640
At this time, Ulrika Eleonora has died childless.

123
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,080
Sweden had no follower.

124
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,880
The Russian Empress said that if one chose her relative Adolf Fredrik-

125
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,320
-Ad it improve the terms of peace.

126
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00.800
Russia wants an ally on the throne. It annoys the valley farmers.

127
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:07,320
They start carpentry together things that are not only used for agriculture.

128
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,080
Here we have a nail club - a fairly simple weapon.

129
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,400
But it is, nonetheless, deadly.

130
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,920
The special thing about the weapon is that it is probably one of the 1084 bar weapons-

131
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:29,400
-Whith was seized from Dalalmogen when they traveled down to Stockholm-

132
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,560
-In what is called the Great Dald dance.

133
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,800
During the time of freedom, as it should be possible for the votes of the people to hear-

134
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,520
-SKs the Great Daldans, also called the Dalreworking, 1743.

135
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,920
Fifth-thousand ripped down guards wander to the capital-

136
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,360
-To "jerk the wig" by the gentlemen in Stockholm.

137
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,640
They are upset over the expensive, unnecessary war, trade restrictions-

138
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02.800
-And Russia's involvement in the choice of throne followers.

139
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,080
They train all the way to Stockholm.

140
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,440
But it will mostly be a tumult

141
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,600
-White ends with dead fellows and over 3,000 captured rebellioners.

142
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,520
When Fredrik dies, Adolf takes over Fredrik the throne, to the dismay of the Dalkarls.

143
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,840
The king's wife is called Lovisa Ulrika.

144
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,200
That she was something to count on synthesis early.

145
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,080
Here is a small gold box.

146
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,000
If you open it, you can see an object that looks like a weight paper.

147
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,760
It is Lovisa Ulrika's fetal membrane, that is, victory hood as it is called.

148
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,240
Previously, it was considered a sign of future happiness.

149
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:01,160
It was thought that the princess could carry this as a bracelet.

150
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07.560
Sweden's "Power Couple" is not satisfied with its back position.

151
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,080
In order to strengthen their power, they decide to implement a coup d'état.

152
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,520
The coup attempt was not well thought out.

153
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,120
The king gets sick, and the whole thing is revealed early.

154
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:29,160
They arrest the insurgents, and they are executed before the eyes of the royal couple.

155
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,520
Lovisa Ulrika's foster membrane did not work as a happiness amulet at that time.

156
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,240
Sweden is at the forefront when it comes to art, culture and science.

157
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,040
A science academy is formed, and an early industrialization occurs.

158
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,080
Sweden hooks on the colonization trends that exist among the countries in Europe.

159
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,760
Through the East India Company we get a trading route all the way to China.

160
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,120
Life for ordinary people is slowly improving.

161
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08.560
For example, parishes begin to take care of their poor.

162
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,520
But on a level it does not happen much.

163
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,320
People are quite free, at least when it comes to religion.

164
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,320
Religion is central to people's lives.

165
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,120
It is the one that explains and legitimizes the entire position society.

166
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,640
Now a house interview, a kind of religious hearing, is held by the priest.

167
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,120
When it comes to house interviews, they have several functions.

168
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,800
The church is a propaganda apparatus through which the state can get its message out.

169
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,960
The second is like the gossip center.

170
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,960
The church keeps track of who people lie with, are married to and have children with.

171
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,280
The third function is like school. At a house interview, a priest goes home to people.

172
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05.800
You interrogate the family and the service people in Luther's little catechism.

173
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09.320
You should know what is right and wrong.

174
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,480
This leads to people becoming more literate than in many other places.

175
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,880
Then it is fun if people can read what they want.

176
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,040
They know when Sweden introduces the world's first freedom of the press.

177
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:32,840
The Freedom of Pressure Regulation comes in 1766, and what you must not write about is:

178
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,280
One must not criticize the royal power, the religion or the form of government.

179
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,520
Otherwise, you have to debate and write anything.

180
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,840
It is extensively debated. The hats and hats are often on a collision course.

181
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,240
The notifications of election fraud are many.

182
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,720
In the midst of all this, Adolf Fredrik dies.

183
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,640
It has often been claimed that he ate to death on bran.

184
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,480
The meal consisted of, among other things, bran, which was a kind of wheat bread.

185
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,880
But he ate too much and had a heart attack.

186
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,160
It had nothing to do with the bran.

187
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,560
Adolf Fredrik's son Gustav III crowned.

188
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,200
He is the first heir to the throne born in Sweden for a long time.

189
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,720
His father and Fredrik I came to Sweden as adults.

190
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,920
Gustav III tries to create order in the Swedish Parliament-

191
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,840
-But now the election fraud beats the ceiling.

192
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,560
In the election 1771, then we arrive at the last parliamentary period of freedom

193
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,200
-Had it was hard to agree on who would be allowed to vote in the presidential election.

194
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,720
In the bourgeoisie, this speech valet-

195
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,800
-So pass that there was a blood white.

196
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,640
They were struck at the ballot box about who would stop in banknotes and not.

197
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,120
Corruption, electoral fraud and fights inside the Riksdag.

198
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,320
In this chaos, Gustav III sees an opportunity to take back power.

199
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,560
He plans a coup d'état, and he doesn't get sick as his father.

200
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,480
The coup is also better planned.

201
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,240
In August 1772 he succeeds with the help of officers locking in government-

202
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,200
-And force them to agree to a new form of government that gives the king power.

203
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,680
Gustav III's coup effectively ends the time of freedom.

204
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,920
We are back where we started, with a strong royal power and a weak parliament.

205
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,320
You have seen in different ways in freedom.

206
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,880
It is either the freest period Sweden had.

207
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:07.880
Others say this was the most corrupt time in Swedish history.

208
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:14,640
This is also Finland's history, since the country was then part of the kingdom.

209
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,680
Several hundred years later, in 1936, Finland praises a person from the time of freedom.

210
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,640
A politician who was born in Finland.

211
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,480
Finland was now free from Russia-

212
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,920
-and there was wear and tear between citizens and communists-

213
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
-S and a constant threat from Russia.

214
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,160
Here is a Finnish stamp where you have portrayed Arvid Horn.

215
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,920
To choose this compromise, peace-loving Arvid Horn-

216
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,960
— on the stamp

217
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,200
-Is both to point out that we should be able to agree in the country-

218
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,360
-But also to go back to the fact that we have been part of Sweden.

219
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,680
We may be able to get support in Sweden if Russia will attack us.

220
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,560
Which they do three years later.

221
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Although Gustav III turns back very-

222
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,360
-There is something that is gaining momentum that exists today - democracy.

223
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,720
Even though few were allowed to vote, that the election fraud has never been so great-

224
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,240
-and that people were locked up in a predetermined stance-

225
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,640
-found an ambition to let the people decide.

226
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,280
We not only see that more people are allowed to join, but that more people want to join.

227
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,360
There you see that it is a movement that is starting to move forward.

228
