1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today I will teach you how to easily build your own fund portfolio.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,600
So you have something to brag about on your tinder date.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
*Slurp*

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,720
What you will learn today, it is not rocket science.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,300
You don't have to be a brain surgeon or hot Einstein by last name to understand these things.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,120
Saving in funds is very basic, it's something I learned when I was 19 years old.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,220
So don't be afraid to learn how to save in funds.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
It is not that difficult!

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,320
Don't make it more difficult than it is.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,840
So, get yourself a cup of coffee and then we'll get started!

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,360
For you who are new here my name is Marcus, and I run the site SparaCash.se

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:57,120
SparaCash is for beginners and wants to learn how to invest and save money in shares, mutual funds and much more.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,040
If you want to learn more, I have lots of simple guides for beginners

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,180
So go in there and see if there is something to suit your taste

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,120
If you want to learn something more that I have not talked about or written about, feel free to tell about it!

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,480
What is a Fund?

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,160
A fund is like a bag

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,760
A bag of securities simply.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,560
It could be shares, interest rates, bonds and other things.

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,040
The reason you invest in a fund

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,740
Is for you to avoid having to package your own stock portfolio

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,820
There is a trustee who manages the fund.

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,660
The fund manager decides what should be in the fund and packages it a little like a good and mixed bag.

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,660
It's a little bit so it works when you invest in mutual funds.

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,500
There is another person who picks up a bag for you and you buy a small piece of the bag.

26
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Then you get the harvest of the good inside the bag.

27
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,360
What is so great about mutual funds is that you can save monthly in them

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
You can save monthly in funds with a very small amount

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,720
Some funds require as little as SEK 1 for you to invest in them

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,140
But with shares you need to have the sum that the share costs

31
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,420
Most funds usually require SEK 100 to 200 in the minimum purchase amount

32
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,100
if you automatically save monthly in the fund, it is usually a lower amount than that.

33
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,060
Some funds, as mentioned, require as little as 1 kroner even.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,420
It doesn't take much to invest in mutual funds

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,540
So every month you get a salary, you put a small amount of money directly into your various funds

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,500
For example, I save in 8 different funds right now.

37
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,720
I change my funds once a quarter to once every six months

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,020
I see that one fund is going a bit bad and another fund is going a little better

39
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,720
then I will exchange the worse for the better fund!

40
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
It's no harder than that;)

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Funds have a level of risk

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,460
At the risk level, you can see how much money you can expect to make

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,680
The higher the risk, the higher the chance that you will make more money from investing in the fund

44
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,480
Very many out there have low risk funds

45
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,660
These low-risk funds are usually fixed income funds.

46
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,780
You may know that we have a fairly low interest rate today in Sweden?

47
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,100
So, it's not so good to have these short-term mutual funds and fixed income funds overall.

48
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,940
Because you don't get much in return on them.

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,400
And if it is also a charge on the fund, it may be that you go back on your investment in the fixed income fund.

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,440
This is swedbank's most popular fixed income fund in February 2020.

51
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,400
So as you look at 3 years it has thus given you -0.54%

52
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,180
And in 5 years it has given you -0.77%

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,360
I really don't understand how people can have stuff like this in their portfolios

54
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,500
Is it that you have fixed income funds or know someone who has it?

55
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Then consider switching them to a savings account with a higher interest rate or similar

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,040
When I choose funds, I personally am not a big fan of low-fee funds.

57
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,380
I like active funds.

58
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,560
That's because I'm an active investor, I like to exchange my funds on and off.

59
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,500
If you are a passive investor then index funds may be better for you.

60
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,060
Index funds have become a bit like a sect, that one should chase low fees.

61
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,360
The truth is not really what people say

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:04,140
If you pull out the savings horizon of 30-40-50 years then the fees play a role, it does.

63
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,160
But in the shorter term, 3-5 years, it is seen that active funds beat passive index funds.

64
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,240
I like them, I'd rather have a little more return and pay for it with a fee.

65
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Then of course you have to have common sense

66
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,820
A fund that costs over 2% may not be reasonable

67
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,860
When you look at the returns in these graphs, the fee is deducted

68
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,260
So keep that in mind when you look at history through historical returns in funds, that fees are always deducted.

69
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,040
Which funds are good for a beginner?

70
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,520
It is definitely best for you if you do not have a savings already

71
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:58,380
The easiest gateway to start and learn more about funds and shares

72
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,740
It is to buy the free funds available

73
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,960
Avanza Zero, and Nordnet Index Fund Sweden.

74
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,600
What is so great about these funds is that they are completely free, it costs nothing for you.

75
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,980
It costs nothing to buy and it does not cost anything running either.

76
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,900
So these two funds are perfect for those who want to get started

77
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,780
My tip for you who are a beginner to those who want to get started and save in one of these free funds

78
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,760
Put in $ 100 in each of these two free funds

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,260
Then you test and see if anything happens to your hundred notes

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,680
Then you can follow these two funds and you can compare them against each other

81
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,340
What is the difference between these two funds and what makes them go up and what makes them go down?

82
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,180
These two funds are the Swedish funds, so they follow Swedish equities

83
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,300
so you don't have to choose your own shares to invest in

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,120
So it's perfect for you who are a beginner to get started with

85
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,580
These funds follow an index and so-called passive index funds

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Passive index funds are something that many people like because they have very low fees

87
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,000
The fees give you more money in your pocket in the long run

88
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,080
So over time, the money will go to you and not to the bank

89
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,460
That's what's great about these free funds.

90
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,140
Which funds should you NOT buy if you are a beginner?

91
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,680
You should not buy any high risk funds that you have no control over.

92
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,780
Do an analysis first.

93
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,100
Do not enter, for example, the Growth Country Fund

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,620
like when I was little

95
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,700
so my mom bought Russian funds for me without even knowing

96
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,100
without knowing the effect of it

97
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,200
and investing in Russia can be crap, though

98
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,860
You have to know what it has for effects

99
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
and in this case it was very high risk

100
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,400
and that was when Russia was on a peak

101
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,580
then the fund went down

102
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,780
then someone chose to sell my Russia funds ...

103
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:20,880
this is a tip for you, choose a slightly wider fund from the beginning if you are new

104
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,020
then when you start to get a little more comfortable with saving in funds

105
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,320
then you might be able to pick out the slightly more generous funds

106
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,360
when you can a little more and have a little more meat on the legs simply

107
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
- so choose a wider fund first.

108
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,080
So now I've gone through a lot of basic stuff for you beginners.

109
