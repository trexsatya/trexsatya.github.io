1
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.440
To scratch, either to sharpen their claws or to highlight their territory,

2
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.320
is perfectly normal behavior for a cat.

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.240
But sometimes it can also be a sign of anxiety and anxiety,

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.200
and happen where we do not wish,

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
Most often on vertical surfaces such as door frames and furniture.

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.000
Feliway optimum with the brand new generation pheromones

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.800
reduces the cat's concern and counteracts the cat scratching where you don't want

8
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.200
Clean the place where the cat scratches as quickly as possible

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.080
And get a stable claw tree for your cat.

10
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.560
It is important that the claw tree is placed near where the cat sleeps.

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.640
Cat parents who used feliway optimum

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.200
Noticed that the cat claw less already after 7 days.

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.520
Always use for at least one month.

14
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.200
Feliway Optimum provides more security than ever

15
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.880
And causes the cat to stop scratching furniture.
