1
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,520
We're a gang of guys called Brooklyn Choppers
and we are playing with big toys.

2
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,060
You should visit Peter, 
He has plenty of strange stuff so it's worth a visit.

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,460
-Hello, I'm Douglas.
Hi, Peter.

4
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,900
-There were a lot of things here.

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,000
Do you think?
I can agree it's a bit crowded.

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,140
-But a lot of fun stuff.

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,260
Yes, that's true.
However, my wife don't agree.

8
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,035
-What's that?

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,100
It's basically a Harley engine and a frame in titanium 
so it should be light and two pulsejet engines.

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,780
The same type of pulsejet engines as Hitler's V missiles
during WW II but these are downscaled.

11
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,580
-Where do you get such an idea?

12
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,080
There is a lot of info on internet but...

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,220
...there are a couple of guys who 
call themselves Svarthåleracing.

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,660
They drive with a huge pulsejet snowmobile at
Speed ​​weekend in Årsunda every winter.

15
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,720
Those guys inspired me to
build my own pulsejet engines.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,800
-Do you ride this bike?

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,400
Haven't used it this summer 
due to the petrol tank burst.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,720
It just can't run it daily because
it consumes about 8 liters of petrol per minute.

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,700
I will not go far.
-Haha, I understand it costs a plenty to drive.

20
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,700
-There are big exhaust pipes.

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, those who have been standing behind it
can testify to how bad it sounds.

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,260
The noise is over 180 db and it's unbearable.
It's not possible to stand there even with ear protection.

23
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,740
I'll get it fix for next summer.

24
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,580
However, it's a potent Harley engine to have as pull bike.
I've been thinking about maybe dismantle it.

25
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,020
Then I can use the pulsejet engine for something else.
But I haven't decided yet.

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,620
It's pretty complicated, It have to be
at least 2 persons to start it.

27
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,120
Then it's a little bit dangerous.

28
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,800
It's 4 high pressure petrol pumps
which can flow 230 liters each.

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,520
But if any fuel line would break, it will be disaster.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,880
I was lucky when the tank burst.
The high pressure pumps is under the petrol tank.

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,860
Had it splashed petrol on glowing
pipes could have become a huge fireball.

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,860
The temperature increases about 100 degrees per sec.
And when it starts, you have to go straight away.

33
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,500
The pulsejet engine can run at 
maximum 10-15 seconds.

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,020
I have protective heating plates 
but I can't sit as wider than I do.

35
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,780
The heating plates is so close
to the pipes so they gets too hot.

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,580
When you stop driving, you have to
move your feet from the footsteps.

37
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,640
Otherwise, the heat goes through the leather pants.

38
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,100
You also have a bicycle that is a bit special.
This one?

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,580
Yes it has a smaller pulsejet engine 
than the motorcycle.

40
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,960
It has a top speed around 20-22 mph.

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
It's fun to ride.

42
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,020
-Haha, lovely exhaust.

43
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,440
It's a classic 70's bicycle.

44
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,900
Yes, an old boy bike.

45
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,700
-How often do you use it?
Only special occasions.

46
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,580
What's the fuel consumption?

47
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,920
Not that much since it's smaller.

48
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,000
You can ride about 2 minutes on 2 liters of petrol.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,060
This is the economic vehicle.
It sounds bad and doesn't go that fast.

50
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,560
-What are you in there?
I have a jet grill.

51
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,540
It is probably Sweden's fastest grill.

52
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,620
This is how it looks like.

53
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,735
Attach it into a suitable surface.

54
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,020
It takes about 30 seconds until it is red.

55
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,560
After a minute it is white.

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,160
Then you have to spin the sausage quickly.

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,340
Then sausage it's done.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,940
We tried to grill marshmallows
but it got really bad.

59
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,520
They all started burning.
We noticed that sugar burns well.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,540
If you want a fast grill, this is the one you should have.

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,920
It is environmentally friendly and runs on liquid-gas.
That is probably the only advantage.

62
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,420
-You are obsessed with jet engines.
Yes, they sounds funny and they are fast.

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,760
-How often do you use the grill?
That's when the whole Brooklyn gang is out on events.

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,980
This is fast food, for real!

65
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,760
The surface gets burned first then the sausage 
must remain on the grill to be finished inside.

66
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,040
I wouldn't grill pork on it.

67
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,500
Should we go into the second room?
-Do you have more things?

68
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,060
I have a coffee maker.
-a coffee maker?

69
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,760
In this you make 30 cups of coffee in 3 minutes.

70
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,160
-Haha, a jet coffee maker.

71
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,780
This also sounds great even when it is so small.

72
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,220
This coffee maker you see that...

73
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,400
...this is the body and this jet engine.

74
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,520
Simple!

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,020
Our gang eat and drink coffee fast.

76
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,760
Fantastic!
Thanks for having me.

77
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
You are welcome.
-See ya.

78
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,120
-See ya in the next episode.
Yes!

79
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,480
Motornörd = Engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,980
More episodes will be translated to 
English in the near future.

81
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:48,060
