1
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.440
Jenny ... you've been so weird lately.

2
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.960
I have to ask a straight question for you.

3
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.480
Have you met any one else?

4
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.240
No, it's clear that I don't have.
 What you are paranoid!

5
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.160
- I just had to ask ... —Sov now a bit instead.

6
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.000
Mobile signal

7
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.000
It's Ulf.
 Hey!
 I'm just going to order food.

8
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.120
- I also have lunch.
 Do you have a cold?
 - Yes, these are such times now.

9
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.160
- Frida and I want to invite you home.
 -How nice!

10
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.240
Sorry, now I didn't hear what you said.

11
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.800
There must be a mess on the line.

12
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.280
Talk to you later.
 Hello.
 - There is poor coverage in here.

13
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.040
We have nothing in common anymore!

14
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.720
Yes, the sofa!
 We bought it together.

15
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.680
- I want you to sleep away tonight.
 - I should go ...

16
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.560
But I can sit a bit on the couch first ...

17
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.280
I go shower for so long.

18
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.160
Oh...!

19
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.080
I actually looked!

20
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.680
Have you called someone you can sleep with?

21
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.640
- How can you be so cold?!
 - Sink, you just make it worse.

22
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:33.560
- What should we do with the food in the fridge?!
 - Take exactly what you want in the fridge!

23
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.520
I have no cooler bag ...

24
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.080
Can't I stay and eat my part here?

25
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.040
Stay and eat, but tomorrow morning you should be gone!

26
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.760
We bought these sausages together ...!

27
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.000
-Hello?
 - Tjena, it's Magnus.

28
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.360
- It can be broken at any time.
 - I should take me briefly.

29
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.600
I have received nicotine patches from Jarmo.
 It should certainly work shit.

30
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.960
The suction has already decreased!

31
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.400
Who can manage this package every time you feel smoke suction?!

32
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.040
Are you still there?!

33
00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.520
- I should go.
 I just thought that ... - What?

34
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.160
I have to go to the bathroom.

35
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.040
- I am gone when you get home!
 - It is safest.

36
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.600
Have you already thrown our soap?!

37
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.840
We bought it together!
 Are you a robot?!

38
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.400
Magnus!
 Hey!

39
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.160
- New Svid?
 Shit!
 -Thanks!
 I am extremely satisfied.

40
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.800
It's a real Hugo Boss.
 Outside Stuttgart they have factory sales.

41
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.120
Everything costs half the price!

42
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.360
They say it is manufacturing defects, but it is not visible.

43
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.360
- What is wrong with this?
 - The seam on the inner pocket is not straight.

44
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.760
- It is not visible.
 What did it cost?
 -Half price.
 SEK 4,700.

45
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.000
It is shit cheap for a boss costume!

46
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:17.320
- You also have something new, huh?
 -Yes.
 Kenzo.
 Reduced by 25 %.

47
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.440
-Why?
 - It has a hole on the back somewhere.

48
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.200
It is great quality.
 Feel!

49
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.960
Really.
 It's not H & amp; M!

50
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.560
- I don't usually ... - no, maybe we shouldn't ...

51
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.360
We work together and ...

52
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.840
- Fan, I have no ... - it's quiet!
 I have.

53
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.280
Jenny ... how can you?

54
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.200
-Are you still there?!
 - The condoms we bought together!

55
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.320
Yesterday there was an aunt here with sandals on your feet!

56
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.160
They may take off the shoes or take on plastic covers.

57
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.920
Hygiene is the most important thing on a bathhouse.

58
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.680
-But hi!
 - Hi, the sock!

59
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.400
- Have you been bathing?
 - Yes, the sock is with dad at work.

60
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.240
Do you want to swim a little more?
 Take your leg!
 Hope in!

61
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.080
You there, with red bathing pants!
 Do not touch the sock legs!

62
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.840
Vivaldi: "The Four Seasons" is played

63
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.480
What is this song?!

64
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.680
Now I know, Israel's Schlager grant!

65
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.160
I love mysterious ethno-techno.

66
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.200
Mouth to mouth method?
 Never, I said.
 Who knows where that trout has been?

67
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.280
Here comes the sock again!

68
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.960
What does she have with her?
 Is it an animal?

69
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.160
I think it's a tupé.

70
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.720
Sorry!
 - Have you picked up the Uncle's tupe?

71
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.800
-Hello!
 How's it going?
 - Giantbra!

72
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.600
- I lay with a guy yesterday.
 - It doesn't sound stupid!
 With whom then?

73
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.320
-With him.
 - David Beckham?

74
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.440
We didn't do it in the old usual way.

75
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.640
We had cyber-sex.
 We met on a single chat.

76
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:37.440
Haven't you tried it?
 You tell each other what you do ...

77
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.880
It's like fantasies, though with another person.
 He was so damn nice!

78
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.920
Wasn't anyone pretended to be him?

79
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.120
No.
 Why would David Beckham do it?

80
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.880
We will meet tonight in that parking garage.

81
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.320
I'll have a red hat so he recognizes me.

82
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.720
- What should he have?
 - I well recognize David Beckham!

83
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.960
You are funny.

84
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.800
Hello!

85
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.360
But hi!

86
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:43.520
Oh, congratulations!
 What fun, you who have been trying for so long.

87
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.160
When does it come?

88
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.640
Well ...

89
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.840
Now I see!
 How narrow you have become, Magnus!

90
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.280
It becomes such a ... optical vision villa when you are so skinny.

91
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.680
You are not too narrow.
 It is neat when you contrast each other.

92
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.000
Kristina, do you have a little cig?

93
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:22.120
That's right.
 Helan and Halvan were very successful.

94
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:29.400
Peter, do you remember what dietary supplement Jarmo should have?

95
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.760
Why can't he have dips sauce for the macaroni like everyone else?

96
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.880
- What good it was!
 - It was a wonderful paella, Frida.

97
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.840
It feels just like sitting down in Italy.

98
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.600
Do you know what I ate in Spain this summer?
 Pig ears.

99
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.800
It was tapas for the beer.
 I didn't understand what it was.

100
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.360
- The bar said it was pig ears.
 -How did it taste?

101
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.240
- crispy ... - SUPPOSE ...!

102
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.960
Do you remember when we ate coming in France?

103
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:28.720
We ordered something that we thought was steak and got a gray mourning.

104
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.080
No one has eaten poop?

105
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.960
It's not as disgusting as you think.

106
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:49.040
- And that's cheap.
 - What disgusting!
 You're joking, Frida?!

107
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.520
Now I don't want to eat anymore ...

108
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.040
What do you mean?
 You can eat it with potatoes and lingonberries.

109
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.040
We have eaten it several times.
 I said it was puddling, but it was poop.

110
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:12.600
- See that you are joking now, Frida.
 -No, I do not.

111
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:18.160
It is clear that you can have poop in the food!

112
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.320
Was it poop in the pair?

113
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:26.920
Was it poop in the pael ...?
 Yes some.

114
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.240
Come, Ulf!
 It was poop in the pair!

115
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.920
I was just joking!
 Came back!

116
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.680
It wasn't poop in the pair!

117
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:45.600
Honey, I was just kidding!
 Don't they tolerate a little joke?

118
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.480
We can eat this ourselves, then.

119
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.480
It will be chocolate pudding then.

120
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.200
With poop ...

121
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.280
Just kidding!

122
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.720
Magnus, I was just kidding!

123
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.880
Yes it is...

124
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.160
What do you want with your theater lessons?

125
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:41.200
- I'll teach me to give lectures?
 - What are you, Per?

126
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:48.000
I am a safety representative at the company and will soon give a major lecture.

127
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.600
So I got this offer ...

128
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.160
- We will start with an exercise, Per.
 - Shoot.

129
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.560
-How beautiful you are.
 -Thanks.

130
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.760
You have a lot of black in you.

131
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.120
An actor must always be prepared!

132
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:21.120
- It's not an actor I should ... - Bank!

133
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.040
We take the remote control and a mug.

134
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.120
We take three feelings that you should ...

135
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.120
We say you are horny ... and then we can take euphoria ... and then you are a hairdresser.

136
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.720
You are welcome.

137
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.560
I'll just give a lecture ...

138
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.160
Breathe...

139
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.040
Look at the audience.

140
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.040
Bring in everyone.
 Take in the seventh row!

141
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.480
Take the text as well.

142
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:09.480
The Work Environmental Protection Agency has called for this meeting to ...

143
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.360
Good!
 Here we go.
 Continue!
 Give all you have got!

144
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.840
The Work Environmental Protection Agency has ...

145
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.720
Now I feel like taking an iron!
 Hit the door again when you go.

146
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.160
Yes ... but is it really the nose that is the problem?

147
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.920
Rather, I think it's your ears.

148
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:52.880
They make the rest of the face look a little disproportionate.

149
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.960
What would you say about removing them altogether?

150
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.600
-Does it hurt?
 - It pains a few days afterwards.

151
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:11.840
- But you enjoy it all your life.
 - Yes, it's an investment.

152
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.440
I think we put up a while and remove them.

153
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.320
I apologize for having the annual general meeting.

154
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.360
Some of you had to cancel the holiday.
 But I considered it to be urgent.

155
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:48.880
I have considered this and decided to leave my husband Lasse.

156
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.960
Everyone recognizes him from the marketing department.

157
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.640
We have never had it very good.

158
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.920
You can summarize our lives together in two points.

159
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.760
Here is a measurement that I have done since 1996.

160
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.280
It's Lasse's stack and my stack.

161
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:24.320
Then we come to the sex life.
 It is almost non -existent.

162
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.920
It is non -existent.
 Nothing.

163
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:36.200
I have a sketch of the apartment to show what a Friday night looks like.

164
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.760
I put on music and pour up champagne -

165
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:46.840
- And trying to bring Lasse with me from the living room to the bedroom.

166
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.480
When after an hour of nagging I get him into the bedroom -

167
00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:01.520
-Starts the TV series "The architects behind the world's foremost bridges"-

168
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:08.960
- And Lasse is like blown away!
 As you can see, there is a conflict of interest.

169
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:15.280
I've decided to say: Thanks for this time, Lasse!

170
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.880
Posyston can give an applause!

171
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.360
Get up!

172
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.320
You get flowers too.
 Thanks.

173
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:58.120
- It will be SEK 16,900.
 -What did you say?

174
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.520
I don't want to buy the whole gym.

175
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:10.280
Membership 2,000, annual card 7,900, freezable card 2,000. There will be 16,900.

176
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.320
No, it will be ... SEK 11,900.

177
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.080
Okay, maybe I took in a little neighbor.

178
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:26.400
Go to Friskis & amp;
 Svettis.
 It's a great gym for people who are a bit ...

179
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.080
—... uglier?
 - It wasn't me who said it.

180
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.400
But this is the only gym nearby.

181
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.640
Welcome then.

182
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.680
Welcome to Mansforum!
 My name is Torbjörn.

183
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:52.240
André is my name.
 Today we will talk tools.
 We guys love tools.

184
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.640
Girls like curtains and soaps, but we love tools.

185
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.720
Here we have gathered some cheeky tools.

186
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.200
For example, this one is very useful.

187
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.360
Then we have all the power tools.

188
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:20.080
Here is the classic drill.
 It is great if you are going to drill ...

189
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.520
...hole.

190
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.320
We will test the drill.

191
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.600
If you hold the plank ...

192
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.800
Wait, I'll hold it so ...

193
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.080
No, it doesn't feel really good.

194
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:49.000
We don't have to drill holes.
 Just press the button and show how it sounds.

195
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.680
- It was ... a good drill.
 - A real don.

196
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.320
- What do you have there?
 - A window.

197
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.160
Five, six, seven, eight ...!

198
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.000
Down!

199
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.440
Spin around!
 Go back!

200
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.600
Drive!

201
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.440
- Break!
 - You are new, huh?
 Welcome.
 -Thanks.

202
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.320
In the beginning it goes a little fast.

203
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:51.280
I can show you at a slower pace.
 - Is it okay with you others?

204
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.560
Check out here now.

205
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.080
It's just driving.

206
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.640
Five, Six, Seven, Eight!

207
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.320
I had to ... I couldn't help but.

208
00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.280
Shit.

209
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.720
Okay!
 Music!
 Here we go!

210
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.480
Are you with?!

211
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.800
What do you wear when working with your hands?

212
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.960
It is uncomfortable clothes that apply.

213
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:13.160
Preferably durable hinge pants with buttoning forward.

214
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:18.480
You can hang the accessories on the body in hanks.

215
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.040
A bandana keeps the hair away.

216
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.880
It is important with proper shoes.

217
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.280
Preferably a simple low shoe, no socks.

218
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:38.440
- A loafer or a sandal hall.
 - The picture has a good work suit.

219
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.440
This man here ...

220
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.680
Or this ... No, this one.

221
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.440
You have to see the cards on my sponsor children!

222
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:11.200
- I would just show my cards.
 - This is Raoul from Nicaragua.

223
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:17.680
Very nice ... look, here is Dragan from Bosnia.
 She is only four years old.

224
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.160
I think Raoul is much sweeter!

225
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.800
You are the sweetest in the world!

226
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.640
- Here is Janis from Lithuania.
 - Some really fit in the side legs.

227
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.200
This one is the cutest!
 Look at the ears.

228
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:46.960
- What an elephant ears!
 - They are probably needed down there in the heat.

229
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.080
Here is my, endolo from Botswana.

230
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.720
-Let's see!
 - No, that's your turn.

231
00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:01.760
It's you when you were little!
 You have painted Afrokull!

232
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.960
- God, what racist!
 - You have cheated!

233
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.360
- It's not a competition?!
 -Yes!

234
00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:19.320
Daniel, is it okay if I have my teddy bear in bed?

235
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.600
I've had Rufus since I was five years old.

236
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.400
Surely it's not strange?

237
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.760
Then maybe I can have my doll in bed?

238
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.560
I've had Samantha since I was 14 years old.

239
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.120
Program text: Helena Habermann (C) Swedish Television AB 2004

240
00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:14.520
- Hey, keep a little further out!
 -What did you say?!

241
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.720
Let's go!
