TIPS BEFORE 
THE ORAL NATIONAL TESTS

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,560
If you've paid attention in class, 
you should know the basics-

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,400
-i.e. what's covered in the national tests.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,120
Remember that for English and 
Swedish, it's not so much about facts-

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,800
-but rather the ability to converse 
and reason with other people.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,640
The test result makes up a considerable 
part of your grade, but not all of it.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,680
If you've already shown what you know, 
your teacher will bear this in mind-

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,680
-regardless of how you do in the test. 
Teachers consider the whole picture.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,640
Try instead to think of the test 
as a way to improve your grades.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,320
Since there are several of you, 
you get to lead the conversation-

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,120
-but also to listen 
and participate several times.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,960
It's important to listen actively 
and show that you're paying attention.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,560
It's not a competition. 
If the group succeeds, you succeed.

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,600
Help each other so everyone 
gets to speak for a better conversation.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,520
The test isn't there to catch you out. 
Your teacher wants you to succeed.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,600
The teacher often even adapts the group 
to ensure a good dynamic.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,680
Remember that a lot of it are things 
that you already know-

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,200
-for example speaking, listening and 
answering questions and statements.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,600
The aim here is to do just that, maybe 
just with a little more commitment.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,480
For the English test, study synonyms. 
This will give you a bigger vocabulary-

21
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,560
-and a more advanced way 
of expressing yourself.

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,800
Practise by having discussions and 
conversations with people around you.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,520
Practise listening 
and asking follow-up questions.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,880
The stress associated with the test 
can feel difficult and scary-

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,720
-but it can actually be a help too.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,840
When we experience short-term stress, 
adrenaline is secreted-

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,800
-which makes us extra alert, 
making us think and reason faster.

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Try to visualise the national test 
and that it goes well.

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,200
It's a mental preparation 
that can help you feel calm.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
And give yourself 
the very best prerequisites-

31
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,800
-by going to bed early, 
and don't forget to have breakfast.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,120
You can do this, good luck!
