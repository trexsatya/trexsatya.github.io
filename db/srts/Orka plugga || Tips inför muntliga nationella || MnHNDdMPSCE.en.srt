1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,120
If you have been involved in the lessons, you should know the basic knowledge.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,760
In English and Swedish it is not so much about fact-

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,360
-Or about the ability to talk and reason.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,960
The national test is counted as a large part of the grade, but not everything.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,560
If you have shown what you can on other tests and lessons, you have it in mind.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,720
The teachers think about the whole.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,640
The test is a way to raise your grades.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Since you are more in the group, you can both lead the conversation, listen and participate.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,440
Listen actively during each call.

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,600
National is not a competition.
 If the group succeeds, then you succeed.

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Help each other and make sure everyone gets to talk, so it will be a better conversation.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,520
The national test is not for putting you there.

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Most often, the teacher has adapted the group so that you get good dynamics.

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
Much of the oral national are things you already can-

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,240
-for example.
 To talk, listen and answer questions.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Under National you should do just that - just with a little more commitment.

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,360
Before English, plug in synonyms!

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,480
You get a larger vocabulary and can use more advanced formulations.

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,120
Practice discussions with people in your vicinity.
 Listen and ask questions.

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:00,680
The stress before the test may feel hard, but it can help us!

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,880
In case of short-term stress, adrenaline is excreted, making us alert-

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,240
-And it makes us think and reason faster.

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,480
Visualize that the test is going well.

24
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,040
It becomes like a mental preparation.

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,680
And give yourself good conditions by settling in time.

26
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,320
And don't forget to have breakfast.
 You can do this.
 Good luck!

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,040
