00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, Elza here from Elza's Bookshelf. It's October, which is kind of Halloween horror month and I'm really into horror books.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I thought I'd... On Goodreads, they've listed like 66 of the most beloved horror books in the last three years.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I've been going through that list and thought I'd let you know which books I'm very curious to read.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because I'm a bit in the mood for horror, I feel. So we'll go through that list, I think, and then you'll hear some of those books.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I have... I saw in that I have kind of... the majority of those books are in my Goodreads list that I want to read.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So we're not going to go through all of them, but maybe top five, top six? Yes, which I really want to read. And of course I want to hear your thoughts on those books.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The first one that comes to mind and has several books on this list is T. Kingfisher. She has books such as A House with Good Bones,

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Twisted Ones, The Hollow Places are just three of the books I know I really want to read by her.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And I know they're supposed to be mild, horror, a lot of atmosphere and the one I think I'll start with, The House of Good Bones I think,

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
where it's about a mother... Yes, a daughter whose mother says there are ghosts in my house and that's how they find out a lot of things.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, with some mild, atmospheric horror, that's what I like. So here we have a book that I have on my TBR too, that I really want to read for a long time,

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and it is The Sundown Motel of St. James, Simone St. James. I have read two other books by her and liked her very much.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And she also has this kind of atmospheric horror, where you kind of take mysterious ghost stories, but you never really know, are they really ghosts or what am I reading,

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and this one should be really good. Another author that I'm really curious about and one of whose books I'm about to start, and that's Grady Hendrix.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I just started How to Sell a Haunted House. It's the next book we're going to read in the book club and I'm so excited.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He is the one who wrote HorrorstÃ¶r. It's this book anyway, which is kind of like the Ikea catalogue, it feels like.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He has several books that I have on my TBR that I really want to read, and as I said, I'm finally starting my first Hendrix, so I'm so excited for that.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then we have a sci-fi horror, Dead Silence, Barnes something, and look at the cover, I just love it and it's on this list too,

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and I am super happy when I saw this. So that one, I don't really know what it's about except that you're out in space simply,

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and sci-fi mostly, so I'm bad at reading even though I like it. So, this combination I think is perfect for me.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hidden pictures, a horror like this that was on this list which is also a book I want to read.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So, I don't really know what it's about other than that it's a child, a boy, it's pictures, not so...

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's supposed to be unpleasant, it's pretty cover and it seems to be very, very good.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Just the cover and the feeling it gives me seems like a book to me. So we'll see.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I have heard very good things about The Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones, and it is also supposed to be such a book that is unpleasant.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Like this, atmospheric horror. Should it be a bit disgusting too, perhaps? I don't know, but I've heard great things about this one.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And it's also a book like this that just climbed up on my TBR that is getting closer and closer that I really want to read and grab it.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know who has read it, but I think I have heard several who have read it and liked it.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So now we have two. In this list, I found two books that have a Latin American feel.

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And one of them that I have had for a long time is Mexican Gothic. Look how beautiful it is.

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes, I very much like the cover. You know how I am. I like covers. Scary covers, nice covers.

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And here we have a really, really nice cover that really attracts me.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And that it's this kind of Mexican, South American horror or mysticism that I like. And this seems great.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And another one that was in this one that I hadn't seen before and that makes me very excited.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
House of Hunger. And so vampire books.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A book that I also found here that I had forgotten that I had put in my TBR last year.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And that's The Book of Accidents by Chuck Wending. It must also be some kind of dysfunctional family.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Past present. Yes, but it must be unpleasant.

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That said, I added it last year, April 2022, and had totally forgotten it was there.

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So now I saw this and it seems very, very interesting. And check out the cover as well.

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And of course, all Stephen King that is on this list is of course an absolute must.

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So that goes without saying. So I don't have to say anything.

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And this book, The Last House on Needles Street by Katrina Ward.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I have it when I saw it on the list. But I've heard and seen it just about everywhere.

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But it's like this serial killer, Revenge, Death, A Stolen Child, all that.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I just, wow, this sounds very, very, very good.

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have to say, overall, this list is incredibly, incredibly good.

48
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've found quite a few new favorites that way. Or not new favorites, but books that I really want to read.

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And all the Kingfishers are there, almost everything I want to read is on this one too.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So were new acquaintances that I hadn't really seen like that and I'm incredibly, incredibly curious about it.

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
One that, a book that I want to talk about is Sundial Katrina Ward again.

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And this was also a book that I added last year and had forgotten about.

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Check out the cover. I mean, how unpleasant and beautiful is it?

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is what made me fall for this book.

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Twisty Psychological Horror. So psychological, twisted.

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's just, I have to read it at once.

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And it has received quite good and high ratings anyway.

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So Katrina Ward might be an author to keep an eye out for.

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Have you read anything by her?

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think this list was so good. Really, really good list overall.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Because especially me who kind of likes horror but doesn't really know where to start.

62
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But I'm very glad I'm going to start Hendrix books now.

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Then I think I'll go get some of the Kingfisher books.

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But I thought this list was so amazing and I just wanted us to go through it a little bit.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And talk about some books that I'm curious about.

66
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm looking at the list, that's why I'm looking down and not at you.

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know, what do you think about horror? Do you get extra hungry now that it's October or do you hate horror in general?

68
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm the kind of person who loves horror and can read horror in April or March, it doesn't really matter.

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I feel that this year, October, I've had this spooky feeling and I've had a strong craving.

70
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So when I saw this list I was like, thank you so much Goodreads, now I'm going to go through it.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And look, and there were a lot of them that I liked, it's crazy, I don't know if you can see, so many of them is in my

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
want to read, want to read, that I've put it on my Goodreads list.

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm so curious as to what you think about horror in general.

74
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The books I have talked about, have you read any of them or are you also curious about them?

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Talk to me in the comments section and I'll see you there. See you next week. Take care bye!
