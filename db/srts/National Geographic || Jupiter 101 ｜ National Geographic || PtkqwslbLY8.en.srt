00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:02,300
(ambient music)

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,413
- [Narrator] Born from
primordial stardust,

3
00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:06,350
4.5 billion years ago,

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,570
Jupiter was the solar
system's first planet.

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,320
And much like its namesake,

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,780
the king of the ancient Roman gods,

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,083
Jupiter was destined for greatness.

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,490
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun,

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,360
and the largest planet
in the solar system.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,870
At approximately 11 earths wide,

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,930
Jupiter has twice the amount of mass

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,833
as the other planets put together.

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,030
But, unlike Earth, and the
three other terrestrial worlds,

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,420
Jupiter has no solid surface.

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,970
It may not even have a
traditionally solid core.

16
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:44,720
Rather, this giant planet may
have a dense, liquid center

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,873
surround by a worldwide ocean
of hydrogen and helium gases.

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,940
Jupiter's gassiest composition

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,600
can be observed in its atmosphere.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,470
About 44 miles thick,

21
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,360
the atmosphere is a canvas
of stripes and storms,

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,800
churning across the giant planet.

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,650
Their colors range
between shades of whites,

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,220
yellows, browns, and reds,

25
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,443
all caused by the different
chemical make up of each area.

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,520
Probably the most iconic
feature of Jupiter,

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,930
is a crimson brown
storm that's been raging

28
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,443
for over 300 years, the Great Red Spot.

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,810
It's a giant, swirling
collection of clouds

30
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,350
with wind speeds of up
to 400 miles per hour,

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,340
at least two and half times faster

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,633
than category five hurricanes.

33
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,690
Floating hundreds of miles
above the storms of Jupiter,

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,690
are about 79 moons, the most
of the eight known planets.

35
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,190
The four largest moons were
discovered by Galileo in 1610.

36
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,090
Called the Galilean
Satellites, they include:

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,130
Io, the most volcanically
active celestial body

38
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,750
in the solar system;

39
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,480
Ganymede, the solar system's largest moon,

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,080
even larger than the planet Mercury;

41
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,640
and Callisto and Europa,
which along with Ganymede,

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,263
may contain oceans of liquid
water underneath their crusts.

43
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,730
Jupiter's large collection of
moons is only made possible

44
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,270
by the planet's massive
size and gravitational pull,

45
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,770
the strongest of all the
planets in the solar system.

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,770
This incredible gravity
also influence the sizes

47
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,453
of the seven other planets.

48
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,010
During the solar system's
earliest days, Jupiter,

49
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,950
being the first planet to form,

50
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,090
attracted and destroyed space debris

51
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,640
that would've helped the
other planets grow in size.

52
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,210
Today, that force may serve as a shield

53
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,130
by attracting comets and asteroids

54
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,240
onto Jupiter's own surface,

55
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,413
preventing them from crashing
onto inner planets like Earth.

56
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,460
Apart from the sun,

57
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,370
Jupiter has become the dominant
figure in the solar system,

58
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,260
thereby earning its place at the top

59
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,761
of the planetary heap as king.

60
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,928
