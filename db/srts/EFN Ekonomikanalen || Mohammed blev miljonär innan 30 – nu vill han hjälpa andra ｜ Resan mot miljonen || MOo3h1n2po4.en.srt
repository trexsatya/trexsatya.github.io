1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07.560
He came as a refugee from Iraq to Sweden as a 13-year-old. Today he is 30 years old and a millionaire.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,960
Mohammed Salih is a savings economist, stock market inspector and Instagram profile.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,240
He is a podder, writer and dad-

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,840
-And today he is here to talk about his journey towards the million.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,000
-Welcome here, Mohammed. -Thanks.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,760
So fun to have you here. We will hear about your trip to the million today.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,200
-Do you have always been interested in savings? -Yes, I've been.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,680
I can remember back to when I came to Sweden.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,280
Already then I started to take an interest in savings and the entrepreneurial.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,680
Now it is prescribed, but before New Year-

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56.840
—I used to ask my dad to buy out a bunch of big rocket-

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00.600
-And then I sold them pieces.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06.240
In this way I made money and I know my family always needed more money-

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,200
-So I tried to contribute as much as possible.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,280
You and your family fled from Iraq to Sweden. Can you tell us a little about it?

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,600
Yes, and it wasn't that we took the flight from Iraq and landed in Sweden.

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,720
Without it was a long escape route, we were on the run for several years-

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,680
-And did a lot of middle stops before we landed in Sweden.

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,400
We are incredibly grateful for that.

20
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,200
So a long escape route that resulted in the new home Sweden.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,080
-You grew up in Ronneby. -Yes, first Rosengård and then Ronneby.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,680
Or Kallinge that is the metropolis for me. It's just there that I feel at home.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00.920
That you have this escape in the luggage, how has it affected your view of money and finances?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,920
This is probably what has made me so interested and constantly want money.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09.880
It creates such security.

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,720
During the escape trip we did not even have money for food and clothes.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,760
Then Mom got to beg clothes and food.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,160
Although I will never end up in that situation in Sweden-

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,160
-So money is a damn security for me and the dependence on money comes from it.

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,720
What does it mean for you to be in Sweden?

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,520
It is difficult to explain with words. My love for Sweden is really boundless.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
There is nothing that I am so grateful for-

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,640
-As Sweden opened its arms to our family.

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,960
For after 13 years on escape-

35
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,320
-or 13 years of uncertainty before getting this residence permit-

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00.320
-It can't describe how nice it felt.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,720
-When did you discover the stock exchange? -When I was around 22-23, quite a few years ago.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,280
It was through a friend actually.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,000
We were going to MMA training. I drove a car, he sat next to it.

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm pretty social so I like to talk.

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,680
He was not as social at all so I asked what he was doing.

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,200
Then he bought and sold shares on his mobile and earned a lot of money-

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,280
-On this short part we drove.

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,000
Then I felt that I had to learn about shares if it is possible to make money via mobile.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,760
Before you put your savings goal to become a millionaire, what did your life look like then?

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,640
Can you get a snapshot from Mohammed Back in the Day?

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,160
Then I had bought my first apartment.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:03,080
I had no savings goals, and without savings goals it is quite difficult to save money.

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06.920
Because then you feel that you have nothing to save for.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,200
An economic yet spent Mohammed who did not care very much about economics.

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,040
I had no budget at that time, but I took life as it came.

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,960
It was probably more before.

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25.560
How did it go when you decided on the million?

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,120
Money is very taboo in Sweden.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,600
No one talks about it, you must never ask what anyone earns, hardly what anyone has in interest.

56
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,040
I wanted to try to change that, document everything I do-

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,760
-and become a millionaire before I'm thirty.

58
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,760
How did it go at the beginning of your investment trip?

59
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49.840
It went okay, actually.
