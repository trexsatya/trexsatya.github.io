1
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,240
I don't know how many houses there are in Norrland, which many people don't know are haunted.

2
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:38,240
The house in Yrtttivaara was definitely a house we didn't know about, but which we soon became aware of that paranormal things happen.

3
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:46,640
The house was built during the Second World War and part of the house was then a shop, where nails were sold, among other things.

4
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,718
In those days, you had to buy a whole railcar with nails, which you did.

5
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,605
The shop was closed down and demolished, but what remained were the old wooden stairs and concrete slab, where the shop once stood.

6
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:11,111
The house changed owners and renovations began. That's when it all started.

7
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,512
Inside one of the bedrooms, knocking began to be heard from the wall where the shop once stood.

8
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:28,994
You could also hear someone walking with clogs up the old wooden stairs. Even though no one is there.

9
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:47,573
The cellar door, which is directly on the left as you enter, opens and closes inexplicably.

10
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:54,580
And on the second floor, today's owners sense that a woman with curly hair is standing and staring at them.

11
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:03,220
Who that woman is is not known, but an enormous discomfort radiates into the room when she is present.

12
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:19,835
We did not know what we were about to face during this investigation. And maybe it was good, because the house in Yrtttivaara will do something with us at LaxTon that we have never experienced before.

13
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:41,481
Then we are just about to enter here in Yrtttivaara, in an old shop. But the shop is no longer there. We have been inside with the bags.

14
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,175
I was about to put on the vest, well we are a bit chocked here.

15
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:44,945
Yes.

16
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:48,619
I think we caught it on surveillance.

17
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:49,778
There are two things.

18
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:58,393
I go to the toilet which is just inside here on the left. And you Niclas walked around and started the audio recording on all surveillance cameras.

19
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:01,469
Yes, so we get audio for the surveillance.

20
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:08,817
And when I'm in there, I hear you walking, Niclas, and I think it's him hitting the toilet door handle hard.

21
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:11,341
I just said "Yeah" or something like that.

22
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:16,788
And then I go out and asked if you hit the handle. And you say "No, I haven't touched the handle"

23
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:22,119
So hopefully the surveillance has captured that angle.

24
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:10,785
And not only that, me and Johan go out here, we stand exactly where we stand right now. We go in and we go to the kitchen, then I hear the basement door just "Bang!"

25
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,626
Damn!

26
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,296
The door closed!

27
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:24,458
Open that door wide.

28
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,071
The surveillance takes it.

29
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:38,819
What I find interesting is what she talks about this. Just with this door, but I don't think she said anything about the toilet door.

30
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:47,274
We also have knocks on the wall, we also have things that are visible, shadow figures. A woman can be seen in here, we have a lot of things.

31
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:54,000
And we just walked in, we have to prepare to start this investigation. And then it starts.

32
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,876
It's really cool, we'll see where this goes. A nice house, but maybe it's a little darker in here, I have no idea.

33
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:09,486
And they are renovating and this tends to tear up energies, I think it can get even stronger.

34
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:18,000
And the owner said earlier today that she feels this tingle in her scalp and in her body and that's usually when amazing things happen.

35
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,221
Shall we go in? It's a little chilly outside now.

36
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:27,995
Then we are inside the hall here.

37
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:37,423
There we hear the door, it is completely still now. This one closed and when you asked if it could open more, it did. And it has happened to her.

38
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:42,000
This is what it sounded like if I were to reconstruct what happened.

39
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,992
Like it closed.

40
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:46,104
And that it then...

41
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:49,751
went up. Kind of like that. When we asked it to open.

42
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:55,618
Right. And what also happened, for her, because I have her as a reference, because this becomes a hot spot.

43
00:07:55,618 --> 00:08:02,878
She is upstairs and she hears a bang from here. She said she always locks this door, we have chosen to keep it open of course.

44
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:06,253
And behind here is the toilet.

45
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:10,111
Here I was, I close the door and then I kind of hear this..

46
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,927
Like someone hitting the handle quite hard.

47
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm walking by here too and I hear it, but I think Tony's checking to make sure the door is locked.

48
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,774
But it's not me.

49
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:30,259
No, I thought 100% that it was you, who wanted to say like you get out. Very strange.

50
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,671
Hopefully we will have a good angle on this by then.

51
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:37,902
We have all the technology in the kitchen. Shall we go in and start walking around a bit? Sense the house.

52
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:44,172
I think we should start there. I even shiver there, it's interesting.

53
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:51,345
I pull a psr there right away, with static and rem.

54
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:56,798
I position it so it even touches the door.

55
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:01,035
Do you have Polterscript on you?

56
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:01,834
Yes.

57
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:06,684
Shall we have it running and see if we can get some direct communication?

58
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:13,614
We've got Lennie sitting on the bus, he's got the time codes, he's got it all down. So we'll go back and look at this later.

59
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,678
Then you will see it, if we got it.

60
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:27,600
We have now put a prs down there. It's our Paranormal Rem Static. We have the rem function, just like a rem pod, also static.

61
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,034
I'll run Polterscript, see if we can get anything about what exactly happened here.

62
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:41,344
As if we have someone with us here who just did those things, pulled the handle or closed the door.

63
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,162
Can you do any of those things again?

64
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:50,224
Close this door or hit the toilet handle.

65
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:55,135
I'm shivering as I stand here. Weird.

66
00:09:55,135 --> 00:10:01,422
I think this is the power to the machine. So there we have nothing.

67
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:06,000
I got the feeling when I came in here, that I wasn't welcome to be there. Like "Get out of here!"

68
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,339
Yes, it's a bit like that.

69
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:12,367
*Footstep*

70
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:15,411
Was that a step from upstairs?

71
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:25,619
Hey, I forgot to say one thing. When I was standing here before and was about to go out, I thought I heard something like a growl.

72
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:37,357
It's also interesting, they have plans for this house. They are renovating and that's when it started.

73
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:41,585
Do you know what their plans are for this house?

74
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:49,707
I have not shivered here before. I've been in here fixing things.

75
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,000
The forest.

76
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,332
I also asked about this trench they have dug. I was wondering when they did that.

77
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,869
There is memory out there.

78
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:12,996
So what they've dug is next to a cat they've buried. One of the people who have lived here said we have to move the cat and someone said "No, we donÂ´t care about the cat"

79
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:21,488
And I'm akso thinking, you dig a deep furrow out in the woods, when you're going to bury a cable. It is open now.

80
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:25,379
You think so. There was a lot that came here straight away.

81
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,018
I'm going to check if you have electromagnetic fields with you.

82
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:38,448
As you can see, it is zero. By Tony here.

83
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,979
Try walking towards the doors.

84
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:52,996
Did you hear? Someone hit this one. Where did it come from?

85
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:59,647
When I got two up on Polterscript, I saw two on it.

86
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:02,508
This is how it sounded.

87
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,353
We have 0.2. 0.1.

88
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:12,883
That sound must have been captured, it was like someone clicking the meter.

89
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:18,196
If you have touched this door, please do it one more time.

90
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:30,759
Here is 01, 02. 03. That's the base we had throughout the day when we went here and looked.

91
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,222
I also thought when you said if it's electricity and you feel something..

92
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:42,184
I'm shivering and it's coming from something.

93
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:43,600
I have never experienced that.

94
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,344
No, it was like something hit.

95
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:52,045
Can you try going up? Do we have emf further up?

96
00:12:52,045 --> 00:13:01,400
02. But it hasn't been during the day when I've gone and looked. They have electricity here that we can use, but it's not leaking from what I've found.

97
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,854
It must remain there.

98
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:05,924
Shall we take a spin and feel it out a bit?

99
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:14,507
I have a new instrument here. A pyramid, you don't really have a name for it yet, it's still a prototype.

100
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:21,564
I want to say it's the Paranormal Pyramid of Truth. It's like Yes and No on it.

101
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:27,216
We put it here, something comes on one side it lights up green, something comes on the other it lights up red.

102
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:33,680
Then we can also ask questions and communicate. Shall we put it on the table so we stand some distance away?

103
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:38,760
Now it takes red for my hand. I put it some distance away from us.

104
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,580
Now it should start pulsing with a blue light.

105
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:43,470
Like that.

106
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:48,406
Now the shivers come in here. Good!

107
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:51,203
You who are here now..

108
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,401
You who are here, Nancy came up.

109
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:01,432
Can you touch this pyramid? Make it glow green.

110
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:11,269
It's a damn discomfort to stand here against this one. I'm almost looking towards the basement here.

111
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:18,549
Get to this one now flashing blue.

112
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:28,167
I'm thinking about this cat.

113
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:38,486
Now if there are several men who are here..

114
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,472
in this house...

115
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:52,282
You who are moving here, is it the woman who has been seen here?

116
00:14:52,282 --> 00:15:01,304
There is a woman upstairs, whom the owners have seen. With slightly shorter curly hair, she's just standing by a doorway there.

117
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:03,747
We don't know her name.

118
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:13,534
And we will go through the entire building, but the hot spots are their strongest points.

119
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:18,002
Shall we take it and go through the rooms down here?

120
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:38,279
This is a room that was a bedroom before. The previous owners have told us that they heard knocking. And the old shop, Evert's old shop as it is called

121
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:48,000
it's behind the wall here. Here they have heard knocking from the wall. There is also an old staircase that goes up here, there they have heard someone walking up with clogs.

122
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,315
Exactly, it has been heard at night.

123
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:54,544
Can you knock back on this wall?

124
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:10,776
Evert, are you still here? Tap here.

125
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:19,619
Or if there is someone else left here, knock on the walls.

126
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:26,998
Can you make a loud noise so we know where to go?

127
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:39,082
Can you run upstairs if you are there?

128
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:50,424
I think it's interesting, because it's a fairly small house, but then the chances that something could happen also increase.

129
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:57,290
We compress without quite well, it's not a castle after all. So if someone is running here or knocking on the wall, we hear it right away.

130
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,463
Yes definitely.

131
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:00,314
So that's good.

132
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:12,433
It would be damn interesting to get the knocks back.

133
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,213
But as I said...

134
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:23,436
There is no discomfort here, but more discomfort out in the hall. Do not you think so?

135
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:24,672
Yes, definitely.

136
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:32,978
I'm being pulled up a bit, shall we try going there?

137
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:45,390
Shall we try closing the door? If I close the door completely, we'll see if we can get a transfer here.

138
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:49,654
We put this against that.

139
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,497
Boys.

140
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,560
Yes?

141
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,000
Very strange white fog down in the basement by the stairs.

142
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,849
White fog in the basement? We go down there now, now there is a white mist in the basement. We were going to go up, but we go there instead.

143
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:34,667
Now we enter that surface, the store is gone, but the concrete foundation remains. And the old staircase remains.

144
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,864
Now the question is where is the fog.

145
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,370
The camera is further in.

146
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,858
Can Lennie hear us now?

147
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:50,972
Yes.

148
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:52,158
Where is the fog?

149
00:18:52,158 --> 00:19:00,815
The fog came where you are now, then it passed the stairs two, three steps down, thick.

150
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:03,956
Okay, I got 37 years here too.

151
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,520
Ugh, what shivers there were here.

152
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:14,377
Are you all down here?

153
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:22,605
You can see that there is moisture damage, it drips in.

154
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:29,198
But as I said, it's this staircase that belongs to the old shop here.

155
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:35,528
And this is where they have heard someone running up in clogs.

156
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,432
*Slam in the room*

157
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,602
There was a bang in the corner here.

158
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,152
Who do we have here?

159
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:57,457
I try the Melmeter.

160
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,009
Okay, this fog that's here...

161
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:27,216
There! Right where Lennie said it was before.

162
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,326
Who are you?

163
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:34,534
Is that you Evert?

164
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:40,994
Where. Should I interpret that as a Yes?

165
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,864
I'm checking here in the corner.

166
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,464
*Slams the next room*

167
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:55,377
What was that?

168
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:57,093
Was this behind?

169
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,346
We don't have a surveillance camera in here.

170
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,742
No.

171
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,101
Is it on red? Or orange?

172
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:14,346
Orange.

173
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,106
Okay can you back up please?

174
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,769
Who are you? Is that you Evert?

175
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,036
You talked about an army of people here.

176
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:31,618
Are there many of you here?

177
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:40,669
I start... I'm just going to test one thing..

178
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:50,068
I turn off Rem. Now we see mG, this cork cabinet does not work.

179
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:51,068
Nothing at all?

180
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:54,809
Zero. 03 here now. 08.

181
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,717
1.1. There was nothing here at all just now.

182
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:58,511
Huh?

183
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:03,056
And now it comes. But it is quite low.

184
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:05,786
Check this out.

185
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:12,739
1.1.

186
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:16,646
2.8. 3.0.

187
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:28,743
Here it goes down.

188
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:37,709
So I need to be damn close. You see, now I'm 30 cm from the cabinet.

189
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,317
Then it's 0.

190
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:50,558
And over here is what we got. I turn it back on.

191
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:56,151
Can you touch that antenna now? Right in front of Niclas.

192
00:22:56,151 --> 00:23:03,349
If we have this army of men as you describe who are here.

193
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:09,396
Wondering what it was? It was like something was pushed away. We got a indication right away when we came in here.

194
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:12,035
We go back here to the fog then.

195
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,422
3.9 degrees. And zero...

196
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,870
Here's something... Zero in emf..

197
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:32,840
Gone.

198
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,498
Come back to me here. And take a good hold of this iron stick.

199
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:42,694
You want us out of here?

200
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:47,196
Do you want us to stay here?

201
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,178
It's up here. But it is still zero in emf.

202
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:08,196
It's pretty cool, it's in the doorway. And the grades go up. To 7.2, we just had 4.

203
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,119
It gets warmer there.

204
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:14,701
Now I'm going out.

205
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,559
It's strong here.

206
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:22,258
Huh?

207
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:25,724
What was that? Did you do that?

208
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:26,719
What did you do?

209
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,464
I was hit in the finger.

210
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:30,000
A shock?!

211
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,756
So disgusting. Like I touched..

212
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:34,625
In metal like?

213
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,429
Cables that are loose.

214
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,035
*First words from Polterscript when we enter the basement*

215
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,231
How disgusting that was. At first I thought I was bitten by something, but there is nothing here.

216
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:57,306
That was like a jab in the finger. Like I'm touching two wires that have low current, I felt it tingle.

217
00:24:57,306 --> 00:25:07,624
Tingle? You, the owner said that it started to tingle in the body. It was interesting that you felt that.

218
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:09,476
And now 4 degrees again.

219
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,785
4.5. It went up to 7 degrees and this one started.

220
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,074
Warmer.

221
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,991
Nothing.

222
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:30,676
Lenny. do you hear us?

223
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:31,641
Yes.

224
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:35,163
Is the fog gone or is it still there?

225
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:37,409
The fog is gone.

226
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:52,199
We're doing this, we're documenting this Lennie, we're continuing to document it. If something else starts to manifest then we go back here. If the mist all the time, we know if it is an army of energies moving here.

227
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,425
We're doing that. We go back to the house again.

228
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:56,303
*Loud bang in the room next to us*

229
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,690
What the hell was that?

230
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:02,359
It's like it's banging in here.

231
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:06,000
That sounded like something was being moved.

232
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,221
Is anyone down here playing with us?

233
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:11,521
I'm starting this again.

234
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:15,053
It was like you turned something on.

235
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:21,586
It seems you like to hit things. You hit the gauges, you hit on handles.

236
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:25,768
If you want us to stay in here with you, touch this iron stick.

237
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:35,590
Yes, take this black box I have here.

238
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:41,735
I'm starting to think about other things now, it talked about forest before Niclas. Now box, maybe it wants to convey something else.

239
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:47,118
Now it's snowing outside so we can't go out and dig, but it's something they want to be able to convey.

240
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:59,143
I turned this off, that's what it sounded like. But I also think like this, if they've touched up the ground, they've renovated here, they might bring in something else.

241
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:07,820
I'm starting to feel watched from the outside. I'll try standing here in the door where we had high value.

242
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,996
I have so we can measure even more.

243
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:19,688
When it said orb it went up to 276!

244
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,249
Man.

245
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,748
Was it this box they were talking about perhaps?

246
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,544
Shit it started talking.

247
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:40,250
Do you think it's funny with that one?

248
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:46,316
01, 02. It went up to 276... when the first word came.

249
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:48,170
Orb.

250
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:55,534
Throughout the house it has been 01, 02 all the time. 05 as max.

251
00:27:55,534 --> 00:27:56,993
But this was... what did you say?

252
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:59,036
276.

253
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:05,821
And precisely with the word orb. We'll see if we catch anything on camera, or on the surveillance camera when we got in here.

254
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:07,555
Shall we go back to the house?

255
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:12,809
We do it. So we let these shadows manifest because we capture it on film.

256
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,218
This is also completely unbelievable, there has been five centimeters of fresh snow all of a sudden out of nowhere. We had sunshine and fine weather before.

257
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:31,888
I think we close the door, we put a prs in front, then we see if we get a movement on it, because it is said to open by itself.

258
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:35,424
And we got a bit of that on the surveillance earlier, we hope.

259
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:40,959
So put prs in front. I'll pick up Ovilus and test it too.

260
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:49,332
I want to place some instruments. If there are any younger energies moving on this floor, for things that are not where they should be.

261
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:56,508
I'll put this on the table. And this is a RemTeddy.

262
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:58,855
So if something comes near it...

263
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,712
So if you don't think it should sit there, feel free to push it down. We saw you in the basement, or we saw you in the basement.

264
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:10,001
How many of you are up here?

265
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:16,891
When the shivers come, they go away, then they come and go.

266
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:17,932
Do you know what I'm doing with this one?

267
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:18,571
No?

268
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:23,343
This is our motion sensor that we have now, also a demo that we are testing.

269
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:27,056
I can set this to an alarm. Shall I put it in the dresser over there?

270
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,136
Where they have heard the knocks?

271
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:33,217
Right. If we come down and this blinks like this...

272
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,414
I put it like this, so it's right against the wall.

273
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:43,894
And then I start it.

274
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:54,682
So if we have someone behind the wall, who wants to knock or knock on the wall, do it now and we will see it later when we come down.

275
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:56,883
We'll leave it there.

276
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:04,507
Or come up from the basement if you want.

277
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:09,000
Push that one away. Open the toilet door too.

278
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:16,066
Touch the teddy bear if it shouldn't be there.

279
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:23,699
And everything we put out now is in front of surveillance cameras, so hopefully we'll catch it if something happens.

280
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:27,360
We go up to the second floor. This is where this woman has been seen standing.

281
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:34,002
*When we go upstairs this happens with the door to the basement downstairs*

282
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:45,174
We can also say that here is a room that they are carpentry in, they haven't had any experiences here.

283
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:47,157
*Slam in the room*

284
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:47,893
What was that?

285
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:52,268
I heard it right when we got in here, like something was thrown.

286
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:56,371
Interesting, because here they said they had nothing.

287
00:30:56,735 --> 00:31:00,373
I don't know if it was thrown at the window or what it was.

288
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:03,639
Can you make that sound one more time?

289
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,644
*Slam in the room*

290
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:11,835
It's here.

291
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,908
We test like this..

292
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:18,625
Is it a wooden floor or a plastic floor that we are standing on here?

293
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:24,000
It's banging at our feet, but it's banging over here.

294
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:30,155
I'll put one thing on the floor for you. So let it be here.

295
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:42,719
Now touch that iron stick. If you walk around up here, can you kick this one away?

296
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,635
We put it by the doorway, then we should get it on the camera if something comes there.

297
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:54,041
Now the camera is right up here.

298
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:58,211
Put it at the entrance right where you come up.

299
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:07,725
It's that doorway by the kitchen, that's where you've seen this lady standing.

300
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,824
Right here.

301
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,998
Shall we try a pmb? Point it straight up.

302
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:23,011
Lisa, I brought up a name here again.

303
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:28,259
The woman who has been seen here...

304
00:32:28,557 --> 00:32:31,667
can you come in to us here?

305
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:45,626
There are more people who have experienced phenomena here. That you hear knocks, you've been seen.

306
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:52,536
There are things you could have pulled out or opened here in the kitchen, these drawers. If you're up here with us.

307
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:55,283
Then you can stand here and fix things in the kitchen.

308
00:32:55,283 --> 00:33:02,564
They talk about men down in the basement here. Can any of you come up here?

309
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:08,348
We're testing a ghostbox and we'll see if anything gets through up here.

310
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,815
Do you hear this noise? Come close to me here.

311
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:30,000
If that woman is in this room right now, can you come out to us?

312
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,085
Who gave me a poke in the finger? Down in the basement.

313
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:49,243
Who hit the handle down by the toilet?

314
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:55,500
Who opened the basement door?

315
00:33:57,484 --> 00:34:00,833
I'm moving a bit this way too.

316
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,106
*Tony hears footsteps behind him*

317
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:16,204
It sounded like someone was walking here, did you hear that?

318
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:22,047
I am removing the pmb here.

319
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:35,027
It was just like someone walked here. I felt it on the floor, because I was standing a little behind. It was like someone was walking, because there was a sway in the floor behind here.

320
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:39,240
And it was like a bang, I have a hard time telling where it came from.

321
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:45,874
That woman, or whoever it was that walked here, can you come in and talk to us here?

322
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:58,053
Shit, it was spinning when I walked in here. Like it's leaning.

323
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,519
The woman who has been seen here..

324
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,992
Who are you?

325
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:09,710
I'll try the other corner too.

326
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,775
"How disgusting you are"

327
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:16,103
It said How disgusting you are?

328
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:21,095
It sounded like it. That's the first thing I get through and it's a man saying it.

329
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:25,045
Who are you?

330
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:34,064
He didn't sound nice. The one that came through was really... "How disgusting you are"

331
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:37,049
I shiver.

332
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:41,181
That's the only word we had.

333
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:45,907
It was a complete sentence and I think it was very clear. Right?

334
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:48,593
I'll check.

335
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:50,377
What did you say?

336
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:53,191
I'll check, it stings there.

337
00:35:54,183 --> 00:35:56,039
On the hand.

338
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,750
I'll put Ovilus in and see if I get anything more.

339
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,317
"Be careful"

340
00:35:59,317 --> 00:36:00,646
Be careful!

341
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:04,871
It was a woman, in Finnish, who said be careful.

342
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:15,139
I shiver when I walk into the corner here, how sick.

343
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:23,352
Can you knock or slap the walls if you are Robert?

344
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:25,756
I'm standing here in the corner.

345
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:31,478
You can push me away in that case.

346
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,793
*Something moves in the building*

347
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:40,177
Something fell or was thrown out there.

348
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:54,493
I'm still standing here. Can you push me away, or pass in front of me, like a shadow.

349
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:59,104
Can you do something that makes me want to get out of here?

350
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,319
*Steps heard in the building*

351
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,118
It's steps!

352
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:15,754
It was steps. But it came.. there is nothing up there.

353
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:17,400
I just shiver.

354
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,877
Knock on the wall again if that was you. Those knocks were great. Do it one more time.

355
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,534
If the lady is here, come in here to us.

356
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,885
What a tingling sensation in my head I got.

357
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,628
I can stand out there, I'm in front of a camera if I stand out there. Are you staying Johan? If you stand there.

358
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,515
Now we are divided, Niclas is behind here.

359
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:31,304
Make that sound one more time.

360
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:48,000
Be prepared of some tear brand now then Niclas.

361
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,847
Do something that makes sure we get out of here, that we find it so uncomfortable.

362
00:38:56,376 --> 00:39:01,085
Knock on the walls here.

363
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:13,120
Not the lamp Johan, stay there. Tony, come on.

364
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,696
We have surveillance cameras on this, come, come, come.

365
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:23,589
Check the floor. Isn't that black there something else? Does it look like something is on the floor?

366
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:24,599
By the stairs?

367
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,328
By the stairs, straight ahead.

368
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:28,255
Very black.

369
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:31,440
If we draw a light there, it will disappear.

370
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,579
Should we just go there?

371
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:38,265
It's like something is there. It is darker than the dark.

372
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:42,279
It's so damn dark. Just like there is something that has come up.

373
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,752
Come in slowly Johan.

374
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:46,829
Damn it's dark.

375
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:53,398
Now it's starting to disappear...

376
00:39:58,755 --> 00:40:02,073
That was crazy.

377
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,108
The carpet is here, but what was lying was here.

378
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:20,622
Imagine someone lying down on the floor.

379
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:25,022
And I saw the outlines.. I just shudder as I stand here.

380
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:29,094
Was that you we saw here? Has something happened to you here?

381
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,620
It burns my knees. It's really weird.

382
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,061
Like scratches or burns?

383
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:42,000
It burns, we'll see if there are tear marks. It usually starts with it getting hot, but what did I see there?

384
00:40:42,827 --> 00:40:45,434
Imagine a person lying here.

385
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:55,533
It just manifests out of nowhere, suddenly it was just there.

386
00:40:57,385 --> 00:41:06,000
Like this, do you see this brand here? Imagine something like that though you see... well, it was very strange..

387
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,274
something manifested that was there.

388
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:20,001
Shall we go in there? Should I place a pmb directed this way? So we'll see. Johan if you go in there.

389
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:27,719
It calibrates.

390
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:40,012
Whoever was possibly lying in the hall outside by the stairs, came in, passed the kitchen and came in here to Niclas in the corner.

391
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:50,935
This works like a spirit box. Although it is digital.

392
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:55,341
And the sound is on this side, that's why I have it upside down.

393
00:41:58,615 --> 00:41:59,115
Did it say that?

394
00:41:59,115 --> 00:42:02,858
I thought it said Niclas. I thought it said your name.

395
00:42:02,858 --> 00:42:05,584
Did you just say my name?

396
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:19,663
Is the previous owner here?

397
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:25,286
He who had the business. Are you still in this building?

398
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:39,395
What do you think of these renovations taking place here?

399
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:44,230
Will it be your way, the way you want it?

400
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:45,662
I was the one who put the hand....

401
00:42:45,662 --> 00:42:46,829
"Worse"

402
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,854
I'm shivering in here.

403
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:00,000
If you don't like it, can you make a loud bang here?

404
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,849
Try turning it off again.

405
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:10,335
Sick, I thought it said Niclas...

406
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:15,646
I thought it was flashing, but we'll see, the surveillance is there.

407
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:17,194
*Surveillance didn't catch a wink in the room*

408
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:23,609
But like I said the one you got through didn't feel so nice. He who said How disgusting you are.

409
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:25,597
But I'm thinking, was he talking to me?

410
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:26,339
I do not know.

411
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:33,720
Or was he talking to the woman? Was that the woman we saw? Has something happened to her? Was that where she collapsed?

412
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,674
But those steps...

413
00:43:35,674 --> 00:43:39,028
They were so clear, where did they come from.

414
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:41,780
What the hell was that?

415
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:49,565
It was like someone was looking.. at the floor, like something was looking in here. Here.

416
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:51,991
Or what did I see?

417
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:56,215
Like something made me see something like...

418
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:57,501
*Nothing caught on surveillance*

419
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,291
or if there was a child or something looking forward.

420
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:07,074
I'm going to sit here. I'm taking Johan with me. And if you try going down and sitting down, you get to choose.

421
00:44:07,074 --> 00:44:21,312
I sit down in the bedroom where they have heard these knocks. Then I listen and see if I hear the knocking. Then you up here. Then we'll see if we hear anything between us.

422
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:23,719
I'll go down myself then.

423
00:44:26,828 --> 00:44:33,206
Now I'm sitting here by myself. It's me and Johan, but Tony is by himself.

424
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:34,557
"We go"

425
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:36,326
We go.

426
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:45,310
Now I'm down here, Niclas is right above. I sit down in bed.

427
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,537
Go down to Tony. All of them.

428
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:54,289
Touch the wall, hit there.

429
00:44:57,233 --> 00:44:59,677
Sound from out there.

430
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:09,181
Sound from here.

431
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:15,468
Don't you want me in this room? Is that why you're leaving?

432
00:45:15,468 --> 00:45:16,069
"Be careful"

433
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:17,570
Be careful..

434
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:27,502
It's like I see someone standing there, in the outlines.

435
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:29,159
Walk towards me...

436
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,381
It looks like someone smaller, like a woman..

437
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,966
Shorter.

438
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:48,000
It is in the hall, but it is not visible in that camera, it is right on the edge of the door.

439
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:54,275
And tell me, who was it that I saw lying on the floor?

440
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:57,107
"Me"

441
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,955
I'll see you there.

442
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:03,471
Come here.

443
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,031
It's cold around here.

444
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:11,210
Shit, around the face...

445
00:46:12,797 --> 00:46:17,593
I'll sit back then, and you can make that noise. Come walking in the corridor here.

446
00:46:27,547 --> 00:46:30,881
Again. I hear someone walking here.

447
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:42,000
Has something happened up here?

448
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,778
Which caused a person to die...

449
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,239
"Woman"

450
00:46:57,505 --> 00:47:00,965
I ask the question one more time, that woman...

451
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:05,160
who has been seen here, have you died in this building?

452
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,352
"Quiet"

453
00:47:06,749 --> 00:47:08,322
Quiet.

454
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:09,221
Man.

455
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,660
Yes.

456
00:47:15,323 --> 00:47:17,727
This is how we do it, Johan, I'll shut this down.

457
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:22,706
We leave and go down to Tony. I put a motion detector right here.

458
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:28,793
You know how it sounds, it's a Hello welcome. And if we hear this from downstairs...

459
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:32,876
then we know we had movement here.

460
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:43,208
I hear so many footsteps, it's like someone is walking down here.

461
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:54,150
And here, right here, when I'm standing in the room at the bottom with those knocks, like there's a girl here, just standing there.

462
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:59,503
I see the silhouette of her, because I see the window behind. She just stands and watches.

463
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:04,002
And then I hear footsteps, like someone is walking.

464
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:05,355
At the ground floor.

465
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:15,983
We put a motion detector up there now, where she has been seen. That's what it sounds like in that passage.

466
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:20,668
I'm thinking we'll remove that one, we'll put a pmb against this door.

467
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:27,955
So if you're there...

468
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:29,714
in the basement...

469
00:48:32,194 --> 00:48:34,175
that army of...

470
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:38,693
energies, get up here. Now this calibrates.

471
00:48:40,677 --> 00:48:43,412
So if something then passes by here...

472
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:46,240
we'll know when it starts playing.

473
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,609
We make sure we go up there. And we take a car with us that runs on static electricity.

474
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:57,311
We place it some distance away from us. We had static up there where that woman was lying. I think we'll put it there.

475
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:07,197
Then we'll see if it starts to go. If it reacts to static. I'll leave that chair there, mess it up a bit, we still have the pmb and the other instruments.

476
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:18,000
Plus I will take the pyramid and put it.. The Pyramid of Truth, that it will be green or red in the bed too.

477
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,286
Because it's completely different up there and we can hear the footsteps too.

478
00:49:21,286 --> 00:49:22,587
We test.

479
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:31,231
So if a static field appears, this car will run away.

480
00:49:33,248 --> 00:49:37,830
I'll put this here quickly then we'll go out and see if the car comes.

481
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,442
We'll go out here again then.

482
00:49:42,988 --> 00:49:45,652
I'll put it at the far end here.

483
00:49:51,836 --> 00:49:56,582
That figure that we saw was on the floor, can you go near this car?

484
00:49:56,582 --> 00:50:00,224
Can you put your hand on it and maybe it will come here to us?

485
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:03,026
And you who have been seen... Directly!

486
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:12,487
It went right away.

487
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:15,457
Can you put your hand on it and then... that was instant!

488
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:21,994
Try again, this is absolutely incredible. And as I said this one goes on static fields that appeared before.

489
00:50:21,994 --> 00:50:30,000
And right when I say Put your hand on this. Because we saw something lying on the floor, it looked like a woman lying on the floor.

490
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,874
And it sounded like she was saying suicide.

491
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:37,618
Green! Suicide....

492
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:40,641
Thanks!

493
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:47,060
Did you put your hand on the car now?

494
00:50:50,995 --> 00:50:54,774
It was interesting that it answered right over there.. green again!

495
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:56,229
Is it?

496
00:50:56,229 --> 00:50:59,763
That I find it interesting that it responds...

497
00:50:59,763 --> 00:51:03,323
so now Tony has put the static car back.

498
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:05,588
Are you here?

499
00:51:05,588 --> 00:51:08,540
If you're still with us here...

500
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,860
put your hand on the car one more time.

501
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,871
So you can make it go here.

502
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:22,532
Did you pass away in the hall?

503
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:25,159
Is that you we've seen?

504
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:27,642
Then do the same thing again.

505
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:34,799
There, now! Now it's static here.

506
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:40,584
Good, go out to the car there. And do the same thing again, put your hand on it.

507
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:44,422
I turn up the volume.

508
00:51:50,044 --> 00:51:54,000
Good. Just come here.

509
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,147
"Yep"

510
00:51:55,147 --> 00:51:56,190
A man.

511
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:01,394
The man who is here, do you see the car out in the hall? Can you go kick it?

512
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:16,767
See this pyramid in the bed lying there glowing? Can you put your hand to it?

513
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:25,857
Run past us here and out to this black bus.

514
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:26,716
"Away"

515
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:30,691
Just as you were talking, a man said Away.

516
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:34,860
The car!

517
00:52:42,665 --> 00:52:44,084
"Run"

518
00:52:46,928 --> 00:52:48,898
*Tony starts to feel weird*

519
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:51,397
I'm feeling sick up here.

520
00:52:51,397 --> 00:52:52,907
Are you feeling bad?

521
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:57,366
I feel it in my whole body. I almost feel ready to puke.

522
00:52:59,185 --> 00:53:05,735
I don't know if I sense something that is here. It just came and I feel dizzy too.

523
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,755
Are any of the energies in the house affecting Tony now?

524
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:16,024
Hit the wall if that's the case.

525
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:17,592
Green!

526
00:53:20,237 --> 00:53:23,319
I think I have to go out... I feel like I'm going to throw up..

527
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,415
Male voice saying "Hmm"

528
00:53:31,243 --> 00:53:35,126
It doesn't light up at all! Did they turn it off?

529
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:41,368
I'll probably go out for a bit, damn I feel sick.

530
00:53:55,455 --> 00:54:02,682
Being so affected by a house that you finally can't handle staying has never happened to us before.

531
00:54:02,682 --> 00:54:10,070
This completely unknown house to us, made us do something we had never done before in our investigations.

532
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:13,665
We had to cancel.

533
00:54:15,192 --> 00:54:22,539
Tony was so strongly affected by something inside the house, that immediately after the investigation he goes outside and vomits.

534
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:28,022
Johan feels after Tony has left the house, that he too is starting to feel strange.

535
00:54:28,022 --> 00:54:31,640
Then the decision was made to cancel.

536
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:45,690
We have subsequently thought about what actually happened. Why was Tony so strongly affected? Could it be because he asked the house to do something, on several occasions during the investigation.

537
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:59,041
When you look back at the investigation from Yrtttivaara, we see that the further into the investigation we get, Tony gets worse and worse and finally has to hold on to the table in order to continue.

538
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:06,000
What stands out during this investigation are several things, apart from Tony being affected.

539
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,560
The door to the basement opens.

540
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,078
The handle to the toilet is knocked down.

541
00:55:17,243 --> 00:55:19,677
Steps heard in the house.

542
00:55:21,215 --> 00:55:27,006
The fog in the basement that also affected the melmeter when we got there.

543
00:55:27,535 --> 00:55:37,796
What is also interesting is when we saw the dark shadow lying on the floor. Which also affected the static bus, which drives away when Niclas asks it to put his hand on it.

544
00:55:38,623 --> 00:55:44,589
But the strongest memory will be that we had to leave the house.

545
00:55:46,824 --> 00:55:56,235
The house in Yrtttivaara won over us this time, but if there is a next time, we will make sure to be more prepared for the house's dark powers.

546
00:55:56,235 --> 00:56:04,211
And that time we will not cancel.
