1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,560
Did you know that every cell is an individual organism?

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,240
You, ie your body, consist of millions of small organisms-

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,440
-O which is in constant motion and works hard around the clock.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:31,760
We have 200 types of cells in the body adapted for specific tasks.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,400
Blood cells are adapted to transport the vital oxygen.

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,720
Muscle cells form muscles so that we can move.

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,000
In spite of differences in appearance and mission-

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,200
-Have all cells identical content.

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,200
I will address the cell's most important components called organelles.

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,080
To simplify, I intend to describe the cell as a round city.

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,640
If the city was a cell it would have been minimal.

12
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:17,040
On average, a cell is a thousand millimeters in diameter. It's small.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,360
In the cell there are various social functions, such as transport routes ...

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,560
... garbage stations, power plants and factories.

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,560
Each cell contains a library-

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,680
-Where the genetic information about you is stored.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,920
Like a medieval town, the cell is protected by a thick wall, a cell membran-

18
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,440
-What seems like a clear barrier.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,960
In the wall there are receptors that work like gates with guards.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,920
It is only for specific proteins that these gates open up-

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,400
-And lets someone in, and then quickly close again.

22
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,000
It is important to keep intruders away to protect the core of the cell:

23
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,800
The city library.

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,200
Too deep in there lies our DNA-

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,320
-The decorated hoppiece and snuggled on small rolls that we call chromosomes.

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,320
The DNA itself is a long molecule made up of chemical building blocks

27
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,280
-while called nitrogen bases.

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,680
It is the order of these nitrogen bases that control our properties-

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,680
-And a sequence of this DNA string we call a gene.

30
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,440
The gene is likened to an instructional book-

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,280
-When the instructions are identical in all cell-

32
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,920
-But different genes are turned on in the different cells-

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,520
-To tell that particular cell what it should put its focus on.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,280
We call it gene regulation.

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,920
The genes that are turned on tell you what kind of cell it should be-

36
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,920
â€”Excrees a nerve cell, a skeletal cell or a skin cell-

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,160
-But also which proteins should be produced in the cell.

38
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:28,160
The protein is produced in the ribosomes that can be likened to factories.

39
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,640
Information is sent out from the genes about which protein to manufacture.

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,880
We call the production of protein protein synthesis.

41
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,600
Once finished, the proteins remain in the cell or get out into the body-

42
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,240
-To to build up tissue, an organ or to treat an infection.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,120
As I said, there are many functions in a cell besides those we talked about.

44
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,160
But there is another one we will put extra weight to: the mitochondria.

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,440
It can be likened to the city's power plant.

46
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,160
In the mitochondria, what we eat is converted into energy.

47
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,960
Sugar and fat are burned to water and carbon dioxide in its internal membrane.

48
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,200
It is folded for us to have a larger area to create energy.

49
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,480
The energy is bound to molecules, ATP, which goes out into the body.

50
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,840
It is thanks to the process that we can move, grow and think.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,120
The cell a complicated organism and without it life would not exist.

52
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,960
