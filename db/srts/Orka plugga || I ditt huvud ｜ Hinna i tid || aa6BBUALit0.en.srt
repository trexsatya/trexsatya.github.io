00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.320
Be on Time


2
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.520
Oh, God! Of course they're sitting there 
when I look like a mess!


3
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.440
Oh, my God...


4
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.080
I can do this. I don't need makeup 
to look good. Natural beauty.


5
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.960
Okay. It's going well. Smile.


6
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.240
Not that much. I want to look tough. 
I'm killing this.


7
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
Why is she walking like that?


8
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.880
-Oh... 
-She thinks she's hot.


9
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.040
-Thinks she's hot. Thinks she's hot... 
-Just walk like normal.


10
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.680
Okay. That wasn't so bad. 
You work that runway.


11
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.160
No! I'm going to be late!


12
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320
I can't be the last one in! 
Ahmed will see me looking a mess!


13
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
-Hello, Freja. 
-Hi, Stina.


14
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.920
-I really have to go. I'm in a hurry. 
-You look tired. How are you doing?


15
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.240
-Fine. 
-You had an appointment on Monday...


16
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.000
I have to go...


17
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.880
Nothing can distract me. Oh, God...


18
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.720
He's so hot! He's coming towards me!


19
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.600
He might talk to me! I look awful!


20
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.480
No, he can't see me like this. 
How can anyone be that perfect?


21
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
My hair is so greasy! 
Why won't this zit go away?


22
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.320
What's wrong with my eyebrow?


23
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.960
Oh, shit! He's checking me out!


24
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.520
Or maybe not...


25
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
You're the hottest girl in town.


26
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.680
In town? Not in the whole world?


27
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.080
-You don't get it. 
-I don't get it?


28
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.560
So now I'm stupid, too? Great, thanks. 
Really nice. Thanks.


29
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.000
Jasmin, don't leave. Let's talk...


30
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.560
-What's up? 
-Hello.


31
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.760
-I'm so ugly today. It's embarrassing. 
-God, I'm embarrassing myself.


32
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.080
My class! There's no point in going in. 
Everyone will see me.


33
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.240
