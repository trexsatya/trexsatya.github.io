1
00:00:01,305 --> 00:00:04,305
Can you get better at using

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:07,605
Photos and videos when you learn Swedish

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:11,035
I will tip that a little about in this video

4
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:15,715
Hello and welcome to Swedish with Kalle

5
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,815
I text the movie so turn on the subtitle

6
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:20,445
If you have not done so

7
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,795
and I think

8
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,935
that one can use pictures

9
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:29,925
and photos and video on very many

10
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:32,805
different ways to learn a language

11
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:35,915
and i think more and more about it because

12
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:38,875
I myself am trying to teach through instagram

13
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,965
and such movies but

14
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:44,305
Even more on Instagram where one can use

15
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:45,765
Video and movies in different ways

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,880
so my question is simply

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,160
How do you use pictures and photos and videos today

18
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:55,425
and how can you try to do in new ways

19
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:57,095
so

20
00:00:57,165 --> 00:01:00,145
A simple suggestion is that

21
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,435
you just shoot things you look around you

22
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,205
and turns up in the lexicon or asking someone

23
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:08,775
what these things are called or

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,540
You can ask a little more open

25
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,560
What can you tell about this picture?

26
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:16,425
If you want you can also get some app

27
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,245
that allows you to write in the pictures

28
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,325
So then you can take a photo and then write a word or sentence

29
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:25,345
in the picture, so that

30
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:27,595
you remember that afterwards

31
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:31,495
you could also use

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,040
video camera to, when you learn a new word,

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,920
How to film yourself and say the word

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
And then you can watch the movie again

35
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:43,265
And then you hear the word and remember it.

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,840
or you might be able to ask the person who teaches you the word

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,860
If that person can say the word

38
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,300
or pronounce the word

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,380
But a good way may be to first learn a word

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,005
or a sentence with good pronunciation

41
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:01,740
and then record yourself when you say this sentence

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,180
and so try to listen to it sometime later

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,915
I think there are a lot of things you can do

44
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:12,375
you may have some time over

45
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,555
Take a picture from a newspaper

46
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:18,405
Print a picture from the Internet

47
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,475
Look a little at the picture and write a little on it

48
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,185
It can be simple words like the "sea" and "heaven"

49
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:27,195
or “the clouds” and “the sun

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,860
or it might be a situation where something happens

51
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,180
Just think a little, how can I tell you about this picture

52
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:35,805
What words do I need, what is called

53
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:38,915
that when a person does this

54
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,300
and if you are good at drawing or painting yourself

55
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,855
so use it to train the language

56
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:48,145
Paint a beautiful landscape

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,440
and at the same time think about what the different things are called

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,580
Write a text next to or write on the picture

59
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,020
Sign up small series

60
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,000
where something happens

61
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,460
You can also share with friends who train Swedish

62
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,280
So you can use this

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,120
In order to develop the language together

64
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,760
Because I think it will be both more fun

65
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,735
But you also help the brain

66
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,295
to process the language in unkind ways

67
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:19,745
Share photos with each other

68
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:23,225
record small movies of something happening

69
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,680
Talk to the movie or write to the movie

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,625
Send the movie to your buddy

71
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,575
and write a little what's going on in the movie

72
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,980
there are certainly many ways that I have not even thought of

73
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,840
But as I said, I think pictures

74
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,500
can make it more fun

75
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:44,915
and that it can help you remember better

76
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:47,775
so think about any way or some ways

77
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:51,165
that might suit you to

78
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,905
It will be more fun and you should learn

79
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:55,775
a little more and a little faster

80
00:03:57,485 --> 00:04:00,525
Yes, I am happy to receive tips and comments

81
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:03,435
and thoughts and questions about this so

82
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:06,365
Do not hesitate, write a comment

83
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:09,845
and send to me and then I answer it when I have time

84
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,875
Thank you for listening, Hello Hello
