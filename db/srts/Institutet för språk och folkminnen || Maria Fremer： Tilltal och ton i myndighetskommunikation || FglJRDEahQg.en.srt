1
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:09.120
Hey all.
 Fun to talk to you all from my home office in Helsinki.

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.160
The subject of my lecture today is address and tone in government communication.

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.360
I have promised to move in the past and show examples of how to do before

4
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.080
before we get back to the present again.
 The background to this is -

5
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.320
That I wrote a dissertation that is about addressing in commercials from the 20th century.

6
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.880
Advertising films are something other than government communication

7
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.640
But the collection I work with consists of over 400 films.

8
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.840
Among them are some that were not common commercials

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.640
Without rather information films directed from authorities to the public.

10
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.880
The purpose of this dissertation was to illuminate the Dure form -

11
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.080
So I particularly looked at what kind of speech used -

12
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.400
When you turn directly to the viewer, and how the tone generally became more informal -

13
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.200
with the 1960s as a kind of breaking point in development.

14
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.480
There are crucial differences between government films and ordinary commercials.

15
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.640
The most important thing is that commercial players sell

16
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.800
while authorities rather inform.

17
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.800
But on the other hand you can say that informative is also about selling

18
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.040
If not products, at least ideas, attitudes and concepts.

19
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.560
So you want to influence recipients, get the viewer to watch out in traffic, vote in the election

20
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.360
Eat healthy, stop sipping and start exercising.

21
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.200
Both advertising and the information films use classic rhetorical grip -

22
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.880
Like ethos, logos and pathos.

23
00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.440
Ethos means that you convince through your person, e.g.
 by showing experts.

24
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
Logos means that you appeal to reason.

25
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.880
It is perhaps a more common grip for authorities

26
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.080
While pathos - that you appeal to emotion - is more typical of commercial actors.

27
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.480
The history of the film began in the late 1800s.

28
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.600
They soon realized the film's potential for the advertising industry.

29
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.480
The oldest Swedish commercials are silent films that were made around 1915.

30
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.240
The oldest government films I have found are also from that time.

31
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.120
There is admittedly even older movie reports

32
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.680
which depicts royalty and other dignitaries who visit different places.

33
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.960
They are perhaps also a kind of government films

34
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.440
But around 1915 you found out that you could appeal to the viewer more direct -

35
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.840
And influence the viewer, instead of just showing something impressive that happened.

36
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.280
Here you can see some examples of films that represent social information

37
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.840
directly from an authority or some other public and public benefit.

38
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.040
In a while you will see examples from a couple of these movies.

39
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.800
But there are lots of films similar to government films

40
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.600
Although they are not really.

41
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.640
The so-called housewives films made from the 50s to the 70s-

42
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.360
Consists of cavalcades of longer and shorter elements.

43
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.680
There, advertising is interspersed.
 information and entertainment.

44
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.840
The Savings Banks Movement has extensive campaigns

45
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.760
which up to the 70s is about saving, not wasting.

46
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.040
Insurance companies can also make films that seem slightly more enlightened.

47
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.320
For example, they want
 prevent accidents.

48
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.680
When it comes to elections, political parties make films where they analyze society

49
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.880
and urges the viewer to vote.

50
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.320
But today I will concentrate on authorities

51
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.960
And on how new media has provided new opportunities.

52
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:22.800
A very early evidence of discussion about this can be found in the magazine Idun in 1918.

53
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.640
Then food and fuel shortages were severe throughout Europe, including in Sweden.

54
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.080
There was a great need to inform about the situation.

55
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.000
You made journal films where you got to see ringing queues with people waiting for

56
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.760
to get a ration bread or something similar.

57
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.120
But it was also found that the film could be used to teach people in

58
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.800
How to deal with this deficiency.

59
00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.120
This article from March 1918 is actually about rational housekeeping and film.

60
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.400
The newest Christian education.
 Here we see pictures of how to fry herring without fat.

61
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.880
How to use a very ordinary sleeve case and a hat box for savings.

62
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.360
And how to fry plates of potato flakes, obviously in a tiled stove.

63
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.840
I want to highlight a quote from this article.

64
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.240
(Reading the text)

65
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.200
When I found the quote was the first thing I did to find Fairbanks and Love

66
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.360
Because I wanted something to compare with -

67
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.840
When I then looked at the Food Board's teaching film -

68
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.040
Which is about how to cook and bake bread in the stove.

69
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.520
I would very much like to show it to you, but it is five minutes long

70
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.800
So you have to find it yourself if you are curious.

71
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.000
But what happens in the movie is quite typically

72
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.920
Something that occurs in commercials and housewife films throughout the 20th century.

73
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.600
First we have the Etoskomponent, the male expert who demonstrates for us -

74
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.280
How a special cooking box is designed.

75
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.680
Then we get to see a female housekeeper who uses the box.

76
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.200
In the film, there are no middle texts and thus no direct address to the viewer.

77
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.800
A few times she looks into the camera and meets our gaze, this young woman

78
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.360
Who has been commissioned to show us how to do when cooking in the stove.

79
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.280
The Food Board's tiled stove film from 1917 thus only shows how to do it.

80
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.840
It does not appeal to our emotions, and it completely lacks middle texts

81
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.200
So that turmoil is not the viewer.

82
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.560
When you appeal to the viewer's feelings, amuse and worry

83
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.840
Can be used to be informal and tell you to the viewer also in the very oldest films.

84
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.200
In fun movies you can build up a fictional intimacy.
 You pretend to be friends with the viewer.

85
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.640
But you can also say you in the most serious context.

86
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.960
It may sound a little surprising, but it seems that really seriously leads to

87
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.360
To peel away all courtesy forms.

88
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.840
We find it in many war -time newspaper ads where you want to encourage Swedes -

89
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.960
To donate money to Finland or stand up as volunteers in the war.

90
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.560
These ads appeal to the reader with you.
 It also makes a road safety campaign.

91
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.800
This movie, which is also a little too long for this context

92
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.240
begins with neutral factual reason arguments -

93
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.640
While we get to see a scene that ends with us seeing a child being hit by a car -

94
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:36.200
in the lively Stockholm traffic.
 At the end, the film turns to a purely pathos-grip-

95
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.600
Where you convince the viewer of the seriousness of this issue with direct you-speech to the viewer.

96
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.080
We see a police officer standing with the lifeless child in their arms

97
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.240
and hear the narrator voice saying:

98
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.520
(Reading the text)

99
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.000
The very direct speech and the dumby -

100
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.320
Certainly could have been perceived as excessive in the 40s.

101
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.840
But because of the deeply serious message, it still works.

102
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.200
Dure form is not the only change in the 1960s.

103
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.360
One can see at the same time partially overlapping, but completely revolving changes

104
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:46.600
which is usually called informalization, democracy, intimisation and conversation.

105
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:54.920
Dure form is the clearest linguistic cursor, but it happens much more.

106
00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.080
This is seen in the films of time that began to use a completely different tone

107
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.240
towards the recipient.

108
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.960
This is an example from the year 1967

109
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.320
When you switched from left -hand traffic to right -hand traffic.

110
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.600
A little info film that reminds the viewer of

111
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.480
That you have to sharpen so that you do not end up on the wrong side when driving in traffic.

112
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.120
I'll play it for you.

113
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.520
Here we can note many new features compared to old films.

114
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.840
That i have colored with green in the text

115
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.160
Are especially clear markers for a new informal and free style.

116
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.120
"Oh you" Here you are used for the viewer, but not as a common address -

117
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.640
but as soon as a discourse marker.

118
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.400
"Mary mode" time -typical youth language, I think.

119
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.680
"So you don't have to do away with it."

120
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.640
Here the movie has the stomach to suggest that the viewer could do away with traffic.

121
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.640
A statement that would hardly have been possible ten years earlier.

122
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.920
We can also note the cameraman's vacant upholstery and hairstyle.

123
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.120
The new spirit permeates everything.

124
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.080
Both the previous example of right -hand traffic and this one about voting

125
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.680
are examples of a new grip that you can call "behind the scenes".

126
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.320
Instead of showing off a grounded end product

127
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.000
If you show something that will represent an insight into the process.

128
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.720
He who is in the middle of the picture is Gottfried Grafström.

129
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:44.160
He has written a script that is evaluated by actor Birgitta Andersson to the right.

130
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.960
She thinks the script lacks humor and now you should see it.

131
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.040
But there is also a type of government film that is much more straightforward

132
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.800
Teaching and educating.

133
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.760
A splendid example of this was served by the National Board of Health and Welfare in 1975.

134
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.680
This one in itself well - the film today looks so absurd out -

135
00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.920
that it has rolled around in social media where it has been commented and discussed.

136
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.240
Often by today's youth who think it is absolutely sick to tell this way

137
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.920
How to do it, into the smallest detail.

138
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.920
Some of you have certainly seen it, but hopefully not too many.

139
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.160
This grip that serves detailed good advice for the viewer

140
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.160
Of course have their good and bad sides.

141
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.440
The purpose was good.

142
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.200
They wanted equality, equality, democratization.

143
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.000
A healthy and happy population that could work hard for Sweden's best.

144
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.760
But this type of government information can easily and with good reasons

145
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:06.600
accused of standardization, requirements for uniformity, detailed control of privacy -

146
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.400
touch sticks and a kind of unauthorized declaration of the citizen.

147
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.520
This is certainly why this film has later been divided and discussed in social media

148
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.680
Where today's young people think it is absolutely incredible.

149
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.560
This is exactly what I do not think our authorities are guilty of today.

150
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.840
But that does not mean that we should be completely uncritical to all new opportunities

151
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.880
that opens up for us ... (sound loss)

152
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.880
The social media today, has become a bit like the movie was a hundred years ago.

153
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:46.720
It is new, you can experiment with new forms of appeal and tone to citizens.

154
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.360
You can fail with it, and then you can easily be perceived as manipulative.

155
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.600
When borrowing languages and other forms from the private sphere

156
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.320
It becomes more difficult for the recipient to identify power.

157
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:06.400
The link between democratization and informalization is not at all obvious.

158
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.600
But when the new form experiments succeed

159
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.880
Could it be an astonishingly effective way to reach out with information -

160
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.160
by packing it in an attractive cover.
 Thanks.
