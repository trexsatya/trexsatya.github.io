1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,120
But then there are some who have thought about a lot.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,080
They live louder, strange, more beautiful and more remarkable than everyone else.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome to seven accommodation that you have never seen before.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,160
So, I have sent out a search Now just wait for tips for really cool housing.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,840
Hello?

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,520
The highest apartment in Sweden.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
We will, we will, we will, we will.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
We have to pull.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,680
Okay, we're heading to Malmö for our very first visit.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,800
And we will do this as a top list, only up to number one.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,280
But we start with number seven.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,680
And what you will see now, it's probably something really extra.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,200
And now we are finally here, my ladies and gentlemen.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
At nothing less than ...

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Turning Torso.

16
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:08.633
We are not going into any apartment. We are going into the highest apartment.

17
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,693
Not only in Turning Torso, but throughout Sweden.

18
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:16,785
Hello. There is no apartment in Sweden that is higher than where we are going now?

19
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,967
- No, there is not this is the highest.

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,200
- Oh, Satan, what a speed.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,880
Hello! Are you living at the top of Sweden?

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,080
Oh my God! Are you kidding me?

23
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,760
We are so high up!

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,440
How do you best use this? What to do here?

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,218
- Takes a beer in front of the view?

26
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:49,320
- Do you do it?

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,920
- Yes! Do you want a beer?

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes!

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00.920
Welcome!

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,920
- What benefits do you get from living at the top of Sweden?

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,920
- It's damn good to say.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,920
- To say to ...

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,920
- Just everyone.

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,920
- A cloudy shit day.

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,920
So you get up here and you see sun.

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,360
- So some rainy days you take the elevator up and then it is sun again.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
And the clouds are below you.

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,240
- You can stand down here on the ground, see the sunset go down.

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,720
Run in, the elevator up and see it again.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,240
YES!

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,520
Here we have the gym. If you look over to Denmark like that. Do you think ...

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,800
Fy damn, what much better we are than them.

43
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48.931
- I don't want to stop before you.

44
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:50,042
- Hahahahaha

45
00:02:51,843 --> 00:02:57,992
- Now William has fixed an incredibly exclusive access to the roof of Turning Torso.

46
00:02:57,992 --> 00:03:00,280
Is it dangerous this?

47
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,139
- Oh oh oh!

48
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:14,139
- Oh, damn!

49
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,078
- You fucking jokes with me huh.

50
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,080
- It's really fucking loud.

51
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:22,382
- Here we sit well.

52
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,352
- Here we are damn good.

53
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:26,382
- Look there is my photographer.

54
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:28,352
- Hello!

55
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:32,321
When we are still at such a height, I felt it was time to call in-

56
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,321
-Sweden master in paper aircraft.

57
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,744
Welcome in, Filip Bergkvist!

58
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,800
I am Philip Bergqvist, 22 years old and am Swedish champion in paper aircraft-

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
-And even the top 20 in the world.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,800
- Okay, each airplane, each throw, who is coming the longest?

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
1, 2, 3!

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
- Oh! It falls like a ... oh!

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Oh, that one!

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Oh! Oh!

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05.800
Oh what it goes!

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07.800
No! Is it coming now?

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09.800
Yes! It landed on the roof!

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,800
The wind takes it!

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
The wind takes it!

70
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
- It's at ICA, in the square!

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,800
- It is still a highlight that my plan, because it did not look good, would come further than yours.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Then it's time for the Swedish Master.

73
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Do your thing.

74
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
No, look what it sails!

75
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
- Oh damn!

76
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,840
- You are joking! Check!

77
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
- It's halfway to Helsingborg!

78
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
No, but are you kidding!

79
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Check!

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
We have a winner!

81
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52.840
Congratulations!

82
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Now I'm going to move on.

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
- See you.

84
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,960
- Hey Hey hey!

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
- Then you take that way yes.

86
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00.960
- Off, this actually feels scary.

87
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
- Then just climb down.

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09.960
This is scary.

89
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:18,588
And while I am freeing up there, it is time for us to go towards the number six.

90
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:20,588
Which is...

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,000
We are heading towards Borlänge. And what we are going to it is no ordinary boat.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,320
It is a guy who built a house that can go on the water.

93
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:40,296
Then we were there. This is what a house should not look like.

94
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:41,980
What kind of house? Hello!

95
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,782
Hello!

96
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:43,659
- Well!

97
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:48,219
- Nice. It's like I almost meet myself.

98
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
- You're a little longer and a little red hair.

99
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
- Yes exactly.

100
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Then it's time to step on this bathboy.

101
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,280
- It is a kitchen, living room, dining room and so here is the lounge corner.

102
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
- How do you get electricity?

103
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
It's from the batteries. Crashed electric car.

104
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,399
Great.

105
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,720
- You have a washing machine?

106
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,690
With built -in dryer.

107
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,330
- It should not be the boat.

108
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,330
- No, it should be a house.

109
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,280
- It should be a nice apartment.

110
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
- Imagine this ... Come and sit down.

111
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Yes, come.

112
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
To have this as a living room.

113
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
- That's how it is.

114
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Is there any boat in the way? No.

115
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
- Just that, you control in parallel here.

116
00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:32,796
It is a constantly ongoing-

117
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:34,796
-mindfuck to see a living room-

118
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:36,280
-Oka around like this on the lake.

119
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:39,586
What a small boat you have!

120
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,556
Superpathetic!

121
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,200
Hahaha, now you have to be nice Mauri!

122
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:50,464
- Now we're going to eat ice cream. Come and we eat ice cream.

123
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,760
- Oh, what are you doing? You're so heaven ...

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55.960
Hello? You are so athletic!

125
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00.560
- Send the ice cream.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01.880
- Oh, you're greedy.

127
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,320
- Yes, I want ice cream.

128
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,280
- You may not get any ice cream today.

129
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,520
- Then you must not be up here.

130
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
- No, okay, you get the ice cream.

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
- Summer and sun.

132
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
It's cozy.

133
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,760
- How much sunscreen do you need to use like this?

134
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,160
- So damn much.

135
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,000
- Then I came up with an idea.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Hi, it's Mauri.

137
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
- Yes, serve Mauri.

138
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,640
- My friend Billy Tang has a restaurant in Falun.

139
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,360
What happens if you order food delivery from him for a house that is in the lake?

140
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,720
So now Billy Tang was completely unknown to deliver food to your house that today stands in the middle of the lake.

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,880
- It's going to be great.

142
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,160
- Hey!

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,080
- Hi Billy!

144
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,600
This guy lives. His house is on sea.

145
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,280
- Well.

146
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55.880
- And we want food delivery. I'm sorry.

147
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,240
- How should I come over here?

148
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02.600
- It's a bit what you are here to solve. There may be some canoe there.

149
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:12,438
- What happens?

150
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:13,556
- That boat is too small.

151
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,556
Other problems. I can not swim.

152
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:17,617
It's so small.

153
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:19,587
Hey! Do you have a boat or?

154
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:21,387
Do you have a boat so you can drive?

155
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:23,339
Yes.

156
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,726
- Are you going to the houseboat?

157
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:25,486
- Yes.

158
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,516
- Why can't the houseboat just come here?

159
00:08:27,516 --> 00:08:29,516
- Good question.

160
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:31,661
Mauri! Why can't you come here? Why do I have to get there?

161
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
- It looks like he's a little angry with us.

162
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,240
- But you look like he gets good help from others as well.

163
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,880
- I don't really know what is happening now.

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,400
- Look! Will the boat come!

165
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,880
Yes, no one can fool Billy you know!

166
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,400
I know exactly, you know.

167
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,920
Hello! Thousand thanks!

168
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,200
Thanks thanks thanks!

169
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Hello!

170
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49.560
Hello!

171
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,400
Hello!

172
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52.840
Thanks thanks thanks!

173
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,880
Mauri I'm coming!

174
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,760
- Hi, Billy!

175
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
- Hello!

176
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,200
- Billy?

177
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,680
- Yes?

178
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,280
- Where are you going? We are here!

179
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,400
- Bye!

180
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00.367
- Billy stop!

181
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01.616
- We are going to Stockholm!

182
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:03,400
- No, you are not going to Stockholm!

183
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04.600
Where are you going?

184
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,120
- Hello Hello!

185
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Hello, serve! Thanks thanks thanks!

186
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
- Billy!

187
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,120
- Hahahaha!

188
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
- Hi! We'll dance!

189
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
- Shall we Dance?

190
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
- A beautiful girl!

191
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Is she free?

192
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
- No, not free Billy!

193
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
- Cheers for the world's most difficult food delivery ever?

194
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
- Thank you for visiting Dalarna in Falun.

195
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Thanks thanks thanks!

196
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,428
Oh Mr. Mauri!

197
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Hahaha!

198
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,440
Okay, we're on our way to Örebro and a couple who apparently live in a fairly ordinary house.

199
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,920
But according to themselves, their downstairs should have something that no one else has.

200
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52.880
- Okay, then we are there and I don't know what to expect for me.

201
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,680
The only thing I know is that in that house live a couple who really insisted on that-

202
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02.040
-I should come here and see something. So we simply get to see what the hell is the question.

203
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06.080
- Hello!

204
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07.560
- Hello the gang!

205
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09.560
- Welcome home to us!

206
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
- Oh, you were almost completely sync.

207
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,240
Most often now I have known where I am going, but you have not really wanted to say what it is.

208
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,000
- No, but it should be experienced.

209
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,640
- Exactly. It will be a surprise, without its equally I think.

210
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
Now I dare to hit the big drum!

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,280
- What the hell are you have then? You look so damn crazy.

212
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,920
- I think it's time.

213
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,480
- God, what an exciting.

214
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,800
- Then we drive then.

215
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,480
- Yeah.

216
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
- It feels annoying.

217
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,200
- Oh damn.

218
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,400
- Research shows that oxytocin, the love hormone is increasing in social contexts.

219
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,840
- This section is in paid collaboration with Lohmanders.

220
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:02,280
- Mauri! Focus now. In any case, it activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

221
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
As...

222
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Well ...

223
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:16,320
What I am trying to say is that research shows that spending time with families and friends is the best thing you can do for your well -being.

224
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,440
And best is a joint dinner!

225
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,360
Come then we will practice sauce for real. Follow here!

226
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,840
Then we spent the evening practicing sauce,--

227
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,440
-The also the doctrine of creating memorable dinners together.

228
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,920
And we could do nothing but pay tribute to Professor Lohmander,-

229
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44.560
-Not just for his outstanding research, but also for the sauces he offers.

230
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
Invite your friends at dinner you with and serve them.

231
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,280
Lohmander's new barbeque!

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,520
Oh, damn!

233
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01.080
Oh, damn!

234
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,120
Are you kidding or?

235
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,960
Oh God!

236
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06.708
It must be worth millions?

237
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07.762
- Ah that's a lot, we can say.

238
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,360
- It is difficult to take in everything that is in here.

239
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
Can you show me?

240
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,880
Yes, that is a clock combined with a display.

241
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,640
Then we have the thick TV screens.

242
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,040
The proof that I won a Nintendo SM.

243
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,760
This is a Nintendo 8-bit. Here you have an old Vectrex.

244
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,920
You get a little enchanted, but wizard when you look.

245
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,920
- Do you become?

246
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,160
It's so damn much stuff.

247
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:44,079
Now I died again, Emilie ...

248
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,009
- ah then we put this down

249
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:46,600
- Would you say I'm unusually bad at Pac-Man?

250
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,400
- Gosh. Nah.

251
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,280
- Now you have to choose a character here.

252
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,800
- They are completely bare -breasted.

253
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,360
- Oops. It might be ...

254
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02.600
- Why does David look so stressed that this was the first attitude?

255
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,040
Lots of bare -breasted women

256
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Who played this last?

257
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
David!

258
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
- Here we have part of the Metroid collection.

259
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,320
We have also named our child after this heroine.

260
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,200
His name is Samus Aran. Our first guys had to find the Aran.

261
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,200
- Lufia is actually our daughter named after.

262
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,200
It is also one that is warm to us.

263
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,880
- You really love this.

264
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,280
- We really love video games. It was also as I said we met.

265
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
About 18 years ago.

266
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,880
- You feel like an absolutely perfect couple.

267
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
So because you are so similar in this.

268
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
- It was delightful.

269
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,280
- And with that, maybe I start to thank me here.

270
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Because I have to return to the editorial staff.

271
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,880
No no no no. Mrs. Andersson. Mrs. Andersson!

272
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,280
I want to sell a subscription to you in the National Geographic magazine.

273
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
One second.

274
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Hello?

275
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Mauricio, we have a tip!

276
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,080
- We are heading towards Malmö, where you should see Sweden's perhaps least glamorous accommodation-

277
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,080
-Hos one of Skåne's absolute best characters.

278
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,080
And now we are in Malmö and he is not here.

279
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,080
He is and eats lunch in Skillingaryd unfortunately.

280
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,080
So I have to wait now for two hours about in Malmö.

281
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,208
Have you ever waited this long for something?

282
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,080
! Hello!

283
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
- Hey!

284
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,080
- Long time no see.

285
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,520
- We met so a year ago when we played in a program.

286
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,640
Then it is mostly about being the man who says ...

287
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,920
- I smoke myself as long as I think it's good.

288
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,040
- And if I had a bad thing, I quit.

289
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
- Yes, it's a hateful version of it today.

290
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,280
But what we didn't really talk about then ...

291
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,960
You are one of the few people in Sweden who do not have like an apartment, a townhouse or a villa.

292
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,520
It's nothing like that.

293
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,440
- Yes, but that's nothing. What the hell am I going to with you to?

294
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,080
- No what the hell is going to ...

295
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09.400
- It's nothing fun.

296
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
- It's not so damn fun.

297
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,840
- No.

298
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,040
- You live instead.

299
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,120
Here. It's not a townhouse this.

300
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,800
- Why should you do like everyone else?

301
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,720
Do as you please.

302
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,000
- And this is what you want?

303
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,280
- Yes otherwise I would not have done it.

304
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,160
- No.

305
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,680
- Then I had done something else.

306
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
- And now I think you should show your home.

307
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,760
There it is!

308
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,480
There it is!

309
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Oh, soft and nice.

310
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,760
It is really just this picture we need to show.

311
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,440
There are not so many more rooms.

312
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,720
- No no, just a room.

313
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,240
With clothes and cigarettes.

314
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Yes, yes, yes.

315
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,632
You must zoom in.

316
00:15:46,632 --> 00:15:47,602
- Zoom in?

317
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:48,240
- The cigarettes

318
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
- We can ask me photographer and so maybe he is kind and he zooms in.

319
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,240
- So he zooms them in so that it seems.

320
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
- And just then you take a cig?

321
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
- Yes of course.

322
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
- It is obvious.

323
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,240
- I get so curious, how much is this worth?

324
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,240
And that's why I brought in a broker from Malmö.

325
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
So now I'm going to value your home.

326
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
- Yes, she can do it.

327
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
- Welcome in, Nicole Svensson!

328
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
- Hello!

329
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
- You smoke in here?

330
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
- Yes exactly.

331
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,240
- But smoke smell and tobacco, you can still find another clientele.

332
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,240
So now I'll just inventory a little here and such.

333
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Good smart storage.

334
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
But I still thought it was a nice choice of materials.

335
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
And here you have your lounge corner.

336
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
- Just that, you see it as a lounge corner.

337
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,320
Yes, I see good material choices here.

338
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,760
Then he has slightly different materials together.

339
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,400
I also see that *mum * *mum *

340
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,400
It's a kyling stand.

341
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,480
It's good, smart storage.

342
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,575
- Do we have a collaboration?

343
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:02.555
- Yes, of course we have!

344
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,400
- Yes, what a wonderful!

345
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
- No, it turned green again.

346
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,680
- huh? Which?

347
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
- What a flow!

348
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,120
- Life smiles at you!

349
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
- Yes!

350
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
- Are you Sweden's freest person?

351
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,120
- It actually feels like you are.

352
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Hehehehe!

353
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Now we are at Ribbersborg.

354
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
- Here you usually sleep?

355
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,400
- Yes.

356
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
- This was no bad view.

357
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
- Could it be worse?

358
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
It can be.

359
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
But can it be better?

360
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
- Exactly. Maybe may I sleep with this?

361
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,680
- There will be no place. It gets a little bad place.

362
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,640
- Is there a heart room? - So there is one located on the floor.

363
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,960
- It is just to bed down. - Was this all the evening routine?

364
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,920
- This is not entirely uncomfortable. - Yes, it goes.

365
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
- This is no problem.

366
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
- No it goes.

367
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,920
- Now we are heading towards Östermalm in Stockholm where they have started a scientific housing experiment.

368
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Researchers want to test how to fit more people on a smaller surface without impairing their quality of life.

369
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,520
Now we will simply go and see how this social experiment has gone.

370
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,560
And here is the place.

371
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
- Hello!

372
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,320
- Tjena, Mauri! -Hello!

373
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,840
- Is this somewhere else in Sweden? - No, this is quite new.

374
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,280
We are 52 people living here together.

375
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,200
It started a bit like a social experiment.

376
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,480
Resources were also given from different institutes.

377
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
- Now someone is coming home.

378
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,120
- Yes, here we have David.

379
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,620
- The situation?

380
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,320
- Yes that is good.

381
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,820
It is good.

382
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,620
Do you like well here too?

383
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,980
- It's absolutely fantastic.

384
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,280
- But can you walk around and look around?

385
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,780
- Absolutely.

386
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,120
- Are you with us now?

387
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,980
Are you in the gang?

388
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,143
- yes I simply hang with

389
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,280
- And here are these pods.

390
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,080
- These are four small huts, you might say.

391
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,980
- Oh.

392
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
In here you live?

393
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,280
- Surely it is a little vibe anyway?

394
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
- It's a bit vibe.

395
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,980
Here you still have a room.

396
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,480
- Yes.

397
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,760
- Here we have another room where we ... there are six people who share rooms.

398
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,720
This is probably the most minimalist, as well. The option available here.

399
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,480
-Hello! -Hello!

400
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,240
-Can you play? - Yes, I can do.

401
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,120
- The flower time is coming? - No, I can't.

402
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Kind of like that.

403
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:50,280
Yes, otherwise I live here with my roommate Raj.

404
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
- Right.

405
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,052
- And here a lot of food is cooked.

406
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:15,052
What are you cooking?

407
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:15,991
Potato.

408
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:16,991
Potato?

409
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:23,143
And now everyone is at the table.

410
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,240
And this is some kind of fuck then type?

411
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:30,295
After all, we have all prepared and brought with us a right.

412
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,080
Right.

413
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,104
After all, I haven't brought anything with me ...

414
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,280
I can't run and buy something. Should I do it or?

415
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Is there any restaurant?

416
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,007
Is there anything I can get really fast? What goes fastest!

417
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:50,248
- I'm doing raw beef now!

418
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:51,397
- A raw beef?

419
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,058
Oh it's done, it's done!

420
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:52,600
Thanks thanks thanks!

421
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Bye!

422
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:57,762
Raw steak!

423
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,480
Raw steak!

424
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:04,123
Everyone can watch.

425
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:06.022
Let it wander.

426
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:07.713
They took 300 bucks for that one.

427
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:08.837
- For real?

428
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:09,762
- Yes 300

429
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:11,133
- Hahaha

430
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,910
Did you buy raw beef for 300 bucks?

431
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,430
- What was I supposed to do?

432
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:23,620
Hello?

433
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:25,882
Hello?

434
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:28,417
Hello?

435
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:30,964
Hello?

436
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:32,504
Hello?

437
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
We are heading towards Vadstena in Östergötland.

438
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,200
There is a house that is built in a greenhouse.

439
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
It sounds really strange.

440
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
But it is such a sickly brilliant trick they have come up with.

441
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,200
This means that they have tropical heat at home with them year -round in Sweden.

442
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,320
And here it is a house in a greenhouse.

443
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
And now it's time to step in, my ladies and gentlemen.

444
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
I stand out. It's cold.

445
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,280
Soon I step into as well as a tropical climate.

446
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,160
I step into a new world as well.

447
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Oh!

448
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,640
Oh, it's like flying to Mallorca in two seconds.

449
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,760
It's so nice in here. It's really strange.

450
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,200
Swedish cold. It's really another world in here.

451
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,160
Oh, there are people. Hello!

452
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,600
-Good morning. -Good morning. Do you live here, your fucking.

453
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,200
It feels like I'm in northern Italy. It really does.

454
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
There are some sitting and eating breakfast outdoors.

455
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,000
All of us others are just loosers compared to you.

456
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
- Yes, but weather in any case.

457
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,800
This spring there was half a meter of snow and we had 25-26 degrees in here.

458
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
So you can't complain.

459
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,400
- You have, like fucked with the whole system.

460
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,600
It is intended that you live in Sweden so you get a good welfare system and a functioning society.

461
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,000
But unfortunately it is cold.

462
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You get a good welfare system and tropical heat all year.

463
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,560
- The heat rises so that we usually say that here is northern Italy.

464
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,360
And the higher up you get closer to Cyprus.

465
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
- Your sick bastard.

466
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,880
How hot is this?

467
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,200
- 29, 30.

468
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,400
- Oh!

469
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,800
- Here it got even warmer.

470
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,960
- Yes, it's hot now.

471
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,680
- It is very hot.

472
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,200
- I completely forgot that it is type 12 degrees outside.

473
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
In here it is 32 degrees.

474
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,360
I am getting sunbathing for real.

475
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,160
- Yes, we go down.

476
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,560
- Can we have shade?

477
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,840
- Yes of course. We go down to Italy. We fly to Italy.

478
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
- We are going to Italy instead.

479
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
But show me more. Show me everything.

480
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,080
Apricot, peaks, vines here, figs, Japanese misleads.

481
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,880
Here you have a mango and here you have my avocado tree.

482
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,240
- Is that there a lemon you have grown?

483
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,280
- Yes, it hangs on the tree too. Now the new is blooming, so it comes all the time.

484
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
- Look! Your very own lemon.

485
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08.960
- Should you taste it?

486
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
- Yes please!

487
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Bowl!

488
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
- It's like you've started a new land-

489
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
-in another country-

490
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
-It's almost the emotion-

491
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
-The bowl for you and you and for what you have done.

492
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
- Thanks! And funny that you are here.

493
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
- Fun to be here.

494
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:38,240
- I have a long time in my life a dream.

495
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,400
I have always dreamed of literally being allowed to throw stones in glass houses.

496
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,240
Yes!

497
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,240
- I am so tired of redheads who will do a thing that they are red -haired.

498
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,360
- I'm so tired of all Iranians that are so successful.

499
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,000
- It's stone in glass houses! Now it's stone in glass houses!

500
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:14,739
And now, my ladies and gentlemen, it's time for place number one.

501
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:26,856
And now we are soon in Knivsta for place number one for our Grande Finale.

502
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Oh my God!

503
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,640
What a building!

504
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Damn!

505
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So check!

506
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What is this?

507
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It is one of the sickest you have seen.

508
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Hello!

509
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
- Tjena, welcome.

510
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
- Mauri.

511
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
- Henry.

512
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
- Nice.

513
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,666
Yes, here he is. Henry.

514
00:25:56,666 --> 00:26:00,000
Which a few years ago found a decline in a water tower no one wanted.

515
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,002
Then he rebuilt it completely and created Sweden's perhaps most spectacular accommodation.

516
00:26:06,944 --> 00:26:07.942
- So, you live here?

517
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09.610
- Up there.

518
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
After all, we have fixed this ourselves.

519
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:14,701
Yes, this was my toughest mission ever.

520
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:15,701
- I can imagine.

521
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,640
- Oh.

522
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Oh oh oh.

523
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,671
- This is awesome.

524
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:21,671
- You live here?

525
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:22,701
- Exactly.

526
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,600
- But my God, how high we come.

527
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
This is the first of your three floors?

528
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
- The first of three floors, yes.

529
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,600
- And there you have a sauna, your bastard.

530
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
This is kind of a shovel department.

531
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Here we have a sauna, bathroom.

532
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
- The next floor then?

533
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,520
It is so neat everything and so this view.

534
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01.079
- Well, Mauri. Sit down. I'll show one thing.

535
00:27:02,242 --> 00:27:06,362
- There comes a TV. It just slides up there in front of us.

536
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
Do you look a lot on Youtube?

537
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,919
No, but I've been looking at you. I am impressed.

538
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:12,760
- Is it true?

539
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,760
- If you sit there and press a button there.

540
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
- God!

541
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
- Where are you going now? Now you go around and have yourself ...

542
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
- Exactly, and then I can ...

543
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,760
- And here is a staircase if you do not want to take a lift here.

544
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Oh oh oh.

545
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,760
- Then we have a small balcony here too.

546
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
This is how you can follow the sun.

547
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,200
- Can tourists sometimes come and foot and so?

548
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,880
- Yes, we have almost daily.

549
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
- You are a tourist attraction as well.

550
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
- Yes, it has become.

551
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Just.

552
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,000
- If you were to sell this today, what's worth it?

553
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,640
It is very difficult to value.

554
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,550
- If I say 40 million?

555
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,550
- Yes we can think about it.

556
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,160
- It must be in those hooks.

557
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,280
- It is in those levels.

558
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,920
- Yes, it's more.

559
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09.640
- But had we had it on a total contract with a larger construction company.

560
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
Then it had cost ...

561
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,520
Incredible money then.

562
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,020
- Mmm

563
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
- Here you have one ..

564
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,960
- A cold IPA after the sauna.

565
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,040
- Is it you and I who take a sauna and a little pool with an IPA in my hand?

566
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,440
- Just right!

567
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,720
- Is that what we should do now?

568
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
- Yes, the sauna is warm.

569
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
- This is not entirely wrong!

570
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,920
- No fuck then.

571
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,920
- Just enjoy.

572
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
- Not completely wrong.

573
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
- Cheers.

574
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
- Cheers. Nice, Mauri.

575
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,920
- Thank you for visiting us. Thank you for looking at us.

576
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
Subscribe to the channel with Mauri.

577
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,920
I have done it and it is absolutely wonderful.

578
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,920
I adore him.

579
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
- No stop!

580
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Give you!

581
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,558
- But you have to get praise too.

582
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:06.817
- Yes, but I get embarrassed.
