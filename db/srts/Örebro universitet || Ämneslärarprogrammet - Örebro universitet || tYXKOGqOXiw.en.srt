1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
- Are you nervous? - Yes, a little neighbor but it will be fun!

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,360
- Yes, it will go well!

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,760
- Hello! My name is Felicia and plugs the subject teacher program,

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,280
with a focus on sports and health, and English.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,680
I plug in semester eight.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,000
- My name is Jhat and I also plug the subject teacher program.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,520
My subjects are sports and health, and history. Semester eight.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,360
I chose to plug the subject teacher program,

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,000
because when I went to high school I had

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,640
A great relationship with my mentors and teachers.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,520
Somewhere I felt I wanted to emulate that relationship,

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
And work with students that way.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
That's what mainly drove me to choose this program.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
I don't know what it was like for you?

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52.640
- I also chose this program because I wanted to work with young people.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,600
Enjoy that relationship.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,280
Then I chose sports as first topic,

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,760
Because I have always loved sports.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07.680
The subject teacher program is a program that you plug for five years.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
It corresponds to ten semesters.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,920
The specializations you choose depend on which topics you want to read.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,640
- I have sports and health as first subject and history as second subject.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,080
I read sports in four semesters and history for three semesters.

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
Then there is pedagogy in between too.

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,120
During the program, I gain a deeper knowledge of my subjects.

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37.560
For me, it's sports and history.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,840
If I take history as an example, I get a deeper knowledge of historical events,

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,600
And year. But also how I teach them to the students.

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,320
- Then we have a lot of pedagogy in teaching as well.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,840
Where we learn about relationship creation with students, which is incredibly important.

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,680
And so we gain even more knowledge about how to teach to the students so they understand.

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08.440
Because they need to keep up when we stand up there and talk.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17.560
During the program, you can take part in a lot of practice.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,360
As it is called here, VFU, business -based education.

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,440
Where you get to the schools and test on what it is like to be a teacher.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,480
- There you have to be out already the first semester. - Yes!

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,120
- It is good. Then you get to know quite directly if you are right out or not.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,720
- mm.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,240
- Then it is scattered, as Felicia said, throughout the education.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,600
Where you can do different things within your subjects.

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,160
- You really get to taste what it feels like to be a teacher.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,360
During the semester you get more and more responsibility during practice.

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02.760
- After graduation, you become authorized to work within the upper secondary school,

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,160
But also within the high school.

45
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07.040
So it's not just high school that applies.

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,840
- Pretty! And in addition to high school and high school, you can work in other businesses,

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,720
Where teachers are needed, such as Komvux.

48
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,480
Teacher education is a little wider than you think.

49
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,040
After graduation, I always thought I want to work at a high school.

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,000
But during the course of education and where I tested at VFU at high schools,

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I feel it attracts a lot.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Especially high school with a focus on sports, because that is what I am very passionate about.

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,240
What do you feel?

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,400
- I feel a bit the same, that I would like to get out to a high school directly.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,240
But another fun thing would be to first come out at a high school,

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,400
And then work upwards towards a high school.

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,600
So you get to meet many different students of different ages,

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,040
And gain experience that way.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,520
And develop their work with as much scope as possible.

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,080
- We have both moved to Örebro to study at Örebro University.

61
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,920
What I love is the warm climate, you feel really welcomed.

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,320
Especially when we have a very long introduction.

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,040
Where as a new student you can find different events together with other students.

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
Get to know new friends and stuff.

65
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,120
Then I love that campus and center are very close to each other.

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
Just take the bike between!

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
It is very nice with Örebro I think.

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,000
- Then it is very section -driven.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,760
It is also, as Felicia said, the warm, very family friendly.

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,240
So it's something positive.

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,320
Then we both who plug in the subject teacher program, also

72
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,720
Because there are many different orientations,

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,120
So you meet many different people during these five years.

74
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02.560
As you get to know, friends join and create relationships.

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05.360
It's been the best for me!
