00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
Questions for systematic reviews

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,840
Being able to ask good questions
is an important asset-

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,480
-and people's interest in how nature
works has led to major discoveries.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,800
In all science subjects,
you work on formulating questions-

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,760
-in order to perform systematic studies.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,200
In order to assess the quality of your
work and give you things to improve-

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,840
-your teacher consults
the knowledge requirements.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,840
The requirements for all science
subjects, grade nine, include:

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,600
"Being able to formulate
simple questions and plans"-

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,960
-"from which to work systematically."

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,880
Before performing a systematic study,
you need a proper plan.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Identify a variable to alter.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,560
Common variables are amounts,
temperature, time and pressure.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,000
It's essential to only change
one variable at a time.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,560
All others have to remain constant.

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,760
An example:

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,960
There's ice by the door.
Someone could slip and fall!

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,320
We have to get rid of the ice
as soon as possible.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,320
Is there anything in the chemistry lab
to make the ice melt quickly?

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,880
Salt?
Salt is used on roads in the winter-

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,800
-but maybe that's special salt.
Would table salt work?

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,440
How would you formulate
that question-

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,440
-in order to enable a systematic study?

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,640
What happens if we pour salt on ice?

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,600
Then you would be studying\h<i>if</i> the ice
would melt, but not how quickly.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,040
How quickly does ice melt
when salt is added?

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,160
How much salt would you add?

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,400
That's what we want to study.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,880
Oh, right! So the question would be:

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,520
How does the amount of salt
affect how quickly the ice melts?

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,880
That would work! And that would make
the amount of salt a variable.

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,720
Have you got a hypothesis?

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,640
Mine is that the ice will melt
more quickly, the more salt we add.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,560
We need to measure how much water
melts during a given time span.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,440
And how will you measure that?

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,960
Now you have to plan your study.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,240
We'll take two paper cups
and make holes in the bottom.

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Then we'll fill them with 1 dl of
crushed ice and place them in beakers.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,120
We'll add 1 tbsp of salt in one
and mix using a glass stirrer.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,760
We'll add 3 tbsp in the other and stir.

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,760
We're checking how quickly
the ice melts, so we have to time it.

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,760
Using a ruler, we'll measure the water
level between cup and beaker-

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,200
-and document how much has melted.

44
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,600
So you'll measure the levels regularly,
using time intervals.

45
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,680
That's right.
We're going to document our findings-

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,920
-our measured values, in a chart.
We'll use the timer on my phone-

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,120
-and every three minutes,
check the water level in both cups.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,680
We can make a graph too,
to present our findings more clearly.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,000
Great! And if your hypothesis
seems accurate-

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,080
-how can you be sure
it wasn't a one-off?

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,600
Right. We'll have to perform the study
again to be entirely sure.

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,760
We'll perform the same study twice.

53
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,720
I'll add that to the plans.

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,160
Let's leave the pupils and their study.

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,200
Good science questions are formulated
in such a way that they can be studied-

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,960
-for instance answered by measuring
or observing changes.

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,280
Questions that start with "why"
are harder to answer in studies alone.

58
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,440
More theory is needed for those.

59
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,880
A systematic study measures
one variable at a time-

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
-and requires a plan
for collecting measuring data.

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,040
In this example,
the amount of salt was studied.

62
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,760
Other variables, like the amount of ice,
temperature, size of the ice cubes-

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,520
-and stirring frequency,
were kept constant.

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,800
The pupils' planning is of good quality.

65
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,640
The question is studied-

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,240
-through observing and measuring the
results of changes in the salt amount.

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,360
They are planning
a repetition of the experiment-

68
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,080
-as well as
the documentation of the study.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,120
The study shows that the salt amount
does affect how quickly the ice melts.

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,240
And that's not the only result
of mixing salt and ice.

71
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,200
You could also measure
the temperature.

72
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
Studies usually give rise
to new questions to study-

73
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
-and there is always more to learn.

74
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,960
