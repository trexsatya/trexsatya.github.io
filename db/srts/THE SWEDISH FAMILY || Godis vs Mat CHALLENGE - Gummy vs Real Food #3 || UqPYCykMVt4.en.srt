1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,920
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,220
Today we are doing a challenge.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,260
Gummy vs Real Food.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,300
We have done Gummy vs Real Food
two times before.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,600
It's a popular challenge that our viewers want us to do
again and again, but this candy isn't that easy to find.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,560
Axel and I bought the candy
for today's challenge during our long trip.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,360
- Should I say how it's done?
- Yes.

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,920
I am your waitress and I will serve you one plate each.
One will have candy, and the other one will have food.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,800
As per usual it's you guys watching who decide
who wins today's challenge by commenting below.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,360
Alma, Harry, or maybe
a shared first place?

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,240
- Or both?
- Yes, exactly.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,860
Don't forget to hit the thumbs up button
if you enjoy this video.

13
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,940
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,700
- Let's go!
- Yes!

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,760
Move them around, move them around...

16
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,060
- I'm happy.
- I want that one.

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,560
Okay. Move them around...

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,920
Wait, hold on.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,880
1, 2, 3...

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,100
A real sausage.

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,340
A gummy sausage.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,080
Ouch!

23
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,060
- That one was very chewy.
- Yes...

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,220
...super duper.

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
But it tasted very good.

26
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,200
This one tastes like... sausage.

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,400
This one tastes like... candy.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,500
It actually does.

29
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:17,300
- Are you ready?
- Move them around, move them around...

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,700
- I want this one.
- But... I wanted that one.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,040
- Well, I have it now.
- No.

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,600
- Can you agree?
- This one is mine.

33
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,440
- Yeah.
- That's kind of you, Harry.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,420
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,300
1, 2, 3...

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,580
- A real orange!
- A fake orange!

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,940
- You mean a candy orange?
- Yes, a candy orange.

38
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh God, how yummy!

39
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,780
- Should the waitress give you a hand?
- Yes, please.

40
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,580
So, this is a chocolate orange.

41
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,180
- It's in several pieces. They have to go on the plate.
- Yes, they are wedges.

42
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,160
Oh, oh!

43
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,680
- Oh, wow. Can I try one?
- Here you go.

44
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,660
- Thank you.
- I have many more.

45
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,480
It's super yummy.

46
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,480
Alma, look. They are the same.

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,680
- This was the best one.
- Yes, I agree.

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,240
This one was a regular orange.
It tasted normal.

49
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,500
Yes.

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,700
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

51
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,240
Move them around, move them around...

52
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,360
- I want this one.
- I want this one.

53
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,700
1, 2, 3...

54
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,100
A candy donut.

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,520
Can I taste it?

56
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,700
- Can I taste yours?
- Mm.

57
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:30,300
This is a hard lollipop that pretty much
tastes just like any lollipop.

58
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,380
This is a real donut.

59
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,600
It tastes super good,
it tastes like...

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,280
...a real donut.

61
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,720
I'm ready for the next one.
Bye bye.

62
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,660
- Oops, it lost its little hat.
- Yes.

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,540
- Maybe we have to lift it like this. It will be fine.
- Yes. That one will have to be without the knob.

64
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,460
Yes.

65
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,800
Don't laugh when Harry gets
the one without the knob.

66
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,380
I'm pinching your toe.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,880
- Did my donut taste the best?
- Yes.

68
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,140
Move them around, move them around...

69
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,880
- I want this one.
- No, I want that one.

70
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,960
- Yes, okay.
- I think it's his turn to choose.

71
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,460
Oh, right.

72
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,680
- Lift them like this.
- Yes.

73
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,900
1, 2, 3...

74
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,940
Gummy...

75
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,400
- Taco.
- Taco.

76
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,980
- A gummy taco, very yummy.
- A real taco.

77
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
My taco fell apart.

78
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,580
- Can I taste yours?
- Here you go.

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:14,040
It's filled with things like tomatoes,
these green things, and these things.

80
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,040
Gummy bears and
a little bit of everything.

81
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:25,320
I dropped mine. I dropped everything in it,
and now it's broken.

82
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,320
Move them around, move them around...

83
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,500
- This one!
- This one!

84
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,380
- I want this one.
- Me too.

85
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,760
- It's Alma's turn to choose, right?
- Yes.

86
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,480
1, 2, 3...

87
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,180
A gummy toast.

88
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:56,280
- Not a gummy toast - a sandwich.
- This is a toast, right? I think it looks like a toast.

89
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,020
- Can I taste it?
- Yes.

90
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,520
Mine was disgusting.

91
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,240
Very disgusting.

92
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,960
It tastes like a rotten sandwich with sugar.

93
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,200
Lots of sugar. 1 kilogram of sugar.

94
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,120
I am ready for the next one.

95
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,140
I will save you for later, little sandwich.

96
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,780
- I am ready for the next one.
- I am ready for the next one.

97
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,760
- I will win.
- I will win.

98
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:52,140
Move them around, move them around...

99
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,540
- I want this one.
- Yes.

100
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,620
1, 2, 3...

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,440
Mini french fries
that really are chewing gum.

102
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,780
I got regular french fries.

103
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,380
- I want to taste Harry's.
- Okay.

104
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,300
Thanks.

105
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,480
- Thanks.
- I have chewing gum in my mouth.

106
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,120
I won.

107
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,660
I won.

108
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,340
Ew.

109
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,140
- Oh, what happened?
- Alma's chewing gum didn't taste good.

110
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,800
Okay, but you are eating and smacking
and munching away. Are you hungry?

111
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,380
- Yes.
- That's what I thought.

112
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,600
Let's answer a Question of the Day.

113
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,840
MoaBella wants to know:
"How are things going with Alma's own channel?"

114
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,080
Super.

115
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,820
- It's actually going great.
- Yes. It exists!

116
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,480
- It exists.
- We have created it.

117
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,220
We have posted three videos so far,
and there will be more.

118
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,380
There is a link in the top right corner
if you are interested.

119
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,940
- What have you done so far?
- I have...

120
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,600
Stop smacking in my ear,
it will drive the viewers crazy.

121
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,700
Yes, just like that... mouth closed.

122
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,200
Good.

123
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:37,420
I talk about different countries, their flags,
their languages and blah, blah, blah.

124
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,520
The videos are about the countries we traveled to,
where we also bought this candy.

125
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,880
- There will be other videos in the future, right?
- Mm.

126
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,020
- You have recorded a slime video with Harry.
- Yes, when we mixed a bunch of slime that we bought.

127
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Things that Alma likes will go on her channel, but this is
our main channel which we will work on the most.

128
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,800
- Mm.
- Mm.

129
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,960
- Are you full now?
- No.

130
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,340
- Do you want more candy and food?
- Yes.

131
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,020
- Then let's continue.
- Yes!

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,520
Move them around, move them around...

133
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,920
- I want this one!
- I want this one.

134
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,940
1, 2, 3...

135
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,440
- I got juice formula.
- And I got candy formula.

136
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,440
- Are you a baby, Harry?
- Yes.

137
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,460
Goo goo ga ga, little baby.

138
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,120
- Oh!
- Oh!

139
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,180
- Can I taste yours?
- Yes.

140
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,600
But then I can eat all of yours,
because you will drink all of mine.

141
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,200
- Harry's tasted the best, I think.
- Yes, but now you are also a baby.

142
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,980
Move them around, move them around...

143
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,680
- I am happy with this one.
- I am happy with this one.

144
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,700
1, 2, 3...

145
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,960
- A real pizza.
- A gummy pizza.

146
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,620
Look, it looks so nice.

147
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,860
- It doesn't look as nice any more.
- No.

148
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,580
- There you go.
- It looks nice again.

149
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:21,880
- My pizza was the best one.
- I think mine was the best one, you never tasted it.

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,360
- You have to taste mine.
- Okay.

151
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,700
Do you taste the flavors of the juicy pizza?

152
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,960
I can only taste the onion.

153
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,720
Move them around, move them around...

154
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,960
- I want this one.
- I want this one.

155
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,600
1, 2, 3...

156
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,980
A real watermelon.

157
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,880
A watermelon lollipop...

158
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,080
...that is made out of candy.

159
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,620
- I can't bite it.
- Do you want to taste mine, and then I can taste yours?

160
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,620
Mine looks nice, but it's a bit hard.

161
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:19,080
- I agree, but I actually think that mine tasted better.
- Yes.

162
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,440
Move them around, move them around...

163
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
- I want this one.
- I want this one.

164
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,860
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

165
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,680
1, 2, 3...

166
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,440
I remember those!
We have eaten them before.

167
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,500
- Bean Boozled Challenge, do you remember?
- Yes.

168
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,880
I don't want to taste it, no no no.
These are the vomit ones.

169
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:02,260
- I don't know if these are as bad as the other ones.
- Try it. Try one...

170
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,460
Okay, if I have to.

171
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,100
I have to spit it out.
It didn't taste good.

172
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,700
Ew! That was really gross.

173
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,160
Never again.
Regular popcorn are better.

174
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,380
- Hello, sweethearts.
- Hi!

175
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,540
- Have you had a good time?
- Very good.

176
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,660
- Was it fun?
- Yes.

177
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:36,500
It says "Buttered Popcorn Jelly Beans",
so it's Jelly Beans that taste like popcorn with butter.

178
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,180
- Do you dare to taste one?
- No, thanks.

179
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,640
- Oh yes! You have to.
- No.

180
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:50,380
- It looks like the ones that tasted like urine or vomit.
- Vomit, I think. But all of these should taste good.

181
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,240
- Oh, okay.
- We bought them in New Zealand.

182
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:59,520
Thank you for watching this video!

183
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,800
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

184
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,880
Comment which one of these silly pants you think won,
ask questions and take care until next time.

185
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,300
Bye bye!
