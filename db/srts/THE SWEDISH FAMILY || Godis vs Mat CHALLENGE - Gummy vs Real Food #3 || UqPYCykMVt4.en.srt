00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,920
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,220
Today we will make a challenge.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,260
With candy versus food.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,300
We have made Gummy vs Real Food twice before.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,460
It is very popular, viewers often want us to do it again and again.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,680
But this candy is not so easy to find.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,420
The candy in today's Challenge bought me and Axel during our long journey.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,360
- Should I tell you how it goes?
 - Yes.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,980
I am a waitress and I will serve you each plate.
 On one it is sweets and on the other it is food.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,800
It is as usual at home that decides who wins today's Challenge by commenting.

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,360
Alma, Harry, or maybe a shared first place?

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,080
- Or both?
 - Yes exactly.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,760
And corner, don't forget to push thumbs up if you think this video is fun.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,080
Are you ready?

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,940
- Yes!
 - Yes!

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,700
- Let's go!
 - Yes!

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,760
- Mix, mix, mix ... - mix, mix, mix ...

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,060
- I am satisfied.
 - No, I want to take it.

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,560
Okay then.
 Mix, mix.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,920
Wait wait.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,880
1, 2, 3 ...

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,100
A real sausage!

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,280
Candy sausage.
 Lol!

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,080
Ouch!

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,060
- It's really good.
 - Yes ...

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,220
... Super Duper.

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
Although it is very good.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,200
This tastes ... sausage.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,500
This one tastes ... candy.
 It actually tastes sweets.

30
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:17,160
- Are you ready?
 - Mix, mix, mix ...

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,700
- I want it.
 - No, but ... I want it.

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,040
- Yes, now I have it.
 - No.

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,600
- Can you agree?
 - It is mine.

34
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,440
- Yes.
 - How kind of you, Harry.

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,820
- Wait a minute.
 - Okay.

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,300
1, 2, 3 ...

37
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,580
- A real orange!
 - The pretend orange!

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,940
- More precisely a candy orange.
 - Yes, a candy orange.

39
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,760
God so tasty!

40
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,780
- Should the waitress help a little?
 - Yes thank you.

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,580
So this is a chocolate orange.

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,160
That's a lot of parts.
 They have to put them on the plate.

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,800
Yes, these are gaps.

44
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,680
- Oh, wow.
 Can I taste?
 - Here, you get it.

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,660
- Thanks so much.
 - I have lots more.

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,480
Tastes super good.

48
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,480
Alma, look.
 They are the same.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,680
- This one was the best.
 - Yes I agree.

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,240
This was a very common orange ... that tastes common.

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,500
Yes.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,700
- Bye.
 - Bye.

53
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,240
Mix, mix, mix ...

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
- I want that!
 - I want that.

55
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,700
1, 2, 3 ...

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,100
Candy can.

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,520
Nom, nom, nom ...

58
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,520
Can I taste?

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,700
- Can I taste?
 - mm.

60
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,080
This is a hard club that tastes ...

61
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,780
... much like all clubs do.

62
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,380
This is a real monk.

63
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,500
It tastes super good, it tastes like ...

64
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,940
... a real monk.

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,720
I'm ready for the next one.
 Bye.

66
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,660
- So it can go unless the hasp is on.
 - Yes.

67
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,540
- You may be able to lift it that way.
 It's fine.
 - Yes.
 It must be without bud.

68
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,640
- Yes.
 - Yes.

69
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,160
You must not laugh when Harry gets his not bud.

70
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,380
I nip you in the toe.

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,880
- Was my monk best?
 - Yes.

72
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,140
Mix, mix, mix ...

73
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,880
- I want that.
 - No, I want it.

74
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,960
- Yes, okay.
 - This time I think it's his turn to choose.

75
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,460
Yes exactly.

76
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,060
- And then you have to take them like that.
 - Yes.

77
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,900
1, 2, 3 ...

78
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,940
Candy...

79
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,400
- Taco.
 - Taco.

80
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,340
- Godistaco, delicious.
 - Real taco.

81
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,560
Oh!

82
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
My taco just fell out.

83
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,580
- Can I taste?
 - mm, here.

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:14,040
It is full of different things like tomatoes, such green things and these.

85
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,040
Rubber bears and everything.

86
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:25,320
I dropped mine.
 I lost all the stuff for it, and now it has broken.

87
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,160
Mix, mix, mix ...

88
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,500
- I want that!
 - I take it!

89
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,380
- I want that.
 - I want that.

90
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,760
- Now it's probably Alma's turn to choose, huh?
 - Yes.

91
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,480
1, 2, 3 ...

92
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,180
Candistoast.

93
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:56,440
- So, not candistoast - sandwich.
 - This is toast?
 I think it's like a toast.

94
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,020
- Can I taste?
 - Yes.

95
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,520
Mine was disgusting.

96
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,240
This one was huge.

97
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,960
Thus, it tastes the rhinet Macka with sugar.

98
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,200
Very much sugar.
 1 kilo of sugar.

99
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm ready for the next one.

100
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,140
I'll save you, Mackis.

101
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,780
- I'm ready for the next one.
 - I'm ready for the next one.

102
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,760
- I'll win.
 - I'll win.

103
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:52,140
Mix, mix, mix ...

104
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,920
- I want that.
 - Yes.

105
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,600
1, 2, 3 ...

106
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,440
Mini french fries which are chewing gum.

107
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,920
Mine are quite ordinary french fries.

108
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,380
- I want to taste Harry's now.
 - Okay.

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,300
Thanks.

110
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,480
- Thanks.
 - I have chewing gum in my mouth.

111
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,120
I won.

112
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,680
I won.

113
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,340
Ew.

114
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,140
- Oh, what happened there?
 - Alma's chewing gum was not good.

115
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,800
Wasn't the chewing gum good?
 Well, but you yell and eat and munch.
 Are you hungry?

116
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,380
- Yes.
 - Yes, I expect it.

117
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:52,840
I thought we would take a question of the day.
 Moabella wonders, "How's Alma's own channel going?"

118
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,960
- Super.
 It actually goes super.
 - It actually goes super, it exists!

119
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,480
- It exists.
 - We have done it.

120
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,280
So far there are three videos there, and it will be more.

121
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,380
We are talking about it now in the corner if you are interested.

122
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,940
- Should you tell us what you do on the channel, then?
 To date.
 - I have...

123
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,600
You have to stop smoking in my ear, the viewers there at home will be crazy.

124
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,700
Just.
 With closed mouth.

125
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,200
Good.

126
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:37,420
I talk about different countries and ... yes, their flag and their language and blah blah blah.

127
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,520
The videos are about the different countries we visited on the trip, the same countries where we bought this candy.

128
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,720
Yay!

129
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,880
- There will be something else on your channel later, huh?
 - mm.

130
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,840
- You have recorded a slime video with Harry.
 - Yes, when we mix a lot of slime that we bought.

131
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,480
Yes, so as Alma thinks is fun on that channel.

132
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,200
But this - The Swedish Family - is our main channel, this is the one we will continue to work most.

133
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,800
- mm.
 - mm.

134
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,960
- Are you full now?
 - No.

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,340
- Do you want to eat more sweets and food?
 - Yes.

136
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,020
- Then we continue.
 - Yes!

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,520
Mix, mix, mix ...

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,920
- I want that!
 - I want that.

139
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,940
1, 2, 3 ...

140
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,660
- I got a juice.
 - And I got a candy evening.

141
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,440
- Are you a baby, Harry?
 - Yes.

142
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,460
Goo goo ga ga, little baby.

143
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,120
- Oh!
 - Oh!

144
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,180
- Can I taste?
 - Yes.

145
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,600
Then I can eat up all yours, you will eat up all of mine.

146
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,180
- Harry's was the best, I think.
 - Yes, though now you are also a baby.

147
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,320
- goo goo ga.
 - GA GA GOO GOO.

148
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,340
- goo goo ga.
 - GA GA GOO GOO.

149
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,620
GA GA GOO GOO GIGGI.

150
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,680
- GA GA GOO GOO GIGGI, GA GA.
 - GA GA!

151
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,980
Mix, mix, mix ...

152
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,540
- I am satisfied.
 - I am satisfied.

153
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,700
1, 2, 3 ...

154
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,860
- A real pizza.
 - Candy pizza.

155
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,620
Check out, how nice it is.

156
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,860
- Now it's not as nice anymore.
 - No.

157
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,100
- So yes.
 - Now it's fine.

158
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Mmm.

159
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,440
My pizza was the best.

160
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,960
No, I actually think mine was the best.
 You never tasted mine.
 You have to taste mine.

161
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,380
Okay.

162
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:32,220
Do you feel the taste of the juicy pizza?

163
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,140
I just feel onions.

164
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,720
Mix, mix, mix ...

165
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,960
- I want that.
 - I want that.

166
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,600
1, 2, 3 ...

167
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,980
A real watermelon.

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,880
A club for watermelon ...

169
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,420
... and it was made of candy.

170
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,960
- It can't bite.
 - Do you want to taste mine, then I can taste yours?

171
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,540
Mine is nice, but it's a little hard.

172
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,540
I agree, but I actually thought mine was the best.

173
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,380
Yes.

174
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,440
Mix, mix, mix ...

175
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
- I want that.
 - I want it.

176
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,040
- Are you happy?
 - Yes.

177
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,680
1, 2, 3 ...

178
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,440
Those I remember!
 We have tested those.

179
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,500
- Bean Boozled Challenge, do you remember?
 - Yes.

180
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,880
I don't want to taste, no no.
 Those are the spy.

181
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:02,260
- I don't know if these are as dangerous as the others.
 - Taste.
 Taste...

182
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,640
Okay, if I have to.

183
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,100
I have to spit.
 It did not taste good.

184
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,760
Oh, what a disgust.
 It was really good.

185
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,140
Never again.
 It is better with regular popcorn.

186
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,380
- Hi, sweethearts.
 - Hello!

187
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,540
- How did you have it?
 - Great.

188
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,660
- Has it been fun?
 - Yes.

189
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:36,360
It says "Buttered Popcorn Jelly Beans", so it is buttery popcorn-jelly beans.

190
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,180
- Do you dare to taste?
 - No thanks.

191
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,620
- Joho!
 You must.
 - No.

192
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:50,380
- It looks like those who tasted the kiss or vomit.
 - Vomit, huh?
 Although these should taste good.

193
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,240
- Oh okay.
 - We bought these in New Zealand.

194
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:59,520
Thanks for watching this video!

195
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,700
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

196
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,880
Write who of these two crunch balls who has won, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

197
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,180
Bye!
