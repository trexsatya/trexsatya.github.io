1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
Everyone had understood what had happened -

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06.620
- And then they saw me when I was relieved, so everyone in the whole hall started laughing.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,420
It was so embarrassing! People still remember me today on the union. "It's you!"

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,120
Nice that everyone feels ready with their plug.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,620
- Is this one on? - Do I have a look in my nose?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
- No, do I have? - Yes a little. You have...

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,520
Have I?! Oh my God!

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,880
Sit down!

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,040
Welcome to the premiere of them calls us students!

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,200
Here we will address everything possible about student life.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,380
You will be asked questions, and we will answer everything that belongs.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,380
Yes, and we will share our stories.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,300
Remember to comment and like this clip, and subscribe to the channel!

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,040
I was very, very nervous, that is.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,300
I remember getting an apartment about 2-3 weeks before school started.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55.820
So about mid -August.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,700
I had never been to Örebro before, so the first time I went here was when I would pick up the keys -

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,760
- To my apartment.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05.440
And just the idea that I would be in a whole new city, I don't know a single person there ...

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08.420
Will I make friends? Will I get to know people really?

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,000
I had no idea, because I hardly knew I would start plugging.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,440
- No ... - It was a bit at that level.

23
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,360
I sent in via late registration and didn't think about it anymore. It was like this:

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,660
"I live in Gothenburg. Plug in Örebro, it probably won't happen. I won't come in."

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,760
Thursday before everything starts: "Hello! You have come in via late registration for the program in Örebro.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,440
- How fun! - Well, and when do I start? "On Monday." So that...

27
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,500
- * Laughter * - so ...

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,140
I was very annoying, I know.

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,900
I would jump on the medical program and book my life for 5½ years, as well.

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,000
So it was a bit like this: "But God, what have I given up on?"

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,140
And how will this be?

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,240
At the same time, it was very cool too, because for the first time you would jump on an education -

33
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00.440
- That would lead to what you wanted to be the rest of your life.

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05.040
So I call my mom in the evening. "I think I'll move to Örebro."

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08.060
And she just: "Well ... when then?"

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09.660
"In three days."

37
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,460
"Okay, where is Örebro?"

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,060
"I'll google, wait a bit!"

39
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,960
I have zero sense of geography, so I'm starting to google.

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,300
- "Yes, but it's easy to get there!" - "Yeah. Where are you going to live?"

41
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,760
Yes, that's the next good question too ...

42
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,340
I took a sabbatical to be able to digest everything and recover from high school.

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,280
- It's pretty ... especially if you go in for grades - yes, of course.

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,920
I didn't invest so much on the college exam. You can get in through that too.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,060
And then it became that you ...

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,640
I didn't feel ready to get into the studies again. - No, I understand.

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,180
I needed to get some other kind of experience. So I worked at McDonald's and turned burgers.

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,000
- I still have scars on my hands today. - Oh my God.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,180
- So, I was the worst. Although I always arrived on time! - Good experience, anyway.

50
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,880
In high school it is a bit so that you read because you have to. But now it was an active choice.

51
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,300
"Shit, this I want to read!"

52
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02.440
How old were you?

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,980
- I was such a thing - "one like that ..."

54
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09.320
- Who jumped at once. So I was 19 years old when I started here.

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,280
Once the introduction and school started, everything went very fast.

56
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
I got very comfortable in the hall.

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,720
I knew I was going to study, because I just come from high school.

58
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,360
- Yes exactly. - I took the student this summer, and I already knew -

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,640
- That I wanted to continue because I want to be finished earlier, later.

60
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,060
I had been here the year before and checked in, because I saw Örebro as a suitable candidate.

61
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,680
It was close, but I still wanted to test my wings and move to a new city.

62
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,560
- But still not too far from the parents. - No, of course.

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,080
It was the first time. I had lived at home for 19 years before moving here.

64
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,420
So it was a big step to start living yourself. Have your own accommodation, wash, cook.

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,640
I remember how I stood at home and practiced frying mom Scan's meatballs to be ready.

66
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,740
For the introduction I could catch up.

67
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,580
First I was very anti-Örebro. Now this sounds very cliché -

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,780
- But it was really like this when we had a syo-call. The study guide said: "But Örebro, then?"

69
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,600
I said no, and she asked why not. And I don't know, I've never been there.

70
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:23,100
I was just so set to Stockholm and Uppsala, because ... no, I don't really know why.

71
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,600
I come from Stockholm, and it was an obvious choice for me not to plug in Stockholm.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,360
I really got tired of Stockholm after the student. I took the student last summer, and for me-

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,840
- It was just to plug somewhere else.

74
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,720
I applied for the law program in all cities that are available, and so I ended up in Örebro by chance.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,740
For me, moving here is the best choice I've made.

76
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,280
I came here on such a day where you can see a little ... what is it called?

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,300
- Recruitment day? - Yes, a little bit like that. You have to go to lectures.

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,180
I thought it looked great. Then I fixed housing and came here.

79
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,280
I was really very uncertain about what I wanted to be.

80
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:12,040
Then I thought: Biology, it's pretty fun. Work with people, it's fun. I guess.

81
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,500
Can be.

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,400
I hadn't done it before. I had only worked at ICA. But I thought it could be good.

83
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,660
It felt like a good goal. When I came in, I thought I was driving on this!

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:32,620
On the first day of intro you will be divided into your group, and then you made friends from day one.

85
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,340
When you went, I knew some friends who had moved with me.

86
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,380
But I still wanted to know new people. Then we ended up in different groups, and it can feel a little scary.

87
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49.060
Day two and three it felt completely natural and clear.

88
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,240
- It was super fun for the first few days. - Yes, but really. That's what is so good.

89
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,700
Everyone is in the same seat, and everyone just: "Give me friends! I want to find someone to hold in!"

90
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,260
- During the introduction, there are activities every night. - Yes it is.

91
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,500
How was it possible to combine it with the plug? Did you do with what you would and also go on activities?

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,180
- Did you have to make priorities? - Of course. It is always the school to prioritize first.

93
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,920
In terms of school, it was not so much for me in the beginning.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,280
There were some introductions. You had to go through what law is and how to read a law book.

95
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,560
Since I read law in high school, I already had the pillars.

96
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,920
So for me it was quite easy to combine with the introduction. But it can be different for everyone -

97
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,380
- Depending on the conditions you have before.

98
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,480
- Then I have to be a little mom to you here then! - Yes, okay then. Gladly!

99
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,840
No, but I would say that everything resolves.

100
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,760
- Don't forget to have fun. - I haven't forgotten that, I can say.

101
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,420
Unfortunately, I was one of those who was not so much on the introduction.

102
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,260
I wanted to go in a lot for school. I felt it was coming like a bang.

103
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00.820
In the MSc program, they want to test during the first few weeks.

104
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,780
They push on with lots of scientific articles and literature. You should still manage four years.

105
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,220
I didn't go so much on the introduction, because it was a lot to read.

106
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,480
Everyone is a little lost. Everyone is in the same situation.

107
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,620
But then I think it was very easy to find people in the class.

108
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,680
I had a huge trip. The second day I sat down with some that I am spending time with right now.

109
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,000
It was just "Tjena! What is your name? You seem funny. You will hold on to!"

110
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,600
This is going to be good! I thought it was super fun.

111
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,100
But it is on all these things in addition to the lectures that get the chance to network.

112
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,140
- Yes, that's it. - Just go and sit in any association house.

113
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,820
- Or go to the corps. That we talked about before. - So, for real. You can go to the corps yourself.

114
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,120
- Yes indeed! - Yes.

115
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,560
Then I got the opportunity to be a sponsor. It is true that everyone ... you know that too.

116
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,700
You can seek to become a sponsor and be part of the introduction and arrange it.

117
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05.860
So I did that a year later. After all, it wasn't too late to get to know new people.

118
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,940
- Did it feel better after you became a sponsor? - Yes exactly. Since then, my network has increased a lot.

119
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,840
But otherwise. Do you have any housewife tips?

120
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,900
So, I am the worst housewife in the world.

121
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,800
We talked here before about food, tacos, and to wash and hold on.

122
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,400
I just felt that: My God, I've lived for a long time now.

123
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,100
I still haven't gone up in rank from sausage stroganoff. I'm still there.

124
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,820
- I understand. - the best I know is when you don't have to cook -

125
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,220
- And you can eat roasted sandwiches for dinner. - Yes, but I also know it.

126
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,680
My favorite food is just sandwiches.

127
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,220
It's so simple, it's just buying bread, butter and optional toppings

128
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,100
- It's kind of better than anything. - I know!

129
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,760
Prio one is to pass the studies.

130
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,180
After all, that is the reason why you are in the city and plug in at Örebro University.

131
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,100
- It's for the sake of studies. - Yes.

132
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07.820
But to cope with e.g. The MSc Program which is four years old -

133
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,940
- Then it is still important to have good people who support if you have a bad day.

134
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,080
And even that you can help others when they have a bad day.

135
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Where do you find yourself?

136
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,300
What do you focus on? Or do you think you have a balance between the social and the plug and all that?

137
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,980
I've had a hard time for it for periods.

138
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,640
I have been very active in associations at the same time as we had a lot in school.

139
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,520
It was different stuff. It was a party on the weekends, and here and there.

140
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,500
And it was fun. I liked to do it.

141
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,660
But I also think that maybe you should do it for a period.

142
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,080
Then maybe you back down and focus a little more on school

143
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,520
So that you can still breathe a little too.

144
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,860
- There was a lot of sausage and meatballs in the beginning. - No, so there will be a lot of tacos.

145
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,160
I still have my taco-streak in eleven days.

146
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,980
I have talked to many at the university, but no one has come up for eleven days.

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05.020
It was for lunch and supper, and sometimes even breakfast.

148
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,000
It was crazy. My stomach became chaos after eleven days.

149
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,260
- We had 10 seminars every day. - 10 seminars?!

150
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,980
- Two weeks on the rake. - Every day?!

151
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,600
- No ... - And then it went two weeks and then we had ten more seminars.

152
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,760
- What? How do you come up with then? - You don't.

153
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,320
But how long were these seminars if you had 10 a day?

154
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,040
- No, not 10 a day. - Well!

155
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:33,240
Do not misunderstand me! Thus, 10 days in a row. One seminar per day. Did you think I meant ...?

156
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,900
- I thought you meant 10 seminars a day! - No no no!

157
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,760
Right. It's one of my horrible memories.

158
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,140
One of the first lessons when I had just moved here from Linköping.

159
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,760
- You know the feeling when you lose your phone? - A little mini-heart attack?

160
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,200
Yes exactly. In other words, I had my credentials there, bank cards ... - in other words?

161
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,260
I had been to the toilet during the break.

162
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,500
I remember I had put my mobile on the sink. I do not know why.

163
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,900
When I got back to the lecture room, it started again.

164
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,340
It had been 10 minutes. You have a routine that you feel the pocket if the phone is there.

165
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,860
And so I feel that, shit, I don't have my phone on me.

166
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,340
- Okay, my bank card ... I'll shop afterwards. - You should live.

167
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,460
I want to be able to come home.

168
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,620
Shit, I put it in the toilet.

169
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,160
- So I just get up. I sat in the middle of an auditorium. - You just stand up?

170
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,260
Yes, in panic I get up very fast. Everyone looks at me and wonders what's going on.

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,240
The lecturer also looks at me and wonders what is happening. Does anyone have died, kind of?

172
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,820
I'm just running out. "Excuse me, excuse, let go of me!"

173
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,080
Goes from the middle towards the edge and out of the hall.

174
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,700
The toilet was free, so when I get to it I see that nothing is there.

175
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:00.060
I'm panicing. I go in and my heart thumps like a thousand. I am sweating. I'm panicing.

176
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,820
It is laptop you have at the lectures. It was not collapsed.

177
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,580
I don't know why I folded it together. I was so disappointed and sad.

178
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,200
- Then I see that my mobile is behind it. - No!

179
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,200
Everyone had understood what had happened. When they saw how relieved I was, everyone in the whole hall began to laugh.

180
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,960
It was so embarrassing! People still remember me today on the union.

181
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,900
"It is you! It is you who dropped the phone and are so customer!"

182
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,460
Yes it's me. Theo, nice to meet.

183
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,680
