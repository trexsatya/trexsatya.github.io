1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,160
All people are extremely different and it is important to

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,360
try to get into what they see

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,160
And based on that make a good decision for the entire ship.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,880
A well -trimmed crew is that

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,480
allows the ship to solve its task in the best way.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,120
A good officer for me should be

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,920
Competent, humble but also demanding.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,040
Just because i'm fanjunger doesn't mean i stand over

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,280
To band ammunition or clean a KSP.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,720
It's an amazing feeling to see people

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,840
Clear a task they themselves do not think they will be able to do.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,400
When you know that you have been a part of training and educating that person.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,960
My name is Viktor and I work as an air defense officer aboard HMS Ven.
