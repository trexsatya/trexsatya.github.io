1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,148
Apparently, this powder should be able to replace our future ..

2
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:09,216
Is this our future?

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,310
When I see something like this, I become skeptical.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,715
Is this Bulls*IT or not?

5
00:00:13,715 --> 00:00:16,384
There is only one way to find out ..

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:20,960
I'll live on this powder only, for a full 30 days.

7
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,966
So we see if I survive.

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,361
I really have the worst eating habits right now.

9
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:41,600
You know ... when you really slip with everything.

10
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:48,128
I have ended up in an army, so it always feels like I am behind and do not have time to make food.

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,224
So in other words that solve my problems with eating quick things.

12
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,248
Candy.

13
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,272
Chips.

14
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,410
Junk food, yes you understand.
 Sugar and fat.

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,482
And sometimes I completely forgot to eat at all.

16
00:01:00,482 --> 00:01:04,000
So I started talking to Emma (girlfriend) about my problem with the food.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,842
Hin posted it pretty simple.
 "Controls it up they make a lunch box, making your food schedule" a normal person probably thought it was a good idea.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,264
But I think the step further.

19
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:19,104
I'm starting to think: "Why is there not a pill"

20
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,664
Future food that solves me being measured.

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,853
It's useful and good, no shit.

22
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:31,472
Type like Kalle and the chocolate factory where Willy Wonka makes a chewing gum that simulates a three -course meal.

23
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,528
How brilliant is not that idea and why is it not?

24
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:54,176
So with that idea in my head, I go to Google and start looking.

25
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,528
I scroll and scroll, find nothing.

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Google

27
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,672
Facebook they are sick in the head

28
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,048
Then you come up with ads just for this.

29
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:21,460
Chocolate taste.

30
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:26,495
We will live this for a whole month.

31
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:36,970
Now we start, cheers.

32
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:50,388
Not bad.

33
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,060
I expected it to be worse.

34
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,820
The taste is totally okay.

35
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,101
Tastes a bit of a mug ..

36
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:00,628
A little coconut some flour and chocolate.

37
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:05,865
The mutton-porridge consistency: d

38
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:08,098
Thought it would be much worse.

39
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:10,520
Think I made my a little too thick ...

40
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,706
The funny thing is that I'm measured now.

41
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:18,312
How fast I didn't get a whole meal now?!

42
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:19,316
There I'm done!

43
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,108
I've been playing for 4 minutes.

44
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:27,800
I guess 2-3 minutes went to lots of shabel when to talk ..

45
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:36,372
I easily think you can eat a whole meal in under a minute.

46
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:41,332
It's crazy that you can eat a meal so fast!

47
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:45,684
At the same time, I feel very useful, when I get everything I need.

48
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,780
Now I'm "fit for fight".

49
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:57,204
I thought you should say this but I'm pleasantly surprised, you actually get measured

50
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:02,376
I've been running now four days and I thought it would be much more difficult than it actually is.

51
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:03,860
But wait a bit now !!

52
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:11,980
You have no idea if that is useful or not, you can't say that straight up and down.

53
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,171
Blood test day.

54
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:20,820
We need an expert too, so it is not just "what I think".

55
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:34,642
Now she has chosen to focus on functional medicine, ie she knows much more than you and me.

56
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:39,080
Is this the future?
 You avoid all the cows, the meat and the environmental impact.

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,298
You solve everything with a powder instead.

58
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:43,602
So my own personal opinion I don't think so.

59
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:45,971
Maybe a shorter period.

60
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:49,733
I don't think that's the future, don't jump.

61
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:53,439
Good food is what we should live on.

62
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:07,153
You have looked at the contents of the bags, what do I get in me?

63
00:05:07,153 --> 00:05:11,715
I see that they contain the necessary vitamins and minerals we need.

64
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:15,099
..So you survive ..

65
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:19,420
Okay *haha *, so I survive?!

66
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,291
So we take a blood test now and then an experiment is clear.

67
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:26,941
But how you will feel ..

68
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:29,872
You may go on your ketones.

69
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:35,060
So you burn fat instead of sugar and I can do some "high"

70
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,460
Clearly thought :)

71
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:47,562
I feel evenly measured, nothing up or down.
 It is very stable.

72
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:51,573
All levels are stable and feel happy.

73
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:55,158
Andreas here sits and eats pizza.

74
00:05:55,158 --> 00:05:56,216
This is so good.

75
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:58,216
What do you have on the pizza?

76
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:00,232
A Vesuvius with bacon.

77
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,047
Is that ham from the beginning?

78
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:04,276
Yes, I added bacon.

79
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,765
So what?

80
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,771
Just, that's the same thing: D!

81
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:16,803
Andreas: That's why I looked at you..when you said bacon

82
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,803
But I thought..yes..ya..ying will probably be good anyway.

83
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,193
I will continue and not give up.

84
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:51,193
I don't know why I felt as bad as I did.

85
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:54,094
We are past it anyway.

86
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:05,457
Then you may be prepared that when you get a little run out of sugar then an abstinen's situation can occur.

87
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:09,134
Headaches, you get low.

88
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,134
Which can be pretty hard to get through.

89
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:13,997
But it happens because the body gets rid of the sugar.

90
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:16,813
Now I have found something bad about the powder.

91
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:21,787
It feels clear with the mask ... the breath.

92
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:26,948
I forgot brushing my teeth and it's not nice ...

93
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:33,667
But I talked to a polisher about, that and he said that protein powder could have the same effect.

94
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:45,374
What do you think I have done this for a while now.

95
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:49,113
You smell for J*crazy :)

96
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:53,732
Routet ... his breath ..

97
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,497
Will we see you test this?

98
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:02,861
Have no hopes.

99
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:06,221
Thumb up if you want Emma to taste.

100
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:08,012
Do you think it is healthy to live like this?

101
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:12,867
No, not for a longer period.

102
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,925
If you are going out and camping or similar, I think it can be smooth.

103
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:28,243
I hope many people like the video now, as he put more a month on getting it together :)

104
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:29,261
Stop

105
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,923
I sleep next to him and the breath ..

106
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:38,205
Continues with the shake, it's 2 weeks left.

107
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:45,901
I regret to do this in the summer.
 I am very hungry for real food.

108
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,978
It will probably go well anyway.

109
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:52,284
The worst thing is to be around "regular food".

110
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:54,631
Had I not seen it would probably have been a minor problem.

111
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:56,631
We would just back with the car ..

112
00:08:56,814 --> 00:09:05,101
I don't know whose car it is.. it just stood here ..

113
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,947
J **** bang

114
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,605
You get a perfect energy level.

115
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,042
Another disadvantage is that you get crazy hungry quickly.

116
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:15,841
Quickly

117
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:22,734
If you chew regular food, you first become hungry, more hungry, crazy hungry.

118
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,813
Here you get the next a little deceived, then it is panic.

119
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:28,258
You are hungry now

120
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:30,570
So my stomach screams at me ..

121
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,351
Today I have eaten just as I should do ..

122
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:39,858
Would pick up some things for Emma and see the chocolate ..

123
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:45,553
My brain says directly: "That we have to take!"

124
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:50,017
But we didn't..I just pulled here ..

125
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:54,520
When my brain says something now ... then I'll do just the opposite.

126
00:09:54,765 --> 00:09:59,373
I haven't been in this refrigerator for about 2 weeks now .. Thanks to this one!

127
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:03,981
I sit and make a food list that I will eat when I'm done!

128
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:10,185
Here you have the dish, I think I have seen a red thread in the whole.

129
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:14,733
It is flour in everything I apparently miss.

130
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:21,389
I'm so hungry at natchos..omg

131
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,119
Am I bitter or am I bitter?

132
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:38,642
7 days left ..

133
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:41,283
It smells so good in here.

134
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:48,546
How crazy is it that I didn't have to think or cook for so long.

135
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:50,037
It is so nice to avoid it.

136
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:53,901
Cooking then "Yes what should I cook today ..."

137
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:54,413
God what fun

138
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:57,374
Finally you cook the same s*it anyway (: uninspiring!

139
00:10:57,374 --> 00:11:02,349
I am feeling very well!

140
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,141
It's not long now

141
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:12,067
Instead of just seeing me with a shake every day, you should see my friends taste instead.

142
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,679
What is that?

143
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,679
Dinner!

144
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,374
Strawberry!

145
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:23,374
It wasn't that dangerous, it was good!

146
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Porridge..Type: D.

147
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:30,780
OATS!

148
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,330
Jerre: No!
 - huh ??

149
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:46,614
After all, there is a little lumps in..but it is so with protein powder and the like.

150
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,685
It's his food ... not protein powder.

151
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:52,237
I liked it.

152
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:55,565
What do you think if one has different opinions and thoughts

153
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:02,189
That is, everyone who does not eat the ones you eat.

154
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:05,261
A chew, doesn't it look nice or?

155
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:07,261
I can not!

156
00:12:09,298 --> 00:12:12,717
The brain wants to take the easy route.

157
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,781
You train your discipline reached incredibly.

158
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:17,805
3 days more

159
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:24,119
It is really nice to not have to cook.

160
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:40,427
A bit of that money and over a month

161
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:14,219
Even if you drink Cola Zero?

162
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:21,643
It is not good for the liver, then everyone knows that at home.
 Instead of sugar, there is some other crap instead.

163
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:28,043
Exactly, so it actually got a little better.

164
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:32,907
Also

165
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:39,563
And then I saw that it was going down a little bit

166
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,221
Finally get to eat

167
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:50,621
WHO How good does this not look like

168
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:54,461
Thanks

169
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:07,192
Wow
