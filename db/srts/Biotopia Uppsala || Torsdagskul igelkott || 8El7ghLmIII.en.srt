00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:03.014
Hello.

2
00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.172
Today it is Thursday and I miss Thursday fun incredibly much.

3
00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:14.470
So I thought we were running a digital variant of Thursday fun today with a little talk and a little work.

4
00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:18.357
Today I thought we should talk about this.

5
00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.679
The hedgehog.

6
00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:24.513
Have you ever seen any such

7
00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:28.986
You can usually have seen them sometimes because they like to live close to us people.

8
00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:31.629
In parks and gardens for example.

9
00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:38.646
The hedgehog could live in the forest but it does not like badgers for badgers can eat it.

10
00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:42.144
So instead it lives quite close to us humans.

11
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:48.196
In Gotland, for example, where there are no badgers where the hedgehog lives in the forest.

12
00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:52.961
The hedgehog looks a little special.

13
00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.614
We all know what it has on the back.

14
00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:57.943
Well, it has its tags.

15
00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:03.722
5000 tags can have it and these tags are really hair that is reformed.

16
00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:07.284
Imagine if we had such nice tags instead.

17
00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:12.984
These tags are designed to protect the hedgehog so no one should come and check it out.

18
00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.903
When the hedgehog becomes scared, it cures.

19
00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:21.837
Then it stops all the tags outwards so that those who want to eat them stick their mouths.

20
00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:30.177
The hedgehog has 4 small legs with small claws on the feet, a small nose, small ears and small eyes.

21
00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:33.971
They don't look great but they feel scents great.

22
00:01:34.286 --> 00:01:36.857
That way they chase up what they want to eat.

23
00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.347
But what does the hedgehog eat

24
00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:54.721
Well, the hedgehog eats worms, beetles, snails, bird eggs they can take, small mouse cubs, frogs ...

25
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.297
... and even snakes they can eat.

26
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.071
The hedgehog can handle pretty good snake poison, so they can.

27
00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:10.263
What is most amazing about the hedgehog eats beetles, do you know what it is

28
00:02:10.852 --> 00:02:16.107
Well, because what you eat comes out like poop.

29
00:02:16.248 --> 00:02:20.000
So when the hedgehogs poop, it is pooping glitter.

30
00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:24.878
The hedgehog's poop shines off the beetle shells that are in it.

31
00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:27.086
So it actually sparkles.

32
00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:30.341
How does a hedgehog sound

33
00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:32.563
They don't sound like much.

34
00:02:32.712 --> 00:02:38.009
You can hear how they scream around there at night because these are awake at night.

35
00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:42.100
Then they crawl out and look for food in our gardens

36
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.143
You can actually feed the hedgehog if you want.

37
00:02:46.643 --> 00:02:53.694
You should keep in mind not to feed it with milk because they are allergic, instead you can exhibit water ...

38
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960
... or cat food they can enjoy.

39
00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:03.881
The hedgehog is starting to wake up now in the spring for all winter it has been in hibernation.

40
00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:11.379
It hides in a pile of leaves or twigs and it is almost like dead.

41
00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:16.901
The heart beats only a few blows and it just breathes a little neighbor.

42
00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:20.000
But then in the spring it arrives.

43
00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:25.777
In fact, the hedgehogs are not very common anymore.

44
00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:29.834
They will actually be included in the red list that will be this year.

45
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.149
This means that they are starting to become really unusual.

46
00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:40.157
You do not know exactly why the hedgehogs are getting fewer, but they have difficulty finding good places to sleep.

47
00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:50.156
If you have a garden, it is good to leave some deciduous piles and rice piles where the hedgehog can winter.

48
00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:55.224
But now I think we should have our own hedgehogs.

49
00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:02.464
So, now I've got some help.
 -Yes!

50
00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:06.972
We are going to make hedgehogs.

51
00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:17.553
We will make the hedgehogs of witch dough and then we need flour, salt, water ...

52
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.045
And a little like that.

53
00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:21.003
And a little like this oil.

54
00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:24.009
Then we want the magic dough to be brown, or how

55
00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:25.394
For the hedgehog is brown.

56
00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:30.272
Then we have old coffee grounds that I was going to color with.

57
00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:33.347
And to tags, what do we have then

58
00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:35.324
What is that for something then

59
00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.449
Ehm, conifer.

60
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.988
Yes, it is.

61
00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:43.258
We have pine cones if we are to make small tags.

62
00:04:43.706 --> 00:04:44.691
Let's go

63
00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:49.806
Now we are going to make magic dough pink.

64
00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:53.721
Then we will have 1 cup flour.

65
00:04:56.484 --> 00:04:57.955
Should you pour in

66
00:04:58.755 --> 00:05:00.501
It's like I'm baking.

67
00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:03.104
Yes, but just like when we bake.

68
00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:08.368
So we should have in salt, half a deciliter.

69
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.833
So.

70
00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:17.517
Then we will have in a little coffee sump, what remains when you have made coffee.

71
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.727
If we get a little.

72
00:05:21.298 --> 00:05:23.298
So, half a deciliter.

73
00:05:24.288 --> 00:05:25.886
Yes, take everything together.

74
00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:29.782
So we should have some water, half a deciliter.

75
00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:32.348
So.

76
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:33.629
And a little oil.

77
00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:34.697
Splash, splash.

78
00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:38.595
Now we are around it.

79
00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:42.394
So this will be a dough.

80
00:05:42.524 --> 00:05:43.552
Mom, this then?

81
00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.504
Yes, it was the one we had before and would show how you did.

82
00:05:50.864 --> 00:05:54.428
I can't bake.
 -You can bake?

83
00:06:02.197 --> 00:06:05.128
Now let's see if we can get to this witch dough.

84
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.146
Look here you'll see.

85
00:06:07.258 --> 00:06:09.364
We gather it like this.

86
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:15.314
Oh.

87
00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:17.720
I want it.

88
00:06:17.983 --> 00:06:23.301
Look now we're going to make a hedgehog of that.

89
00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:26.771
But we should not make such a big hedgehog but a small hedgehog.

90
00:06:26.924 --> 00:06:28.924
Here you get and make a little hedgehog.

91
00:06:29.117 --> 00:06:31.117
Here I can make a little hedgehog.

92
00:06:32.122 --> 00:06:35.771
The hedgehogs they are a little elongated.

93
00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:39.258
So we roll this one and make it like a small sausage.

94
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:40.790
That's how.

95
00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:43.042
But I don't want to do.

96
00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:45.267
You don't want to make one?

97
00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:46.178
Well but then I do one.

98
00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:50.366
Then we will make a small nose on the hedgehog.

99
00:06:50.504 --> 00:06:52.504
Hello there little hedgehog.

100
00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:58.771
Then the hedgehog will get tags.

101
00:06:59.047 --> 00:07:01.427
Then we have these bars.

102
00:07:02.405 --> 00:07:06.392
But the bars are so long so we cut them into small pieces.

103
00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:10.108
So.

104
00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:14.297
Then you can take here and put in hedgehogs on your hedgehog.

105
00:07:14.774 --> 00:07:16.774
I want to stop in yours.

106
00:07:17.164 --> 00:07:20.559
Should you stop in mine?
 Yes, put in my hedgehog.

107
00:07:21.556 --> 00:07:23.197
We can have it together.

108
00:07:23.578 --> 00:07:24.754
I want mine.

109
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:28.311
You want yours, yes but then you take yours and stop tags on yours.

110
00:07:28.617 --> 00:07:29.856
No.

111
00:07:30.224 --> 00:07:32.224
I do one ...

112
00:07:38.997 --> 00:07:40.997
What are you doing then?

113
00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:50.626
Now let's see, look so many hedgehogs it got and a little strange plut there.

114
00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.138
Can you help me stop in hedgehogs

115
00:07:54.234 --> 00:07:55.093
It was me.

116
00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.260
Well, was it you who made the little dot?

117
00:07:58.432 --> 00:08:00.432
Look, can you help me

118
00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:02.805
Great

119
00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:07.242
You have to stick them in.

120
00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:16.073
The hedgehog has a lot of tags.

121
00:08:16.891 --> 00:08:19.081
5000, so we have to sit here for a while.

122
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:22.463
These?
 -Yes but like those.

123
00:08:22.728 --> 00:08:24.728
5.6.
 -6.7.

124
00:08:25.852 --> 00:08:28.338
It is good for no one to want to eat the hedgehog.

125
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.420
They protect themselves with their tags

126
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.000
But look, now it is starting to be a little hedgehog.

127
00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:37.014
But the hedgehog must ...

128
00:08:37.273 --> 00:08:38.280
... was it sharp

129
00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:40.000
Like a hedgehog.

130
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:43.940
It must get eyes.

131
00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:47.023
I't was not there.
 -No, there were no eyes.

132
00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.152
No pen either.

133
00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:53.178
There, it had just hidden.

134
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.816
It was I who didn't find the pen.

135
00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.096
So we can draw small eyes.

136
00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:00.336
At the front have the hedgehog small eyes

137
00:09:01.464 --> 00:09:06.001
So it has a black nose so it can feel scents.

138
00:09:06.174 --> 00:09:08.174
I want it.
 -Yes, you want it.

139
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.620
Should you make tags on yours too

140
00:09:17.016 --> 00:09:18.445
You make dots.

141
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:23.930
It is not always that people want to play that you want to play yourself.

142
00:09:24.304 --> 00:09:27.699
I want to do.
 -Yes you should do as you please.

143
00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:32.941
Should we build a small nest to the hedgehog

144
00:09:34.013 --> 00:09:36.013
Look here you'll see.

145
00:09:36.941 --> 00:09:39.364
Here we have some paper.

146
00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:40.663
Here the hedgehog will be allowed to live.

147
00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:44.805
Idgehogs like to rest in winter and go to hibernation.

148
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:50.763
The heart beats very dealing, almost so they lie dead in deciduous piles.

149
00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:52.671
So I thought we were taking some old leaves.

150
00:09:52.769 --> 00:09:56.312
I usually glue like a small V, or one up and down V.

151
00:09:58.001 --> 00:09:59.536
So we attach some leaves here.

152
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.670
Look

153
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.204
Oh.

154
00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:10.157
Look now, now it becomes like a small hut for the hedgehog so it can go in there.

155
00:10:13.315 --> 00:10:15.315
Like that, look what a nice thing.

156
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.020
How are your hedgehogs going
