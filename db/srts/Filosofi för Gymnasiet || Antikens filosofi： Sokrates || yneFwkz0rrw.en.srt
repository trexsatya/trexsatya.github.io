1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,920
With Socrates, a new chapter begins in Western philosophy.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,860
When the former natural philosophers are mainly interested in explaining the world,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,060
Those interested in how man would best live his life.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,340
He was well versed in the former thinkers (by the afterlife often referred to as pre -democrats when they came before Socrates),

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,160
But said that their theories - albeit interesting - were basically meaningless.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,820
What does it really matter if everything basically consists of atoms

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,320
If we are still ignorant of issues that concern how to live our lives?

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,040
Philosophy should therefore investigate issues of practical importance to us humans, Socrates said.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,760
What is justice? What is knowledge? What is truth? What is courage? These are examples of issues of importance.

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,000
I do not have the answers to these questions myself, but I realize that no one else has it either.

11
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,800
Socrates therefore came to use a method called dialectics.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,200
This is based on the fact that knowledge is born in discussions through arguments and counter -arguments.

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,400
The best method was, according to Socrates, the public conversation - an open dialogue for anyone who wanted to participate.

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,640
He made only three demands on his interlocutors:

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,180
They would speak based on their own conviction - not repeat what others said.

16
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36.560
They were not allowed to present contradictory arguments.

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,660
And they had to clearly define the words, expressions and concepts used.

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,900
He wandered around the big square in Athens, Agoran,

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,460
And asked questions about morality and politics to anyone who wanted to listen.

20
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,140
The discussions he started became of great interest and the approach was always the same.

21
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,820
Anyone who believed to know the answer was challenged

22
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,140
And Socrates submitted the answer a review by asking a number of follow -up questions.

23
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,100
Almost always emerged the shortcomings in the original response

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,240
Then the interlocutor revised the reasoning and tried again.

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,460
Socratic thinking became famous and it revealed ignorance in people with alleged knowledge.

26
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:26,060
Although Socrates herself rarely gave any final answers (and in that case it would have been included in his method

27
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:33,320
To emphasize that each such response would also be subjected to review) he stimulated an interest in philosophy.

28
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,920
He taught people to question everything, which would also be his ruin.

29
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,080
In the end, he was arrested by the authorities who are tired of being constantly being questioned,

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,760
And he was sentenced to death.

31
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,280
Although his friends and students offered help in fleeing, Socrates opposed this

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,560
And talked about how citizens must obey the laws and the authorities' decisions.

33
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,680
After saying goodbye to his wife and children he spoke with his disciples about the immortality of the soul

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06.880
and then emptied the poison cup as a soldier full of excuses gave him.

35
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,620
There are lots of rumors and claims about Socrates,

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,040
Among other things, he is said to have been small, thick and unusually ugly.

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,080
According to information he was married to Xantippa - a very quarrelsome and angry woman,

38
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,680
But also the only one who could defeat Socrates in a discussion.

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,900
He is alleged to have also been virtually insensitive to cold and physical exertion,

40
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,920
And it is said that he could stand pondering for hours, completely unaware of the outside world.

41
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,620
Often he spoke to his inner voice, his "daimon", when he doubted that a way to act really the right thing.

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,540
A major problem when it comes to our knowledge of Socrates is that he never wrote anything.

43
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,480
Most of what we know about him comes from his students, mainly Plato.

44
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,600
But what is really reproduced by Socrates thoughts in these writings

45
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,700
And what in turn is Plato's own doctrine is something that is constantly being discussed.

46
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05.440
In summary, Socrates has had a huge influence on philosophy.

47
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,700
Not only did he define many of the issues that philosophy is still engaged in today, such as moral philosophy,

48
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:20,180
His dialectical method and emphasis on critical thinking have permeated philosophy since the days of ancient times.
