1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,920
Here's the deal...

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,584
Here are our house parts.

3
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:06,137
Yes.

4
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:11,120
What the heck?

5
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:12,800
Don't bump it.

6
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,458
No!

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,240
Laura, you must jump down.

8
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:22,534
- Let Laura down.
- I can't. I have to hold the parts.

9
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,274
Hey, hey!

10
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,880
Today, we are doing...

11
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:40,059
The Gingerbread House Challenge!

12
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:42,339
The longest word in the world.

13
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,859
- It's a competition where you build a gingerbread house.
- Yes.

14
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,859
- A nice, funny, lovely, inspiring house.
- Yes.

15
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,459
- The one who makes the nicest one wins.
- Exactly.

16
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:57,081
- And is the best.
- Exactly.

17
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,640
We've split into two teams.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm a little worried about today's challenge.

19
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:11,299
Here in Portugal, they don't have those
gingerbread house kits from, like, "Mor Annas".

20
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:15,054
- No, exactly.
- Is that what it's called?

21
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:18,619
- I think it's called "Farmor Anna".
- Or just "Annas Pepparkaka".

22
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:19,419
Yes.

23
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:25,869
Anyhow, they don't have it here.
Portuguese don't eat, or build, gingerbread houses.

24
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,929
They basically don't eat gingerbread at all.

25
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:31,059
- That's true.
- Yes.

26
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:37,539
We have to start by drawing up what our houses should look like.
You have prepared a dough.

27
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:46,619
- Yes. I made a huge dough yesterday, so it's ready.
- Mm. And what are the teams?

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,659
- Me and Alma. The best team.
- And me and Mommy and Lauris.

29
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:59,263
- What? You get help from her?
- Yes, she's the world's best mascot!

30
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:01,463
The winning mascot.

31
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:08,299
Let's split up and start working on our house dreams.
That's why we have so much paper here.

32
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,979
- I think we should go to the kitchen.
- We'll go to the kitchen, and you guys stay here.

33
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:17,823
Shoo, shoo, shoo! Go!

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,676
- Bye-bye!
- Laura doesn't understand a thing.

35
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:26,539
We have had a few different ideas.
First, Harry thought we should do a horror house.

36
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,699
"Poppy Pli Time"

37
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:33,459
- Then you thought about a sushi restaurant.
- Mm.

38
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:43,240
Then we thought a lot about the shape and decided that
it would be easiest to just print out templates from the web.

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,600
So that's what we did,
and we will put more energy into the decorating.

40
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:52,840
What kind of house will it be?
Do we know?

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,619
Harry's Toys store!

42
00:02:57,276 --> 00:03:01,200
We will see.
We may change our minds again.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,898
Anyway, here we have little Harry.
Can you see it in this light?

44
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,939
- Are you filming?
- Mm.

45
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,659
- I didn't even notice.
- Want to tell us what you're doing?

46
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:26,307
I'm making a hat
for mine and dad's Moomin house.

47
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:28,017
Ta-da!

48
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:37,065
Yes, the scissors are scary.
It's very sharp.

49
00:03:38,856 --> 00:03:42,584
No, Harry. Little rascal.

50
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:50,219
And you're eating candy
even though it's not Saturday.

51
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:55,850
Is that allowed?

52
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:05,139
So, here's the deal. Mommy and Harry think that
we'll make the same gingerbread house they're making.

53
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,920
Let me see.

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:15,200
Because we took these papers.
But we really made this thing for the dough.

55
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:20,800
This is for the roof... like so.

56
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:25,840
And now we will
prepare to make the walls.

57
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,059
I'll just draw here.

58
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,213
- Alma.
- Mm.

59
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:41,599
- Which piece is for us?
- This one.

60
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:47,000
- Ah, the big one.
- What? I thought they were the same size.

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,219
Let me see.

62
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:53,374
- These are the same size.
- Kind of.

63
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
There!

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,944
Time to roll the dough.

65
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,353
Here are our house parts.

66
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,459
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

67
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:21,763
- We're just missing the chimney. It's in the oven.
- Yes.

68
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,059
Yes, what's that?

69
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:29,613
You have to take out the pacifier
so that we can hear what you're saying.

70
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,949
No? You don't want to show it.

71
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:38,160
Stop, stop, stop!
Harry, you should probably save that from Laura.

72
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,840
Gone!

73
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:46,820
No!

74
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:50,349
What's happening?

75
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:55,779
Our house parts are breaking and falling off.

76
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,253
- You're making it so advanced!
- This will never work.

77
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,779
Never say never.

78
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:06,400
Don't bump it!

79
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:08,168
No!

80
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:16,543
Alma, what are we going to do?
Oh, no!

81
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,779
You'll have to make a new part.

82
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:24,000
No! This must be repairable.
Everything can be repaired, especially in Portugal.

83
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,520
Everything can be repaired with icing.

84
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,692
The houses are crooked,
and they can still be repaired.

85
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:38,059
- Laura broke our freshly baked chimney.
- Laura, your little rascal!

86
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:43,979
We can probably make it work, I hope.
Now we have all our parts.

87
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:49,059
God, my hair...
It's so hot to be by the oven, or what do you say?

88
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:53,822
- Yes.
- You also look a little... ragged.

89
00:07:54,059 --> 00:08:04,499
First we tried to put our parts together
with cold baking glue. Was that a good idea?

90
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:09,080
- No.
- No, a very bad idea. So, now we've had it in a water bath.

91
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:15,697
God, the way I'm sitting...
Having Laura on your team should give you a handicap.

92
00:08:16,016 --> 00:08:19,706
Shall we assemble it
with the warm baking glue?

93
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:23,102
Put some there.

94
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:27,400
Now it's easier, right?

95
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:33,498
- Is it still a little hard?
- Yes, wait... Now, now.

96
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,696
Okay.
It was rock-hard before the water bath.

97
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:41,459
Wait...

98
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,800
There, some glue.
Now let's put them together.

99
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,014
Ooh, two walls.

100
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,761
And let's put this here.

101
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:56,139
- No, no, no!
- Don't take it.

102
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:58,619
- Do you want it?
- Mm.

103
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,190
- Oops!
- Of course she does.

104
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:11,905
- Let's take this one.
- Yes. I wonder how long it takes for it to dry. It doesn't say.

105
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:19,019
This is our side, with a door. It's gonna go there.
Shall we put glue on it?

106
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,424
Yes.

107
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:24,659
- I think it comes out pretty easy now.
- Yes.

108
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,173
It looks like this.

109
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:35,506
Yes, you want that.
But we need it as a little weight there.

110
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:44,306
Okay, take it.
Do you want to go to daddy and Alma?

111
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,779
I'm like, "Bye-bye."
Now. Now, Harry.

112
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:55,619
- This will be our roof.
- Without the aluminum foil.

113
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:03,059
Yes, the goal is to be able to lift it.
I mean, this isn't going to dry today, I don't know how...

114
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,720
Laura is having her best day ever.

115
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,516
She's just walking around and playing with things,
and she loved rolling out the rough.

116
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:19,368
Cutie pie.
Oh, are you going to bake cupcakes now?

117
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,480
This will be interesting.

118
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:33,000
- Now you're also at the assembly stage.
- Yes, but I mean...

119
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,160
Mommy is here.

120
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,690
I've never made such an advanced...

121
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,988
Oh, our heads are getting cut off,
maybe we should raise the camera.

122
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:47,720
We'll have to sit down.
I'll go and get more parts, Alma.

123
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,099
- That's an incredibly high level of ambition on your part.
- Oh, yes.

124
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:57,548
We lowered the demands instead.
We just printed out a template.

125
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:02,729
Oh, they're different heights.

126
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:07,640
How could that happen?
They're made from the same template.

127
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:12,651
- This is going to turn out so good.
- Mm.

128
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:16,000
Harry, I need your help. The roof.

129
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,371
I'll take the most durable part.

130
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,835
Wait, wait, wait!

131
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:24,219
Don't touch it.

132
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:28,594
- Harry, I need your help.
- This is never going to work.

133
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:32,400
Stop laughing like that, like a ghost!

134
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,760
You can hear the panic.
It's pure and utter.

135
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:44,139
- No, no, no!
- Oh my God! Laura... Laura, you have to get down.

136
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:48,605
- Let Laura down.
- I can't. I have to hold the parts.

137
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:53,885
Quiet!

138
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:57,960
Our gingerbread house
is starting to feel more and more like dough.

139
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:01,264
Yes, the parts feel a little wet.

140
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,418
No!

141
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,499
- You have to wait with your little figure, Harry.
- It broke its leg.

142
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:10,040
Harry is just focusing on his gingerbread man
while I'm struggling with the house.

143
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,560
- He amputated his own leg, on purpose.
- Yeah.

144
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:18,598
I talked to another parent
at the Swedish School here in Portugal-

145
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,760
-and told him that we're going to make
gingerbread houses.

146
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:31,855
He said, "You better do it fast because they don't last that long.
They, like, collapse due to the humidity."

147
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:37,379
And that seems to be correct.
It's much more humid here, indoors too.

148
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:42,899
In Sweden, a gingerbread house could last all winter.
Here, forget about it.

149
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:44,903
It barely lasts a week here.

150
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,139
No...

151
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,254
What the heck!

152
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,560
No!

153
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:55,440
No! But...

154
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:59,842
Oh, how messy. Shall I help you?

155
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:04,345
- No.
- It's too late.

156
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:12,748
Our house doesn't have an entrance, Alma.

157
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:52,956
We are done!

158
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, almost done.

159
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,570
The sun sets at 5:20 PM in Portugal.

160
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,079
- More? More gingerbread houses?
- Mm.

161
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:08,400
- No, thanks. We are done!
- Yes.

162
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,520
We have moved to the brightest house...

163
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,160
No.

164
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,441
...the brightest room
in the whole house to show you...

165
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,720
- Our creations.
- Yes.

166
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,640
- Why did you go like that?
- It's so hot.

167
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:30,440
Yes, from the oven earlier.
This has been one of our hottest, sweatiest, and most stressful...

168
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:31,640
And messiest.

169
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,800
- ...recordings. 
- Yes.

170
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,600
- But when we edit, it probably won't look that bad.
- No.

171
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,462
- Okay. Who starts presenting their house?
- Me and Mommy.

172
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,242
- Okay.
- And Lauris.

173
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,766
- You remember the story, right?
- I do. I'll move the house closer and let you tell it.

174
00:14:55,159 --> 00:15:00,691
Once upon a time,
there was a toy store called Harry's Toys.

175
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,646
It was created by Harry himself.

176
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,800
One beautiful day, the roof collapsed,
and then it was over.

177
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:20,641
So, he decided to give all the presents
to the kids that lived in the town.

178
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:27,200
Ever since then, it's called Harry's...

179
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,755
- Ruin.
- ...ruin.

180
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,400
- Great!
- It looks like this.

181
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,560
- Right. The roof was difficult to put on.
- Incredibly.

182
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:42,001
It just slid off.

183
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Once upon a time, there was a happy Moomin family
that lived in a big Moomin house.

184
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:53,000
They loved Christmas, and this particular Christmas
they had bought a bunch of presents.

185
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,436
However, some burglars got in
and took all the presents.

186
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,800
The Moomin family
were absolutely devastated, so they left.

187
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,200
Then, the roof collapsed
and pretty much the whole house cracked.

188
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:16,600
Yes, and now we don't know who lives here.
There are some Christmas tree lights and other things hanging here.

189
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,080
- Exactly. They light up every winter.
- Yes.

190
00:16:21,224 --> 00:16:26,782
- Here, you can see traces from the break-in.
- Yes, there's a ladder here.

191
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,645
Now it's up to you guys at home to decide
who won today's challenge!

192
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,440
Yes.

193
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:36,971
- Team Harry, or...
- Team Alma.
