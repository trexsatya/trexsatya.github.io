1
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.280
Art - or weirdness?

2
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.560
Sweden's art history is part of the huge story of our country.

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.720
With some selected impacts, we will show art that depict changes -

4
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.000
–And Creation power.

5
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.680
Or what is art, really?

6
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.920
Is this art?
 Nobody knows.

7
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.080
But we start here anyway.

8
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.640
In the shadow of Nämforsen's power plants there are thousands of tracks -

9
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.880
- Of the possibly artistic creation of our ancestors.

10
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.320
There is a lot of ship and a lot of moose.
 461 moose out of 2,600 rock carvings.

11
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.960
The ships and boats are important to them.

12
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.600
But how it would fulfill some function to do this -

13
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.600
- If there is any magic, a hunting diary or mythology, you can't know.

14
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.960
Many have speculated, but you cannot lead it in evidence.

15
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.400
Gustaf Hallström, who made them famous -

16
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.720
- Called them for Sweden's largest monumental artwork.

17
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.800
There is no scientific method that allows us to get a year -

18
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.600
- But you can try to narrow it.

19
00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.360
The simplest thing is when you can have started - it is 4,500 BC.

20
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.440
Before that, this was under water.

21
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.320
First everything was under ice.

22
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.560
Slowly, the people migrated when the inland ice pulled away.

23
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.240
Some places provided a lot of food.
 There they stopped.

24
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.680
It is bad with water in the Ångerman River this fall.

25
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.320
But it should well arrange for floating and power supply -

26
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.000
- And in the optimistic spirit, Nämforsen's power plant has been inaugurated.

27
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.040
Antiquarian Hallström shows the princess the rock carvings.

28
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.200
The largest overall group you know from northern and central Europe.

29
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.760
Be careful now, Mr Hallström, when you paint in the old carvings!

30
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.160
When the rock carvings were knocked in thousands of years ago, they were white.

31
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.680
They could be turquoise, so it is realized that the painting is hit.

32
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.480
The advantage is that you see them, but you only see someone who has interpreted them.

33
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.560
It can be a little different how you have painted them.

34
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.200
Sometimes a figure has been done differently - right or wrong is difficult to say.

35
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.320
The figure where a moose kisses a salmon ... or is it the salmon that kisses the moose?

36
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.280
We don't really know that.
 But where they meet it is like an elevation -

37
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.840
- So probably they have not been done at the same time.
 But it's a nice picture.

38
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.480
Fine, new pictures are still discovered by the researchers-with modern 3D technology.

39
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.200
Behind this mossy surface, this huge ship hides.

40
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.600
Maybe it was travelers who were looking for new settlements along the northern coast.

41
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.080
The most common motif in Nämforsen is the moose.

42
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.360
Important food, of course, but perhaps also spirit.

43
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.040
Was the carving in the stone a way to advance the meat?

44
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.440
Art as a vital part of everyday life?

45
00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.920
It raises many thoughts.
 I move in the forests where the people chased.

46
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.840
If you encounter any catch pit or shard, man - - knows -

47
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.360
- That it was an old man or girl there before me.

48
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.960
It's amazing when the sun goes in clouds and one settles on a cliff-

49
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.600
-And the sun comes at a certain angle and it just explodes with pictures!

50
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.280
What you want with ancient times is not their arrowheads and axes -

51
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.280
- Without how they lived and thought.
 And closer than the pictures you will not come.

52
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.200
They are not very clear, but they raise more thoughts on it.

53
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.560
