C. Head Tapers Jävlar!

159
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.520
It was good, Gun.

160
00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.440
-A little more?
 -Yes thank you.

161
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.200
- Yes?
 -I am full.

162
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.800
And so a little lingonberry.

163
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:22.120
Shouldn't you have some food, honey?
 It is good.

164
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.000
Don't you like cabbage dolls, Gösta?

165
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:36.640
- Dad is so bad.
 - It's right for him.

166
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:45.840
He has an unfortunate ability to complicate everything.

167
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.600
And he is not particularly handy.

168
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:58.040
Grandpa, do you remember when Dad was breaking your tractor?

169
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:09.640
If I were to put on some coffee ...

170
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:25.080
- I want to get stuck in the laundry.
 - He is your dad anyway.

171
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.520
He thinks he knows best.

172
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.360
He is not so easy.

173
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.560
He wants us to have a nice holiday.

174
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:45.680
- I would have had to stay home.
 -Yes Yes.

175
00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.160
You can try to be a little kind.

176
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.520
Next summer you may not be.

177
00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:00.080
- You are soon big now.
 - But he doesn't notice.

178
00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:11.480
It's only a few weeks left now.
 We still have it pretty wonderful.

179
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.480
Differently than at home.

180
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:30.640
You're really good.
 - Gösta, join now!
 You can stand in the goal.

181
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.600
C. sound high pop music

182
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:19.320
C. Head talkative you kick ball here?
 People want C. Head talkatives from having some calm on their vacation.

183
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:31.520
- Are you with, Grandpa?
 -I can not take it.
 Grandpa is tired.

184
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
- Dad, do you play football with me?
 C. Head talk - I don't feel good.

185
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.840
- Let dad be at peace.
 - Can we not swim, then?

186
00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:54.280
-What are you doing?
 -!
 Pee and lie down ...

187
00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.960
Lotta has a hubby!
 Lotta has a hubby!
 - Look, Dad!

188
00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:09.880
- Lotta has a hubby.
 C. Head talk - yeah?!
 You haven't said anything about that.

189
00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.560
C. Head talk - What is he called, then?
 -I know.
 His name is Lasse.

190
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.600
-Lasse ... - now, Gösta!

191
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.800
Don't you understand that the girl is getting sad?

192
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.600
- Look, mom!
 - In the refrigerator.

193
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.640
C. Head talk - hurry now, Gun!
 - Where should you go?

194
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:48.720
Into town and shop.
 Gösta wants something strong against the headaches.

195
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.000
Well, should you buy out?
 - Gösta!

196
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.080
Do you want to be kind and buy a half for me?

197
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.320
C. Head talkative response is that satan system?
 C. Head talk noise is not able to.

198
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.760
Take it easy.

199
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.760

200
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.040
Beware the cyclist!
 But not here!

201
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.760

Good morning.

237
00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:27.600
-Dad!
 I want to bathe.

-Why not?
 C. Head talk - but quiet now!

239
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:39.480
There will be nothing bathing for you this summer - and no fishing either.

240
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:45.200
Grandpa says we should never bathe.
 You are giant!

241
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.960
-Stop now!
 - Dad, Lotta strikes me!

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.760
How is it?

245
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.560
Ruotsi ... Sweden!

246
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.920

C. Head talk!
 Go to mom now.
 C. Head talk - What was it?

252
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.800
My ball is gone.
 Not there.
 Where!

253
00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:48.640
- It's the wrong ball.
 C. Head talk - It doesn't matter.
 This one is finer.

254
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.360
- It's not mine.
 C. Head Tapers - play now!
 I blow up the mattress.

255
00:41:53.520 --> 00:42:00.800

256
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:07.000

 - I don't want to fish, I want to swim.

257
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.960
- Dad, Blow this up too.
 C. Head talk - not two things at the same time!

258
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.000
-I do not want to.
 C. Head talk - but bathe now.

259
00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.640
No one else bathes.
 I do not want to!

260
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:23.800
C. Head talkative self understands nothing.
 For two weeks c. Head talk, you have been chatting about this.
 Bathe!

261
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.960

No, Matilda!
 Remove the bucket!

266
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.160

You're not really wise, shit guy!

297
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:45.320
C. Head talk - not another sound!
 - Now I have had a headache.

298
00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:01.400
C. Head talkative do you not eat?
 C. Head Tapraredu has no food.

299
00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:07.240
- No urgency for me.
 C. Head talk - why don't you take a "today's"?

300
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:13.280
C. The head talk is only to sabotage.

301
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.440
C. Head Tapers - Sabotage!

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:17.560
- I have to lighten the bladder.
 C. Head talk - not again!
 You don't do anything else.

309
00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:22.480
Gösta, I can't stay anymore.

310
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.880
No!

311
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.560
