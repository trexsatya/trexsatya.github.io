00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,640
Without concrete criminal suspicion. - Jimmie, you can develop.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
I think it is too narrow when you have to deprive someone and not.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,880
How long should you be able to sit detained on someone ...?

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,920
This type of detail ...

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,920
That's the details! Jimmie tries to loosen up Swedish legal society.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,240
Anders Holmberg, your nerd, focuses on petitesses such as time and length.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,960
Geeky.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
But Jimmie's proposal has been effective in other countries.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,040
You can look at Eritrea.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Dawit Isaak has not written a single regime -critical article since 2001.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,840
I just say there may be something here.
