1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,500
I watched several different videos on installing particleboard before tackling my own.

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,520
I still managed to find a number of mistakes that they didn't cover in these videos, so

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:25,920
I thought I'd show a little again which five mistakes I made and which ones I avoided.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,700
One thing that is easy to miss is that

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,180
chipboards have an upside and a downside.

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,940
I don't know what role they play, but it's just as well to do the right thing.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,840
A near-death experience you can avoid

8
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,260
if you think about it - is that the discs become slippery when you have them lying in a pile.

9
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,640
Don't try to jump down on a stack of discs

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,980
or take a big step between the joists on a stack like this.

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,080
It could end badly.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,360
One of the first and most important steps

13
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,620
when laying particleboard is to get the first row perfectly nailed.

14
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,520
If it started to warp a little, in any direction, you will get a fault that will

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,020
propagate throughout the floor and you will also have to fight with it

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,560
every new row you start with and the fault will

17
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,600
always be with you and you can't get rid of it .

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,800
To get the first row straight, you can

19
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:39,210
lace the floor and above all make sure that the short sides lie tightly against each other.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,820
Are they completely tight so they don't miss anything.

21
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,080
So the rows will be straight they just need to be adjusted laterally.

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,780
One mistake I made here was that I started with the wrong page.

23
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,320
As you can see, these are chipboards. And if you see, they are

24
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,890
on one side, it is a batten that lies

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,980
close to the joists, while the other comes as a lip from above.

26
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,170
You must of course have the lip that lies down against the bars outwards at all times.

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,220
Then you glue it directly to the floor and you avoid the problems I ran into

28
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:35,260
trying to get this lip under the previous board.

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,020
This means that when you have screwed it and glued it.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,560
If you have waited a day, there may be

31
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,260
glue residue or something else in between, which makes it completely hopeless to get it in there.

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,840
That's why you have to check each and every disc you place so that

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,540
it's free underneath before you start hitting it.

34
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,880
Because once you've put on glue and start hammering in

35
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,420
the disc, it's not easy to remove it and fix it afterwards.

36
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,140
And above all, even if it succeeds, it's very messy with all the glue.

37
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,740
So start with the right side out.

38
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
It's not very difficult, it's just

39
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,760
that you have the right side up on the disc and make sure that the lip down - is outwards the one

40
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,840
you put against the new discs.

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,400
One point I missed in the chipboard videos I saw

42
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,380
was how to join the corners.

43
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,080
To put one long side against another long side.

44
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,540
It's just a matter of pressing and it usually works quite easily.

45
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,140
But what they don't show

46
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:44,160
is how they do it to get both the long side and the short side to be tight together.

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,160
For the pros, it seems it's just a matter of

48
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,300
throwing the discs there and maybe stomping and kicking them a bit and they end up right.

49
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,340
It hasn't been that easy for me.

50
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,060
I have therefore manufactured a hangover with

51
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,279
the same function as you use when laying

52
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:11,140
parquet or click flooring.

53
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,660
And this hangover makes it possible to knock the disc there.

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:22,540
It is not possible to knock on the real sides of the board because they are chipboards.

55
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,220
It is very easy to ruin the edges.

56
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,280
The batten on these chipboards and you also have to think about that when you handle them.

57
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,000
If you put them on the short side when you

58
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:38,600
bump, you will immediately destroy this little chipboard batten.

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,400
Another mistake you can make, which in and

60
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:58,060
of itself you learn quite quickly and avoid, is to apply the glue in the right order.

61
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,220
If you start by gluing

62
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,100
all the batten edges, you will keep smearing the glue on your hands.

63
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,820
Therefore, I put the glue on the one

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,540
that is stuck first and then I glue on the disc that

65
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,760
is to be put there. And you do it in the right order.

66
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,000
In this way, you avoid getting so much glue on your fingers.

67
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,900
And when you have to push the disc there,

68
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,640
you also have the glue under the rules, which makes it slide quite easily.

69
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,280
If you pull it back and forth a little,

70
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,480
the glue spreads out and then you push it there.

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,720
And as is so often the case when I put these

72
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,220
discs in anyway, it doesn't go right into place,

73
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,680
but that's when I pick out my little hangover.

74
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,260
I made the hangover from a piece of waste wood from another chipboard.

75
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,620
Corresponding seam on the one on the board and then I have nailed

76
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,740
or screwed on a piece of chipboard and a block to be able to tap.

77
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,800
You don't have to touch, you shouldn't touch

78
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,060
very hard, it's just that you have power in the right direction.

79
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,540
It's pretty hopeless to get power

80
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,860
in the right direction otherwise with these discs if you're going to try with manual power.

81
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,680
And like I said, you can't hit the clean

82
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,760
edge as it is because it ruins it.

83
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
And the goal is to get

84
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,480
the boards in so tightly together that glue penetrates between them.

85
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,060
And finally make sure to get the short side tight.

86
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,380
Here you can see that it

87
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,160
doesn't go fast, but it comes so slowly and slides in and then

88
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,520
finally you see the glue push up when it's in place for real.

89
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
There comes the glue.

90
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,300
Another mistake you can make that I have made here and before

91
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,160
is not having a damp cloth to wipe off the glue.

92
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,620
Do not wipe off the glue.

93
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,020
Then you will need to sand it off when it hardens.

94
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,980
And if you do as I do here, use a small scrap piece to

95
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:18,340
remove the glue, it's easy that you'll be satisfied.

96
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,040
At the end of the working day, you leave the piece of wood and then it is glued to the floor.

97
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,720
Mistake number five that I've made a few

98
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,120
times is trusting my eye gauge a little too much.

99
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,120
I screwed the chipboards into the joists.

100
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,640
Three screws in each rule except where you have a joint.

101
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,500
There should be four screws in the chipboard on each rule next to the joint.

102
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,560
And if you trust the eye gauge, you think that this is the rule,

103
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,040
and then it turns out that when the screw is tightened, it

104
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,540
just spins in the air. It's not a disaster

105
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,420
but you shouldn't do what I did here.

106
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,280
To guess that "the rule is enough on

107
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,860
this side" but do as I do on this film.

108
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,520
Have a straightedge of some kind so you

109
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,760
can lay out so you know where it should sit.

110
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,940
Because it is easy to mistake where the rule

111
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,000
is somewhere and it is unnecessary to be annoyed.

112
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,360
Putting it wrong puts the screws wrong.

113
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,240
If you got anything out of this video

114
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,060
