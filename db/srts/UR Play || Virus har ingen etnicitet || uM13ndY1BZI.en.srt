1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,120
There is a thing that the rulers do not agree on.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,280
Something small that still seems important to everyone: what the Coronavirus should be called.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,520
It's not racist.
 It comes from China.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,640
Stigmat is more dangerous than the virus itself.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,040
Trump replaces "Corona" with "Chinese"

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,120
Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the Viral Reviewer.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,480
Today, they run the source criticism, Sweden's national team in source criticism.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,440
Now they, together with Edwin Safari, are doing Källkoll Corona.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,040
Trump has wanted to call the virus the Chinese virus.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,560
It suits him well.
 He wants to blame for things in other countries.

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,680
It has been accused of racism.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,080
People seem to want to divide things and each other into groups.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,320
Group division can be used to spread hatred in the worst case-

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,800
-When there are dangers or diseases that are spread.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,640
Then you can take the group that you think most badly om-

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,280
-And you put them in some scapegoat.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,080
The Coronavirus has led to increased sinophobia.

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,800
Hate crime against East Asians, but also against People of Color, as black in China.

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,920
It experienced many Chinese in Africa during the Corona crisis's early stage-

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,000
-When Chinese were seen as a carrier.

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,560
Just as Black in China has been exposed to hop-

22
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,120
-Have Chinese outside China did that too.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,080
It began to be noticed as early as February in Boston.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Concerns for the Coronavirus will decrease trade in Boston's Chinatown.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,600
According to restaurant and bakery owners, sales have decreased by 50-70 %.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,640
This seems to dilute suspicion between groups.

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,000
And it's a reminder that people don't like invisible things.

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,840
For example.
 Radiation and virus.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,440
But we are struggling to get hold of and handle it.

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,920
It is much easier if you have a visible thing that you can beware of.

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,880
The visible thing is people.

32
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,120
There are ancient ideas about which ones are usually blamed.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,920
Conceptions about which groups are the worst.
 Jews are such a group.

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,080
For thousands of years, the Jews have been blamed for various different things.

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,840
Take the deaths during the 1300s.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,640
The dizzying victim stumbles around in their last moments.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,320
Then people died in quantities.

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,560
Those who survived had a hard time staying Sane after this trauma.

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,040
The researchers do not know exactly how many people died.

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,640
But it is talked about that up to 1/3 of Europe's population died.

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,040
In some villages 80 %.
 In such a village, I had not kept Sane either.

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,080
No.
 In this terrible situation, people did everything to survive.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,960
But survival also took strange forms.

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,800
They gave up on strangers.

45
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,000
People with another dialect or something strange.

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,240
Everything that made one a stranger made you suspect.

47
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,400
One of the largest alien groups that lived in Europe was then the Jews.

48
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,040
The Jews end up in the scapegoat again.
 Then it was like that ...

49
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,320
False claims

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,840
-That intentionally spread this infection.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
They started to persecute and torture the Jews.

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,760
If we jump to the 1980s, it was a disease that spread in the world.

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,400
The virus was HIV and the disease was AIDS.
 Many homosexuals were affected.

54
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,280
Some male homosexuals' lifestyle has initiated a rare cancer epidemic.

55
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,640
Homosexuality had just stopped being classified as mental illness.

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,360
Many lived in an idea that LGBTQ people were sick-

57
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,320
-And maybe a little more contagious and spreading.

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,920
Then the LGBTQ person became the scapegoat for HIV/AIDS-

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,720
-For it was easier to see the physical people than the virus.

60
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,400
There was an incredibly stigma against gay people at that time.

61
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,520
But the world learned how the homosexuals took on the outbreak:

62
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,120
With great courage, great dignity and a lot of activism.

63
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,320
For Källkoll Corona there is educational material at Urplay.se.

64
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,120
Search "Källkoll Corona", Choose "Pedagogical Material"-

65
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,880
-And click on the worksheet.

66
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,240
In history, there is a tendency for us to baptize diseases for places.

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,960
-In completely incorrect.
 -Right.
 Type like Spanish sickness.

68
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,000
It was the brutal flu epidemic during the First World War.

69
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,720
And this ... Spain was a neutral country during the war.

70
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,200
They did not have war censorship in the news.
 When disease cases began to dive up-

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,040
-reported Spain about it.
 So it was unfairly baptized to Spanish illness.

72
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,840
East Asians have been exposed to threats during the pandemic.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,800
Are there similar incidents with Italians?

74
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,400
Good question.
 We have tried to check it.
 It doesn't seem to be much like that.

75
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,400
When the cure of infection moved from Asia to Europe and USA-

76
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,880
-If you think it would change the image.
 But it doesn't seem to have happened.

77
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,480
Some of the cases we found have been about Westerners in India-

78
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,400
-What has been thrown out because they were alleged to carry infection.

79
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,680
Perhaps the idea of the "ethnicity" of the infection has already settled.

80
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,400
We have decided: "It is an infection that is essentially Asian."

81
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,720
Which is completely wrong, because the infection is a pandemic.
 All over the earth.

82
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,840
Diseases have no ethnicity.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,960
With fact-examination, historical knowledge and humanity-

84
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,880
-Can you counteract the ignorance.

85
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,800
-What do we do?
 -You do right.

86
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,960
