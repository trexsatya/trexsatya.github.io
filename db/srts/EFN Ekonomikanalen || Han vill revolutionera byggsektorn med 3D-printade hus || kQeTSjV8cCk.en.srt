1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09.560
Our vision is to be able to buy a plot-

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,400
-Sodate a house by a house designer, and press "Buy".

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,760
Then a self -driving printer prints the house and fixes everything.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,400
Then you can move in within 30 days.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,640
I think it was Gudrun who flew past and my roof was about to roll off.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:45,040
I lay and glued the roofing cardboards with hot air gun.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,600
I felt it was terribly hard to build.

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,000
Everything takes a long time. There must be a more effective way to do it.

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,360
In order for the Western world not to be over -exploited, we must develop a technology.

10
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,840
It is about creating a construction method that minimizes the amount of material-

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,400
-and at the same time build enough accommodation-

12
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,800
-For the large mass of the earth's population.

13
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,200
The view of this technology from the large construction companies-

14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,760
-Is that they are very interested. Many have been here and looked.

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,080
But the technology is not really mature yet.

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,040
The entire industry needs to change.

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:57,360
I think we need to help create new opportunities.

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,200
We would need help from companies to participate and drive the development.

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,840
The next goal for us as a company is to build a real villa.

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,200
We want to buy a plot, print a house, furnish it-

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,200
-And sell it to someone who wants to buy it. Make all the way.

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,320
You test the whole process.
