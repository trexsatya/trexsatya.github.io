1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,560
If you were European in the 16th century you thought the earth was lying in the middle of the universe-

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,160
-And for the most part was country - at least to 70 %.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,080
An almost dry plane, where the Atlantic was more like a pool of water.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,600
But over the next centuries, your worldview changes totally.

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,600
The exciting with early modern time-

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,760
-Is that everything people in Europe think they know is put to an end.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,080
In the early modern period, man understands for the first time-

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,560
-How she looks inside and that there are more than three continents-

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,440
-And share shocking ideas like that all people have reason.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
What do all discoveries get for consequences-

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,080
-For Europe's development and people?

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,120
Europe's early history can be divided into three eras.

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
This is the last and shortest: early modern time.

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,720
We used to be divided into the Renaissance and enlightenment.

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,280
It begins when Columbus lands on an unknown continent-

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,680
-And ends when the people of France take power and execute their king.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,680
It is a period of refraction-

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,840
â€” between the slightly mythical far back in time that we don't know so much about-

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,640
-and step into modernity.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,360
During this time, the early modern state emerges.

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,560
In the Middle Ages, Europe consisted of small kingdoms.

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:01,080
Now we get larger states, which can better control their resources.

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,680
But how much did those who lived there noticed this?

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,040
For a Western Gothic farmer- how was the difference between the 16th and 18th centuries?

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,000
The sad answer is that it might not be such a big difference.

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,040
For the farmer it may not be that-

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,480
-But the 14th-century Italian humanist-

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,000
-Iri that it is a significant difference.

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,760
They see a rebirth of antiquity arts and sciences-

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,160
-But it is also the time of discovery.

31
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,400
You are out at sea.

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,720
This is how trade and cultural exchange takes place.

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,840
You have to have a compass, and this is a rosecap pass.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,880
The magnet is drawn against the earth's magnetic north pole.

35
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,000
One who has one of those is Christofer Columbus-

36
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,480
-He whose journey is so important that it marks the start of the era.

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,880
The goal is to find a new sea route to India.

38
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,160
After a few months at sea, he reaches land on October 12, 1492.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:27,800
He thinks he came to Asia and is looking for proof of that.

40
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,840
He is trying to find spices and textiles-

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,880
-As he has seen in the trade in China and India.

42
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,720
He thinks he came to Asia.

43
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,800
But where has Columbus ended up?
 The compass has not shown error-

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,040
-What has emerged a new continent: America.

45
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,920
When Columbus dies, he still believes he reached Asia.

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,480
He never understood it was a new continent-

47
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,240
-With maybe 60-70 million inhabitants.

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,120
For them came the so -called
 The discovery to change everything.

49
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,960
Ships go in shuttish traffic-

50
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,600
-and almost all land areas in America are colonized.

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,120
The discovery of the new continent shakes everything.

52
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,600
Everything one thought you know about what the world looked like.

53
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:34,120
One begins to realize that the image like the Old Testament, the Bible and the Church Ger-

54
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,360
-Not not matching reality.

55
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,960
Can the Bible, who for almost a thousand years have had the answer to all questions, be wrong?

56
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,560
The new continent leads to a revolution in science.

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,520
People are starting to investigate, with the goal of learning more about their surroundings.

58
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,080
The scientific revolution involves both discoveries-

59
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,600
-and a new way to discover the world.

60
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,880
A way to examine the nature-

61
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,600
-To draw conclusions about what is true and how nature works.

62
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,120
Those conclusions can be spread in a new way-

63
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,120
-With Gutenberg's invention.

64
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,440
The book pressure makes it possible to mass -produce text.

65
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,560
With that, text will be much more accessible than before.

66
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,920
Previously, manuscripts were traveled.

67
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:41,520
Now you can buy your own copy and have it at home in your car.

68
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,720
In a book, Copernicus questions that the earth is the center of the universe.

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,280
It is picked up by Galileo Galilei, who for his help has one like this.

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,680
The binoculars came in the 17th century.

71
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,160
The longing it is, the greater the magnification.

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,960
Galilei's telescope directed toward space gave three times magnifying-

73
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,480
-But already next year he received 33 times magnification.

74
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,240
One night he directs it toward space, and in 33 times enlarg-

75
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
-He is something that no one has seen before.

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,280
Now he can confirm that Copernicus was right.

77
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,360
The earth is not the center of the universe.

78
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,440
Galilei is sentenced by the Catholic Court to Lifetime House Rest.

79
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,120
Society is still characterized by religion.

80
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,360
Philosophers and scientists seeking explanations-

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,280
-Want to explain God's work, not question it.

82
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,720
Religion also affects how society is organized-

83
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,720
-And there is a clear hierarchical order.

84
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,360
The standing society can be illustrated like this.

85
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,720
The head is the nobility, the heart the priests and legs the peasants.

86
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,320
The legs should not make any decisions.
 The head should do that.

87
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,240
The metaphor shows to the people that everyone has their place.

88
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,720
The early modern society is obsessed with hierarchies and rank.

89
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,160
You know your place.

90
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,200
If you are a nobleman you must have certain clothes that citizens must not have.

91
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,960
One should look directly at a nobleman that the person in question is noble.

92
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:45,240
Rich people can buy themselves free from sin and get a simple path to heaven.

93
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,680
It is also being questioned within the church.

94
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,240
Here the monk Martin Luther nails 95 points at the church in Wittenberg.

95
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,320
They change the church and Europe for all time.

96
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,040
Luther believes that someone may be right against the pope and church-

97
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,560
-If they have support from the Bible.

98
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,080
"Slowly on the slopes," the Pope says, threatening with banning.

99
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,400
Luther sets fire to the letter, and then it goes fast.

100
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,400
The dissatisfaction spreads like a wildfeld

101
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,560
-And the Roman Catholic Church split.

102
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,240
Luther's criticism of the church becomes a kind of catalyzer-

103
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,000
-for a lot of dissatisfaction lying and putting in Europe-

104
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,240
-Both politically and religiously.

105
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Kings and princes see their chance.

106
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,160
If they join Luther and carry out a Reformation-

107
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,920
-Can they free themselves from the Catholic Church and strengthen their power.

108
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,200
One who takes the chance is Gustav Vasa.

109
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,280
Reformation opens an opportunity for king-

110
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,200
-Getting greater resources.

111
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,000
The church has money the king needs.

112
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,120
If you put the church under the state, you can take care of them.

113
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,600
It becomes a Catholic and a Protestant Europe-

114
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,840
-And it that has united continent more than boundaries and language is now gone.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,560
Europe's states are fighting with each other during almost the entire 17th century.

116
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,400
War is a European specialty, but now they are stepped up.

117
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,760
They become religiously charged, longer and bloodier.

118
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,560
Europe is dominated by the Habsburg Emperor

119
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,400
-But more countries are eager to become a big player and expand their power.

120
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
It leads to thirty-year war-

121
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,360
-Which starts with a quarrel in Prague 1618 between Protestants and Catholics.

122
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,680
The Protestants throw out two Catholic governors through the window.

123
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,440
They survive - according to Catholics thanks to two protective angels.

124
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
According to the Protestants, they fell in a heap.

125
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,640
The noise makes the thirty-year war sometimes be seen as a religious war-

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,720
-But it is also about power, money and control.

127
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,240
The Habsburg Empire wants to build a strong Emperor power.

128
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,480
"Hold your horses," says German princes who want to be independent.

129
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,960
It is complicated even more by the power struggle between Spain and the Netherlands.

130
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,240
In addition, France is growing in power.

131
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,360
They consider themselves threatened by the Habsburgs and want to compete for power.

132
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,440
All this is confused.

133
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,160
At the same time, we hear in Sweden what is happening.

134
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,000
"We're going to be there too."

135
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,480
Gustav II Adolf and the army close up with the Protestant princes.

136
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:20,440
The king falls, but Sweden ends up on the winning side with France-

137
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,520
-When the Westphalian Peace closed

138
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,640
Sweden is now the big player that others must relate to.

139
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Sweden has a large army, and you do not want to happen to it.

140
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
You don't want to.

141
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,840
In the footsteps of the war we see plundered villages and trampled arable land.

142
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,160
In some areas, the number of inhabitants drops by a quarter.

143
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,240
Westphalian peace changes the balance of power.

144
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,160
The Habsburg Emperor Empire is weakened, especially in Germany.

145
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,720
Sweden builds an empire-

146
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,280
-But at the top of the podium steps France.

147
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,320
France becomes a host nation for the new philosophers of the new age.

148
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,680
Here's ideas about nature, science and not least man.

149
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,000
The 18th century is called the century of reason.

150
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,560
There is enormous optimism about human reason.

151
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,280
There is nothing she cannot do with her reason.

152
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,880
Now one thinks that everyone has a reason-

153
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,120
-To and with at the bottom of the hierarchy - the legs in the illustration.

154
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,360
With human new sense, the idea of natural law becomes strong.

155
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,080
It was a way of reasoning about fundamental rights-

156
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,440
-As you thought everyone had.

157
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,120
Not thanks to God.

158
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,360
You could realize with your reason that it must be so.

159
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,280
For example, everyone must be entitled to their lives.

160
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,600
The first encyclopedia are written, and the periodic system is invented.

161
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,800
The printing presses go hot, and people's thoughts can spread.

162
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,400
But that everyone may think is not always appreciated by the kings.

163
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,600
In many countries there will be censorship.

164
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,400
Some that are discussed are about how a country should be governed.

165
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,680
Sweden has a slightly different development.

166
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,160
Hair prevails

167
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,120
-When almost is a political experiment with a weak royal power.

168
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,920
It gives us the Freedom of Pressure Regulation, a constitution that we still have today.

169
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:05,080
When the Riksdag 1766 faces freedom of the press, you do it as a response-

170
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,800
-On the requirement that you want to be able to write and print anything.

171
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,840
Religious writings are exempt.
 They are not allowed to speak freely om-

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
-But for political criticism it is free.

173
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,600
The time of freedom ends drastically with Gustav III's coup 1772.

174
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,960
But how should a state be ruled if we can decide?

175
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,760
The enlightenment philosophers have three ways.

176
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,560
Montesquieu presents a power distribution principle-

177
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,120
-with a legislative, a judgment and an executive power.

178
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,640
For Rousseau, anyone can control, only that follows the general will.

179
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,400
Voltaire believes that the best is a single monarch-

180
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:04,200
-When with the help of illuminated advisers can modernis the country.

181
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,160
We get illuminated despots that help the technological development-

182
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,280
-But of course with their perspectives and for their own gain.

183
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,560
You only enlighten so that your power is expanded.

184
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,680
You want the subjects to think right, but not free.

185
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,120
A king and a free people easily create conflicts-

186
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,640
-and it will be the end of the era.

187
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,320
British colonies break free from the king-

188
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,800
-And in France the people take power and dismiss their king.

189
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,080
The early modern time begins to pass into modern times-

190
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,760
-When we get revolutions that think this is wrong.

191
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,880
Power should be divided into the entire population.

192
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,600
How is the rest of the world affected by the early modern time?

193
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,440
The contact between America's indigenous people and Europeans-

194
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,760
-As probably the biggest disaster in the last thousand years.

195
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,080
The discovery trips and colonization that began to era-

196
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,760
-In crucial for the future of Europe and the rest of the world.

197
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,520
From the colonies, trade is conducted that only benefits European states.

198
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,200
To motivate resources, you develop ideologies.

199
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,600
That one is better racially and religiously legitimizes extinction-

200
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,360
-Or that you slaughter the people there brutal ways.

201
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,800
The most economically important is the establishment of plantation economies-

202
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,120
-In the Caribbean, North America and South America.

203
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
They demanded slave labor.

204
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,080
Now you are picking slaves, and it has fateful consequences.

205
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,200
In the transatlantic triangle trade, boats move in a triangle.

206
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:16,600
Europe receives raw materials from America with enslaved labor from Africa.

207
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,120
That fine view of man with the right to his life-

208
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,560
-Do not effect everyone.

209
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,520
There is perhaps an idea that one belongs to a civilization-

210
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,960
-As is higher than these cultures and peoples.

211
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,000
Colonization gives us an influence on other continents that are unique.

212
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,960
We will never have the same influence on the outside world as during this time.

213
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,320
Many of the thoughts, ideas and discoveries of this time are still alive today.

214
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,640
The tracks we can see today include
 our tax system and secularisation-

215
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:10,280
-But above all, our modern states develop over an early modern time.
