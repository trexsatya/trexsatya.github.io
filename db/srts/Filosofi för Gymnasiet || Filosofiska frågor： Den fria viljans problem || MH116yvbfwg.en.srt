1
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,540
We all have an experience that we are free in our actions. We choose what we say, we choose what we do.

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,600
We can choose to act on our impulses or choose not to live them out.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,240
Despite this, many philosophers ask themselves, and have done so for a long time,

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,760
If we are really as free as we feel.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,840
Many even mean that our experience of influence over our actions is a mental

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,780
post -construction of an act that was inevitable or even predetermined.

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,260
They thus mean that you could not do anything else at this moment but to look at this.

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52.080
We will look more closely at the problem of free will.

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,720
The free will can be defined as the possibility that you could have acted differently.

10
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,520
The problem is based on the fact that we live in a determinated world,

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,480
That is, a world where nature is caused.

12
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,320
An apple does not fall to the ground because it decided to leave the branch,

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,600
but because of a complex amount of causal effect.

14
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:25,340
Some of the variables that affect when the apple falls are; the size and mass of the apple, the size and age of the tree,

15
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,780
the thickness of the branch, possible genetic defects, height above the ground, temperature, rainfall, winds,

16
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,580
Time of year, external influence in the form of animals, and so on ...

17
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,700
What finally causes an apple to fall at exactly a certain time is too complex for a human being

18
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,020
Be able to figure out - we can't possibly know all variables.

19
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:50,548
Despite this, most people agree that if we knew all the conditions

20
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,760
So we could figure out exactly when the apple would fall.

21
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,700
The fate of the apple is thus determined.

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02.840
Sometimes in these discussions the term "predetermined" is used in these discussions,

23
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,580
Often thought as synonymous with determinated.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09.560
You may say that it is therefore predetermined when the apple will fall.

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,760
However, there is a point in not using this term as the term "predetermined" suggests that someone,

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,420
Often interpreted as God, in advance has decided when things will happen.

27
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,200
This is usually not what we mean, although there are of course theories

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,220
About all events takes place according to God's predetermined plan.

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,080
Nature is thus determined, it can theoretically predict if you can all parameters.

30
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,740
This also applies, for example, to physical or economic systems.

31
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,700
If you have knowledge of a projectile's exit speed, output direction, form, the strength of the wind,

32
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Humidity, height above sea level, etc. can be determined exactly where it will land.

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,280
Why then would man differ from the basic conditions

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,500
That seems to apply to everything else in the universe?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,300
Should we and our brain not obey the same causal effect as anything else,

36
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09.660
After all, we are made up of the same matter?

37
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,240
Each time you make a decision on something,

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,960
So you make this decision based on past experiences and the current conditions.

39
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,320
Imagine now a hypothetical creature (in philosophy often called Laplace's demon) that has knowledge

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,880
About each particle and every event in the universe and has the ability to analyze all this.

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Should not then this creature, with one hundred percent insight into how your brain looks and works,

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,060
Able to figure out what decision you will make the next moment?

43
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,200
The problem with free will is illustrated when making the comparison between a human brain and a computer.

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55.840
One accepts the claim that a human is basically to be regarded as an advanced biological

45
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,120
Machine (that is, there is no "magic ingredient", such as a soul) you can ask the question

46
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07.600
If a computer will ever be able to make completely free and independent decisions?

47
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,520
Many people spontaneously answer no to that question with reference to a computer always

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,240
follows the rules we have set up for its thinking, and that a computer despite its

49
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,840
Huge capacity is always and remains a glorified calculator.

50
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,420
The computer can give us seemingly intelligent and independent answers but behind this lies a

51
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,140
strictly the following by routines created by a program or programmer.

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,160
It could never have given us another answer under the exact same circumstances.

53
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,100
Certainly there are great differences between a human being and a computer,

54
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,580
This includes that we are made of meat and blood while the computer is a machine.

55
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,360
But is it really a relevant difference?

56
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:54,180
Isn't it the function of the brain, what it achieves or leads to that is the interesting?

57
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,580
There is currently not much to indicate that we in the future

58
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,240
could not have the same functionality based on other material.

59
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09.680
For example, no one would claim that mathematics was not as true just because the answer came from a computer,

60
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,580
a calculator or a culmin and not from a human brain.

61
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:22,400
The fact that a computer is designed by people is also not a counter -argument. Say the person who is not.

62
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,240
The fact that the computer's "thinking" is based on routines and algorithms is of course true,

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,180
But it does not necessarily disqualify the computer.

64
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,760
Computers can already learn things on their own today and go beyond what was initially taught them.

65
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,440
In addition, the human brain is full of corresponding "routines and algorithms",

66
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,000
structured as a neural network in our brain. That is why we can learn things and think.

67
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,800
An example of a "thinking" computer capable of making your own decisions is IBMS Watson,

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,460
an artificial intelligence that interprets natural language.

69
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:06,580
In 2011, Watson won the American version of Jeopardy! against the human finalists.

70
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,900
Watson is not a regular computer but consists of 90 interconnected servers.

71
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,640
No one claims that Watson has any free will, but the performance illustrates the technological development well.

72
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,340
So do you mean that a computer will never be able to enjoy genuine free will

73
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,660
So you have a challenge in explaining how man can do it.

74
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,520
In a survey from the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig and Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience

75
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,900
In Berlin from 2008, 14 healthy subjects were examined with the help of a brain scanner.

76
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,680
Random letters were shown on a screen, a new letter every half -second.

77
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,880
The people had to press a button whenever they felt it during the trial.

78
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,160
The subjects were then allowed to indicate which letter had been shown at that moment

79
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,200
as they decided to press the button.
