1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07.519
I value professionalism.

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,800
Performing the work correctly is incredibly important to me.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,359
I feel that we who work at the Social Insurance Office have received a

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,919
great confidence in society by managing and taking

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,239
Take care of social insurance.

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,600
to be part of it trigger me in a very positive way and do

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,679
me proud to go to work.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
As an authority, we of course have clear frameworks that we must adhere to.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,600
We need to be accurate and at the same time flexible and quickly be able to change as needed,

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,000
both to meet different people who are often in a difficult situation and

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,799
In order for new provisions and legislative changes that the Riksdag has decided on.

12
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,320
Before I started at the Social Insurance Office I thought it would be more of a

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,640
Stubborn organization where you as an employee could not affect so much,

14
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,159
But we have a lot of cooperation between the teams and an incredibly good

15
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01.320
And close cooperation in your own team.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,920
We share responsibility for everything to be done and you are never alone.
