00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,080
The Taoist monk Zhuang Zi was always happy, positive and energetic.

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,180
But one day his disciples found him sitting in his room, crying with confusion.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,180
They asked him what had happened, after which he told me he was dreaming he was a butterfly.

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,540
He had known the wind, the smells and how he flew around - just as if he had been there.

5
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,700
The disciples looked surprised, wondering what was the problem?

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,700
The monk replied, “Now I don't know if I'm a monk who dreams I'm a butterfly,

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,340
Or a butterfly that dreams that I am a monk. "

8
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,100
Even in ancient Greece, philosophers were wondering if the world was perhaps only an illusion,

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59.960
And Plato claimed that everything we perceived was only shadow pictures of reality.

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,160
Enlightenment philosopher René Descartes questioned whether it is possible to trust our senses,

11
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,960
And Arthur Schopenhauer concluded that we do not really exist as human beings.

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,040
Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom claims in a modern theory on the same theme that the world we live in is only one

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,700
Computer simulation, and thus nothing is for real.

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,340
We will take a closer look at the so -called simulation argument.

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,280
Theory is based on statistical probability, and is based on the assumption

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36.560
that computer technology will continue to develop.

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:43,260
Bostrom believes that technological developments within, for example, artificial intelligence in the future can lead to

18
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,200
Computer simulations that are so real that the simulations themselves think they are real.

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,280
We are far from the technical possibilities today,

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,000
But who knows what we have the opportunity for 1,000, 100,000 or millions of years.

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,140
Bostrom sees three future scenario:

22
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06.800
The first means that the human species die out before we have developed the possibility of simulating

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,220
human consciousness. Everything is peace and joy, and no simulation will happen.

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,640
The second alternative means that technology can develop, but that, for example, it moral

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,700
or legal reasons will never be tested.

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,040
This scenario sees Bostrom himself as the least likely when a technology like this would be interesting for

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,740
humanity. But that is, after all, an opportunity.

28
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,060
The third alternative means that the technology will be developed and actually used as well.

29
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,240
The number of simulated worlds will probably be large, you would not have been attracted by running one

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,800
Simulation on your computer and see how the "people" develop and ponder the mysteries of life?

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,360
Which of the above options do you see as most likely?

32
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00.160
If you have answered option three, you have also just "proven" that we are all in such a simulation.

33
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06.820
For what would the probability be that we belong to the real world, when there may be thousands,

34
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09.800
Not to say millions of simulated worlds?

35
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,140
Statistically, it is almost non -existent, which is why we are a simulation.

36
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,880
Perhaps every simulation in turn can develop so far that it creates its own simulations, and that it thus

37
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,240
may be several levels of reality.

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,540
Maybe this is the meaning of life,

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,960
Maybe they are met by us who have lived "right" by a "welcome to level 2" after we died.

40
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,420
Maybe God is just a teenager in front of his computer.

41
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:42.060
In fact, some researchers believe that we are no further than a few decades from being able to simulate conscious life.

42
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,800
But to simulate a whole world would of course require huge capacity,

43
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,600
But maybe not as much as we first expect.

44
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,180
Instead of simulating the world in detail, you only need to simulate what can actually be perceived.

45
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,520
Other galaxies and planets need not be simulated in greater detail than light flashes are perceived from the earth,

46
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07.920
And the microscopic world only needs to be simulated in detail when someone actually looks at it.
