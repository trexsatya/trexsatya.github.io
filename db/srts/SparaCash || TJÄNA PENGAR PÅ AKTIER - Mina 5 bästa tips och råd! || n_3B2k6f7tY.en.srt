1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,024
You looked right!

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:09,091
I have already earned over SEK 40,000 on shares this year

3
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:13,296
It is not that difficult to make money on stocks.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,314
I tried to tell this in my previous videos

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,688
But I think that in this video

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,224
so we should simplify

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,624
We go through the only two ways you can make money on stocks. I will also show you mine

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,416
stock trades that I made money on

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
So you can see

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
Exactly how it works

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
When making money on stocks

12
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,424
A small bonus is that in the end I will give you my best tips for when to buy shares.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
So that you can make as much money as possible.

14
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
If you did not know, my name is Marcus Lindblad

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,944
I run SparaCash.se

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:57,600
SparaCash is for you who are a beginner who wants to learn how to save in shares, funds and much more!

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,904
I want to make it simple and easy for you who are a beginner.

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
Pick up a good cup of coffee because now we start the video. And thank you so much to you who have invited me for a coffee.

19
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
Briefly explained, there is

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,800
Two ways you can make money on stocks.

21
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,360
The first way is when buying stocks

22
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,776
How to buy the shares for a certain price

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
Over time, the price of your shares can go up

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
And then you sell them for a more expensive price

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
and then you have made money on your shares.

26
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
The second way

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
Which you can make money on stocks through

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
It is that you buy

29
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
Shares that pay a dividend

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
This means that companies share their profits as they do

31
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
Thus, you earn

32
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Money through it

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
And then you get this money

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
directly to your account in which you own the shares

35
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
and then you have made money.

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:56,480
Coffee break!

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
Nice

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,576
So we start with way number 1. And that is that you make money

39
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
when the price of

40
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
The shares are going up

41
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
And in my first video

42
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
called 'Aktier för nybörjare' (stocks for beginners)

43
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
I showed you how to buy shares

44
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
And I bought some shares in the company called Plejd

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,261
"And now the purchase of the shares went through and I now have 1 share in Plejd"

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
And then it was like that

47
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,872
That I June 8, 2020

48
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
Bought shares for

49
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
Just over DKK 5,000 in Plejd.

50
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,576
What I did then was that I bought into Plejd with a small security post as I call it.

51
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
What it simply means to me

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,646
I force myself to read more about the company

53
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,452
Then I will not lose a profit if the share goes up very much.

54
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,288
But I also do not go in too heavy if it is the case that I have missed some detail on the road

55
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
which means that the share may fall very much. It might not hurt as much!

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,016
But if we wind up the band a little, then I bought a little more shares

57
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,880
Closer to SEK 15,000

58
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,384
In total, I then invested SEK 20,000 in Plejd

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
As time went on

60
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,376
so it went better for the company Plejd and thus I decided

61
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
To buy a little more shares in Plejd.

62
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
Then I bought for SEK 10,000 more

63
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,824
So invested a total of DKK 30,000 in Plejd.

64
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,896
If you look at the value today of my shares

65
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
As I have invested in care

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
So today they are worth SEK 95,000

67
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
Which means an increase of just over

68
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
65000 kr

69
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
On my SEK 30,000 that I have invested in Plejd.

70
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,792
In percentage terms, this means an increase of 216%

71
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
right now

72
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
So if I were to sell my shares

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
Then I would have made a profit

74
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
At SEK 65,000 today

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,616
And this is not something that is normal for a stock to increase so much in one year

76
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
I was simply lucky

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
And I should thank myself for that ...

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
You need to know

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,648
If the company is doing poorly in the future or they may go bankrupt

80
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Then come mine

81
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,000
Shares may theoretically be worth 0

82
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
And then I did not make any money

83
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
You have not made money until

84
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Sold or taken home his profit

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
And for you who are a beginner who may not really

86
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,751
Understand why the price of these shares

87
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
In Plejd has gone up so much

88
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
Then I'll try to explain it now

89
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,735
The simple explanation for why the price of the shares in Plejd has gone up so much

90
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
It's simply that company

91
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Has shown

92
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,159
That they can make more money than they have done before

93
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
And what happens

94
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
That to other individuals like you and me or

95
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
Banks and other companies

96
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
They believe that Plejd's shares are

97
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,959
Attractive and they also want to invest in this company

98
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,799
If it is the case that they continue to do just as well in the future

99
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
And what you do then is that

100
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
to raise the price

101
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
As one is willing to pay

102
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
For ordinary shares

103
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
And what happens is that the price of the shares goes up

104
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,367
Which makes my investment worth more than it was before

105
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
Put number 2 that you can make money on stocks

106
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,119
I made a video about dividend stocks

107
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,519
As you can see here and in that video, I go through some basics about why a company pays dividends

108
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
How to make money on it

109
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
But simply put, it's about

110
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,298
Companies - usually slightly larger companies

111
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
share a piece of the profit that they make

112
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
They thank us shareholders for what we want

113
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
Be part of the company

114
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
But also then to

115
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,719
Those who own a piece of the company like you and me

116
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
Or those who have founded the company should get

117
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
A small part of the profit simply

118
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Eat a small piece of the cake

119
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Not all companies share the profits

120
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Plaid that I talked about earlier

121
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
They do not share their profits

122
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Because they think

123
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
The money they earn

124
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Will stay in the company

125
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
And should not be distributed to

126
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
Because they consider the company

127
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,695
Will use this money in a better way

128
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,047
But larger companies such as banks and real estate companies

129
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Who gets a stable

130
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
Cash flow as it is called

131
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,959
they make a lot of money every month or every year and so on

132
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
They are generous and want to share with us

133
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
Like Thank you for investing in their business

134
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
But what I like about dividend stocks

135
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
You get a little

136
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
Money that thus pure cash into the account

137
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,855
And the money they drop into the same account that you own your shares on

138
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
So you have few shares in a dividend share

139
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
on, for example, an Investment Savings Account

140
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,327
Then the money will fall into the same account that you own the shares in

141
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
And then it's free for you

142
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
Take out this money and do whatever you want with it

143
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Or buy

144
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
More shares

145
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,775
So you get a higher dividend next time

146
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Or whatever you want

147
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Buy a Snickers or whatever

148
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
For example, Castellum

149
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,503
Last year I received SEK 3,600 in dividends from Castellum

150
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
And now I have bought a little more shares

151
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Castellum

152
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
Partly for this dividend money

153
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,255
But even so, Castellum has raised the dividend this year

154
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,095
Which means I'm getting a higher dividend so this year I'll get it

155
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
4000 kr

156
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
in share dividend from Castellum

157
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:40,287
But do you then have to choose either or?

158
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,919
No you do not have to! It is just as well to have both a dividend share and a growth share.

159
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,479
If you think the price will go up on the shares instead.

160
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
I have both.

161
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
That it goes well for you too.

162
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,231
And you think I'll give you my best tips for making money on stocks.

163
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,303
These tips You should think about before buying shares.

164
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
So you make the right choice.

165
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,911
Tip number one to 1 for you who are a beginner

166
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Who may not have bought shares yet.

167
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,055
Only invest money that you can afford to be without.

168
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,383
The stock market fluctuates a lot, it goes up a lot and it goes down a lot.

169
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,503
Money that you invest, you should be able to afford to be without for at least 3-5 years.

170
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Let's say you have

171
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,671
Just started working on something and then you have set aside some money

172
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
let your salary say SEK 1,000

173
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
Do not invest all that money

174
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,143
Maybe starts with SEK 100 or SEK 200 that you can afford to be without

175
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,495
And test a little with them just to feel and learn a little how it works

176
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
This way you avoid

177
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,103
To go in too heavy and burn yourself

178
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,687
And then maybe you lose a lot of money and you think it's hard

179
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,247
And then you simply will not continue to invest ...

180
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
Start with a small amount

181
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
And do not sell without Let it lie!

182
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
Then you will learn how it swings up and down

183
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
Tip number two

184
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
Only buy shares in companies that you understand

185
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,863
Think of it as lending money

186
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,191
if you had lent money to a friend

187
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Which you trust

188
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,567
Yes but then Can you trust this buddy will pay back the money to you

189
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,943
But if you would instead lend money to a stranger on the street that you have never met before

190
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
How sure are you that you will get your money back?

191
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
It's a bit like investing in shares

192
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,951
Invest in companies that you know how to make money

193
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,047
So that you can get a little more feel, Yes so you can understand a little

194
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
This company will use yours

195
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Money the right way

196
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,519
Very many beginners buy companies or buy shares in companies like

197
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
they have no idea how they make money and if they even make any money!

198
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
Some companies make a loss

199
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
And people are just wondering

200
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
the stock should go up or down

201
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
But do you know what the company does and how they make money

202
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
So you will make much better investments

203
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
Number 3 be patient

204
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
To be patient

205
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
This is how you will earn

206
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
Terrible much more

207
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Money on the stock market

208
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
I remember when I was a beginner

209
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,519
so I keep buying and selling and keep going back and forth like that and followed the stock market every minute

210
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
From 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

211
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Do not do it

212
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
Invest, log out

213
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
Do something else that is fun like

214
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
Rather want to redo the days

215
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
Do not sit and check every day all the time.

216
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,927
so much you will not learn from a stock market day.

217
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:42,559
Have patience. The less you do and shop and buy and sell

218
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
So you will make a lot more money

219
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
This is usually when you go in and try to make quick money on stocks

220
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
In short term

221
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
as one usually loses money.

222
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
Have patience

223
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Log out a little

224
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
So you will earn much more

225
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Tip No. 4

226
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,262
Buy shares in an ISK account.

227
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
From the beginning

228
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,063
When you start investing

229
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,629
So you get to choose which account 
you want to invest in

230
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
And then there is the investment savings account

231
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Endowment insurance, equity fund account

232
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,095
By having your shares and funds for that matter in an investment savings account

233
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
then you get a low tax

234
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
And you do not have to keep declaring your business

235
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:28,127
You get tax-free dividends and you can just enjoy life and chill and have a good time

236
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
And the last tip

237
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
Buy a company

238
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Who makes a profit!

239
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
If you are a beginner

240
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,623
Do not go on buying lots of companies that you have no idea what they are doing

241
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
And then they go with a loss

242
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
For What do companies that make a loss do?

243
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,084
Well they are doing something wrong!

244
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,399
Because it is not sustainable to run companies that do not make money

245
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
Or who does not make a profit in any case

246
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
Then you need to be very confident in your investment

247
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
Start by buying for-profit companies

248
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
You can only check the P / E ratio

249
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,503
If the P / E ratio is above zero, that is positive - then the company is making a profit.

250
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
If they are at a negative P / E ratio, they are at a loss.

251
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
Avoid them in the first place.

252
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
until you have learned a little more

253
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Then you can consider buying other companies.

254
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,631
The most important lesson when you want to start investing in stocks.

255
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,000
It's just getting started!

256
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
Dare to invest Do not be afraid to invest.

257
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
Start with as little as just SEK 100

258
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,431
Buy a Swedish company that you are aware of that is listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange

259
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,063
At Avanza you can do it completely without brokerage and also at Nordnet.

260
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,415

I started just over 6 years ago.

263
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,631
And yes I could never believe I can live on this right now.

264
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655

265
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
