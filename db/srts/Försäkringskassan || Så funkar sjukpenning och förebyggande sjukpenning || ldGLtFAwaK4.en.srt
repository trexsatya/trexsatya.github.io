1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:04,533
Sickness benefit and sickness benefit for preventive purposes.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08.033
In this film we will focus on the regulations around

3
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:13,600
sickness benefit and how the Social Insurance Office works with those who are on sick leave.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,233
We also take up the compensation preventive sickness benefit.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,633
It is sickness benefit

6
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:23,633
Compensation for illness that most people come into contact with.

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:27,033
Of those who live and work in Sweden.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,166
The Mission of the Swedish Social Insurance Agency is partly to investigate and decide

9
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:36,500
about the right to compensation. But also to clarify the need for rehabilitation.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,966
Work to make the efforts needed for effective rehabilitation

11
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,866
taken as soon as possible as well as

12
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,300
to coordinate rehabilitation efforts.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,466
This is what is the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's coordination assignment.

14
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:55,533
Both of these parts are regulated in the Social Security Code

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,133
which is the legislation that governs the sickness benefit.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,733
The Social Insurance Office does not carry out its own rehabilitation efforts.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09.633
However, we thus have an important coordinating role in the sick leave process.

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,766
Rehabilitation includes it

19
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:16,533
which takes place in health care, but also the one as the employer,

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,700
The social services or other actors are responsible for.

21
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:25,366
The Swedish Social Insurance Agency therefore needs to cooperate with all actors

22
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:28,500
In order for the sick person to receive adequate support

23
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,566
In order to return to work it is crucial that all actors in

24
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:35,933
The sick leave process actively contributes outside

25
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:41,266
their respective responsibilities.

26
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,200
What happens if man

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,866
cannot work due to illness.

28
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:49,266
When you are sick and cannot work because of the disease

29
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:54.666
as an employee, you should make a sickness report directly to your employer.

30
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,100
The employer is responsible for sick pay

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,700
the first 14 days of the sick period.

32
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:05.433
Anyone who is not employed but instead is self -employed,

33
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:11,066
unemployed or parental sick leave to report directly to the Social Insurance Office

34
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:15,100
and then apply for sickness benefit.

35
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:19,400
At the beginning of the sick period, a waiting deduction is made.

36
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:23,866
For employees it is deducted from sick pay by the employer and for others from the sickness benefit

37
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,900
by the Social Insurance Office.

38
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:29,200
From day eight of the sick period

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,500
Needs those who are ill and cannot work show a medical certificate.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,433
This applies to both employees and others.

41
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,366
If the employee is still ill and cannot work

42
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:45,566
Due to the disease after the sick pay period in 14 days, reports sickness

43
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:49,600
The employer his employees to the Social Insurance Office.

44
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,900
The employee must then apply for sickness benefit himself.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Thus, both a notification is required,

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
an application and as a rule a medical certificate

47
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:04.333
In order for the Swedish Social Insurance Agency to be able to start the proceedings.

48
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:08.966
Most people who apply for sickness benefit do it digitally via fk.se.

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,333
When the Social Insurance Agency investigates the right to sickness benefit

50
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,500
and the need for support for return to work

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,266
If we first do a review of all the information contained in the case.

52
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,600
In addition to the application and medical certificate

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,600
May there be other important information we need to access.

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,366
Then we make an assessment

55
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:37,200
of if we have enough evidence to make decisions.

56
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:42,600
If any task is missing or needs to be clarified, the documentation is supplemented.

57
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,400
Usually through a contact with the person himself,

58
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,633
the employer or health care.

59
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,533
In conversation with the individual we pray among other things

60
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:55,633
about a more detailed description of what the work consists of.

61
00:03:55,733 --> 00:04:00.633
What is the person having difficulty doing and in what situations?

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02.933
What requirements do the tasks place

63
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:07,500
On physical, mental and mental ability?

64
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:11,533
The Social Insurance Office also asks for the person's own perception of

65
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:14,533
the ability to get back to work and what

66
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:17,533
which would be required in that case.

67
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:21,533
Maybe it has already been made adjustments to work or would it

68
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:27,133
Maybe it is possible to make adjustments to facilitate the return to work?

69
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:33,366
If the person is on sick leave part -time, the placement of working hours is also investigated.

70
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:37,200
We often also need to talk to the employer.

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,633
It is the employer who has a working environment and rehabilitation responsibility.

72
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:46,166
And know what is possible to do in the workplace.

73
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:49.066
Issues that often become relevant are, among other things;

74
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:52,300
Are there opportunities for work adaptation or other

75
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,466
appropriate tasks, either temporary or more permanent?

76
00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:00.800
For example, work adaptation may be about changes in

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
tasks or working hours.

78
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,400
And if the person is on sick leave part -time it can also be

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,566
Current to ask about the organization of working hours.

80
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,600
The medical certificate is one of the most important surfaces

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,666
In the investigation and the main source of medical information

82
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:24,266
When the Social Insurance Office is to assess whether illness reduces work ability.

83
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,300
The Social Insurance Agency may therefore also

84
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,300
need to have contact with health care.

85
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,666
It may be partly clarified by

86
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,466
medical information linked to the right to compensation

87
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:39,800
Among other things, the rehabilitation chain's different assessment bases

88
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42.066
the need for information.

89
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:45,200
But it can also be about the medical conditions that

90
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,366
Available for return to work.

91
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,733
For it to be right

92
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:53,633
For sickness benefit, there are a number of conditions that need to be met.

93
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:59.966
Both general and specific, and these are stated in the Social Security Code.

94
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:04.966
Most people who live and work in Sweden are covered by social insurance.

95
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:09.100
When applying for sickness benefit, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency needs first secure

96
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,766
that the person is insured in Sweden.

97
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:16,933
The work -based benefits, where the sickness benefit is counted

98
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:21,166
is based on the income loss principle.

99
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,066
It means that the income I go

100
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:27,466
Misten when I'm sick is the one I get compensation for.

101
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,733
Therefore, the Social Insurance Agency must always

102
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:32,733
investigate the sickness benefit -based income, SGI

103
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:38.033
Then it is the one on which the sickness benefit is based.

104
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,300
If any of these two basic conditions are not met

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,000
No sickness benefit is paid out no matter how sick and limited you are.

106
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:50,266
In order to be entitled to sickness benefit, the work capacity should also be

107
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:54,100
reduced by at least one quarter due to illness.

108
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,900
Here you start from the individual's regular working hours.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,233
Sickness benefit is thus not

110
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:04.333
connected to a standard working time of 40 hours per week.

111
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07.666
For example, if someone works 8 hours a day

112
00:07:07,766 --> 00:07:12,633
the disease must limit work ability by at least 2 hours per day.

113
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,166
If the normal working hours are instead 4 hours, then the disease needs

114
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:22,133
Limit work ability at least one hour per day.

115
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,500
When assessing the right to sickness benefit, the Social Insurance Office receives

116
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,666
just take into account the disease and consequences of it.

117
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:34,533
According to the legislation, factors such as situation in the labor market, receive

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,533
social conditions or economic situation does not affect the decision.

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,333
If any of these factors have led to the disease it is thus only

120
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:49.833
The consequences of the disease valued, not the cause of it.

121
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:56,166
The information in the medical certificate is an important part of the decision basis at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.

122
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59.866
The certificate should describe what disease the person has and on

123
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:06.433
which way it is limiting and how the doctor has arrived at it.

124
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07.366
For employees with

125
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:11,666
sick pay and self -employed we make the assessment based on the

126
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:17,466
The so -called rehabilitation chain, which is part of the Social Security Code.

127
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:22,433
Here are fixed time frames for assessing work ability.

128
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,600
The longer the sick leave is in progress

129
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,400
The more the assessment is widened.

130
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,800
The purpose of the rehabilitation chain is to take advantage of it

131
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,966
Work ability The individual has and, if necessary, promotes transition.

132
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:40,233
This assumes that the Swedish Social Insurance Agency together with other actors

133
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:46,033
And as soon as possible, the individual works actively for return to work.

134
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,566
In the first 90 days, work capacity should be assessed in relation to

135
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:56,100
regular work or other temporary work that the employer can offer.

136
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,833
Even for the needy employees where it can be assumed that

137
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:02,100
the individual would have worked in the first 90 days

138
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:06.833
the assessment must be made in relation to the regular work.

139
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:10,133
After 90 days the work capacity should also be assessed

140
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,700
in relation to work that the employer can offer

141
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,100
In the event of a relocation, both temporary and permanent.

142
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,900
In the case of own entrepreneurs, they are judged

143
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,266
in relation to the regular work up to and including day 180

144
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30.066
and needs employees are assessed from day 91

145
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:34,066
as unemployed if they have not booked work passes.

146
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:38,533
After 180 days the assessment is expanded further

147
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42.066
Here the Social Insurance Office will disregard what work the individual

148
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:45,533
have and instead evaluate the restrictions in relationship

149
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:49,666
to a normal occurring work in the labor market.

150
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:50,933
It means a work

151
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:55.066
which is not adapted or specially prepared for the individual.

152
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:57,366
The Social Insurance Office shall also indicate within

153
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:01.866
Which occupational group the individual can have a possible ability to work.

154
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:06.666
At day 180, the legislation has gradually been extended with several exceptions

155
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,366
from being assessed against normal work.

156
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12.933
The basic idea with the exceptions is that the individual

157
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:16,233
should have more time in the health insurance for action

158
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:20,466
which aims to be able to come back to his regular employer.

159
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:23,400
Age can also be an exception.

160
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,766
The exceptions need to be investigated before the Social Insurance Office can

161
00:10:26,766 --> 00:10:29,000
Make a decision on sickness benefit.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,466
The Swedish Social Insurance Agency may need to supplement the decision basis with clarifications

163
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,533
or further information.

164
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,300
Even the one who does not work when

165
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,366
The need for sick leave arises can be granted sickness benefit.

166
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:46,933
Anyone who is unemployed is judged directly in relation to normal

167
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,933
existing work in the labor market.

168
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:54,166
Parental leave is assessed in relation to the ability to take care of the child.

169
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:58,533
Here, the Social Insurance Office investigates, among other things, who in that case takes care of the child

170
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:03,666
When the parent is ill and has a reduced ability to do so.

171
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:06,200
For those who study it is the study ability

172
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,500
that should be impaired due to illness.

173
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,833
If the Social Insurance Agency assesses that study

174
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:16,866
the ability is impaired approved the sick period and information is sent to CSN

175
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:21,100
so that the person is allowed to retain their study support.

176
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,233
Usually, this means that the study ability must be fully impaired.

177
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,233
Anyone studying needs a medical certificate from day 15.

178
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,366
In the cases that the sick person has

179
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:37,100
Various employment at the same time, the assessment is divided.

180
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,933
For example, the person who is is assessed

181
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:43,200
partly unemployed in relation to normal work.

182
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,700
For that part they are unemployed and in relation to the rehabilitation chain

183
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,600
for their employees.

184
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,166
Depending on the employment and situation of the sick leave, there may be one

185
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,733
several different actors who need to be involved in the person's

186
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:03.033
Rehabilitation and return to work.

187
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05.733
All actors have different roles and responsibilities

188
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:08,733
in the sick and the rehabilitation process.

189
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,500
Anyone who is on sick leave has a responsibility to provide the information

190
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,900
as needed to clarify the need for rehabilitation

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,400
And to actively participate in rehabilitation to the best of their ability.

192
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,100
The employer is responsible

193
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,766
for the work -oriented rehabilitation.

194
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:31,800
If it can be assumed that sick leave will last for at least 60 days

195
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,133
shall the employer together with the employee draw up a plan

196
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:41,166
for return to work during the first 30 days of sick leave.

197
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:45,600
The plan must be continuously followed up and revised if necessary.

198
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,533
In the employer's work environment responsibility

199
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:52.433
also include reviewing which work adjustments you can do

200
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,666
And if necessary, conduct work -oriented rehabilitation.

201
00:12:57,766 --> 00:13:00,500
As assistance and support there may be occupational health care

202
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,266
But also union representatives.

203
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,900
The doctor's task is to make a medical assessment,

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,700
make diagnosis and assess the need for care and treatment,

205
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,800
But also to decide on sick leave.

206
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:18,466
If the doctor concluded that the disease and its consequences

207
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:23,733
If the work ability puts down it should be described in the medical certificate.

208
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,100
The Employment Service is responsible for support to

209
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,366
The one as unemployed, but also support for transition.

210
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,700
If a person who employed cannot go back to work with his employer.

211
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:40,833
This includes being responsible for the individual's work -oriented rehabilitation.

212
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,866
The municipality is responsible for social efforts

213
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,066
and support to plan for self -sufficiency.

214
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:51,333
The Swedish Social Insurance Agency is responsible for investigating and assessing the work capacity

215
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:57,233
reduction due to illness in accordance with the provisions of the Social Security Code.

216
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,166
The Social Insurance Office should also coordinate others

217
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01.833
actors' efforts.

218
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07.833
Doctors may assess that there is a need for medical efforts

219
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:11,066
or rehabilitation, but that the disease does not put

220
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:14,533
Down work ability so that sick leave is needed.

221
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,466
Then a preventive sickness benefit may be relevant.

222
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,866
For example, it may trade

223
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:24,100
that there is a risk that illness will affect work ability.

224
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,633
It may also be the case that the work capacity is no longer impaired

225
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:32,200
Due to illness, but that the need for rehabilitation remains.

226
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:36,800
In order for preventive sickness benefit to be granted, one must just as for

227
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Sickness benefit is both insured in Sweden and have a sickness benefit -based income, SGI.

228
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:46,800
The purpose of compensation is to prevent,

229
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,766
shorten or cancel a reduction in work capacity.

230
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,466
This means that it can be granted if the person, for example, has

231
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:59,600
or risks developing a disease that can lead to reduced work capacity.

232
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02.666
The medical treatment or rehabilitation

233
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:06,366
shall be prescribed by a doctor and even included in a

234
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:11,866
The Försäkringskassan approved plan for the person to be granted the compensation.

235
00:15:11,966 --> 00:15:14,800
In order for preventive sickness benefit to be up -to -date

236
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,533
Do you need to be gone due to treatment or rehabilitation

237
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:23,000
At least a quarter of the working hours on the day the treatment is performed.

238
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,433
This applies whether you work or are job seekers.

239
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,800
In addition to the treatment time itself also includes travel time

240
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,966
to and from the treatment if it needs to be done during working hours.

241
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:38,966
If treatment and or travel time occurs outside working hours

242
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:41,466
That time is not included.

243
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:44,433
One cannot receive preventive sickness benefit for single

244
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:48,266
Treatment sessions but only when recurring.

245
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:51,833
In case of preventive sickness benefit, no waiting deduction is made

246
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:55,900
And the employer pays no sick pay for the time granted.

247
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,133
It is not possible to make one

248
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:02,100
Full list of treatments that will give the right to compensation

249
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07.066
Because it can vary and an individual assessment is made in each case.

250
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,966
But some examples of efforts that led to granting are

251
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:15,933
psychology conversation, pain treatment, physiotherapy,

252
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
