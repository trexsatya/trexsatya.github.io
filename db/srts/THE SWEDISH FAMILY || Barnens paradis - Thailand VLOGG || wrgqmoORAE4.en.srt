1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,180
We are in Khao Lak in Thailand.

3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,680
Today you will follow us around us for a whole day.

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,300
- The time is 8.30 in the morning.
- Yes!

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,000
In our previous vlog we were at a different hotel.

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,380
We had a great time there,
but this hotel is a paradise for children!

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,100
Yes, it really is.

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,820
Time for breakfast!

9
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,100
Not that much. A yoghurt, chocolate milk,
scrambled eggs and bacon.

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,620
What do you like most about hotel breakfast?

11
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,080
Yoghurt!

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,220
Oh God, what happened there?

13
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,160
"Yoghurt!" ...okay.

14
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,500
Harry has always loved yoghurt.

15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,420
- What is this pool called?
- The Pirate Pool.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,380
- Why is that?
- Because there are pirates.

17
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,960
Should we take a photo for Instagram?

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,240
Sure! It's so much fun because
something is always going on at this pool.

19
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,740
Whether it's Bamse, Captain T,
or someone else who comes to see the kids.

20
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,320
Harry, stand next to him.

21
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,260
There you go.

22
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,980
- Did you get a good picture?
- Yes!

23
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,920
- Alma and Harry are playing in the pool with friends.
- Yes.

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,460
- They have so many friends here.
- They find new friends all the time!

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:10,340
Yes. The Kids Club is closed today, but otherwise
in the mornings from 10 to 12 o'clock, Axel...

26
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,740
...Axel is at the Bamse Club!

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,460
I go to Bamse Club, and the kids have some alone time.

28
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,060
Harry goes to the Bamse Club downstairs.

29
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,820
- Can you see?
- Yes.

30
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,740
And up there is something called 611, witch is...

31
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,700
"Witch is"...

32
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,980
Sometimes it just gets wrong.

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,380
The 611 club, for children between the ages 6 and 11,
which is the one Alma goes to.

34
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,560
They both have so much fun there every day!

35
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,500
- And we get some time... 
- ...for ourselves.

36
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,460
- Yes.
- Yeah.

37
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,300
They meet friends and play.
They are being taken care of by great TUI hosts.

38
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,240
You can choose whether you want your kids
to be there in the morning or afternoon.

39
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,040
Yes. There are two hours in the morning,
and two hours in the afternoon.

40
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,940
You can choose both, but then we
wouldn't even see our children, so that's not for us.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,220
No, exactly.

42
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,160
Now we are going on the big blue water slide!

43
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,380
- Alma, what is this?
- It is a stone collection.

44
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,960
We got down and picked them up from the bottom.

45
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,280
Here is the big pile.

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,420
Here are the white ones,
the orange ones, and the black ones.

47
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,480
This is what's on the bottom.

48
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,660
I love that there's sand on the bottom.
It's so good for my feet.

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
Guys, should we go and have lunch?

50
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,940
We went to a pool which is right by the beach,
and there is a great lunch restaurant here.

51
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,120
Alma and Harry immediately found their friends
in the pool, so they just took off.

52
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,700
Hey!

53
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,600
- It's nice to have some food after all that bathing, right?
- Mhm!

54
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,860
- What are you having?
- Egg fried rice.

55
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,480
I will go diving in the ketchup!

56
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,720
Now we will show you our amazing house!

57
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,120
Welcome!

58
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,900
Here is our very own pool!

59
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,380
Woho!

60
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,620
Alma has invited friends over several times
and we have had pool parties.

61
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,920
We played some music, had fruit and water. So nice!

62
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
The place has just been cleaned. So nice!

63
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,800
Welcome, to the little office.

64
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
Wow!

65
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,620
They have really made an effort!

66
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,840
- Mommy?
- Yes?

67
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,840
That is your beating heart,
and there is dad's beating heart.

68
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,200
- And there is everyone's beating hearts!
- Is this everyone's hearts?

69
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,060
Yes. Everyone's beating hearts.

70
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,120
This is made out of towels, if you can't tell.

71
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,060
- And that is made out of stones?
- No, these are little petals.

72
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Flower petals!

73
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,500
What...

74
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,160
It's true!

75
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,260
So this is mine and Axel's bed.

76
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,940
The kids have this round sofa bed.

77
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,340
- Do you sleep well here?
- Mhm, it's like a princess bed!

78
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,760
It doesn't take very long to do a house tour here.

79
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,100
The children can look out at the pool through here.

80
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,860
Here we have coffee, tea, water, and a fridge.

81
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,540
And here is the patio.

82
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,840
It faces the sea.

83
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,780
Here is the bathroom and toilet.

84
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,360
Here is our little dressing room.

85
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,120
You can close it like this...

86
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,200
"I'm going to change now".

87
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,980
And then you can choose one of these.

88
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,180
- "C"?
- Yes, then what does it say?

89
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,900
- "Car"... Car!
- Yes, good!

90
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,320
We are studying.

91
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,160
- Dirt.
- "Dirt", yes!

92
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,940
We alternate with taking a dip in the pool
because it gets so hot.

93
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,800
- We weren't supposed to still be here.
- That's right.

94
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,420
This trip is a collaboration with TUI and we were meant
to be in Khao Lak for two weeks, at two different hotels.

95
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,360
But after being here at Mai Khao Lak for just a few days,
we felt that we had to stay longer!

96
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,620
Yes. It was so nice to come here.
The whole family got into a calmer state.

97
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,340
- Yeah.
- It was really nice.

98
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,100
We're not going to be in New Zealand until February 1st.
They were able to solve it because it's off-season.

99
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,180
Mhm.

100
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,060
In collaboration with TUI we have an offer
for those of you who want to travel to this hotel.

101
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,060
- A 1000 SEK discount...
- ...if you use the code "FAMILY" when booking.

102
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:59,660
You can travel until March 2020, but you have to
book it before January 28th - this week.

103
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,340
All info is in the descriptive text. Check it out!

104
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,060
We are on our way to the store to buy cashew nuts.

105
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,360
There is an old fishing village right next to the hotel over here.

106
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,100
- I am so happy it's there!
- Yes, it's like a little adventure.

107
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,880
Before we had kids we would
probably be staying in that fishing village.

108
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,480
- Now I can really appreciate Bamse and the resort life.
- Yes, indeed.

109
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,920
But it's so nice to be able to go and see other things.

110
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,260
- Yes.
- Yeah.

111
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,120
There are a lot of massage places here.

112
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,480
- That looks nice.
- Yeah.

113
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,940
So many hermit crabs.

114
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
No thank you.

115
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,780
- What did he say?
- He asked if we wanted to eat there.

116
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,180
- No thanks. Did you say no thanks?
- Yes, exactly.

117
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,340
I didn't want to, because it would be kind of boring
to eat food and not buy nuts.

118
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,560
Hands behind your back.

119
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,140
Wow...

120
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,900
Harry.

121
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,240
- Here are the cashew nuts.
- And candy!

122
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,220
Yes, lots of candy. But not that much Thai candy.

123
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,240
This is Thai.

124
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,400
- And this.
- Yes.

125
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,820
- And this!
- No, Haribo isn't Thai.

126
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,640
But guys, listen...

127
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,880
We have a Question of the Day for the viewers!
I just thought of it.

128
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
- Do you know what?
- No.

129
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,280
Do you want to see a video where we try candy from Thailand?

130
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,600
Yes!

131
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,840
Comment below: yes or no. We do what you want!

132
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,560
The time is 6 PM and the sun is about to set.

133
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,140
This is a beautiful place for a walk.

134
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,720
We got ready for dinner and I noticed that
we all got sunburned today.

135
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,220
Harry.

136
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,660
Harry, you have red cheeks.

137
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,800
- What are you looking at?
- The water.

138
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,580
Yes, isn't it nice? The beach makes you calmer.

139
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,740
The sun just set. Alma, do you hear it?

140
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,300
It's the crickets!

141
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,420
- Oh God, how they play!
- Yes!

142
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,680
- They started playing just now.
- Yes.

143
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,300
Alma, what do you think of this place?

144
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,940
It's the best place I've been to, I think!

145
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,560
I'm kind of distracted by the waves.

146
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,960
♪ Hooray, Bamse, the strongest is our Bamse. ♪

147
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,980
♪ And he never thinks about a fight! ♪

148
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,160
♪ Thunder-honey, grandma's thunder-honey
He eats it to become strong, of course. ♪

149
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,180
- There is a show every night!
- Yeah.

150
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,120
- Harry's favorite is Bamse.
- Yes, and Alma's favorite is the disco that's coming up.

151
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,540
We are back in our house, and now it's time to sleep.

152
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,760
Thank you for watching this video!

153
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,860
Please leave a thumbs up...

154
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,160
...or down.

155
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,820
- Or somewhere in between.
- Yes, maybe... Exactly.

156
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,120
Leave a comment, ask questions,
and have a great time until we see you next time!

157
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,980
- See you!
- Bye, bye!

158
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,260
Adieu, farewell!
