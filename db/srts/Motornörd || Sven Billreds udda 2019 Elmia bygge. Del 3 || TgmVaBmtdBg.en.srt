PART 3.

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,000
Vetlanda Sweden, Oktober 2018.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,400
-Hello!
Hi!

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,640
-I'm back.
Yepp.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,860
-Let's see if they have been any progress?
Well there has been no huge progress.

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,660
I got my waterjet grill in aluminum.

8
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,340
And all the moldings.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,080
The moldings I have been shaped and they are not
finished yet but should be rounded and sanded.

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,880
All screws should be recessed.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,300
And had to rolled to this one.

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:05,980
When it's polished on the outside
it looks like it is cast in aluminum.

13
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:13,940
It is because it is a bit dull but then it becomes
when they waterjet it then it looks more real.

14
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,360
So you're going to polish it?
Yes only on that surface.

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,180
Then it may be gray like this.

16
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,480
It took many hours to do but it looks great.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,780
There are many holes.

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,120
I have created a door.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,420
And fitted the trunk and it's almost done.

20
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,600
It needs to be polished.
It's rough sanded.

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,080
Here I did a rough... and I tested to polish.

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,160
Then I tried something eles and
the other side got much better.

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,220
I have to redo the other side.

24
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,200
Now it is wet-sanded.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,860
-Okey.
It's only the polishing left.

26
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,340
It is very straight and looks fine
compared to the other side.

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,295
That part took about 14 hours to grind.

28
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,780
-You're joking!??
No, it took 14 hours.

29
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,540
-14 hours to sand the little triangle?
Yes.

30
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:22,000
It about anothe 5-6 hours of polishing before I'm done.
-You're crazy.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,140
I'm lucky I don't have to pay someone
for it would be very expensive.

32
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,660
-It's totally crazy.
If you spend 6 hours to grind just that side.

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,860
-Then you have 20 hours of work on the other side.
Yes.

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,100
-And you should be ready before Easter...
-Yes hehehe... that's the idea.

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,260
I have made a door that is 
suspended in my own hinges.

36
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,120
I cut to it so the transition is not quite straight yet.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,060
I want a little sweep on it.

38
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,660
I got to weld and put in
pieces to get a good fit.

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,800
-Have you built the door yourself?
Yes.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,860
-You're good.
Well...

41
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,440
...stubborn.

42
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,720
On the inside I have tried jeweling.

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,820
Same way as the dashboard
but it was difficult.

44
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,340
I can't do that in the pillar drill
because it gets too deep.

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,780
I tried by hand though but now
it will be covered with leather instead.

46
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,820
With a compartment here in leather.

47
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,240
Did you wanted it to look like this?
Yes, jeweling is difficult to do.

48
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,820
It's a different thing if you have a machine 
Which could push just as hard to get same type of jeweling.

49
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,060
Then you get smooth and even results.

50
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,880
-How long did it take to build do the door?
Well, how long did it take ....

51
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,840
hmmm...

52
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
About one and a half week.

53
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,320
From scratch.

54
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,840
I had to make special tools.

55
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,780
When I've cut the sheet metal I put it here.

56
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,380
So it stands out around this much.

57
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,520
Attaches it so it stays firm.
-Yes.

58
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,580
I knock with a plastic hammer around the pipe.

59
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,240
Then you get this bend.

60
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,540
-What bend do you want?
Partly upwards.

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,000
And it turns in.
-Ah, right.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,820
When I do the other door, 
I have to cut off the welding and turn it around so that it becomes mirrored.

63
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,260
These parts are welded into this bend

64
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:53,880
The door itself consists of outer skins 
and the two edge moldings that you can bend.

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,560
A bottom and a front piece where hinges
sitting which I had to reinforce.

66
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,360
And finally, the inner leather on the door.

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,940
-Impressive!
And now the hinges are in place.

68
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,720
Here, there should be a sealing strip 
that is in line with the hinge.

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,380
A sealing strip or D-list as it is called.

70
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,720
It should sit here since I want the car waterproof.

71
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,240
I should be able to wash the car
without getting the whole inside wet.

72
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,620
-Yes you should be able to drive in the rain as well.
Yes that is the most important thing.

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,360
That's about as far as I've come.

74
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,720
I have created some other small details.
I didn't have these mouldings before.

75
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,880
Was the rearview mirror in place when you were last here?
-No.

76
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,560
It is mounted with a standard M6 stud bolt.

77
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,900
Then it is removable.

78
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,760
I put it here first...

79
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,140
It should be below this.

80
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,180
Then you attach the rearview mirror like this.

81
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,380
The only thing which is missing is the passenger door.
And fit the rest of the parts.

82
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,460
I smooth out the body with a pansar blade.
-Pansar blade?

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,200
A car body file which many experts says.
It is used so that you get a smooth surface.

84
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,700
To get rid of any small elevations that exist.

85
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,280
And after that I start sanding with sandpaper.

86
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,480
If I would use sandpaper it 
would just follows the bumps.

87
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,600
A car body file removes the bumps
so I can then grind later on.

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,420
-How much is it planing off?
Not a lot.

89
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,560
I have to careful so I don't get i wrong.

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,060
IF I cut a jack in the sheet metal.

91
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,700
Then you get to plan the entire area so that the jacket disappears.
You can't just plane at the same spot.

92
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,620
Then there will be a pit there when you polish.

93
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,500
If you have a pit or a jack, I have to plane
down everything until I get to the same level.

94
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,540
This area takes about 5 hours to plan.

95
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:25,540
Here it is smoother and then it takes
2-3 hours with a car body file.

96
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,080
There are various grinding machines you can use.

97
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,960
I tried a machine that
car painters call pancakes.

98
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,060
It is slightly larger and has oscillating grinding.
It does this movement.

99
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,700
And it also forcibly rotates.

100
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,800
A regular oscillator grinder
does not spin it just vibrates.

101
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,280
This machine spins and
makes an oscillating motion.

102
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,700
Then it is easy to get the surface smooth.

103
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,420
I have tried this machine on this site
and therefore it became much smoother.

104
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,740
That is why I will redo the other side.

105
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,320
This type of sandpaper is used.

106
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,580
This sandpaper is larger than usual.
So it takes a bigger surface and it is easier to get flat.

107
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,080
-What sandpaper do you start with?
This is 180.

108
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,920
I use from 180 up to 2000.

109
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,800
With 1000 and 2000 I wet polishing.

110
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,180
Then it becomes this surface.

111
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,160
I use window cleaners products.
I think that's smoother.

112
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,420
It gets leaner and much and easier to wipe off.

113
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,920
-This is pure craftsmanship.

114
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,500
Well... Could we can take the other side instead?
This one is stuck.

115
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,860
It is instead of chrome or paint.

116
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,460
It has a tendency to get burned pretty quickly.
So it is better to make a cover that covers.

117
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:14,500
-Mm, I will do such a cover in 20 minutes...
Well, half an hour..hahaha!

118
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,340
-Crazy!
It takes a bit longer to do.

119
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,880
Here you get some cooling.
Right.

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,960
It takes in cooling air here 
and lets it out underneath.

121
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,380
Then it gets a stream of air that cools the covers.

122
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,520
-Is this one polished and done?
No it is just roughly polished.

123
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,160
-And the other side is just sanded?
Yes.

124
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,520
I have started to polish.

125
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,080
Do you use machine then?
Yes I use a bench polishing machine.

126
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,740
As I use with 3 different polish pads.

127
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,740
-The headlighte are mounted.
Yes, but I don't remember if this was done then.

128
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:05,220
This one will be unpolished though
the stripes will be polished up.

129
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,080
Possibly the edge around it.

130
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,880
I thought it looked a bit naked so I've lathed a metal sleeve.

131
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,660
It brings more life to it.

132
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:24,020
The screws will be replaced. It will be 
countersunk screws with a lid in brass.

133
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,700
Here it will be brass tiles.

134
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,500
-You have an eye for details.
That's the fun bit.

135
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,940
That's the icing on the cake.
-That's what makes the difference.

136
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,880
I think it can be good...
I hope.

137
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,140
-Here you started sketching on the rims.
Yes.

138
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,740
I want it to look a bit different than the original rims.

139
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,120
That is an original rim.

140
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:01,180
I don't want the spinners so I have too
shortened this cover and made it tougher.

141
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,220
I am thinking about using
brass in this pattern.

142
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,920
The cover I have been thinking about
engraves Chevrolet in brass.

143
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,840
The brass will be creased.

144
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,760
Same as I have done with the steering wheel.

145
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,900
It becomes like spokes that I should have on the rims as well.

146
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,900
I'll test on a rim and I'll see what it looks like.

147
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,540
I haven't decided yet.
I'm unsure if it fits but we'll see.

148
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,360
-You do not know until you have tested.
Right.

149
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,300
The rim whould get a personal touch.
We have to wait and see.

150
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,100
-Interesting, It'll be great to see when it's done.

151
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,260
-I suppose you want to continue to work?
Yes.

152
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,620
Okey, see ya!  
Bye.
