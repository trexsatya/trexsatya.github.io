1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,760
Yesterday it was really hard to say hello to you all

2
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,000
But now I'm finally on the way

3
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:13,559
And should go.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,480
After a long education.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,719
We will soon board the aircraft.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,480
I thought you would be able to go, so you will see how I have it down there.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,440
Against Afghanistan.

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,519
Sometimes you come down as a foreign soldier and want to change the world

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,639
During the small six months.

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,039
But there is very little you can do during that time.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,280
Still, you are a cog to get something in the right direction, hopefully.

12
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,480
I think it feels like we made a difference when we were there.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,039
The impression you got from the locals and those we talked to

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,719
When one made things that got a concrete difference

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,559
So it felt like one created security

16
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,519
And made it better for the population, they contributed to a development in the right direction.

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,039
My name is Niklas Wikholm and I come from Holm

18
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:26,599
A village five miles outside Sundsvall.

19
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,400
I work on the ambulance in Ã…nge.

20
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,519
Here is Ana's healthcare store and there is very good stuff here

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,679
Which they may not really know that they have.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,320
Ked-vest

23
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,559
TRACTION SPLINT

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,199
More than we have on our ambulance.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,280
FS14 and FS15 I thought I felt pretty well.

26
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
But it was winter on FS14, a very cold winter with Afghan dimensions.

27
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,119
Otherwise, they were reasonably equal to tasks, what they did and so.

28
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,280
When I got home after the FS15, it was two years before I went down again on the FS20.

29
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:20,679
Then they experienced that it became

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,320
a clearly more strained position

31
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,039
and more sharp tasks

32
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,719
to try to influence what happened

33
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:37,320
More than just watching, observing, as you may have done before.

34
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,559
Preferably one was in southern Afghanistan

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,360
at the larger conflicts, at first

36
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,880
And then it also spread to northern Afghanistan.

37
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,199
It's been a tough night on the mountain top at the mast tonight

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
First we had a post at the top of the top

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,199
Then we were forced to regroup

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,840
Down to the Compo Round in the middle of the night.

41
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:08,840
We had to wake the Ana soldiers so they would not freeze to death.

42
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,199
Now we have camped here instead.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,880
We came down on the FS20 in December.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,679
We were a unit that would follow the Afghan Army

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,039
And be embedded in it, surrounded.

46
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,599
We didn't have much to do with the larger Swedish units.

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,159
For most of the mission.

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,800
The Afghan army would go down and look at an area south of Sar-e Pol.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,280
We would get there there had been a lot of unrest

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,559
And warlords who had disturbed the locals.

51
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,039
Initially run man in more low -lying areas

52
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,599
Then we came to a mountain passage

53
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,000
with high rock walls in a valley

54
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:58,760
A bit like the Grand Canyon, though the mockery narrower.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,199
The rock walls were 300-400 meters straight up on each side

56
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,719
When we were to pass that passport

57
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,920
We were shot.

58
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,320
I remember that before we went in

59
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,880
In this valley where the insurgents were found

60
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,519
became it like a stando

61
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:25,880
where one was waiting for their turn to go in

62
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,440
On almost like a railroad track.

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,360
The feeling when going into this shooting area

64
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,039
was that they tried to be calm and focused.

65
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,280
What is my task, what should I think about.

66
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,960
Right then and then, do their best and try to do their task.

67
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,559
We tried to call on flight support

68
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,960
But we had no coverage then.

69
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,039
We sat trying to call it

70
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,159
So it was approached that you would go into this area.

71
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
Where you are most likely to be shot.

72
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,519
The task was that we would reach the village of Jarghan.

73
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,199
When we got out where the valley opened a little more

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,320
where the insurgenets had taken fire

75
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:55,679
So the Afghan policemen had taken shelter under some stones.

76
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,559
They had thrown themselves out of the cars, which were not split protected.

77
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,039
At the same time, our Swedish Galtar had arrived

78
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:11,280
and driven past their Afghan police cars.

79
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,480
We started to answer the fire and push back the insurgents.

80
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,039
As we passed these cops on the side of the Galten

81
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,320
To take shelter as we get through the valley, along a mountain wall

82
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:36,840
So three to four policemen hang on the side of the Galten.

83
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,840
Any of them throws up the bullet on the hood

84
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,880
To avoid carrying it.

85
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,519
They look exhausted and sweaty

86
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:48,880
While I was driving I tried to send out water bottles

87
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:52,760
Through the small grenade hatch found on the box.

88
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:56,239
Deport PET bottles so they could drink.

89
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,159
We tried to support them the best we could

90
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,079
And went through this mountain pass with 20-30 vehicles.

91
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:14,519
We made our way up to the village of Jarghan where we could collaborate with the population.

92
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,480
Half town is here and welcomes us.

93
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,800
Here is the village where we have our location

94
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,559
Where we opened our base.

95
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,639
It looks like an old cowboy constellation

96
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Where you put the tensions in ring.

97
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:37,760
The village is called Jarghan.

98
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,559
Here next to Ana lives in a compound.

99
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,800
They are building a building, a school maybe.

100
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,440
Very high mountains here.

101
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:57,719
We wanted to try to establish a presence of the Afghan army and police

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
In order to regain this area

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
to the Afghan government

104
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
which we support.

105
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,079
I remember when we arrived.

106
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,519
Then you would not have talked to so many other units directly

107
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,400
Without the most talk on the radio.

108
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:15,360
You didn't really know what it was like with everyone else

109
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,439
If they had managed fully -skinned

110
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,479
Or if something had happened you might have missed.

111
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,800
Someone who had been injured or so.

112
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,399
But once we arrived and could talk to each other

113
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,640
saw that everyone was full -skinned

114
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,119
So it became a pretty excited atmosphere.

115
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:37,159
That everything had gone well, you were very relieved.

116
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,960
One was not satisfied and happy that

117
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:45,600
It had become a dangerous situation or that you have been shot.

118
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,039
That everyone managed was nice.

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,079
One was somehow prepared to

120
00:08:55,239 --> 00:08:59,560
It could be dangerous this time when we came down to Afghanistan.

121
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,039
Then you were also relieved that it went well this time.

122
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,399
I think there are many lessons you bring

123
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,640
from the missions that are difficult to put into words.

124
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:14,079
I am convinced that one is formed as a human being

125
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:18,560
And experiences are tied here at home.

126
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:22,279
You get some perspective on things you are through.

127
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:25,359
One may not complain about the same everyday things

128
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,359
When you get home as you did before you left.

129
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,439
With all the missions in the luggage

130
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,560
I feel satisfied with what I have been through.

131
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,640
I carry a chair with me that I have been involved in and contributed

132
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,039
to helping other people in the world

133
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:52,319
But also help Sweden make a difference in other countries.

134
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,720
It's something I will always have with me.

135
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:00,359
My name is Niklas Wikholm and I am a foreign veteran.
