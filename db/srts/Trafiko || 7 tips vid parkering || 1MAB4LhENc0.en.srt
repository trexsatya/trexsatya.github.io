00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:16.625
Learning to park is an important part of being able to drive a car.

2
00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:19.709
There are several ways to do it on

3
00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:21.834
And that can be a lot to think about.

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.041
We have collected all our videos about parking in its own playlist

5
00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:30.083
If you want to learn more about different types of parking

6
00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:32.458
And how you do to cope with them.

7
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.876
In this video we will give general tips on parking.

8
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:44.208
Start by practicing in quieter areas with some traffic,

9
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:47.542
To gradually train among more cars and road users.

10
00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:51.208
In the beginning you can even exhibit your own obstacles,

11
00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:55.417
For example, cones or other items that do not harm the car,

12
00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.417
To train on more difficult elements.

13
00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:02.667
Are you in a parking lot with lots of cars

14
00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:06.041
Can it be smart to park a little further from the entrance.

15
00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:09.417
Many want to be as close to the entrance as possible

16
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.667
And it makes it crowded and stressful.

17
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.458
Sometimes it might be worth standing a little further away

18
00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:19.083
To be able to park with more space in peace and quiet.

19
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:25.667
Plan your driving to assess the type of parking to do.

20
00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:28.959
The more space you have to swing on,

21
00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.083
The easier it will be to succeed with your parking.

22
00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.250
If you see that it gets crowded to drive in

23
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.125
Maybe it's better to back in.

24
00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:41.041
Do you see it well in advance your driving will usually be safer

25
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.917
And you show more clearly to your fellow road users what you intend to do.

26
00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.333
If you enter your parking

27
00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.041
Can you always adjust it afterwards.

28
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.292
Then try to drive out from the parking as far as possible

29
00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:13.250
to then drive back in,

30
00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.292
Then you get a better overview and perspective,

31
00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:18.876
Which increases the chance that you are standing straight.

32
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.584
If you instead adjust with small movements

33
00:02:22.584 --> 00:02:24.458
Is it more difficult to get it right.

34
00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.333
Are you unsure how far forward or rear you should stand in a parking box

35
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.792
May it help to look at the cars around you.

36
00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:40.458
If you see that the car next to you has its side mirrors at the height of your

37
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.625
So you probably stand well too.

38
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.834
Do you have the opportunity to drive straight through the parking box

39
00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:52.709
To set yourself with the nose outward in the second box

40
00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.250
Is it good to do it.

41
00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.792
Partly because it is easier to get out when you go again,

42
00:02:57.792 --> 00:03:00.625
Without having to back out on a lively parking.

43
00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:03.208
In addition, it is more environmentally friendly

44
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:07.333
Because you reduce the number of times you stop and start the car.

45
00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:16.250
If you need to back out, always do so by crawling.
