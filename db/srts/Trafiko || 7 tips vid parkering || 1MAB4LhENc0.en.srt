Learning to park is an important part of being able to drive.


3
00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:19.709
There are several different ways to do it -


4
00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:21.834
and it can be a lot to think about.


5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.041
We've collected all our videos about parking in our own playlist -


6
00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:30.083
if you want to learn more about different types of parking -


7
00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:32.458
and how to cope with them.


8
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.876
In this video we will give general tips for parking.


9
00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:44.208
Start by practicing in quieter areas with little traffic, -


10
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:47.542
to gradually practice among more cars and road users.


11
00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:51.208
At the beginning, you can even set up your own obstacles, -


12
00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:55.417
for example cones or other objects that do not damage the car, -


13
00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.417
to practice more difficult parts.


14
00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:02.667
If you are in a parking lot with a lot of cars -


15
00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:06.041
it might be smart to park a little further from the entrance.


16
00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:09.417
Many want to be as close to the entrance as possible -


17
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.667
and that makes it crowded and stressful.


18
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.458
Sometimes it can be worth standing a little further away -


19
00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:19.083
to be able to park with more space in peace and quiet.


20
00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:25.667
Plan your drive to assess the type of parking you will be doing.


21
00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:28.959
The more space you have to turn, -


22
00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.083
the easier it will be to succeed with your parking.


23
00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.250
If you see that it is getting crowded to drive in -


24
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.125
maybe it is better to back in.


25
00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:41.041
If you see it in good time, your driving usually becomes safer -


26
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:44.917
and you show your fellow road users more clearly what you intend to do.


27
00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.333
If you enter your parking spot at an angle -


28
00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.041
you can always adjust it afterwards.


29
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.292
Then try to drive out of the parking lot as far as possible -


30
00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:13.250
and then drive back in, -


31
00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.292
then you get a better overview and perspective, -


32
00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:18.876
which increases the chance that you stand straight.


33
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.584
If you instead adjust with small movements -


34
00:02:22.584 --> 00:02:24.458
it's harder to get it right.


35
00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.333
If you are not sure how far to the front or back you should stand in a parking space -


36
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.792
it can help to check the cars around you.


37
00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:40.458
If you see that the car next to you has its side mirrors at the same height as yours -


38
00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.625
then you are probably doing well too.


39
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.834
If you have the opportunity to drive straight through the parking box -


40
00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:52.709
to position yourself with your nose outwards in the other box -


41
00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.250
it is good to do so.


42
00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.792
Partly because it is easier to get out when you have to go again, -


43
00:02:57.792 --> 00:03:00.625
without having to back out into a busy car park.


44
00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:03.208
In addition, it is more environmentally friendly -


45
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:07.333
because you reduce the number of times you stop and start the car.


46
00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:16.250
If you need to back out, always do so by crawling.
