Hello! My name is Helena Karlsson-

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,400
-And I plug my second semester at project -based master.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:20,320
With a project -based master, I have more opportunities to influence my studies.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,520
I can work with a company or an organizational-

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
-and help them with changes or problems they have.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,720
I have much more flexibility in a project -based master.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,520
I am studying what I am interested in and I get to do something-

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,520
-Or has a value for someone else.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,160
Maybe a company that needs help with something.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,200
That is positive about having a company or an organization in the back-

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,600
-Is that I get one-

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,640
-The feeling for what it looks like in real life and I gain experience.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,360
What kind of benefit is the company?

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,200
They

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,080
-The high school

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,200
-And an innovative resource team and I am included there.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,680
It is very exciting that together you influence and solve-

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,520
-A existing problems that exist at the organization or company.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,520
One is continuously working on carrying a dialog-

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,800
-and as a student-

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,440
-Es you feedback and support-

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,520
-What applies to the process.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Halmstad University is one of the most innovative colleges in the entire country-

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,280
-And that's why I just chose Halmstad University.

25
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,960
Precisely the project-based master-

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,240
-I feel the right line.

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,480
University really works proactive-

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,680
-To get the student as much experience as possible.
