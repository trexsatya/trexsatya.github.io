1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,577
A new student can expect warmth I would say,

2
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:17,064
Fun and exciting people with great integrity.

3
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:25,345
It is great fun when we get a visit from active opera singers.

4
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:29,190
Then they come here and guest teaching in masterclass form.

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:47,840
The best thing about studying here at the School of Music, I would say is the quality of teachers,

6
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:55,397
the quality of premises and the fact that you get so much time to practice,

7
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:57,468
Because I think that is very fun.

8
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,240
Students absolutely spend time across genre boundaries.

9
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,400
There are many occasions in the form of some courses being mixed instruments.

10
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,908
That's a bit what you do it for yourself, the time you have at school.

11
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:30,733
As a musician, whom I study, you do not have a lot of lessons a week, but

12
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:36,431
As I usually say, we have no leisure time, we have exercise time.

13
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:50,690
I have developed in the way that I think I have become a little calmer in myself.

14
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:57,029
It probably has to do with all the nice colleagues I have at school, which helps me a lot.

15
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:00,951
It feels like we all drive each other in a pretty good way.
