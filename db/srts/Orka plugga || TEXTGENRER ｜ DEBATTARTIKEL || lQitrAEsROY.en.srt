00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,600
When writing an op-ed piece, your goal is 
to make the reader agree with you.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,360
Choose an issue you feel strongly about, 
where something needs to change.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,320
Use clear, fact-based arguments 
to make the reader react and act.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Op-eds are most common in newspapers 
but also occur on blogs and other sites.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,080
Unlike a column or letter to the editor-

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,720
-an op-ed piece is less personal 
and more fact-based.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
Keep this in mind 
when you're writing an op-ed piece.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,400
Use a short title 
that will spark the reader's interest.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,640
What do you want to say, 
change, affect?

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,440
Start your piece with a clear thesis.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,320
Use arguments to convince the reader.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,880
Choose your best arguments, 
and get rid of the rest.

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,160
Can you think 
of any counterarguments? Good!

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,240
Address those to show that you're able 
to see things from different perspectives.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,760
Use source references 
to strengthen your arguments.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,520
Don't be afraid to cause a stir 
with your piece.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,560
Making the reader care about the issue 
is a positive thing.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,200
Finally, summarise your piece. Repeat 
your thesis, and use your best argument.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,440
You can also finish by asking the reader 
to take action.
