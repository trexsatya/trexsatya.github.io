1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Avanza and Nordnet, they've got competition.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,560
In this video I'm going to go through Levler, which is a new stock platform where you can trade stocks and funds.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,640
And now they offer fee-free trading of shares until March 2025.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,200
So I will go through my thoughts about the platform, how it has gone, I have deposited SEK 1000 for which I bought some shares.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,000
Will show how it works, what I don't like and what I like about the platform.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,440
Now we run, roll intro!

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,000
Hi mate, nice to see you again!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,960
That's right, Levler is a new savings platform that offers stock trading, they just launched it.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,520
They have been around for a while, I don't know how long, but I have about a year or a little more.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,560
They previously only offered mutual fund trading, but now they have launched stock trading as well.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,560
They then offer a 25% discount on all funds and also interest on ISK.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,560
So I usually say, if you want to start saving, start with Avanza, up to 50,000.

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,360
If you want to buy more shares after that, go to Nordnet, then you have up to 80,000 but only within 6 months.

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,880
So there you have a time limit.

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:29,720
At Levler, there is no time limit, or I mean there is no amount limit, but the time limit is until March and then 2025.

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,200
Then it will start to cost brokerage.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,240
But the brokerage at Levler will be cheaper than at Avanza.

18
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,760
I put graphics here, compare, here you can see the price of Levler, here you can see the price of Avanza and Nordnet.

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,600
First of all then, what can you buy on Levler?

20
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,240
Yes, you can trade shares on the Swedish stock exchange, i.e. the Stockholm Stock Exchange, not, for example, Spotlight.

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,080
For example, you can't buy, for example, Plejd, but you can buy, for example, Evolution.

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:05,720
You can buy Hennes and Maurits, H&M that is, but you can't buy, for example, Spiltan shares.

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
So that's the downside then.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:15,240
It is only Nasdaq Stockholm as it currently is, but they have plans to launch it in the future.

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:23,800
You can't buy foreign stocks either, and I've had questions in the group about whether you can buy Bull & Bear and such leveraged products.

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,320
No, but this is purely shares or funds on the Swedish stock exchange then.

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,320
And what's really nice is that they offer free brokerage until March 2025.

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,040
So I got into the app and put in a coin to try this out.

29
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,240
I have bought some shares.

30
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,520
Brokerage-free stock trading simply means that when you buy and sell stocks, you have to pay a fee.

31
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,840
And they skip this fee, so for example on Avanza and Nordnet you have free brokerage up to certain levels.

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,560
50,000 is Avanza, 80,000 is Nordnet.

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,800
So this is good, there is no upper limit as far as I can see anyway.

34
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,560
And this is really fun for us who like to save money and not pay so many expenses.

35
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,200
So I caved in and tested this app and let you know what I think, give some feedback to the app simply.

36
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,320
If you want to try Leveller, there is a link in the description and the comment field.

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,040
So go, try it in case you're a bit keen on saving money.

38
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,000
So if we start with first of all my experience, I deposited a 1000 note with Swish and bought some shares.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,480
I bought some Investor, I bought some Lundbergs and I bought some Betsson.

40
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:54,040
The app works well, but the first thing I encounter is that it feels a bit like an online shop or a clothing store.

41
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:01,720
A bit strange, but it's probably because they have chosen to target people who may not be familiar with shares simply.

42
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,760
You press add to basket when you want to buy a share or a fund and then it's like a checkout.

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,960
So that you can click on what you are interested in and then in the shopping cart you can pay.

44
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:21,080
And it works, but I prefer the traditional way of saying buy or sell, that you press that instead.

45
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,680
So it works to buy shares, a disadvantage here is that you don't get the same functionality as with Avanza & Nordnet.

46
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:36,920
For example, you have no buy points in the graph, you have no technical analysis, somewhat limited overview when it comes to your total portfolio return.

47
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,280
So far from what I can see, but I have just opened an account in and of itself, the P/E ratio shows a little error.

48
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,160
Evolution showed a PE number of 339, so that might be a bit misleading.

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,840
The fund discounts are also good, which we will get into now, and it is the case that Leveller offers a 25% discount on the fund fees.

50
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,520
I haven't compared against SAVR and Fondo, but the two platforms also exist that offer quite heavy discounts on the funds.

51
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:13,115
This is how it is good if you save in funds, so you can check if you have active funds, you can save quite a lot on fees on these platforms.

52
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:20,265
Now I thought I would take some questions that came from the Facebook group then.

53
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:29,628
Rasoul asks what happens after 2025 with the fee, well then it goes to brokerage, 0.185% in variable and minimum brokerage is one kroner.

54
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:34,840
About a 25% discount compared to Avanza and Nordnet, so it's cheaper than Avanza and Nordnet.

55
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,680
Jessica asks if the funds are only discounted until March 2025 as well, or if they continue after that.

56
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,440
The discount should be the same as I understand it, 25% discount is sort of permanent and it's not a temporary thing.

57
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:55,480
Alaa asks if they have bull and bear certificates, if there is a free charge on them as well, but no, they don't have that at the moment and I don't know if they will launch that.

58
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,160
Isak asks if it is free of charge on American shares, and no, they only offer trading on Swedish shares at the moment.

59
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,120
But it is something they plan to launch in the future then.

60
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:21,080
So my honest opinion about Levler, I think it works well to trade on Levler, I have bought shares, I encountered some bug though when I bought shares.

61
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:29,160
But first of all, what I like about it is that the app itself or the website looks a bit like a clothing store, it feels like a web shop.

62
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:38,840
So it's like nothing that, what can I say, the design doesn't appeal to me right away, but the idea is more to appeal perhaps to a beginner who has never saved before.

63
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,120
Who might recognize themselves at a clothing store or an online webshop or something.

64
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:53,080
I know someone on Discord said, shit it looks just like a store, I'll put a picture over here so you can see and compare, it looks kind of funny.

65
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:09,960
I would like to see that when you have placed an order, because you can enter the price you want to buy a share for and place an order, then I think it is a bit unclear that you cannot find it so easily.

66
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:19,640
You have to go into account events to find this, I would have liked it to be on the overview or something so you can get to it faster.

67
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:30,440
And one thing that also bothers me is that you are logged out fairly quickly, I don't know if it has to do with the bank ID or something like that, but on Avanza Nordnet it feels like you can be logged in longer.

68
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,520
At Avanza, I know that you can decide that time, how long you should be logged in and so on.

69
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:42,600
Another thing that bothers me a bit is when you press search, at least on the computer, it first of all selects funds, not shares.

70
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Here, I would instead like that when you press search, you get a sorting of both stocks and funds.

71
00:07:48,600 --> 00:08:03,720
So it's a bit frustrating, and I got a bug then when I bought or was going to buy shares in Betsson, then it said something like, the order didn't go through and then I couldn't place a new order because the previous order didn't have gone through.

72
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,120
But it was all of a sudden gone, so I couldn't go in and remove it or anything. There must have been some bug or some temporary error.

73
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:20,040
So it works to buy shares, it works great. I haven't tested funds per se, but it could be a bit like that, a few small bugs here and there.

74
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,240
But it's great that you get free fees, at least until 2025. It's worth its weight in gold.

75
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:41,560
The future plans for Levler. After all, they have said that they are going to launch more markets, that is, more exchanges and also foreign stocks and have said on Twitter that they are going to be competitive here.

76
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:54,040
So it's fun to see what will happen. They also offer an interest rate, I forgot to say, on ISK of 1.25% or something like that. I put graphics here with how much interest there is.

77
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Here you can see my portfolio, how it looks today, with the three shares that I bought. I chose to invest my 1000 note in Investor, Lundbergs, which is a small base in my private portfolio with.

78
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:15,080
So I just experimented with them. And then I bought Betsson too, just for fun. It came up and I thought we'd run one. So that's how it looks at the moment.

79
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:28,840
So overall, I think the app works just fine, absolutely. I think it's great that Avanza and Nordnet have competition. I have gone on Twitter and said that I am bothered by the brokerage classes where Avanza is good so you can change the brokerage class once every day.

80
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:37,480
There we do not know how it will be at Levler in the future. Nordnet gets a leg up there, because there you can only change the brokerage class once a month.

81
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,120
So it's really lousy Nordnet, you have to fix that. It has to get better.

82
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:51,240
But generally speaking, I hate it. I hate brokerage classes. I HATE brokerage classes.

83
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:02,440
Stop it, everyone. Even Levler. Try to fix an automatic brokerage class. So you always get the cheapest fees when you buy and sell shares.

84
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:11,640
And if you appreciate this video and are considering opening an account there, you are very welcome to use my affiliate link down here in the description or comment field for Levler.

85
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,040
As I said, free of charge until 2025. Go crazy, shop. There are no fees, so just drive.

86
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,520
So you can test yourself, buy and sell a little and so on.

87
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:29,960
