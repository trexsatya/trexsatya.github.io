1
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:14,970
It’s just so fucking hot.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,123
SEE ME

3
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:19,329
And the leather, you just slide in,

4
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:21,123
sit down, and then…

5
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:24,071
It’s getting erotic in here!

6
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,405
The BMW’s got four-wheel drive.

7
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,071
The BMW is a fucking dick car.

8
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,948
Yeah, exactly.

9
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:33,761
The Audi, on the other hand. 
That’s a cock magnet!

10
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:36,575
Didn’t that get your pants wet!

11
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:38,399
Some of us don’t need
a car for that.

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,145
Hey, don’t forget 
who’s boss here!

13
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,771
Karin, was it?

14
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:44,790
Yeah?

15
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,908
What’ll it be then? 
The BMW or the Audi?

16
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:50,398
I had a BMW on my last job, so…

17
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:51,908
And there it is, Ingrid.

18
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:56,162
That’s right. 
It’s a fucking dick car.

19
00:00:57,183 --> 00:00:58,869
Fuck yeah!

20
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,402
Hell, I think you’re 
gonna do just fine here.

21
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:08,045
So Karin here, she’s gonna
relieve us a bit in admin.

22
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:11,557
While I’m looking for 
our new section manager.

23
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:14,144
There, right!

24
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:18,144
Now girls, it’s Friday. 
Let’s stop talking business, right?

25
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,694
I just had something 
on the S.E.K.S report.

26
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:23,968
That we talked about yesterday.

27
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,496
What I did was, I put 
the result in a diagram.

28
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,808
It’s really quite interesting…

29
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,534
Goddamnit, sorry girls.

30
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,260
But I had to leave 
the kids at daycare.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,612
Something that’s apparently 
impossible with prostate cramps.

32
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:42,104
Well anyway, how’s the 
After Work plans going?

33
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:43,418
Good that you brought that up.

34
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:46,694
Girls, we need someone to get 
some snacks, some finger food.

35
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:50,712
Somebody, anybody? Come on!

36
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,241
I could do it. For sure, yeah.

37
00:01:55,241 --> 00:02:00,066
Cool, boys. I’ll leave it to you then. 
You did a fine job last time, so…

38
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01,064
Yeah, really.

39
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:02,908
Yep, let’s go make some cash then,

40
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:05,266
so we can reward 
ourselves with beer later.

41
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:08,300
Let’s get to work girls!

42
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,930
I just wanted to say that, I think 
you’re doing an amazing job.

43
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,379
You should know that I see that.

44
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,456
Thank you.

45
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:50,127
Well, if they’re downing beers before,
then we should get to drink some wine.

46
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,497
Right?

47
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,349
Cheers, honey.

48
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:54,361
Cheers.

49
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:58,281
So, tell me about you know what?

50
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,694
What do you mean?

51
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02,163
The position, has she asked you yet?

52
00:03:02,163 --> 00:03:04,534
No, they’re not gonna give it to me.

53
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,305
Are you kidding me, hun?

54
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:09,300
Everyone knows that you’re 
pretty much running this place.

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,915
Sorry, but that’s how it is. 
You’re the most qualified.

56
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,556
I don’t know about that.

57
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:17,808
Who else would get it? Henrietta?

58
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:22,790
”Yeah, I’m just gonna scratch my 
pubes first, then I’ll get you the report”

59
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,534
You’re awful!

60
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:27,641
If not, you’ll have to 
convince the boss?

61
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,063
Ew! Seriously?

62
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:31,771
God gave us tits and ass, honey.

63
00:03:31,771 --> 00:03:33,281
If we use them the right way,

64
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,841
it’s not us getting taken 
advantage of, right?

65
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,456
I guess so.

66
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:44,182
You’re so cute, sweetie. 
You’ll get this. Trust me!

67
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:24,752
Thank fuck I had a 
burger before this!

68
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:29,985
This thing about 
men faking orgasms…

69
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:35,810
Looking good, boys!

70
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:43,908
Honey, I wanna dance!

71
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:23,896
This is the funniest fucking
chick I’ve ever met!

72
00:05:23,896 --> 00:05:27,362
Did I miss something funny?

73
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:28,862
Tell it again!

74
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,028
It might not be very 
suitable for guys.

75
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:33,353
No, I’m okay.

76
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,550
Okay.

77
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,512
An intelligent woman, an intelligent 
man and Santa Claus were out walking.

78
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:48,473
Suddenly, they find a fiver on the ground. 
Who bends down to pick up the bill?

79
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,276
I don’t know.

80
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:54,257
The intelligent woman of course.
The other two don’t exist!

81
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,701
You’re not offended, right?

82
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:00,300
No.

83
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,012
It’s just a joke.

84
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,569
It was funny.

85
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:11,177
You should be a fucking 
comedian or something!

86
00:06:41,555 --> 00:06:47,829
So, I guess you’ve heard that I’m 
assigning a new section manager?

87
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:51,632
Mhm, I think I 
picked up on that.

88
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,281
I’ve been thinking of you.

89
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:04,418
I mean, you have all the
right merits, experiences.

90
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:09,144
Great!

91
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:18,007
You gotta be able to get your 
hands dirty, when you need to.

92
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:22,201
Don’t be afraid of that.

93
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:26,730
Really get things done.

94
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,692
Just, dare to be...

95
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:34,908
...hard really, when it’s needed.

96
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:55,793
I, eh.. I think I’m gonna 
head home, actually.

97
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:59,877
It’s been such a long day and…

98
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:02,310
But it’s been fun, 
a real success.

99
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,819
We have to do this 
more often. Really.

100
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:16,192
I guess I’ll… see you on Monday.

101
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:59,056
Show your balls, fucking cock!

102
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:26,123
I am convinced that you’re 
the right person for the job.

103
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:27,220
Congratulations!

104
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,652
Thank you for this opportunity!

105
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,123
Hey, you! 
I’m just going to a meeting.

106
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:39,830
You don’t wanna be a sweetheart 
and take this to the kitchen?

107
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,575
Mhm, of course.

108
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,409
Great.

109
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,925
[Wash up the dishes. 
Your dad doesn’t work here!]

110
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:16,226
SEE ME
