1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Yes, but this is how it is that I sit here in the window now and enjoy and long for my first cup of coffee of the day

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,960
And of course I have already drunk it

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:15,616
So it was a lie but I think we're brewing another cup and then I thought we're grazing a little

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:23,440
Various things you might want to know about the investment savings account. STAY TUNED

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,600
Löfbergs ... Skånerost! 
Yes, it's nice.

6
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
4 cups

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
It is needed for a steady man

8
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,608
One ... Four and a half.

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,898
Just put on the lid then just drive.

10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
A real Scanian cheese. It should fit nicely in the intestine.

11
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
Oh how good it is with coffee.

12
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
Hello there

13
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
Today I thought we should talk about

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
Investment savings account

15
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
A so-called ISK

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
Do you know what it is? If you do not know

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
Then you will know it after this video

18
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,360
You may have seen my video about stocks for beginners So how to start investing in stocks as a beginner

19
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
If you have not seen it, check it out

20
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,808
But there I explain that you need as a shell for your investments. That's exactly what the investment savings account is

21
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
it's like a shell

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,976
Think like a small bag of loose candy and in this one we pick different pieces of candy

23
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,072
Which you should take home and eat for your Friday candy

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,728
And this is exactly how an investment savings account works that you choose what you want to pick in this bag

25
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
And just this investment savings account it works like a then shell and

26
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
Based on the type of

27
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
Shells that you choose, you get to estimate in different ways

28
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
And with an investment savings account today

29
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
So you estimate a very low amount

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,160
On your investments so you do not pay as much tax if it is the case that you make a lot of profit without

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,000
You simply pay for the size of this bag

32
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072
The more money you put in this bag

33
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
The more tax you have to pay

34
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
At first I just want to thank you because now I see here that we are as much as 135

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Subscribers to this Youtube channel

36
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,200
I just wanted to give a nice hand heart to you who are subscribers so Thank you very much

37
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,064
I have posted about three videos and you already subscribe it is unbelievable that

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
They really prove that this knowledge is needed

39
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
It is so that there is a demand

40
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096
Okay I'm going to try to stimulate it a bit like that so you can learn more about stock investing

41
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
Saving and more

42
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,216
If you are so that you did not become, press this button here

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
If you want

44
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
If you do not want no but you do not need

45
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
But thanks for watching

46
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,968
So imagine that you start with the requirements to have an investment savings account

47
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Requirements Yes, this is what the Swedish Tax Agency and the bank require from you in order to have an investment savings account

48
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
The investment savings account is a Swedish idea, something that the government has picked out for us

49
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
People should find it easier to save and invest only money so the usual requirements for you to have a

50
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
Investment savings account it is

51
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
1 You must be a private individual So you can not have an investment savings account as a firm or company

52
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,480
You must also be registered in Sweden. So you can not have escaped the country

53
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
because we have such high taxes in Sweden

54
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,392
But you must have an address and you must live in Sweden

55
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,792
Is it the case that you live abroad if you can get a little cumbersome to open an investment savings account and probably

56
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,608
So you are not allowed to do that unfortunately

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,264
You can also not own an investment savings account with others, it is so that you have

58
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
investments that you want to share with others

59
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
To invest together with

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Then you can not do it in the investment savings account

61
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
Without it for the individual

62
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
So you and me

63
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,320
So what are the benefits of having an investment savings account?

64
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Unlike endowment insurance, there are not that many, but if you look at compare

65
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,559
a traditional Share / Fund account or and also called AF account or securities depository

66
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
So is the investment savings account

67
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
It has quite a few benefits

68
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,751
A free investment savings account should not cost anything

69
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
The bank may not charge a fee

70
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,383
If there is a fee in your investment savings account, flee

71
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Spring

72
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
No profit tax

73
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
In an investment savings account

74
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Unlike share depot

75
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Then you have to pay a tax on the profit

76
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
You do not do this in an investment savings account

77
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Avoid declaring your business

78
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,951
The bank does that for you

79
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
They report to the Swedish Tax Agency

80
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
What you have bought and sold

81
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
And you do not have to worry so much about reporting purchase prices and profits and cuts and all sorts of fuss

82
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
Without it, the bank manages

83
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
You own the shares

84
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
On a Endowment Insurance

85
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
KF account or endowment insurance as most people know

86
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,527
Then you do not own the shares, but the bank is responsible for the shares

87
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
But

88
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
with an investment savings account

89
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
then you actually own the investments

90
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
You can move this whole shell from bank to bank

91
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,607
If it is the case that you have an investment savings account at, for example, swedbank or

92
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
SparBanken or any other bank

93
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
Yes, but then you can move them

94
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
From

95
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Point a

96
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
To point b

97
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
Without you having to make a sale

98
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
On other types of such account

99
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
Then maybe you need to sell your shares first

100
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Before

101
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
You're moving

102
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
And then have to buy them again at the other bank

103
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
That's pretty stupid

104
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
Same with mutual funds, it does not matter

105
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
And it's smooth!

106
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,327
Disadvantages of an investment savings account then What is there are some Well absolutely there are

107
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
You have to pay taxes

108
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
Even if your investments go down

109
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
In other words

110
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,847
The less money you have in this tax bag, the less tax you have to pay

111
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
But you still have to pay taxes

112
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
On, for example, share fund account

113
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,319
Then it is the case that then you can offset your losses against your profits, but you can not do that in an investment savings account

114
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
That's a disadvantage

115
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
A little premium though

116
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,951
You can not blank shares in an investment savings account

117
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
And most people do not, so it does not matter

118
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,119
You cannot have certain securities in an investment savings account

119
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,935
For example, unlisted

120
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,287
Shares that are not listed on the stock exchange If you were to buy some shares in an unlisted company

121
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,407
For example, a family friend's company, you can not have them in an investment savings account

122
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
You pay tax on deposits

123
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,063
So if you deposit more money in your investment savings account, it increases

124
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
So the value of yours

125
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Shells and then

126
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
The tax is also increased

127
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
think about it

128
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
So for whom is an investment savings account

129
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
Yes but they could say is

130
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,095
Anyone who wants to invest in the longer term

131
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Anyone who wants to invest with high risk

132
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,311
I would say to investment savings account fits almost all individuals who have a longer time horizon when one

133
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
want to invest their money

134
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
and

135
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
Yes For example if you

136
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,343
Want a savings that you think is suitable for 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 years

137
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,415
Yes, but then it fits very well to have an investment savings account

138
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,767
The investment savings account is suitable for you who trade quite a lot

139
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,071
Who can not declare your business

140
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,679
If you have a regular share fund account then you must declare each buy and sell

141
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
In the declaration

142
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,823
But in an investment savings account, you avoid it because the bank takes care of it for you

143
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
So an investment savings account is probably for you who shop a little more often and want a pretty nice low tax

144
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Who do not withdraw money often either without money As you deposit here and invest them should stay there

145
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
So it is for those who have a little longer Horizon so money that you have in an investment savings account they should stay there

146
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
You should not take them out of there

147
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
Because it only gives you a negative tax

148
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,055
If you do not have an investment savings account, I think you should open one and invest in it

149
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
myself and quite a few others

150
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,479
Usually have an investment savings account at, for example, Avanza bank or at Nordnet Bank

151
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,135
I am not sponsored without the two But on the other hand I get a small commission if you open an account at the two banks

152
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
and yes

153
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,583
You are very welcome to do so, there are links below and if you do not want to support me so it is completely calm and just go to Avanza or nordnet in a

154
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,911
New tab without clicking on my links, I get no commission

155
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Go for it

156
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,311
An investment savings account is good and I think everyone should have it

157
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,663
So now that I have almost drunk my cup of coffee, I want to take the opportunity to say

158
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735

174
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Hello
