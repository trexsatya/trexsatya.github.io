00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,973
A group of young people has been charged in a serious incident in early April 2023.

2
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:16,347
The incident, which began in April, involves ten young individuals from different parts of Sweden, aged between 15 and 24 years.

3
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:24,653
All are suspected of serious crimes. It is about a kidnapping which then results in an attempted murder.

4
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:31,325
The incident unfolded when a 20-year-old man was shot during an escape attempt from his captors.

5
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:41,467
The victim alerted the police that he was kidnapped from Salem the night before and taken to an apartment in Vega in Haninge municipality in southern Stockholm.

6
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:59,448
The victim has stated that there were two light-skinned Swedish men aged 15-16 and four or five dark-skinned men in the apartment, that he was sitting in a car with a friend when he was taken away from Salem to an apartment at gunpoint by masked men and that he was shot in the calf when he fled.

7
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:14,493
Two teenage boys were arrested the following morning, suspected of kidnapping, extremely serious assault and aggravated weapons offences. one is from Ludvika and the other from Smedjebacken.

8
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:20,698
According to the indictment, six of the defendants planned to murder another young man in the apartment.

9
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:37,211
In order to attract the victim, one of his acquaintances was kidnapped in Salem and taken to the place where he was later subjected to threats, punches and kicks. He was also filmed in an attempt to pressure him to lure out his acquaintance. When he tried to escape, he was shot.

10
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:51,489
The primary murder victim never arrived at the apartment, thus averting his murder. The prosecutor has filed charges against six people for involvement in attempted murder and kidnapping.

11
00:01:51,489 --> 00:02:03,332
A seventh person is charged with involvement in kidnapping alone. Two others are charged with felony weapons offense and one girl with failure to disclose the crime.

12
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:15,274
In addition to this, both the kidnapping victim and the intended murder victim are charged with drug offenses, a crime that came to light during the investigation.

13
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:29,252
The indictment suggests strong ties to the Foxtrot criminal network. Among other things, a defendant is said to have referred to the fact that he "drives with the fox", i.e. the "Kurdish fox", which underlines the gang connection.

14
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:41,962
There is talk that the 22-year-old from Gothenburg has stolen 11 bags of narcotics from the Kurdish fox, it should be worth 1 million kroner.

15
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:50,369
The 22-year-old has taken a batch of hashish worth around 1 million kroner in the street. This party "belongs" to the Kurdish fox.

16
00:02:50,369 --> 00:03:03,079
The 22-year-old took on the task of transporting the party from Stockholm to the north of Sweden, such as Skellefteå which was the target. But during the trip, the 22-year-old regrets it and goes to Gothenburg instead.

17
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:11,052
Later, he takes the train down to Malmö and jumps off somewhere where he leaves the hash, which is alleged to have been sold at a greatly reduced price.

18
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:28,099
When the 22-year-old is in Gothenburg in March 2023, he has arranged a meeting with his friend, the 20-year-old victim from Stockholm, who comes to him and hangs out for a few hours. then the 20-year-old gets 300 grams of the hash to sell on in Stockholm.

19
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:49,582
On the evening of March 13, the 20-year-old goes with a friend to Salem's cemetery. They drove into the parking lot and stop a little way into the gravel field.

20
00:03:49,582 --> 00:04:02,559
Then several guys come running with guns and drag the victim out of the car and into the back seat of the other car. The victim is then comforted by his friend and then they drive the victim to an apartment.

21
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:16,070
The victim does not want to state which friend is stalking him, but he is said to live in Salem and has connections to the Kurdish Fox. If you are forced to do something by the Kurdish fox, then you do it, he states.

22
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:28,847
The kidnappers told the victim that he would get a guy from Gothenburg, the 22-year-old, if the victim did not come to Stockholm, they would kill him instead.

23
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:30,847
The victim himself says that:

24
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:48,062
"To an apartment where they are holding me captive. A number of perpetrators. Forces me to bring out an old friend. But I can't get him to Stockholm either. So that I get beaten there as well. Being beaten, stripped and they took money and my mobile and my shoes and sort of stripped me and beat me.

25
00:04:51,064 --> 00:05:16,518
Then they hold me prisoner there for maybe three or four hours at gunpoint. Then I get, they sit and smoke hash inside the apartment we were in. Then finally I manage to get, get them to give me a little leg walk outside because I think I'm not from any air. So we go for a little walk. Then on the way back in, I managed to trick my phone into me without them seeing it.

26
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:31,797
Then I send a location inf... a location pin to my older brother and write to the police that he should call the police. But then those who are holding me prisoner hear that I am sending this SMS this little ping that it is being sent away.

27
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:43,973
Then they aim the weapons at me and then I take my, my, my second there and thus the opportunity to succeed in running out of the apartment and then they start shooting after me inside the apartment.

28
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:59,952
Then I run out of the apartment and scream and down the street towards chain houses and ping and knock on every door and scream. Finally, I find a door that is open on a chain house. So I go in and lock the door and yell and tell them to call the police. So then a family wakes up and calls the police.”

29
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:13,196
At 03.30 on the night of Wednesday, the police received several calls about shots being fired, approximately five minutes later the police find the victim.

30
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:20,869
At 04.45 an order is made for a taxi to pick up Spetsbergsvägen in Vega.

31
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:34,980
The taxi driver gets a bad feeling on the spot that the young boys who were going to go with him felt a bit dangerous and therefore left without picking them up and calls the police.

32
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:42,953
When the police arrive at the address, it is empty at the designated address, but they make contact at the back of the house by the forest.

33
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:52,294
They order a young boy to lie down and in connection with this, another policeman discovers another perpetrator on a roof slanted behind.

34
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:58,132
When they have shackled the boy on the roof, it turns out he has a gun in one of his jacket pockets.

35
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:10,808
The first boy arrested said himself that he had a firearm on him and he also had a pair of assembly gloves/"nubber gloves" on at the time of his arrest.

36
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:24,252
The weapon appeared to be an older black gun, probably old eastern state arms. So two minors and armed 16-year-old boys are arrested at the scene near the apartment where the shooting and kidnapping allegedly took place.

37
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:43,101
The investigation shows that the empty casings, the ricochet marks in the hall, the bullet holes in the kitchen and the entrance door together with the bullets show that at least five shots were fired in the direction of the entrance door and the kitchen.

38
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:48,605
One of them hits the 20-year-old in the leg.

39
00:07:55,611 --> 00:08:06,286
In summary, the 22-year-old steals narcotics belonging to Rawa Majid aka Kurdish Fox. The 22-year-old hands over parts of this to 20-year-old J, who will sell it on. For this, the 22-year-old is to be murdered.

40
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:15,259
In order to get hold of the 22-year-old, the 20-year-old is kidnapped so that he can attract his friend the 22-year-old.

41
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:31,005
16-year-old K, who has been involved, suspected and prosecuted in several high-profile cases in recent years, including recently he was acquitted in the case of Skogå's murder in January 2023, is charged with the kidnapping.

42
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:47,852
