1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,440
Do you have several chapters to study 
for a test and can't even face starting?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,920
Here are some good strategies 
for studying long texts.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,560
PRIOR KNOWLEDGE

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,600
Look through all the pages, read 
the headers and look at the pictures.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,760
Read the captions and look for text 
in italics, which might be a summary.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,720
Is it a book? Read the cover. Do you 
already know something about the topic?

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,600
Can you get more knowledge 
before you start?

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,160
Maybe there is a film on the topic 
or a short article that you could read?

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,800
Prior knowledge gives your brain some- 
thing for new information to hold on to.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
That makes it easier to remember.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,000
SHORT & FOCUSED

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,960
Don't study for several hours at a time.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,920
Set a timer for five minutes and focus. 
Then you can increase the time.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,880
If your reading is unfocused, 
you'll forget where you are in the text.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,840
Then you'll have to reread the page. 
Five focused minutes give a better result.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,360
I'll set the timer for five minutes.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,000
UNDERSTAND

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,760
A common mistake is reading a text 
over and over again.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,520
Because it feels familiar after a while, 
you think that you understand it.

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,560
Divide the text into sections. 
Read one at a time.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,040
When you've finished a section, 
check if you can explain what you read.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,360
It's a simple way to test comprehension.

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
SUMMARIES

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,160
Write short summaries. Look for 
keywords and explain in your own words.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,520
Is it complicated? Try drawing 
a picture that explains the text.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,880
If you want to explain 
how photosynthesis works,

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,840
draw a picture 
and explain what you drew.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,360
It's a good way to explain connections.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
STUDY TOGETHER

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,760
With long texts, 
it's great to study together.

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,320
Read for five minutes, 
discuss what you read and take breaks.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,000
Did you understand it the same way? 
Maybe a friend can explain it better.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Just like summaries, discussions help 
the brain to remember what you've read.

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,280
If you have time, 
you can do presentations.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,040
Take a page or a chapter each.

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Then you need to know what you're 
talking about, which is great for the test.

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,080
Prior knowledge 
Short & focused

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,440
Summaries 
Understand

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
Study together
