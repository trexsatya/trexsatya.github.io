Hi, Julia is my name.

2
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:09,133
I am alumni from language, text processing and digital communication program-

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,533
-To University in Halmstad.

4
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:15,067
Right now I'm sitting in Gothenburg in my apartment and working from there.

5
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:20,033
I now work as a communicator at the construction companies in Gothenburg.

6
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:21,967
Thus in the construction industry.

7
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:26,000
The best thing about the education was to develop my writing.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,633
I've always loved to write so it was a lot of fun.

9
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:32,900
Then it was also great fun to get more-

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,133
-The knowledge of text processing and communication.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,967
Halmstad is a fantastic city to live and live in.

12
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:42,967
It is also a very good student city.

13
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,800
To you who are going to plug this program-

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,900
-or that is thinking about doing so, I would like to give tips on that-

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,000
-be curious about everything and absorb as much as possible-

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,733
-What the width offered by the program.

17
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,933
You can meanwhile find what you want to do then-

18
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,600
-or which direction you want to go.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,533
It was especially good for me because I didn't really know-

20
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:11,300
-What I wanted to work with afterwards. I could come up with that in the meantime.

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,367
Something I brought with me from the education-

22
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:17,433
-Is that I have had to develop my writing.

23
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:20,933
It's something I do every day. I produce a lot of content-

24
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:26,067
-To various channels, social media and web, debate articles and more.

25
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:30,267
I have brought a lot of what we have read about communication-

26
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,567
-And digital concepts for example.

27
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:36,700
It is a big advantage for me in my job today.

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,133
I have always liked both Swedish and English as subjects in school.

29
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:45,867
But I chose the "Swedish language" as a focus because I experienced that-

30
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:49,733
-It was a more widespread labor market in Sweden.

31
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,533
I knew I wanted to live and live here in Sweden.

32
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:56,533
Therefore, I chose the "Swedish language" as a focus.

33
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:02,133
I didn't really know what I wanted to work on.

34
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,300
But thought it was a very wide focus.

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,533
So that I could come up with everything because, what I wanted to work on.

36
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:15,100
Something that I thought was extra good during the training was the practice.

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,333
I thought it was one of the most fun and most important things in the program.

38
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:25,467
There you really have to put your knowledge on the test-

39
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,200
-and do practical things.

40
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,300
Which is a great good stuff to know what you want to do later.

41
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,867
But also to make contacts for the future.

42
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:39,833
In the future, I want to continue working with communication in different ways.

43
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:44,367
I love to create content, to write above all. I think that is great fun.

44
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:48,867
But I also have a great interest in books and reading.

45
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,800
Which would have been a fun thing to work with in the future.

46
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:55,800
Either on a book publisher or as a writer.

47
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,367
We'll see what the future has to give.
