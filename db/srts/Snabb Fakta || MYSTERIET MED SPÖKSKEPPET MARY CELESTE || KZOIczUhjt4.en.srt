1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:16,360
November 7, 1872 the ship Mary Celeste sails away from the port of New York.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,480
The ship would sail to Italy.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:30,960
On board Mary Celeste was Captain Benjamin S. Briggs.
 His wife Sarah and their 2 year old daughter Sophia

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,860
But also 7-8 pieces in the crew.

5
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:44,200
About a month later, December 5, a British ship named Dei Gratia sails

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,260
About 64-74 miles east from the Portuguese archipelago Azores.

7
00:00:51,260 --> 00:01:04,300
The crew of Dei Gratia sees a ship about 10 km away from them.
 The ship behaved strangely.
 It seemed to sail irregularly.

8
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,040
Like no one on board ruled.

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,880
They could not see anyone aboard the deck, which was very strange.

10
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:25,860
The captain of Dei Gratia, David Morehouse suspected that something must be wrong and sent three of his men to go there to investigate.

11
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,640
As the men approached the ship, they saw the name of the ship written on the stern ...

12
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,220
Mary Celeste.

13
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:56,180
The men climbed aboard the ship.
 Once on board, they discovered that something was not really right.

14
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:03,960
Many of the sails were broken or in very poor condition.
 Some sails were completely missing.

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:11,620
When you went down into the cargo room it was water -filled up to 1.1 meters.
 A significant amount of water.

16
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,940
But not particularly alarming to a ship of this size.

17
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:25,140
The men also found a provisional measuring rod that should probably have been used to measure the water depth inside the ship.

18
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,440
It was also discovered that the lifeboat was gone.

19
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,080
The men continue to investigate the ship.

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:45,800
Mary Celeste carried 1701 barrels with industrial alcohol, but all cargo was untouched and mostly intact.

21
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,720
There was food on board that would last for about 6 months.

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:03:00,960
It was also seen that part of the navigation equipment was gone.
 Among other things, a chronometer, a navigation book and a sextant.

23
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:14,200
A logbook was found, where it had been noted that Mary Celeste had added to the harbor on the island of Santa Maria, which belongs to the Azores archipelago on November 25.

24
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,680
About 74 km from where the ship was then found by Dei Gratia.

25
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,460
But that note was written about 1.5 weeks ago without any update since then.

26
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,140
There was nothing about any problem or damage to the ship.

27
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:39,540
There were no signs of violence, injuries or that it had burned on the ship.

28
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:47,020
Apart from the fact that it was a little wet here and there, the ship was still in a relatively good condition.

29
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:55,240
The personal possession of the crew and the captain and valuables remained on the ship.

30
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,560
It was like everyone had just ... abandoned the ship.

31
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,440
But why?

32
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,320
Mary Celeste quickly became known as the "ghost ship"

33
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:24,040
And from that name a lot of different theories were born about what may have happened to the crew on board.

34
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,360
Since no one knows what has happened, I will go through 5 different theories

35
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,540
And then it is up to everyone to decide what sounds most reasonable.

36
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,160
The theories that I intend to go through are:

37
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,960
MUTINY

38
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
Pirates

39
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,140
Water thrombus

40
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,260
Aliens

41
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,260
Giant octopus

42
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,920
If we look at the first theory.
 Mutiny.
 What does it mean?

43
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,180
Myteri means that, for example, crews on a ship refuse to obey the commander's order.

44
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,140
In some cases, this can lead to rebellion and the crew then become violent.

45
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:21,660
According to this theory, the crew must be drunk by the alcohol on board, become violent

46
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,300
And then killed Captain Briggs and his family.

47
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,100
But.. There are some problems with this theory.

48
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:41,920
First, Captain Briggs was known for being a very good captain who had a reputation for always treating his crew well and fairly.

49
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:50,420
Secondly, the alcohol on board industrial alcohol was.
 Also called denatured alcohol.

50
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:59,280
It is alcohol that is undrinkable.
 Different chemicals have been added to make it taste bad or even toxic.

51
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,500
This is for the alcohol to be used in other products that are not intended to be consumed.

52
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,960
In today's society this is in hand spirit.

53
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:21,040
Hence, it is difficult to imagine that the crew would force an alcohol that is not suitable to drink and thus risk their own health.

54
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:34,200
Third, if now the crew murdered the captain and his family, why would all abandon the ship in the middle of the sea in a small lifeboat?

55
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
It does not add up.

56
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:51,900
If we look at the second theory of pirates, it can initially and be a reasonable theory of what may have happened.

57
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,260
The area where Mary Celeste was found was known for having North African pirates.

58
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:06,480
They may have been so that a bunch of pirates attacked Mary Celeste and killed everyone on board.

59
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:14,880
But pirates are known to plunder ships.
 So steal away.

60
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:24,580
But Mary Celeste had all the loads and all valuables from the crew were still left when the ship was found.

61
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:37,140
This theory thus also becomes unlikely because it is difficult to imagine that pirates would murder an entire crew in "unnecessary" without getting anything for it.

62
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:45,500
Could it have been that the crew aboard Dei Gratia has anything to do with it?

63
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:55,080
Maybe it was those who attacked Mary Celeste, killed everyone on board and pretended to find the ship empty and on operation

64
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:01,260
So that it can make money on the cargo and then the sale of the ship?

65
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,260
It is tolerated to think about.

66
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:14,780
Can the sea itself be behind the disappearance of the crew?

67
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:20,300
I mean, it is no wonder that there are natural disasters out on the sea.

68
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
A theory points to this.

69
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:33,060
That it was a water thrombus, also called sea straw that may have created the flood down in the cargo room at Mary Celeste.

70
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:40,140
Then the crew may have used the provisional measuring rod to measure the water mass and probably believed it would

71
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:48,600
continue to rise and that the ship would sink.
 Hence, all the ship fled via the lifeboat.

72
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,040
In that case, it would explain why it was so wet everywhere inside the ship.

73
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:13,100
When rumors began to spread about Mary Celeste, it emerged, as it almost always does with unresolved mysteries, a lot of myths and invented truths.

74
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:20,140
One of those myths says that when the crew at Dei Gratia boarded Mary Celeste

75
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,780
So found them food brought on the tables that were half -eaten

76
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,440
And that there was a cup of smoking hot tea there.

77
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,680
Like everyone in the crew only disappeared in empty nothing.

78
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:43,640
Like an extraterrestrial ship flown over the ship and absorbed everyone in the crew.

79
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,260
These are false post -constructions.

80
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:55,680
It is not true that any meal or tea stood ahead.
 So this theory we can probably iron out immediately.

81
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:05,400
After all, the lifeboat was gone, which points out that the crew intentionally abandoned the ship.

82
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:20,040
The theory of the giant octopus believes that the entire crew, including the captain and his family were taken from the ship

83
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,940
One by one, of a huge octopus.

84
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,940
Although there are very large octopus in our seas.

85
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:38,520
For example, the giant octopus that can be between 15-17 m long or coloss inkfish that can be about 14 m

86
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,740
So it is still very unlikely that an octopus would have the mental intelligence

87
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:53,100
Which makes it understand how it should pick the crew members one by one from the ship.

88
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,300
Would the octopus also take the lifeboat and the nagification equipment as well?

89
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,900
Well, this does not sound particularly likely.

90
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:17,700
What probably happened to Mary Celeste was probably that there was a storm out on the sea.

91
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,160
The storm could possibly have created a water thromble, we can never know for sure

92
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,180
But it can also just as well have been very high waves.

93
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,480
Waves that hit the ship, filled it with more and more water

94
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:43,300
Then the captain made a decision to abandon the ship with the lifeboat which later tragically sank in the storm.

95
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,760
But of course we can't know for sure.

96
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,260
No one on board has ever been found.

97
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:59,400
What really happened to the ship Mary Celeste is still ..

98
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,540
...a mystery.

99
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,540
What do you think happened to the ship?

100
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,540
Feel free to share in the comments field.

101
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,940
And as always ..

102
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Thanks for watching!
