1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,321
For me, it was a pretty big thing to quit at the health center.

2
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:08.921
I had worked there for a lot of years.

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13.561
It was important to me now that I decided to do something else

4
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:16,721
that it was something that felt meaningful

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:22,001
And who felt like it was good for society.

6
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:27.041
This day is very important for those who come here.

7
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:28,921
It's a very special day.

8
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:33,160
Many are nervous and may not have been from home so much before.

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,281
The first time they are in a completely different city.

10
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39.841
You have walked around with our nurse, life, right?

11
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:40,961
Yes.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:45,160
It is important that we who work here make them relax and do their best.

13
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:48,721
And get it for an exciting day and a fun day.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,881
Something they will remember.

15
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:53.641
It's part of the job.

16
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:59.561
And since the slightly bigger purpose, that we take the right person to the right service

17
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:03,281
In two organizations that are important to Sweden,

18
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:05.721
The Armed Forces and the Police Authority.

19
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:10,281
What is fun about working at this authority,

20
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,721
It is, after all, that this is an authority that is under development

21
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,281
And is getting bigger and bigger.

22
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,801
It feels fun to be part of that development.

23
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:24,841
In my former workplace, I often did not feel ready.

24
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:28,401
I always had what I call a "bad conscience high".

25
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:29.601
I don't have that here,

26
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,401
but when we are ready for the day we are ready for the day

27
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,321
And the next day it is a new day.

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:39.241
When I sit on my bike I feel the job runs off

29
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:44,481
and I can focus and concentrate on my second life, my private life

30
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:47.521
And my family instead.
