1
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:25,198
The one who is here, it knocks and hits the walls.

2
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:30,448
It was from under the bed, I thought it thumped back in my back.

3
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:36,414
It was so hard, it felt in the body.
 And then he came after me.

4
00:01:54,148 --> 00:02:03,274
We live in Säffle and we have lived here for, 13 years.

5
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:05,908
When did things happen in this apartment?

6
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:10,601
It is probably a year and a half ago.

7
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:22,153
The one who is now here, it knocks and hits the walls.
 And it has made holes in the wall, both in the hall and in the bedroom.

8
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:28,997
It shakes and moves the bed.
 Even when we are in it.

9
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,213
When you lie in bed?
 You know how someone pulls it?

10
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:35,559
Yes.

11
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,180
When you lie in it ... It's a heavy bed.

12
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,345
Yes, it scratches on the floor.

13
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:51,397
Yes, it was under the bed I thought now.
 Something scraped, polished as well.

14
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:53,833
It also moves the dining table.

15
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,236
Yes.

16
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,337
And roll over the chairs.

17
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:07,563
Throws things.
 For example, a teaspoon.

18
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:19,092
It is so much that you have even written down a list, so you remember everything that has happened.
 And it's not just a phenomenon, it's pretty much that has happened.

19
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:23,716
Opens the mirror in the bathroom.
 The mirror cabinet.

20
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:26,812
One door.

21
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:37,446
When he thumps then the internet goes out.

22
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:40,905
It happened two, three days in succession.

23
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:50,000
And that paraffin lamp, it shook.
 I even kept it and felt how it shook.
 Then it was scary I think.

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,950
Yes.

25
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,543
And it turns on the TV at night.

26
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:02,512
Scratches on the floor.

27
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:08,968
Do you have any idea who this might be?

28
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:20,899
I think it is true to your brother, because he has had a hard time.

29
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:25,527
Can you tell us a little about your brother?

30
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:40,000
He drinks a lot, he is almost an alcoholic.
 So that's why we don't have much contact.
 He gets noisy when he drinks.

31
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:52,438
It will be exciting.
 We will investigate here and see what we get and then we will bring here a medium that does not know anything about this apartment or about these phenomena.

32
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:55,455
So we'll see what she gets late tonight and tonight.

33
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,202
Yes, exciting.

34
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:03,665
Then we are in this residential building here in Säffle and it is an incredible story, what they say hands here.

35
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:11,539
This is the craziest we have been with, this is such a physical activity so there is even proof of the walls.

36
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,218
But this is crazy.

37
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:20,428
It is not the crashing location we have been on, but this is how it is, you never know what is happening.
 It doesn't have to be the big castle from the 1200s

38
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:33,034
Without it can be just like here.
 It is quite small, about 2.3 rooms, but then the phenomenon that happens here, they are incredible.

39
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,548
What do you say, should we start?

40
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:46,981
We fill the rooms with different instruments, we hear them, we are so close to everything.
 It's like a big one about, so we will hear.
 We know where these hot spots are somewhere.

41
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:53,916
And we will focus on very, very much.
 And see if we can make any of the phenomena happen.

42
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:11,706
In here, where the most incredible has happened, a bed that is moved when two people are in it.
 They lie and shake.

43
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:19,157
And then holes in the walls.
 But what I think will be quite unique here too, it is that we will take a medium here.

44
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:26,685
And that medium will try to get it off or get what it is moving here.
 But we must first look at what we can get.

45
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:36,757
On the one hand, document what they say hands here, then run with communication.
 We will have as much info we can about the place when we are done here.

46
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:47,538
We will also test a theory, now we are here ourselves, then we will call back those who live here, to see if more things happen.
 There was a sound behind the camera right now.

47
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:51,192
It snapped.
 I don't know if you heard it Viktor, but it small.

48
00:06:51,192 --> 00:07:01,883
Now Tony Viktor said, he is now filming.
 We still have Lennie, who sits on the bus, he hears us, we have surveillance with sound.

49
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:06,081
If it comes through a name, Lennie can sit and search for it.

50
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:10,979
I imagine that if this energy moves here, it is enough that we just set the PMB.
 Straight up here.

51
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,384
I start it straight up to the roof here.
 So we'll see.

52
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:26,037
There is still sound out there.

53
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,462
There is no sound I've heard before.

54
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:38,386
It sounds like something is wandering around out there.
 So the energy that can make these sounds in the walls and everything, can you go ahead and put your hand on that box there?

55
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:45,251
There was a discomfort when you said it.
 Although it came from the wall here and moved forward.

56
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:50,904
This feels like a regular bedroom, but when you said it Niclas it was like something happened.

57
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:58,088
I also ripped when I said so.
 So if you are with us here now and understand what we say ..

58
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:00,539
So you can knock in the wall ...

59
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:05,626
Check this out.
 It's when you talk, I don't know what you trigger, something is.

60
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:14,604
It feels like you know we are here and we see what you can do.
 You can move things, you can knock in the walls.

61
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:22,991
This is your chance to communicate with us and say what you want, for the family who is here wants to know who it is here and what you want.
 So now you can communicate with us.

62
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:39,539
So if you are in this room now, could you go past that little black that is on the bench?
 Wrap by or put your hand on it and we will notice that you are here.

63
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,239
You have made holes in the walls, can you make a new hole here for us?

64
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:47,608
Can you move on this bed?

65
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:58,002
We make sure we leave here now, you get a discomfort now.
 It is cool that you feel it, that you shudder when you say the words.

66
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:03,132
This is the only room we have PMB in, so it starts playing so we know it is from here.

67
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:08,207
But we try it like this, then afterwards we will try to put it against the wall.

68
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,006
There was something here ...

69
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,983
The floor doesn't even sound.

70
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,235
There it is cracking a little.

71
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:27,935
It was something such a sound we heard.
 We will post our paranormal Movement Alert, ie PMA.
 We can put it on alarms that only indicate movement then.

72
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:40,000
We put it on the table, but we do not take the alarm but just that it should indicate in case something moves.
 Because here they talk about chairs falling, tables being moved, everything vibrates, the lamp vibrates and it has also been kept.

73
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,257
It will be perfect.
 And PRS next to it.

74
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:51,770
We can test when we stand here.
 As we did in the bedroom.

75
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,759
If we have someone who can move on this table, move on the chairs that they have told about ..

76
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,875
Would you be able to do it for us now when we stand here?

77
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,881
Take our energy and then you do something.

78
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:12,353
We start any communication.
 Should you test?

79
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:14,150
I start Ovilus.

80
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,517
Ovilus throws out lots of words, in English that we will interpret.

81
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,493
Try walking around.

82
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:27,562
I will go without disturbing the units, because they are quite sensitive.

83
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:37,802
These chairs here that you have moved on and pushed down on the floor even, could you be able to get them to move a little neighbor only when we stand here?

84
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:49,289
I have one thing in my hand that you can come up and talk ...

85
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,893
The man who is here, if I'm talking to you right now ...

86
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:05,156
Can you say your name to us?

87
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:24,027
We can test anyway, we know Arne, his brother perished in a fire a year and a half ago here in Säffle.
 That's when these things started to happen.

88
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:28,341
And I think he mentioned that his name was Tommy.

89
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:29,740
Okay.

90
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,627
So Tommy, if you are in this apartment ...

91
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:44,089
And want to say something to Arne, greet him something.
 So you have the opportunity to do it now.

92
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:54,904
If you are Tommy who is here, can you go to the table here and touch the antenna?
 Or just go by and we'll see that you're here.

93
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:04,106
Scratch sound, she talked about that before.
 It's in the bedroom.

94
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:08,612
Under the bed, they have heard it, like someone lying and crawling.

95
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:18,836
But we do so that we leave them two here, we learn to hear in case they get started.
 So we put something out in the living room as well.

96
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,368
This one you recognize, says Hello Welcome.
 I will direct it ..

97
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:28,145
Wait!

98
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,750
Here, the kitchen!

99
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,747
Can you do that again?

100
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:38,627
We heard that you were here in the kitchen.

101
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,524
Tommy?

102
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:46,932
Are you here?
 If so, stir the iron stick.

103
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:52,707
We leave it, it may start again.
 I go back here.

104
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,256
Can you touch it again again when we stand here?

105
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:14,891
You don't have to be afraid of us, whoever it is.
 I don't know who it might be right now, but you who are here, or what's here, can you touch that antenna again?

106
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:20,226
We test some theories then, is there a woman who is here?

107
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:23,400
Is it a man who is here?

108
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:37,180
Is it a child who is here?

109
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:42,984
Now I get lots of words here Niclas.

110
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,804
Is there anything in the ground here under this apartment?

111
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:59,689
Can you touch any of our tools in here located on the table?
 If there is something in the ground right here.

112
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:17,804
Now I have activated two PRS here, it is both static and strap function, so if something comes close ..

113
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,572
So if you do as I did now ..

114
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:25,105
Then you will make it sound.

115
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:40,000
Can you throw something in here?

116
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:43,840
Duns and sound in the building.

117
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,346
When you say throw it sounded from the floor.

118
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:55,438
It's no one above.
 And these sounds that come are here somewhere ..

119
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,512
So it sounded type.

120
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:07,279
But there is so much that happens, TV is started by itself, the bathroom cabinet opens by itself.

121
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:10,000
I feel a little dizziness, but not much.
 It comes and goes.

122
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,053
Try there.

123
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:17,313
We test go in here again then.
 As you notice, it is not big here, but we can move pretty quickly through the rooms.

124
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,438
Try standing where I stood.

125
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:26,809
Can you do these things, make a hole in the wall?

126
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:32,243
Tap so high and hard that there are holes in the wall so we will see it.

127
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:40,713
So we know that you are here and that you really want to convey something here now.

128
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:46,498
Now I got up camera, we have to keep track of if something is happening with the technology now.

129
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:55,143
So the individual, the entity that makes these physical holes in the wall, now we challenge you to get to us here.

130
00:15:55,143 --> 00:16:02,093
I think when we talk about camera, if it is intelligent, what comes through here now, we have cameras everywhere here ..

131
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:08,900
That it is so that you film this, that it does not want to be documented.

132
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,305
Duns and a knock in the room.

133
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,214
Now it was a knock somewhere.

134
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:18,338
It's just a tapping, it's hard to say where they come from.

135
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:20,278
It is really difficult.

136
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,386
Can you do this then?

137
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:37,138
PRS reacts in the living room.

138
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,221
Out!

139
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:41,108
I don't know if it was the living room ..

140
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:41,963
Was this out?

141
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:44,794
Yes, here.
 Good!

142
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,513
Shiver..

143
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:51,427
You are .. I don't know what it is, where the shivers came from.

144
00:16:51,427 --> 00:17:00,000
Check out what goose bumps when I go in here.
 It's sick how the hair just rises straight up.

145
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,723
Can you knock for us?

146
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,604
Do you recognize that melody?

147
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,548
Reveal the master, what does it mean by that?

148
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,218
Say your name to us.

149
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,202
Come ...

150
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,540
Niclas hears something from the hall.

151
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,874
What is it that sounds here?
 I have to check.

152
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:46,747
What kind of sound was that?

153
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,791
It sounds like there is someone outside the door.

154
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,423
Okay.

155
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:02,071
I bring a spirit box too, so we see.

156
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,417
Maybe we should test this Niclas.

157
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,369
I go in and knock on the wardrobe the door, right I did so it went on.

158
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,095
Try it again then.

159
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,598
Niclas gets a knock back.

160
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:18,541
Was that you?
 Was it you who knocked?!

161
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,177
No, mine were hard, then something else came.

162
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:23,595
It was a dull ..

163
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:26,561
It sounded like it came in the wall here.

164
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,380
Try again.

165
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:37,163
A knock back.

166
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,123
What kind of sound comes afterwards?

167
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:57,083
What is here, now you have the chance to do everything here so we know who you are.

168
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,614
Do you have the power to be able to do something for us?

169
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,403
Sit on the couch if you want.

170
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,845
Throw a pillow.

171
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:11,466
Is it he who lives here, Arne, his brother who is here?

172
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:16,953
Is it something you want to say goodbye or say to Arne?

173
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,411
Is it Eva you want to talk to?
 So make a loud sound somewhere.

174
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:33,263
They have a lot of watches here, you hear clock sounds everywhere.

175
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:41,409
It is interesting anyway, when we are not in the same room, an instrument starts.

176
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:46,350
Now there was nothing in the kitchen then, but now this was what it probably sounded.

177
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:54,582
Lennie here after all when we are here, because we have sound recording on surveillance.
 So Lennie, if you hear us now ...

178
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:57,082
I hear you.

179
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:07,905
Would you be able to check this area if you find something about this area in Säffle.
 If there was something in the ground or if this is known in Säffle, that things happen here.

180
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,691
I look at what I get.

181
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:14,451
Perfect, just come back if you find something.

182
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:15,953
Yes.

183
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:26,704
What we have been reaction to now, there are knocks.
 When we knock in there, this one starts, we leave that room and then it went on.

184
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,332
I don't know how to meet this.

185
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:34,993
But we have driven Ovilus, should we test spirit box?
 Now it said table.

186
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:39,624
We must have some control.
 We wait a while with spirit box, otherwise we will not hear.

187
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:45,463
Is there anyone in the kitchen over there?
 Can you touch what's on the table?

188
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:51,563
Do you know that you are dead?

189
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:58,036
Tappations are heard from the wall and ceiling.

190
00:20:58,036 --> 00:20:59,933
Sound up from.

191
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:03,024
How can it be sound up from?
 There is no one there.

192
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:09,232
Knocking and voice.

193
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:20,000
If you are angry with something, can you go to any of those things that don't usually be here?

194
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:29,696
Should we try a spirit box?
 See if we get something through it.

195
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:35,988
Who is making them the holes in ...

196
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:37,104
"I"

197
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:38,279
I.

198
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,662
"Wall"

199
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:43,533
MAN.

200
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:45,737
Wake up or wall.

201
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:50,462
If you take all the power you have ..

202
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:51,501
Yes.

203
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:55,423
And then you hit a hole in the wall in here.

204
00:21:56,863 --> 00:22:00,074
I challenge you to do it.

205
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:12,468
Should we go in and close the door here?
 We have a lot of holes behind too.

206
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,987
"Are you standing there?"

207
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:26,734
Can you make one to the hole behind the door there?

208
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,588
Do you see the black box standing up there?
 Can you push it down?

209
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,231
"Yes"

210
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:44,374
Say your first and last name to us.

211
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:47,047
What's your name?

212
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:56,961
Do you know the family who lives here?

213
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:00,272
"Yes."

214
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:03,876
It sounded like someone young.

215
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:08,096
Do you know who makes them the holes in the wall?

216
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:10,891
Not much is coming through.

217
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,076
We pause it a little.

218
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:19,793
Now we are here, can you do something for us?

219
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,520
Show your power to us.

220
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:42,283
Tap hard in any of these walls or do you have such power to move the bed once only?

221
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:48,398
Are you stuck here?

222
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,798
Want help from here?

223
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,648
Listen now if something goes on.
 I knock again, in the wardrobe door.

224
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:25,771
You who have overturned these chairs, can you come in here and move them again?

225
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:37,313
I would like to document the phenomenon.
 Because when we come to such a place where we have chairs that go out, holes in the walls, bankings ..

226
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:44,227
And it happens regularly.
 It is hoped that it will happen when we are here now.

227
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:50,270
If you take all the power you can now, we invite you here.
 Push this table.

228
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:58,234
Can you move a chair just a little neighbor.

229
00:24:58,234 --> 00:24:59,839
Just like this ...

230
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,377
Do you have so much energy?
 You have overturned these chairs.

231
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,926
I turn this off.

232
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:15,043
I put it over there.

233
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:26,961
Do you see the two lamps lying and pulsating here?

234
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:31,223
If you put your hand on one of these pages, it will shine a color.

235
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:37,985
So we can talk to you, you walking around here.
 That knocks in the walls.

236
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:56,473
You are quiet because you want to listen too, in case you hear these the banks.

237
00:25:56,473 --> 00:26:05,808
Not only that, they have had power under the bed when they sleep.
 Like someone lying and scratching on the floor.
 So all sounds are very important here now.

238
00:26:12,814 --> 00:26:16,882
Do you like when knocking in the walls here?

239
00:26:19,463 --> 00:26:22,304
Maybe we should look out of another theory ..

240
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:23,897
There may be something with the ground.

241
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:35,479
That it is not linked to the family but there is something below?
 The strange thing is that they have lived here for 13 years, but this started about a year and a half ago, when his brother passed away.

242
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:42,453
Is there anything in the ground here?
 Has something happened in this place?

243
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:48,004
Do you want to get the family to move from here?

244
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:51,628
Is that why you are punching holes in the walls?

245
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:55,498
Don't like those who live here?

246
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:04,919
Or is it a cry for help?
 Want help from here?

247
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:13,177
If there had been a relative, his brother who wants to communicate and give him an answer ...

248
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:16,279
He should come through them and give us something now.

249
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:24,638
Or he wants to wait until he knows that Eva and Arne will come here.
 That he wants to give it then, we do not know.

250
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:30,000
Or when the medium Wilma will be here late.
 It may be that it might want to convey through.

251
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,279
I put this in bed.

252
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,544
Now I have added one to instruments in there, it is an iron stick that stands out from the bed.

253
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:54,660
Now we have put out quite a lot of tools, you do not want too much either, a tool usually becomes the center point for everything.

254
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:07,780
Otherwise, the energy can make us run around in circles all the time as it did in the beginning.
 A little neighbor in the kitchen, a little neighbor here.
 But now if we are here now we have been watching almost everywhere.
 Except for the kitchen.

255
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:20,569
We have lots of surveillance cameras, audio recordings.
 For the most important thing for us it is to document these physical phenomena.
 These are the ones we want to access.

256
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:26,353
Stand here and experience them when they happen, it was absolutely incredible.

257
00:28:26,353 --> 00:28:31,218
But it also feels like we have to address the right energy and I don't know ..

258
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:41,260
Then I do not know if it is linked to those who live here.
 Because now, it feels like what's here not really comes through.
 Not as strong as they have told you anyway.

259
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:50,279
No.
 And the shivers has disappeared.
 They were there in the beginning when you addressed it, it felt like something was stroked.
 But it didn't really go on the instruments.

260
00:28:52,304 --> 00:28:54,689
Should I try to lie down in bed?
 I lie down on one side here.

261
00:28:54,689 --> 00:29:00,972
I'm standing here.
 Now Tony will lie down in bed there.
 Can he do it?

262
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:07,728
Can you make this bed shake?

263
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:11,910
I get a lot with digs.

264
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,146
That's what I mean.
 And Find Ashes.

265
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,906
What does it mean?

266
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:24,492
Is there anything under this apartment?

267
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:31,211
Finish what?

268
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:44,147
You may attack me when I'm here.
 Pull in this bed and make it shake so I want to get up from here.

269
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:58,690
You don't have to be afraid of me, Niclas or Viktor who is in here now.
 Without doing what you usually do when the others, Eva and Arne are here.

270
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,992
No vibrations here.

271
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:14,240
Statical field here!

272
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:20,801
Thanks!
 Can you do it again?
 Thanks!
 Damn it fast.

273
00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:26,675
Were you here with me exactly?

274
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,782
Shit, what shivers.
 Wait...

275
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:30,863
What is it?

276
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:37,583
What the hell was that?
 It was like someone knocked me in the back of my head.
 I thought I went into the stand.

277
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,865
You who did that, can you do it again?

278
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:55,474
I was quite a hundred that I went into my mic, that it was hanging down.

279
00:30:55,474 --> 00:31:00,000
It was quite intense, then I saw this field.

280
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:09,796
Can you do it again?
 If you can walk on the edge of the bed there, it will shine just as it did.

281
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:16,632
How can it sound from the ceiling?
 I don't get it together.

282
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:18,848
How can it sound up there?

283
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:22,847
I just have to test again ..

284
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,490
So I got up.

285
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:45,402
It is now shining.

286
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,961
Thanks!
 You're in here.

287
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:54,853
What kind of sound was that?

288
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,202
What?

289
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,698
Viktor- "It was I who went against .."

290
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:00,101
No, not that sound ..

291
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,475
I heard that out here too.

292
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:02,459
Did you hear that?

293
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:16,956
We are here with you.
 Need help from here?
 If you can go to this now that is on the bed, light it up properly.

294
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:25,302
Can you do it again?
 What you just did here.
 That you lit it up, that you stood there.

295
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:27,873
Tommy, if you are here ...

296
00:32:27,873 --> 00:32:30,437
Brother of Arne ...

297
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:33,570
Can you go to this on bed now?

298
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:38,305
Okay, we leave this room then.

299
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:53,314
It is difficult.
 A little neighbor in there, it was interesting anyway.

300
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:57,954
We do it like this.
 I have another instrument, we put it on the bed too.

301
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:04,785
This is a prototype we have, I put this I thought.

302
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:12,220
And it's the same thing here, green or red.

303
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:18,350
So if there is something that passes this beam, then we definitely know.

304
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:26,049
So you who usually move in the bedroom, can you go and take in the pyramid I put there?

305
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:37,020
If you are in bed there, can you touch that blue pulsating light?

306
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:45,321
Get it to shine red if you want us to go out here.

307
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:53,246
Make it shine green if you want to keep us in here.

308
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,362
I test a Ghost box.

309
00:33:57,362 --> 00:34:02,029
Yes, test and see if we get something there, I would like to hear this individual's name.

310
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:10,304
And I would like to hear the voice.
 If it now says something to us.
 Ghostbox works like a spirit box.

311
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,040
It will roar a little.

312
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,588
I leave Ovilus there for so long.

313
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:27,608
Do you hear the noise I have here?

314
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:33,966
If you get close to me, you can talk to me.

315
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:46,255
Did I move at your arm?

316
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:47,754
No.

317
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:49,190
Surely?

318
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,923
Yes, I stood here.
 What did you know?

319
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:56,468
It felt like, maybe we got it on film, it was like I was moving at you.
 It was like you took ...

320
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:59,326
No, I stood like this.
 You didn't touch me.

321
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:04,374
This is the second time, I didn't say anything last time, but then it was like someone was here under the sweater.

322
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:11,325
Good, move us if you want.
 Take our energy, do stuff, we're here for your sake.

323
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:14,353
You will get help from here.

324
00:35:14,353 --> 00:35:17,511
I try walking around with this one.

325
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:24,375
The energy that has pushed chairs ...

326
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:34,099
You affect him who lives here very much, he feels very tired.

327
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,222
Huh?

328
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:37,945
No clue.

329
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,240
It was like several ...

330
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,613
"Disappear!"

331
00:35:41,613 --> 00:35:43,341
Did it say away?

332
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:48,198
We will not go here until you say who you are.

333
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:53,295
Say your name to us.

334
00:35:56,491 --> 00:36:00,000
The family wants to know what you are called.

335
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,001
"Do you get it?"

336
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:03,893
It was a woman.

337
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:05,068
"Yes"

338
00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:07,606
Here?

339
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:09,465
Is it a child who is here?

340
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,624
Have you died in this place?

341
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,499
Is your ashes under this house?

342
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,440
"Running"

343
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,358
Spring sounded like.

344
00:36:41,104 --> 00:36:44,210
We will not run from here.

345
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,948
Can you push out a chair to us are you kind?

346
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:51,099
"Hå **** t!"

347
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:56,447
It may have each keep up, but I'm not sure.

348
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,222
"Go"

349
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:58,453
It was go.

350
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:02,682
We go if you pull out this chair.

351
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:06,539
If you move on the chair, we go here.

352
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,377
"The back"

353
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,055
I thought it said Arnes ...

354
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:35,514
Who makes these holes in the wall?

355
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:38,827
"Pass away"

356
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:41,460
Pass away.

357
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:43,231
Did you hear how dark it was?

358
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:46,281
We come in here instead.

359
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:49,060
We stand here.

360
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,220
We will not go.

361
00:37:56,951 --> 00:38:01,061
We will not go.
 You said go away, but we won't go away.
 Who are you?

362
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:03,083
“The kitchen”

363
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,740
Every time I talk ...

364
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:06,242
Do you see this?
 Can you put hand ...

365
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:06,912
“Yep”

366
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,214
Put your hand on this one.

367
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:09,085
"Why?"

368
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:10,121
Why?

369
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,045
Is it a child?

370
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:13,771
Yes, or is it a child?

371
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,957
It is a child who says it.

372
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:22,000
The child who is here, can you come in and play with us here?

373
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:36,276
Can you have it play?
 The one at the office.

374
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,124
"If you pray"

375
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:44,265
If you pray.

376
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:47,175
Please, play on the one at the office there.

377
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:49,093
"Yes"

378
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:51,193
"Evil"

379
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:59,436
I ask you as kindly as I can, put your hand in front of it.
 So it plays.

380
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:05,682
"Never"

381
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:10,906
"Does it work?"

382
00:39:11,176 --> 00:39:17,255
I don't know, there will be a lot of strange words.

383
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,892
There are bangs everywhere, I don't take anything.

384
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:27,293
It feels like we are not coming anymore.
 Not with this, right now it feels like it's a whole stop.

385
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:31,752
I don't know if we should take the family here, so they can be here with us and walk around.

386
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:32,838
Yes, we test it.

387
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:35,730
Or do you come up with something more that we haven't tried?

388
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:43,296
No, we try to communicate.
 We'll see if it starts when they arrive.
 If it is those who have things with them.

389
00:39:54,908 --> 00:40:01,541
Then it's time again, now Eva and Arne are included.
 We'll see if some more things happen now.

390
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:07,845
Exactly, it is you who experience these phenomena with the holes in the wall and knocks.
 All the madness that happens here.

391
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:15,999
Then we continue, we start a motion detector.

392
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:23,191
This one sounds in case something goes in front of it.
 I put it against the sofa here.

393
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:25,359
So if something goes by ..

394
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:35,763
And then we start this one.
 Anyone who shows with red and green if it is something.

395
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:46,713
Now we have those who live here.
 If anyone wants to come in here and talk to us, there are lots of different types of tools here.

396
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:51,255
On the bed or on the table, or out on the kitchen table.

397
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:56,899
Is anyone here with us now?
 Who wants to communicate.

398
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:03,927
Come now.

399
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:11,434
Come show you to us now that we have all gathered.
 There is a lot of energy to take here.

400
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:15,485
Can we hear a knock in the wall?

401
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:20,350
It does not want to.

402
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:30,000
I knocked a little in the wardrobe, then an instrument started.
 It was like that so you can't do it, it's me to do it.

403
00:41:35,266 --> 00:41:37,715
Can you do that?

404
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,137
When we were in a room, we heard something in another room.
 And then we went to that room, then we heard from another room.
 It was like it was moving.

405
00:42:08,137 --> 00:42:12,575
But not very clear, we will see if it happens more now.

406
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:17,627
If we are going into the bedroom Niclas, because there you experience a lot.

407
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:19,704
Yes, turn off the pyramid.

408
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,515
Yes, it's mostly there.

409
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:24,148
I'm going to turn off here only.

410
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:29,030
Now we are here.

411
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,656
Exactly, now we're in here.

412
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:38,329
Can you knock in the wall?
 So we hear it.

413
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,803
In this wall.

414
00:42:48,218 --> 00:42:50,339
There was a bang out there.

415
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,172
Now it's there instead.

416
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,574
Do you recognize that sound?
 Is that how it usually sounds?

417
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,800
Yes.

418
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,875
Small bang.

419
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:10,498
Yes, but sometimes it's higher.

420
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:15,930
Can you move this bed?
 You have moved it and made it shake.

421
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,598
Can you do something like that?

422
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:29,750
Can you come in and put it hand in front of this so it sounds like this ..

423
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:36,431
Can you touch any of them the things we have in here?

424
00:43:38,636 --> 00:43:42,324
Is there any child running in here?

425
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:51,096
Who likes to cuddle?
 Can you go to the bed and touch this iron stick that stands out?

426
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:57,858
Or is there anything in the ground here?

427
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:04,580
Who wants to convey something.
 Can you touch these things then?

428
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:17,642
We got this up with a camera, if it has anything to do with it?
 That, now we film, does it not want to be documented?
 We don't know.

429
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:24,776
If you are out there, can you go to the table there?
 Where it blinks some stuff.

430
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:27,960
And then you touch it, you are kind.

431
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:38,238
Should we try to go out in the kitchen then?
 We leave this.

432
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:40,648
I start it then when we go.

433
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:44,415
Then we go out into the kitchen then and see if we can get through ...

434
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,791
It was me.

435
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:48,097
He just goes past the instrument.

436
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:52,966
Tony!

437
00:44:52,966 --> 00:44:53,643
Yes?

438
00:44:53,643 --> 00:44:57,323
It starts here, it shines!
 Come come!

439
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,911
I think we got it on surveillance.

440
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:03,240
Shone the pyramid?

441
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,530
Both static and REM function went.

442
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,031
Both?

443
00:45:08,031 --> 00:45:11,595
Just as we went out and I turned around, they started glowing.

444
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:14,995
Good, follow us out here then.

445
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,242
So we go to the kitchen so we can talk to you there.

446
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:21,491
It is typical that it is after that it is in the room where we leave.

447
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:22,378
Yes.

448
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:39,231
You who have talked to us before, can you come in and talk to us again?

449
00:45:44,788 --> 00:45:47,072
Who are you?

450
00:45:50,903 --> 00:45:52,731
Say your name to us.

451
00:45:56,647 --> 00:45:57,792
Something you want to say goodbye ....

452
00:45:57,792 --> 00:45:58,775
"Remove"

453
00:45:58,775 --> 00:46:00,186
Did it say go away?

454
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:06,169
Something you want to say goodbye?

455
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,083
Hello Hello!

456
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:10,676
Who are you?

457
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:13,578
Do you know us?

458
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:20,775
Why do you knock in the walls here?

459
00:46:20,775 --> 00:46:21,660
“Banking”

460
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,578
Banks.

461
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:29,176
It sounds like a child.
 I don't get it together.

462
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:33,537
What do you want?

463
00:46:45,914 --> 00:46:52,045
Now we want you to come in here and then you say your name loudly and clearly.

464
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,233
It sounded very far.

465
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:07,417
It sounded a bit like Tommy, but I don't know ..

466
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:11,273
If it is Tommy who is here ...

467
00:47:11,273 --> 00:47:14,426
Say yes in that case.

468
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:18,281
"Yes"

469
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:25,998
Is there anything else here?
 That has to do with this ground.

470
00:47:29,104 --> 00:47:31,784
Say yes if it is.

471
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:33,000
"Yes"

472
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,810
It's something else.

473
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:40,384
"Strong"

474
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:46,744
Are you buried under this house?

475
00:47:48,454 --> 00:47:52,500
Is your ash under this house?

476
00:47:55,516 --> 00:47:58,586
Lennie, have you looked up anything about the place?

477
00:47:58,586 --> 00:48:05,406
Yes, I have found that there is an old pilgrim trail outside here.
 Could it be true?

478
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:06,412
Yes, it's a joint.

479
00:48:06,412 --> 00:48:07,589
It's a joint here?

480
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,525
Okay.

481
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,228
Is there anything more you've got about the place?

482
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:21,346
No more than there is a cemetery about one, one and a half kilometers away.

483
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:22,583
That's right.

484
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:27,298
It is out after the narrow road.

485
00:48:27,298 --> 00:48:37,498
Thanks Lennie, great.
 That's what we've been up to now, we get this with ash, legs, digs and now you asked if it is in the ground.

486
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:46,337
Then maybe we have a line to go on, that it is not linked to you in this case, but there is something near here.

487
00:48:46,337 --> 00:48:50,232
But if there is something in the ground ..

488
00:48:50,502 --> 00:48:54,605
who want to remind themselves that they are here ...

489
00:48:54,605 --> 00:48:58,530
Can you touch something in here?

490
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:11,545
Have you followed any object in this building here?

491
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:28,151
So hard, we don't really get out what it is.
 It keeps up with a bit and we have some theories but ...

492
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:32,251
We get no response that it is so.

493
00:49:32,566 --> 00:49:34,261
Nothing.

494
00:49:34,576 --> 00:49:47,103
We go so that we take in Wilma.
 She has no idea what has happened here tonight.
 So we'll see what she gets, if she gets something more.

495
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:53,227
And possibly can remove what is here.

496
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,438
Hello!
 Wilma.

497
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:06,200
Arne.

498
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,092
Nice.

499
00:50:07,092 --> 00:50:08,143
Eva.

500
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:11,910
Nice.
 Exciting.

501
00:50:13,035 --> 00:50:24,315
Welcome here Wilma.
 We have been walking around a bit here and we think it's your turn to feel.
 And see what you get to you.

502
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:31,881
I only have one meter, so if we get something that happens then I will measure EMF.

503
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:36,780
But you can do the job here and see what you get to yourself.

504
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,516
How exiting.

505
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:49,155
Let's see.
 I want to start by going straight here in the family room, it seems to be.

506
00:50:55,762 --> 00:51:04,808
I actually get a first contact here.
 And then I see as a figure of an older gentleman sitting in that armchair.

507
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:14,033
He sits just like the armchair is directed, so he sits and stare straight in like this, in the TV.

508
00:51:14,033 --> 00:51:21,843
He is here to keep track and wants to be close to you.
 So I connect that there is a relative.

509
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:28,902
He wants to keep track and he sits here and just wants it to be calm and well for you.

510
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:38,632
And he has a fairly clear energy and he shows that he has tried to contact you by affecting the electronics.

511
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:43,823
That he has hit the TV or raised the sound and the like.

512
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:47,108
And turns on the TV at night ..

513
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:57,600
I'll try to see how he ... I'll move a little here.
 I'll know what kind of relatives this might be.

514
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,510
I get a name, it doesn't have to be this name, it can be similar.

515
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:18,241
And I hear Arne ... It may be that the letters A and R are in the name.
 But it is Arne anyway.
 And he feels a little older, about 80 years, as he shows up.

516
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:26,021
And I connect him a lot to you, that it is you that he simply belongs to that it is you he wants to be close.

517
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:37,408
But he is a good energy.
 He says he knows you know about him, that you have felt his energy here.

518
00:52:37,408 --> 00:52:45,746
And especially right here on the couch.
 For example, if you have been here yourself on the couch, you have felt that you are not really alone.

519
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:53,989
And it is not intended to be intimidated, he says, but he just wants to show his presence.
 By pure love.

520
00:52:53,989 --> 00:53:02,370
But what you can do then, what I do with relatives and those who are friendly and are just here of love, it is that he tones them down a bit.

521
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:07,344
But I don't completely remove them if there are family bands.

522
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:21,306
I think I want to move on a little first, then we go back here in case he wants to show me something more.

523
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:25,218
Then I want to go in here.

524
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:51,858
Here I get a woman pretty quickly.
 And this woman belongs to you.
 She shows that she stands against the wardrobe and folds together and folds the sheet.
 It should be nice and it is so important to her.

525
00:53:51,858 --> 00:54:07,591
That it should be washed clean and be nice and so.
 She has been with you and she stays like here, just because when she lived it was important for her to sew up curtains and as I said fold sheets.

526
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:09,235
It's my mother -in -law then.

527
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:23,362
I was just going to say something about mother, in that direction.
 It's guaranteed your mother -in -law, I'll see if I get any name.
 So we see if we can confirm it too.

528
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:33,320
I still get the word mother, that is, like it's Lillemor or ...

529
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,024
No, I'll probably stay at Lillemor, it feels like it.

530
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:37,661
Lillemor.

531
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:38,656
It's Lillemor.

532
00:54:38,656 --> 00:54:40,629
No, it's not.

533
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:56,975
I get that name, but I still connect it to be the mother -in -law.
 Because I feel she is here now and she wants to be close to you very much.

534
00:54:56,975 --> 00:54:59,371
And she shows a connection to you.

535
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,332
And as I said she organizes a lot here and she also wants to be in control.

536
00:55:04,737 --> 00:55:11,803
And this particular woman and that man out there, they don't know about each other.
 Because they are at different frequencies.

537
00:55:11,803 --> 00:55:15,337
So they do not know each other's energy.

538
00:55:15,922 --> 00:55:21,674
Now I feel drawn to the kitchen.
 So I think we go there.

539
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:31,691
When I enter the kitchen then it is like a small, compact energy runs between my feet.
 Like a dog or cat.

540
00:55:31,691 --> 00:55:46,686
Runs and strokes and goes in between.
 Very curious and social.
 And I know the typical animal energy that we medium can feel, that we feel the difference if it is animal or human, the energy.

541
00:55:46,686 --> 00:56:00,370
Very happy.
 Dog or cat, I actually can't see or feel what kind of animal it is.
 But a very happy animal, likes to jump up on the chairs.

542
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:09,116
And this animal has a connection to you two together, if you may have had an animal that has passed away or that you have had to remove.

543
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,343
It's been many years since that.

544
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:15,900
Where do I want to go in?
 Have we been in here?
 We don't have that?

545
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,273
No.

546
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,189
It felt exciting in here.

547
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:32,240
In here, there are very clear energies, there are several that I get here.

548
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:41,807
First I get a man and he smells a little liquor, like he had some alcohol problems and was a little aggressive.

549
00:56:41,807 --> 00:56:49,109
And his energy also turns out so that he falls in and is so that I should be seen and I should be heard.

550
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:51,414
He makes a lot of fuss here.

551
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:54,291
I think it's true to your brother.

552
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:57,984
He drinks a lot, he is almost an alcoholic.

553
00:56:57,984 --> 00:56:59,728
He was noisy.

554
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:02,710
Very noisy when he drinks.

555
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:14,181
But this man who boots in so, I have a little trouble indicating what kind of connection he has to you.

556
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:20,000
But what I know is that he is not unknown but he has a connection to one of you.

557
00:57:22,701 --> 00:57:35,949
And he is simply here because he needs help to be transferred to the light.
 He thinks he did a lot wrong when he was alive and he is afraid that when he goes over he ends up in hell.

558
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:43,814
Therefore, he does not dare to go over.
 So he wants to ask for forgiveness and wants help to be brought to light.

559
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:54,378
It is reminiscent of, this with the spirits, he was almost alcoholic.

560
00:57:54,378 --> 00:57:55,851
Is that your father?

561
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:56,644
Brother.

562
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:58,087
Brother.
 Okay.

563
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:05,356
And he was pretty messy.

564
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:19,561
But I'm trying to tone him away.
 Since it is a relative, I do not completely remove, but it will be very quiet when he disappears.

565
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:28,760
And I do it at once now.
 So that we can continue in the rest of the house, otherwise he will disturb all the time.

566
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,040
I'll see if he has any last message to say.

567
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:52,989
The last message is to you then.
 It is that you should think about the posture, not just for back problems but you should show that you are a man, you can do this.
 You should be straight -backed.

568
00:58:52,989 --> 00:59:03,520
He says that you should not be a look and go like this, but now you can show that you are the man here.
 That you take over after me now he says.

569
00:59:04,195 --> 00:59:08,189
So that's his message to you.

570
00:59:10,844 --> 00:59:13,762
Are you okay with me tone him away a bit?

571
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:14,645
Yes.

572
00:59:14,645 --> 00:59:21,983
That's good.
 Then I'll bring in some light and angels here.

573
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:45,894
That's how.
 I saw him go away and I showed the light and explained that there is no hell but he will get help there on the other side.
 And get the love he needs.

574
00:59:45,894 --> 01:00:00,568
He has also received his message through and has shown that it is he who has been here simply.
 So hopefully it will be much calmer, just the passive and intense energy.

575
01:00:01,738 --> 01:00:17,642
I actually felt the scrub there, I feel an energy that is hiding.
 As soon as I come, it's like the energy is behind something.

576
01:00:17,642 --> 01:00:20,878
Which is a bit shy.

577
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:35,984
It is a little boy that I get in, who is about this long.
 Very mischievous.
 And as soon as there is a medial person here, because he feels that I can communicate, then he starts and buses.

578
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:49,311
So that's why he hides and runs around here.
 And this boy is a little lost, because he is looking for his parents.
 He has not really switched to the light.

579
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:56,389
I need to get them to meet each other, so he is led into the light.

580
01:00:56,389 --> 01:01:07,442
He has run here very much on weekdays, back and forth.
 I hear in my head that you have heard these little running.

581
01:01:07,442 --> 01:01:15,758
And he likes to re -furnish in the shelves and roll stuff and that's because he is busing.

582
01:01:15,758 --> 01:01:27,833
When I ask about how he died, I feel fire smoke.
 It may have been like he has burned inside or that he has been burned in some way.

583
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:35,722
Because I feel a lot of fire smoke around him and then he shows burns on the body.

584
01:01:37,747 --> 01:01:52,916
I removed there, then we had the energy here too that I should try to tone down.
 So now I will really just go around where we have been.

585
01:01:57,822 --> 01:02:05,995
Our expectations of the house in Säffle were high.
 After everything the family told, documented and experienced.

586
01:02:05,995 --> 01:02:15,387
What if we would witness a powerful poltergeist phenomenon for the first time?
 Which even had such power to be able to punch holes in walls.

587
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:25,624
It was interesting to see how the medium Wilma worked.
 She got a lot that agreed to Arne's brother Tommy, who tragically died in a fire.

588
01:02:25,624 --> 01:02:32,410
It will be interesting to see if it has been calm after Wilma helps the energies over to the other side.

589
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:42,747
But the question is whether it has become completely calm?
 Or if the forces that remain in the house that cause the phenomenon appear to have switched to the other side.

590
01:02:42,747 --> 01:02:49,776
Or lies dormant to get back with full force.
