1
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:25,198
Whoever is here, it knocks and hits the walls.

2
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:30,448
It was from under the bed, I thought it thumped in my back.

3
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:36,414
It was so hard, you could feel it in your body. And then he came after me.

4
00:01:54,148 --> 00:02:03,274
We live in Säffle and we have lived here for 13 years.

5
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:05,908
When did things start happening in this apartment?

6
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:10,601
It's probably a year and a half ago.

7
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:22,153
The one that is now here, it knocks and hits the walls. And it has made holes in the wall, both in the hall and in the bedroom.

8
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:28,997
It shakes and moves the bed. Even when we are in it.

9
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,213
When you're in bed? Do you feel someone pulling on it?

10
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:35,559
Yes.

11
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,180
When you lie in it... it's a heavy bed.

12
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,345
Yes, it scratches the floor.

13
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:51,397
Yes, it was under the bed, I thought now. Something scratched, sort of polished.

14
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:53,833
It also moves the dining table.

15
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,236
Yes.

16
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,337
And overturns the chairs.

17
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:07,563
Throwing things. For example, a teaspoon.

18
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:19,092
It's so much that you've even written down a list, so you remember everything that happened. And it's not just a phenomenon, quite a lot has happened.

19
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:23,716
Opens the mirror in the bathroom. The mirror cabinet.

20
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:26,812
The one door.

21
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:37,446
When he thumps, the internet goes out.

22
00:03:37,446 --> 00:03:40,905
It happened two, three days in a row.

23
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:50,000
And that paraffin lamp, it shook. I even held it and felt it shake. Back then it was scary, I think.

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,950
Yes.

25
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,543
And it turns on the TV at night.

26
00:03:58,778 --> 00:04:02,512
Scratching the floor.

27
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:08,968
Do you have any idea who this could be?

28
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:20,899
I think that's true of your brother, because he's had a hard time.

29
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:25,527
Can you tell us a little about your brother?

30
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:40,000
He drinks a lot, he's practically an alcoholic. So that's why we don't have much contact. He gets rowdy when he drinks.

31
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:52,438
It will be exciting. We will investigate here and see what we find and then we will bring here a medium who knows nothing about this apartment or about these phenomena.

32
00:04:52,438 --> 00:04:55,455
So we'll see what she comes up with later tonight and tonight.

33
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,202
Yes, exciting.

34
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:03,665
Then we are inside this apartment building here in Säffle and it is an incredible story, what they say happens here.

35
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:11,539
This is the craziest thing we've seen, this is such a physical activity that there's even evidence on the walls.

36
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,218
But this is crazy.

37
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:20,428
It's not the worst location we've been to, but that's the way it is, you never know what's going to happen. It doesn't have to be the big castle from the 13th century,

38
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:33,034
but it can be just like here. It's quite small, about 2.3 rooms, but the phenomena that happen here, they are incredible.

39
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:35,548
What do you say, shall we start?

40
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:46,981
We fill the rooms with different instruments, we hear them, we are so close to everything. It's like a big one, so we'll hear. We know where these hot spots are.

41
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:53,916
And we will focus on them very, very much. And see if we can make any of the phenomena happen.

42
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:11,706
In here is where the most incredible thing has happened, a bed that moves when two people lie in it. They lie and shake.

43
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:19,157
And then holes in the walls. But what I think will be quite unique here as well, is that we will bring a medium here.

44
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:26,685
And that media will try to remove it or bring out what is going on here. But first we'll see what we can find.

45
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:36,757
First, document what they say is happening here, then continue with communication. We will have as much info as we can about the place when we are done here.

46
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:47,538
We will also test a theory, now we are here ourselves, then we will call back those who live here, to see if more things happen. There was a sound behind the camera just now.

47
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:51,192
Something made a sound. I don't know if you heard it Viktor, but it was small.

48
00:06:51,192 --> 00:07:01,883
Now Tony said Viktor, he is now here filming. We still have Lennie, sitting on the bus, he hears us, we have audio surveillance.

49
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:06,081
If a name comes through, Lennie can sit and search for it.

50
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:10,979
I can imagine that if this energy moves here, it is enough that we just set the PMB. Straight up here.

51
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,384
I'm starting it straight up towards the ceiling here. So we'll see.

52
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:26,037
There is still noise out there.

53
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,462
It's not a sound I've heard before.

54
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:38,386
Sounds like something is wandering around out there. So the energy that can make these sounds in the walls and everything, can you go over and put your hand on that music box over there?

55
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:45,251
There was a discomfort when you said that. Although it came off the wall here and pulled forward.

56
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:50,904
This feels like an ordinary bedroom, but when you said it Niclas, it was like something happened.

57
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:58,088
I shiverede too when I said that. So if you are with us here now and understand what we are saying..

58
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:00,539
then you can knock on the wall...

59
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:05,626
Check here. It's when you talk, I don't know what you trigger, something is.

60
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:14,604
It feels like you know we're here and we see what you can do. You can move things, you can knock on the walls.

61
00:08:14,604 --> 00:08:22,991
This is your chance to communicate with us and say what you want, because the family that is here wants to know who is here and what you want. So now you can communicate with us.

62
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:39,539
So if you're in this room now, could you walk past that little black one on the bench? Swipe past or place your hand on it and we'll notice you're here.

63
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,239
You've made holes in the walls, can you make another hole here for us?

64
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:47,608
Can you move this bed?

65
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:58,002
We're going to leave here now, you're going to feel uncomfortable now. It's cool that you feel it, that you shudder when you say the words.

66
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:03,132
This is the only room we have PMB in, when it starts playing we know it's from here.

67
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:08,207
But we try it like this, then after we will try to put it against the wall.

68
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,006
There was something here...

69
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,983
the floor doesn't even make a sound.

70
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,235
There it cracks a bit.

71
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:27,935
It was something like that sound we heard. We will post our Paranormal Movement Alert, i.e. PMA. We can set it to an alarm that only indicates movement then.

72
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:40,000
We put it on the table, but we don't take the alarm, just that it should indicate in case something moves. Because here they talk about chairs falling, tables being moved, everything vibrating, the lamp vibrating and you even had to hold it.

73
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,257
It will be perfect. And PRS next to it.

74
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:51,770
We can test it when we're here. As we did in the bedroom.

75
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:57,759
If we have someone who can move this table, move the chairs that they've been talking about..

76
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,875
could you do it for us now that we're standing here?

77
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,881
Take our energy and you do something.

78
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:12,353
We start some communication. Are you going to test?

79
00:10:12,353 --> 00:10:14,150
I start Ovilus.

80
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,517
Ovilus throws out lots of words, in English that we have to interpret.

81
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,493
Try walking around.

82
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:27,562
I will go without disturbing the devices, because they are quite sensitive.

83
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:37,802
These chairs here that you've moved and pushed down to the floor even, could you get them to move a little bit just while we're standing here?

84
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:49,289
I have a device in hand that you can come forward and speak to...

85
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,893
The man who is here, if I speak to you right now...

86
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:05,156
can you tell us your name?

87
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:24,027
We can at least try, we know Arne, his brother died in a fire a year and a half ago here in Säffle. That's when these things started happening.

88
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:28,341
And I remember him mentioning that his name was Tommy.

89
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:29,740
Okay.

90
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,627
So Tommy, if you're in this apartment...

91
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:44,089
and want to say something to Arne, say hi to him. So you have the opportunity to be able to do it now.

92
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:54,904
If you're Tommy here, can you walk over to the table here and touch the antenna? Or just drop by and we'll see you're here.

93
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:04,106
Scratchy sound, she talked about that before. It's in the bedroom.

94
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:08,612
Under the bed they have heard it, as if someone is lying and scratching.

95
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:18,836
But we'll leave the two of them here, we'll hear if they start. So we put something out in the living room as well.

96
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,368
You recognize this one, it says Hello Welcome. I will direct it..

97
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:28,145
Wait!

98
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,750
Here, the kitchen!

99
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,747
Can you do that again?

100
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:38,627
We heard you were here in the kitchen.

101
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,524
Tommy?

102
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:46,932
Is that you here? Touch that iron stick in that case.

103
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:52,707
We leave it alone, it might start again. I'm going back here.

104
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,256
Can you touch it just one more time while we're standing here?

105
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:14,891
You don't have to be afraid of us, whoever it is. I don't know who it might be right now, but you who are here, or what is here, can you touch that antenna one more time?

106
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:20,226
We'll test some theories then, is it a woman here?

107
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:23,400
Is it a man here?

108
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:37,180
Is there a child here?

109
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:42,984
Now I get a lot of words here Niclas.

110
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,804
Is there something in the ground here under this apartment?

111
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:59,689
Can you touch any of our tools in here that are on the table? If there is something that is in the ground right here.

112
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:17,804
Now I have activated two pieces of PRS here, it is both static and the rem function, so if something comes close..

113
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,572
So if you do what I did now..

114
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:25,105
you will make it sound.

115
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:40,000
Can you throw something in here?

116
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:43,840
Thumps and noises in the building.

117
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,346
When you say throw, it sounded from the floor.

118
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:55,438
There is no one above. And these sounds that are coming are here somewhere..

119
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:58,512
That's what it sounded like.

120
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:07,279
But there's so much going on, the TV turns on by itself, the bathroom cabinet opens by itself.

121
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:10,000
I feel a little dizzy, but not much. It comes and goes.

122
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,053
Try there.

123
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:17,313
We will try to enter here again then. As you can see, it's not big here, but we can move quite quickly through the rooms.

124
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,438
Try standing where I stood.

125
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:26,809
Can you do these things, make a hole in the wall?

126
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:32,243
Knock so loud and hard that it leaves a hole in the wall so we can see it.

127
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:40,713
So we know that you are here and that you really want to convey something here now.

128
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:46,498
Now I got the camera up, we'll have to keep an eye on whether anything happens with the technology now.

129
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:55,143
So that individual, that entity that makes these physical holes in the wall, now we challenge you to come to us here.

130
00:15:55,143 --> 00:16:02,093
I think when we talk about cameras, if it's intelligent, what's coming through here now, we have cameras everywhere here... 

131
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:08,900
that it´s like you're filming this, that it doesn't want to be documented.

132
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,305
Thumps and a knock in the room.

133
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,214
Now there was a knock somewhere.

134
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:18,338
It's just small knocks, it's hard to tell where they come from.

135
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:20,278
It is really difficult.

136
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,386
Can you do this then?

137
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:37,138
PRS reacts outside in the living room.

138
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:38,221
Out!

139
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:41,108
I don't know if it was the living room..

140
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:41,963
Was it outside?

141
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:44,794
Yes, here. Good!

142
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,513
Shivering..

143
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:51,427
You are.. I don't know what it is, where the shivering came from.

144
00:16:51,427 --> 00:17:00,000
Check out the goosebumps when I walk in here. It's crazy how the hair just stands up straight.

145
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,723
Can you knock for us?

146
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,604
Do you recognize that tune?

147
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,548
Reveal the master, what does it mean?

148
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,218
Tell us your name.

149
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,202
Come...

150
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,540
Niclas hears something from the hall.

151
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,874
What's that noise over here? I have to check.

152
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:46,747
What was that sound?

153
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,791
It sounds like there's someone outside the door.

154
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,423
Okay.

155
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:02,071
I'll bring a spirit box too, so we'll see.

156
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,417
Maybe we should try this Niclas.

157
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,369
I go in and knock on the wardrobe door, as soon as I did it, it started.

158
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,095
Try it again then.

159
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,598
Niclas gets a knock back.

160
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:18,541
Was that you? Was it you who knocked?!

161
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,177
No, mine were hard, then something else came.

162
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:23,595
It was a dove..

163
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:26,561
it sounded like it hit the wall here.

164
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,380
Try one more time.

165
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:37,163
A knock back.

166
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,123
What is the sound that comes afterwards?

167
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:57,083
What is here, now you have the chance to do everything here so we know who you are.

168
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,614
Do you have the power to do something for us?

169
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,403
Sit on the couch if you want.

170
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,845
Throw a pillow.

171
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:11,466
Is it he who lives here, Arne, his brother who is here?

172
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:16,953
Is there something you want to greet or say to Arne?

173
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,411
Is it Eva you want to talk to? So make a loud noise somewhere.

174
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:33,263
They have a lot of bells here, you can hear the sound of bells everywhere.

175
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:41,409
It's interesting though, when we're not in the same room, an instrument starts up.

176
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:46,350
Now there was nothing in the kitchen then, but now this is what it probably sounded like.

177
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:54,582
Lennie here us when we are here, because we have audio recording on the surveillance. So Lennie, if you hear us now...

178
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:57,082
I hear you.

179
00:19:57,082 --> 00:20:07,905
Could you check this area, if you find anything around this area in Säffle. If there was something in the ground or if this is known in Säffle, that things are happening here.

180
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,691
I look at what I can find.

181
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:14,451
Perfect, just come back if you find anything.

182
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:15,953
Yes.

183
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:26,704
What we've had a reaction to now, it's knocks. When we knock in there this one starts, we leave that room and then that one started.

184
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,332
I don't know how we are going to face this.

185
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:34,993
But we have run Ovilus, shall we test spiritbox? Now it said table.

186
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:39,624
We'll have to keep an eye out. We wait a while with spiritbox, otherwise we don't hear.

187
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:45,463
Is there someone in the kitchen over there? Can you touch what's on the table?

188
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:51,563
Do you know you are dead?

189
00:20:52,778 --> 00:20:58,036
Knocks are heard from the walls and ceiling.

190
00:20:58,036 --> 00:20:59,933
Sound from above.

191
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:03,024
How can there be noise from upstairs? There's no one there.

192
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:09,232
Knock and voice.

193
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:20,000
If you're angry about something, can you go to any of the things that aren't usually here?

194
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:29,696
Shall we try a spirit box? See if we can get anything through on it.

195
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:35,988
Who is making these holes in...

196
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:37,104
"Me"

197
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:38,279
Me.

198
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,662
"Wall"

199
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:43,533
Man.

200
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:45,737
Gone or wall.

201
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:50,462
If you take all the power you have..

202
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:51,501
Yes.

203
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:55,423
and then you punch a hole in the wall in here.

204
00:21:56,863 --> 00:22:00,074
I challenge you to do so.

205
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:12,468
Shall we go in and close the door here? We have a lot of holes here behind as well.

206
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,987
"Are you standing there?"

207
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:26,734
Can you make another hole behind the door there?

208
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,588
See that black box up there? Can you push it down?

209
00:22:34,588 --> 00:22:36,231
"Yes"

210
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:44,374
Tell us your first and last name.

211
00:22:44,374 --> 00:22:47,047
What's your name?

212
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:56,961
Do you know the family that lives here?

213
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:00,272
"Yes."

214
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:03,876
It sounded like someone young.

215
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:08,096
Do you know who makes these holes in the wall?

216
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:10,891
Not much gets through.

217
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,076
We pause it a bit.

218
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:19,793
Now we're here, can you do something for us?

219
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,520
Show us your power.

220
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:42,283
Knock hard on one of these walls or do you have the strength to move the bed just once?

221
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:48,398
Are you stuck here?

222
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,798
Do you want help from here?

223
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,648
Listen now in case something goes off. I knock again, on the wardrobe door.

224
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:25,771
You who knocked over these chairs, can you come in here and move them again?

225
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:37,313
I really want to document the phenomena. Because when we get to a place like that where we have chairs falling out, holes in the walls, knocking..

226
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:44,227
and it happens regularly. One hopes that it will happen when we are here now.

227
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:50,270
If you take all the power you can now, we invite you here. Push this table.

228
00:24:54,276 --> 00:24:58,234
Can you move a chair just a little bit.

229
00:24:58,234 --> 00:24:59,839
Just like this...

230
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,377
Do you have that much energy? You have knocked over these chairs.

231
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:11,926
I'm turning this off.

232
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:15,043
I'll put it over there.

233
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:26,961
Do you see the two lights pulsating here?

234
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:31,223
If you put your hand on one of these pages, it will glow a color.

235
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:37,985
So we can talk to you, you who walk around here. Knocking on the walls.

236
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:56,473
You are quiet because you want to listen too, in case you hear these knockings.

237
00:25:56,473 --> 00:26:05,808
Not only that, they've had scratches under the bed when they sleep. Like someone is scratching the floor. So all sounds are very important here now.

238
00:26:12,814 --> 00:26:16,882
Do you enjoy banging on the walls here?

239
00:26:19,463 --> 00:26:22,304
Maybe we should look at another theory..

240
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:23,897
maybe it's something with the ground.

241
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:35,479
That it is not connected to the family but there is something here underneath? The strange thing is that they have lived here for 13 years, but this started about a year and a half ago, when his brother passed away.

242
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:42,453
Is there something in the ground here? Has something happened at this location?

243
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:48,004
Do you want to get the family to move out of here?

244
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:51,628
Is that why you're punching holes in the walls?

245
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:55,498
Don't like the people who live here?

246
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:04,919
Or is it a cry for help? Do you want help from here?

247
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:13,177
If it had been a relative, his brother who wants to communicate and give him some answer...

248
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:16,279
they should probably come through and give us something now.

249
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:24,638
Or he wants to wait until he knows that Eva and Arne will come here. That he wants to give it then, we don't know.

250
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:30,000
Or when the medium Wilma will be here late. It is perhaps it may want to convey through.

251
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,279
I'll put this to bed.

252
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,544
Now I've put another instrument in there, it's an iron stick sticking up from the bed.

253
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:54,660
Now we have put out quite a lot of tools, you don't want too many either, one tool usually becomes the center point for everything.

254
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:07,780
Otherwise, the energy can make us run around in circles all the time like it did at the start. A little bit in the kitchen, a little bit here. But now if we are standing here now, we have control almost everywhere. Except for the kitchen.

255
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:20,569
We have lots of surveillance cameras, audio recordings. Because the most important thing for us is to document these physical phenomena. Those are the ones we want to reach.

256
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:26,353
Stand here and experience them as they happen, it would have been absolutely incredible.

257
00:28:26,353 --> 00:28:31,218
But it also feels like we have to address the right energy and I don't know..

258
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:41,260
Then I don't know if it's connected to those who live here. Because right now it feels like what's here isn't really coming through. Not as strong as they have told me anyway.

259
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:50,279
No. And the shivers have disappeared. They were there at the beginning when it was addressed, it felt like something was floating around. But it didn't quite work out on the instruments.

260
00:28:52,304 --> 00:28:54,689
Should I try getting into bed? I'm laying on one side here.

261
00:28:54,689 --> 00:29:00,972
I'm still standing here. Now Tony will go to bed there. Can he do it?

262
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:07,728
Can you make this bed shake?

263
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:11,910
I get a lot of things about dig.

264
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:15,146
That's what I mean. And Find Ashes.

265
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,906
What does it mean?

266
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:24,492
Is there anything under this apartment?

267
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:31,211
End what?

268
00:29:36,702 --> 00:29:44,147
You can attack me while I'm lying here. Pull this bed and make it shake so I want to get out of here.

269
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:58,690
You don't have to be afraid of me, Niclas or Viktor who are in here now. But do what you usually do when the others, Eva and Arne, are here.

270
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,992
No vibrations here.

271
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:14,240
Static field here!

272
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:20,801
Thanks! Can you do it one more time? Thanks! Damn, how fast it went.

273
00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:26,675
Were you just here with me?

274
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,782
Shit, shivers. Wait...

275
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:30,863
What is that?

276
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:37,583
What the hell was that? It was like someone tapped me on the back of the head. I thought I went into the stand.

277
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,865
You who did that, can you do it one more time?

278
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:55,474
I was absolutely certain that I went into the mic, that it hung down.

279
00:30:55,474 --> 00:31:00,000
It was pretty intense, then I saw this field.

280
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:09,796
Can you do it one more time? If you can walk on the edge of the bed there, it will glow just like it did just now.

281
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:16,632
How can it sound from the roof? I can't get it together.

282
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:18,848
How can it sound up there?

283
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:22,847
I just have to try one more time..

284
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,490
Then I stood up.

285
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:45,402
It is now lit.

286
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,961
Thanks! You are in here.

287
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:54,853
What was that sound?

288
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,202
What?

289
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,698
Viktor- "I was the one who went against.."

290
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:00,101
No, not that sound..

291
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,475
I heard that out here too.

292
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:02,459
Did you hear that?

293
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:16,956
We are here with you. Need help from here? Can you go over to this one now lying on the bed, shine it properly.

294
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:25,302
Can you do it one more time? What you just did here. That you lit it up, that you stood there.

295
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:27,873
Tommy, if you're here...

296
00:32:27,873 --> 00:32:30,437
Arne's brother...

297
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:33,570
can you walk over to this one on the bed now?

298
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:38,305
Okay, we'll leave this room then.

299
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:53,314
It is difficult. A bit close in there, it was interesting nonetheless.

300
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:57,954
We do it like this. I have another instrument, we put it on the bed too.

301
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:04,785
This is a prototype we have, I'll put it here I thought.

302
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:12,220
And it's the same here, green or red.

303
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:18,350
So if there is something that passes this beam, then we know for sure.

304
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:26,049
So you who usually move around in the bedroom, can you go and take the pyramid I put there?

305
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:37,020
If you're in bed there, can you touch that blue pulsating light?

306
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:45,321
Make it glow red if you want us out of here.

307
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:53,246
Make it glow green if you want to keep us in here.

308
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,362
I'm testing a Ghostbox.

309
00:33:57,362 --> 00:34:02,029
Yeah, test and see if we get anything there, I'd like to hear this individual's name.

310
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:10,304
And the voice I would like to hear. Now if it tells us something. Ghostbox works as a spiritbox.

311
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:13,040
It will be a bit noisy.

312
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,588
I'll let Ovilus be there for that long.

313
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:27,608
Do you hear the noise I have here?

314
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:33,966
If you come near me, you can talk to me.

315
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:46,255
Did I touch your arm?

316
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:47,754
No.

317
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:49,190
Sure?

318
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,923
Yes, I was standing here. What did you feel?

319
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:56,468
It felt like, maybe we got it on film, it was like I was touching you. It was like you took...

320
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:59,326
No, I was standing like this. You didn't touch me.

321
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:04,374
It's the second time, I didn't say anything last time, but then it tingled like someone was here under the shirt.

322
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:11,325
Good, move us if you want. Take our energy, make stuff, we're here for you.

323
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:14,353
You will get help from here.

324
00:35:14,353 --> 00:35:17,511
I try walking around with this one.

325
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:24,375
The energy that has pushed chairs...

326
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:34,099
You affect the man who lives here very much, he feels very tired.

327
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,222
Huh?

328
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:37,945
No clue.

329
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,240
It was like several...

330
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,613
"Go away!"

331
00:35:41,613 --> 00:35:43,341
Did it say away?

332
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:48,198
We're not leaving here until you tell us who you are.

333
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:53,295
Tell us your name.

334
00:35:56,491 --> 00:36:00,000
The family wants to know your name.

335
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,001
"Do you get it?"

336
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:03,893
It was a woman.

337
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:05,068
"Yes"

338
00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:07,606
Here?

339
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:09,465
Are there children here?

340
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,624
Have you died at this location?

341
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,499
Are your ashes under this house?

342
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:33,440
"Run"

343
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,358
Run it sounded like.

344
00:36:41,104 --> 00:36:44,210
We will not run from here.

345
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,948
Could you push out a chair for us, please?

346
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:51,099
"Shu****!"

347
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:56,447
It might have been Shut up, but I'm not sure.

348
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,222
"Go"

349
00:36:57,222 --> 00:36:58,453
That was Go.

350
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:02,682
We'll go if you pull this chair out.

351
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:06,539
If you move the chair, we will leave here.

352
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,377
"The back side"

353
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:19,055
I thought it said Arnes...

354
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:35,514
Who makes these holes in the wall?

355
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:38,827
"Go away"

356
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:41,460
Go away.

357
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:43,231
Did you hear how dark it was?

358
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:46,281
We'll come in here instead.

359
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:49,060
We stand here.

360
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,220
We won't go.

361
00:37:56,951 --> 00:38:01,061
We won't go. You said go away, but we won't go away. Who are you?

362
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:03,083
"The Kitchen"

363
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,740
Every time I talk...

364
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:06,242
Do you see this one? Can you put your hand...

365
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:06,912
"Yup"

366
00:38:06,912 --> 00:38:08,214
put your hand on this one.

367
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:09,085
"Why?"

368
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:10,121
Why?

369
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,045
Is it a child?

370
00:38:12,045 --> 00:38:13,771
Yes, or is it a child?

371
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,957
It's a child saying that.

372
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:22,000
The child that is here, can you come in and play with us here?

373
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:36,276
Can you get it to play? The one who is up on the bureau.

374
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,124
"If you ask"

375
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:44,265
If you ask.

376
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:47,175
Please play whoever is on the bureau there.

377
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:49,093
"Yes"

378
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:51,193
"Evil"

379
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:59,436
I beg you as kindly as I can, put your hand in front of it. So it plays.

380
00:39:04,162 --> 00:39:05,682
"Never"

381
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:10,906
"Does it work?"

382
00:39:11,176 --> 00:39:17,255
I don't know, there are a lot of strange words.

383
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,892
There are explosions everywhere, I don't understand anything.

384
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:27,293
It feels like we're not getting any further. Not with this, right now it feels like it's completely stopped.

385
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:31,752
I don't know if we should bring the family here, so they can stay here with us and walk around.

386
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:32,838
Yes, we are testing it.

387
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:35,730
Or do you think of something else that we haven't tried?

388
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:43,296
No, we're trying to communicate. We'll see if it takes off when they arrive. If they are the ones who have the things with them.

389
00:39:54,908 --> 00:40:01,541
Then it's time again, now Eva and Arne are with us. We'll see if a few more things happen now then.

390
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:07,845
Exactly, it is you who experience these phenomena with the holes in the wall and knocking. All the craziness that happens here.

391
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:15,999
Then we continue, we set off a motion detector.

392
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:23,191
This one sounds in case something goes in front of it. I put it against the couch here.

393
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:25,359
So if something goes by..

394
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:35,763
And then we start this one. The one that shows with red and green in case there is something.

395
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:46,713
Now we have with us those who live here. If there is anyone who wants to come in here and talk to us, there are lots of different types of tools here.

396
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:51,255
On the bed or on the table, or out on the kitchen table.

397
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:56,899
Is there anyone here with us now? Who wants to communicate.

398
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:03,927
Come now.

399
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:11,434
Come and show yourself to us now that we have everyone gathered. There is a lot of energy to take off here.

400
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:15,485
Can we hear a knock on the wall?

401
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:20,350
It doesn't want to.

402
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:30,000
I knocked a little on the wardrobe, then an instrument started. It was like, You can't do that, I'll do it.

403
00:41:35,266 --> 00:41:37,715
Can you do that?

404
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,137
When we were in one room, then we heard something in another room. And then we went to that room, then we heard from another room. It was like it was moving.

405
00:42:08,137 --> 00:42:12,575
But not very clear, we'll see if more happens now.

406
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:17,627
Shall we go into the bedroom Niclas, because you experience a lot there.

407
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:19,704
Yes, turn off the Pyramid.

408
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,515
Yes, it's mostly there.

409
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:24,148
I'm just going to shut down here.

410
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:29,030
Now we are here.

411
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,656
Right, now we're in here.

412
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:38,329
Can you knock on the wall? So we get to hear it.

413
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,803
In this wall.

414
00:42:48,218 --> 00:42:50,339
It was a thud out there.

415
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,172
Now it's there instead.

416
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:56,574
Do you recognize that sound? Is that what it usually sounds like?

417
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,800
Yes.

418
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,875
Small bang.

419
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:10,498
Yes, but sometimes it's higher.

420
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:15,930
Can you move this bed? You've moved it and made it shake.

421
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,598
Can you do something like that?

422
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:29,750
Can you come in and put that hand in front of this so it sounds like this..

423
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:36,431
Can you touch any of the things we have in here?

424
00:43:38,636 --> 00:43:42,324
Are there any children running around in here?

425
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:51,096
Who likes to fool around? Can you walk up to the bed and touch this iron stick sticking up?

426
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:57,858
Or is there something in the ground here?

427
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:04,580
Who wants to convey something. Can you touch these things then?

428
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:17,642
We caught this on camera, if that has anything to do with it? That, now we're filming, doesn't it want to be documented? We don't know.

429
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:24,776
If you are out there walking, can you walk up to the table there? Where some stuff flashes.

430
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:27,960
And if you touch it, you are nice.

431
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:38,238
Shall we try going out into the kitchen then? We'll leave it here.

432
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:40,648
I'll turn it on when we leave.

433
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:44,415
Then we go out into the kitchen and see if we can get through...

434
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,791
It was me.

435
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:48,097
He just walks past the instrument.

436
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:52,966
Tony!

437
00:44:52,966 --> 00:44:53,643
Yes?

438
00:44:53,643 --> 00:44:57,323
It starts here, it lights up! Come come!

439
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,911
I think we got it on surveillance.

440
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:03,240
Did the pyramid shine?

441
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,530
Both static and strap function worked.

442
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,031
Both?

443
00:45:08,031 --> 00:45:11,595
Just as we were walking out and I turned around, they started to glow.

444
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:14,995
Good, come with us out here then.

445
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,242
Then we go to the kitchen and we can talk to you there.

446
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:21,491
It is typical that it is after, that it is in the room where we leave.

447
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:22,378
Yes.

448
00:45:33,604 --> 00:45:39,231
You who have talked to us before, can you come in and talk to us again?

449
00:45:44,788 --> 00:45:47,072
Who are you?

450
00:45:50,903 --> 00:45:52,731
Tell us your name.

451
00:45:56,647 --> 00:45:57,792
Something you want to greet....

452
00:45:57,792 --> 00:45:58,775
"Remove"

453
00:45:58,775 --> 00:46:00,186
Did it say go away?

454
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:06,169
Something you want to greet?

455
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:08,083
Hello Hello!

456
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:10,676
Who are you?

457
00:46:11,081 --> 00:46:13,578
Do you know us?

458
00:46:17,449 --> 00:46:20,775
Why are you banging on the walls here?

459
00:46:20,775 --> 00:46:21,660
"Banks"

460
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,578
Banks.

461
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:29,176
It sounds like a child. I can't get it together.

462
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:33,537
What do you want?

463
00:46:45,914 --> 00:46:52,045
Now we want you to come in here and say your name loud and clear.

464
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,233
It sounded very far.

465
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:07,417
It sounded a bit like Tommy, but I don't know..

466
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:11,273
If it's Tommy here...

467
00:47:11,273 --> 00:47:14,426
say Yes in that case.

468
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:18,281
"Yeah"

469
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:25,998
Is there anything else here? Which has to do with this land.

470
00:47:29,104 --> 00:47:31,784
Say Yes if that is the case.

471
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:33,000
"Yes"

472
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,810
It's something else.

473
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:40,384
"Strong"

474
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:46,744
Are you buried under this house?

475
00:47:48,454 --> 00:47:52,500
Are your ashes under this house?

476
00:47:55,516 --> 00:47:58,586
Lennie, have you looked anything up about the place?

477
00:47:58,586 --> 00:48:05,406
Yes, I have found out that there is an old pilgrim trail outside here. Could it be true?

478
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:06,412
Yes, there is a trail.

479
00:48:06,412 --> 00:48:07,589
Is there a trail here?

480
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,525
Okay.

481
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,228
Is there anything else you have found out about the place?

482
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:21,346
No more than that there is a cemetery about one, one and a half kilometers from there.

483
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:22,583
That is also true.

484
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:27,298
It's out along the narrow road.

485
00:48:27,298 --> 00:48:37,498
Thanks Lennie, great. That's what we've been into now, we get this with ashes, bones, digs and now you asked if it's in the ground.

486
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:46,337
Then maybe we have a line to walk on, that it's not connected to you in this case, but it's something close here.

487
00:48:46,337 --> 00:48:50,232
But if there's something that's in the ground..

488
00:48:50,502 --> 00:48:54,605
that wants to be reminded that they're here...

489
00:48:54,605 --> 00:48:58,530
can you touch something in here?

490
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:11,545
Did you bring any item in this building here?

491
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:28,151
So hard, we can't quite figure out what it is. It's been going on for a while and we have some theories but...

492
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:32,251
we don't get a response that it is so.

493
00:49:32,566 --> 00:49:34,261
Nothing.

494
00:49:34,576 --> 00:49:47,103
We're going to take Wilma in. She has no idea what has happened here tonight. So we'll see what she comes up with, if she comes up with anything more.

495
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:53,227
And possibly can remove what is here.

496
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,438
Hello! Wilma.

497
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:06,200
Arne.

498
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,092
Nice.

499
00:50:07,092 --> 00:50:08,143
Eve.

500
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:11,910
Nice. Exciting.

501
00:50:13,035 --> 00:50:24,315
Welcome here Wilma. We've been around a bit here and we think it's your turn to feel in. And see what you get.

502
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:31,881
I only have one meter with me, so if we get something going on, I'll measure the EMF.

503
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:36,780
But you have to do the work here and see what you get.

504
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,516
How exiting.

505
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:49,155
Let's see. I want to start by walking right into this common room, it seems.

506
00:50:55,762 --> 00:51:04,808
I actually get a first contact here. And then I see the figure of an elderly gentleman sitting in that armchair.

507
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:14,033
He sits exactly as the armchair is directed, so he sits and stares straight into the TV like this.

508
00:51:14,033 --> 00:51:21,843
He is here to keep tabs and wants to be close to you. So I connect it to the fact that it is a relative.

509
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:28,902
He wants to be in control and he sits here and just wants things to be calm and well for you.

510
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:38,632
And he has quite a clear energy and he shows that he has tried to contact you by affecting the electronics.

511
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:43,823
That he has turned on the TV or raised the volume and the like.

512
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:47,108
And turns on the TV at night..

513
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:57,600
I'll try to see which way he... I'll move a little this way. I'm going to feel what kind of relative this could be.

514
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,510
I get a name in, it doesn't have to be this name, it can be similar.

515
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:18,241
And I hear Arne... it could be that the letters A and R are in the name. But it's Arne anyway. And he feels a little older, about 80 years old, as he appears.

516
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:26,021
And I connect him a lot to you, that it is you that he simply belongs to, that it is you that he wants to be close to.

517
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:37,408
But he is a good energy. He says that he knows that you know about him, that you have felt his energy here.

518
00:52:37,408 --> 00:52:45,746
And especially right here on the sofa. For example, if you've been here alone on the couch, you've felt that you're not really alone.

519
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:53,989
And it's not meant to scare, he says, but he just wants to show his presence. Out of pure love.

520
00:52:53,989 --> 00:53:02,370
But what you can do then, what I do with relatives and those who are friendly and are only here out of love, is that he tones them down a little.

521
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:07,344
But I don't remove them completely if they are family ties.

522
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:21,306
I think I want to move on a bit first, then we'll go back here in case he wants to show me something else.

523
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:25,218
Then I want to come in here.

524
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:51,858
Here I get a woman in quite quickly. And this woman belongs to you. She shows like she's standing against the wardrobe like that and folding and folding the sheets. It must be nice and it is so important to her.

525
00:53:51,858 --> 00:54:07,591
That it should be washed clean and be nice and so on. She has been with you and she kind of stays here, precisely because when she was alive it was important for her to sew up curtains and, as I said, fold the sheets.

526
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:09,235
That's my mother-in-law then.

527
00:54:09,235 --> 00:54:23,362
I was just going to say something about mother, along those lines. It's guaranteed to be your mother-in-law, I'll see if I can get a name. So we'll see if we can confirm that as well.

528
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:33,320
I still get the word Mother, so like it's Lillemor or...

529
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,024
No, I'll probably stick with Lillemor, it feels like that.

530
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:37,661
Lillemor.

531
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:38,656
It's Lillemor.

532
00:54:38,656 --> 00:54:40,629
No, it isn't.

533
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:56,975
I'm getting that name in, but I'm still linking it to possibly being the mother-in-law. Because I feel that she is here now and she wants to be close to you very much.

534
00:54:56,975 --> 00:54:59,371
And she shows a connection to you.

535
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,332
And as I said she organizes a lot here and she also just wants to be in control.

536
00:55:04,737 --> 00:55:11,803
And this particular woman and that man out there, they don't know about each other. Because they are on different frequencies.

537
00:55:11,803 --> 00:55:15,337
So they don't sense each other's energy.

538
00:55:15,922 --> 00:55:21,674
Now I feel drawn to the kitchen. So I think we're going there.

539
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:31,691
When I come into the kitchen, it's like a small, compact energy runs between my feet. Like a dog or cat.

540
00:55:31,691 --> 00:55:46,686
Running and ironing and walking in between. Very curious and social. And I feel the typical animal energy that we mediums can feel, that we feel the difference between animal or human, the energy.

541
00:55:46,686 --> 00:56:00,370
Very happy. Dog or cat, I can't actually see or feel what kind of animal it is. But a very happy animal, likes to jump on the chairs.

542
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:09,116
And this animal has a connection to the two of you together, if you may have previously had an animal that passed away or had to be removed.

543
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,343
It's been many years since that.

544
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:15,900
Where do I want to enter? Have we been in here? We don't have that do we?

545
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,273
No.

546
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,189
It felt exciting in here.

547
00:56:24,789 --> 00:56:32,240
There are very clear energies in here, there are several that I get in here.

548
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:41,807
First I get a man in and he smells a bit of booze, like he had a bit of an alcohol problem and was a bit aggressive.

549
00:56:41,807 --> 00:56:49,109
And his energy also manifests itself so that he falls in and is such that I shall be seen and I shall be heard.

550
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:51,414
He makes a lot of noise here.

551
00:56:51,414 --> 00:56:54,291
I think that's right about your brother.

552
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:57,984
He drinks a lot, he's practically an alcoholic.

553
00:56:57,984 --> 00:56:59,728
He was rowdy.

554
00:56:59,728 --> 00:57:02,710
Very rowdy when he drinks.

555
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:14,181
But this man who boots in like that, I'm having a little trouble deciphering what kind of connection he has with you.

556
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:20,000
But what I do know is that he is not unknown, but he has a connection with one of you.

557
00:57:22,701 --> 00:57:35,949
And he is here simply because he needs help to be brought over to the light. He thinks he did a lot of wrong while he was alive and he's afraid that when he crosses over, he'll end up in hell.

558
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:43,814
Therefore, he does not dare to go over. So he wants to ask for forgiveness and wants help to be brought to the light.

559
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:54,378
It reminds me of, this thing with the booze, he was practically an alcoholic.

560
00:57:54,378 --> 00:57:55,851
Is that your dad?

561
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:56,644
Brother.

562
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:58,087
Brother. Okay.

563
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:05,356
And he was quite messy.

564
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:19,561
But I try to tone him down. Since it's a relative, I won't remove it completely, but it will be very peaceful when he disappears.

565
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:28,760
And I do it all at once now. So that we can continue in the rest of the house, otherwise he will disturb all the time.

566
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,040
I'll see if he has any last message to say.

567
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:52,989
The last message is for you then. It's that you have to think about your posture, not just for back problems, but you have to show that you're a man, you can do this. You must be straight.

568
00:58:52,989 --> 00:59:03,520
He says that you shouldn't be a coward and go like this, but now you have to show that you are the man here. That you take over after me now, he says.

569
00:59:04,195 --> 00:59:08,189
So that is his message to you.

570
00:59:10,844 --> 00:59:13,762
Are you okay with me toning him down a bit?

571
00:59:13,762 --> 00:59:14,645
Yes.

572
00:59:14,645 --> 00:59:21,983
That's good. Then I'll bring some light and angels in here.

573
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:45,894
There. I saw him walk away and I showed the light and explained that there is no hell but he will get help on the other side. And get the love that he needs.

574
00:59:45,894 --> 01:00:00,568
He has also gotten his message across and shown that he is simply the one who has been here. So hopefully it will be much calmer, precisely the passive and intense energy.

575
01:00:01,738 --> 01:00:17,642
I actually felt the scrub there, I feel an energy that is hiding. As soon as I arrive, it's like the energy is behind something.

576
01:00:17,642 --> 01:00:20,878
Who is a bit shy.

577
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:35,984
It's a little boy that I bring in, who is about this tall. Very mischievous. And as soon as a media person comes in here, because he feels that I can communicate, then he starts and pranks.

578
01:00:35,984 --> 01:00:49,311
So that's why he's hiding and running around here. And this boy is a little lost, because he's looking for his parents. He hasn't quite transitioned to the light.

579
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:56,389
I need to make them face each other, so he is led into the light.

580
01:00:56,389 --> 01:01:07,442
He has been running here a lot on weekdays, back and forth. I hear in my head that you have heard little runs like this.

581
01:01:07,442 --> 01:01:15,758
And he likes to rearrange the shelves and knock things over and it's because he's being naughty.

582
01:01:15,758 --> 01:01:27,833
When I ask how he died, I smell fire smoke. It could have been that he has burned inside or that he has been burned in some way.

583
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:35,722
Because I feel a lot of fire smoke around him and then he shows burns on his body.

584
01:01:37,747 --> 01:01:52,916
I took away there, then we had the energy here too which I will try to tone down. So now I'm really just going to walk around where we've been.

585
01:01:57,822 --> 01:02:05,995
Our expectations of the house in Säffle were great. After everything the family has told, documented and experienced.

586
01:02:05,995 --> 01:02:15,387
What if we were to witness a powerful poltergeist phenomenon for the first time? Which even had the power to punch holes in walls.

587
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:25,624
It was interesting to see how the medium Wilma worked. She found a lot that matched Arne's brother Tommy, who tragically died in a fire.

588
01:02:25,624 --> 01:02:32,410
It will be interesting to see if things have calmed down after Wilma has helped the energies over to the other side.

589
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:42,747
But the question is, has it become completely calm? Or if the forces that remain in the house that cause the phenomena, seem to have crossed over to the other side.

590
01:02:42,747 --> 01:02:49,776
Or lies dormant to come back with full force.
