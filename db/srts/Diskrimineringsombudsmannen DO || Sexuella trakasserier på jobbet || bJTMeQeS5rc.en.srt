1
00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.751
Et VoilÃ¡

2
00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:09.125
Multo Bene

3
00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.250
Where would the key lie down now again

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.792
You can put it in the blue cup, on the cabinet.

5
00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.042
Yes

6
00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:20.626
But you

7
00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:22.292
 Really good job today.

8
00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:26.709
You were a star at the coffee machine.

9
00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:30.209
Not many people can make such good milk foam art, the first day.

10
00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:31.167
Really good.

11
00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:36.459
But so, I will dream about cappuccinos and lanttish all night.

12
00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:41.250
Then maybe i will show up in your dream as your good looking supervisor

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.209
You never know.

14
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:45.667
No, you never know.

15
00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:53.250
I really hope for many more passports before the exam weeks start.

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.042
I really need the money

17
00:00:55.751 --> 00:01:01.250
 So I thought if you could put a good word for me to Marianne?

18
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.584
Of course I can do it.
 We are a good team, or how

19
00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:16.751
I really also feel that it is a tiring job.

20
00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:20.751
I will be stiff like a stick tomorrow.

21
00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:34.167
Yes ... you are really stiff.

22
00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:41.292
You, if you try to relax a little in your shoulders.

23
00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:44.167
No, I'm a little Wierd actually.

24
00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:47.000
I don't like massage so much.

25
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.417
But then you have not met the right one.

26
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.792
You

27
00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.999
 I know someone who would like a massage.

28
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:04.292
No.

29
00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:07.542
How was it now again, did you want more passports

30
00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:17.334
Hi, it's Henrik.

31
00:02:18.584 --> 00:02:20.667
Hi Marianne

32
00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.083
Yes, it has been great.

33
00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:29.375
She really is a star.

34
00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:35.626
You, could you put her in on more passports next week

35
00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.959
Yes I think so.

36
00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:44.792
But it will be good

37
00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:46.667
 perfect.

38
00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.417
We'll do that

39
00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:50.042
Hello.

40
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:55.209
You

41
00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.959
 I must go now.

42
00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.959
After the coffee machine, you can take the disk as well.

43
00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:03.584
So we will talk more about this next week.

44
00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:06.375
Don't forget to alert.
