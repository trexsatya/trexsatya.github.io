00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,080
My best tip for reading long texts
goes like this.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,080
First read the headline
and look at the pictures-

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,040
-to get an idea
of what the text is about.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,600
Then read each paragraph carefully
to access the details.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
After that, you write a summary
of what the text is about.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,160
It's important that you write
the summary in your own words-

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,360
-and don't look at the text
while writing it.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Don't just read a text.
Make sure you really understand it.
