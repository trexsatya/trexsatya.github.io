My best tip when it comes to reading long texts is like this:

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,040
Read the headline and check out the pictures, to see what the text is about.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,560
Then read each paragraph carefully, so that you perceive the details.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,800
After that, you write a summary of the text.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,960
You should use your own words and not check the text while writing.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Not only content yourself with reading through a text.
 Make sure you understand it.
