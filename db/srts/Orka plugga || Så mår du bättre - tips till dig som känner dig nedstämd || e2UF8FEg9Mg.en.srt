1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,800
Going to school can be demanding.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,920
They expect you to be focused in class, 
to memorise homework and exams.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,680
At the same time, you have to interact 
with classmates and teachers.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,800
If your head is spinning 
with negative thoughts and feelings-

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,640
-it's hard to focus 
on what your teachers are saying.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's normal to feel low sometimes 
and to feel that everything is wrong.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,480
But if your negative thoughts take over 
or refuse to go away-

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,760
-you may need help and support 
getting to the root of the problem.

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,840
A lot of people feel sad or low at times. 
These last few years, I've noticed...

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,200
...that staying at home, not going 
to school, can make matters worse.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,400
Sometimes it's better to be in school 
and be a bit passive - that's okay.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,520
You don't have to deliver 
and perform well every single day.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,720
Sometimes it's okay to just show up at 
school and be a part of the community.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,960
I've seen a lot of students 
benefit from this.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,440
There are no set rules that say 
how you have to interact socially-

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,280
-or that you have to bring 
a lot of energy to the group.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,120
Sometimes you're sad, 
sometimes you're in a bad mood-

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,480
-sometimes you're happy, 
sometimes you're angry.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,680
All feelings and emotions are okay. 
Come to school as you are.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,120
Talk about how you're feeling

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,400
I think that when your worries 
almost become overwhelming-

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,680
-and take over your life 
and drain you of energy-

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,680
-and prevent you from doing activities 
you enjoy, and you feel kind of listless-

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,400
-that's a sign that maybe 
you should go and talk to someone.

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,320
But I'd like to stress:

26
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,320
Talk to an adult. About little things, 
about big things - doesn't matter.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,800
You shouldn't be afraid of putting 
your feelings and emotions into words.

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,840
And if that's the case, 
that you need some help...

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you find it scary to put them into words 
and get that process started-

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,160
-that's probably a sign 
that you need to talk to an adult.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,360
You probably need support 
moving forward.

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,840
Confidentiality

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,760
You should know 
that school counsellors-

34
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,720
-are bound 
by professional confidentiality.

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,560
This means that whatever you tell me 
is confidential. It goes no further.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,560
Unless you're in some kind of danger. 
Then I have to take the matter further.

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,920
Maybe talk to your parents or to 
the authorities so that they can help you.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,280
This doesn't necessarily mean 
that you're initiating a huge process-

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,160
-just because you talk to your counsellor 
about how you're feeling.

40
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,880
With some students, I have maybe 
3-4 sessions and a follow-up meeting.

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
Three tips to help you feel better

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,800
Here are some tips for those of you who 
aren't feeling 100 per cent right now.

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,440
1. This is pretty normal.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,400
Sometimes, you feel low. 
But it will get better.

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,320
2. Exercise. Give it a try, at least!

46
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,080
Exercise, diet and sleep - start there.

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,960
These three things will have an effect 
on how your brain works, too.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,880
And, of course: Ask an adult for help. 
And your friends, too.

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,320
If you're worried about yourself 
or someone else-

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,200
-you should put these feelings into words.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,240
Sometimes, the first step to feeling better 
is to talk about your feelings.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,040
You can always 
turn to an adult at school-

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,720
-and there are 
lots of organisations that you can turn to.
