1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,800
Going to school can be demanding.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,760
You are expected to concentrate on lessons, remember homework and samples.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,360
At the same time as you should relate to classmates and teachers.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,840
Is the head at the same time full of hard thoughts and emotion-

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
-In it difficult to focus on what your teachers say.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,000
Feeling worse in periods and feeling that everything is wrong is perfectly normal.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,400
But if what feels hard takes over too much or holding in

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,480
-An longer you may need support in sorting out what weighs one.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,680
Many people feel bad in periods.
 What I have noticed in recent years-

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,720
-Is that many students feel even worse about staying at home.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,840
Not to go to school.
 Sometimes it is better to be in school.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,800
Be a little passive and leave it.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,240
You do not always have to deliver and perform at a high level.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,600
But sometimes it goes a long way to just come to school-

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,000
-and join the community.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,240
I think that I have seen many students who still feel good about.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,640
There are no requirements on you how you have to be social-

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,960
-or that you have to come up with a lot of energies.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Sometimes but sad, sometimes you are a little angry, sometimes you are happy-

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,560
-Int is you angry ... all emotions are totally okay to feel.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,720
Come to school as you are.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,480
I think that when the pondering becomes so tangible for one-

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,000
-That it takes over a little too much, so you don't get energy-

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,840
â€” maybe do other activities, or that you get a little powerless-

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,520
-Then I think it's a sign that it's time to go and talk to someone.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,080
But again, I would really like to say: come and talk to adults.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,360
About big and small.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,680
One should probably never be afraid to put words into how to feel-

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,360
-And how to do it.
 Is it that ...

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,200
... that you need help.
 If one is a little afraid to put word-

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,480
-and start processes, so maybe it is still a sign on-

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,480
-That you need to talk to an adult.

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
Then you may need support in moving on.

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,360
An important thing to know if one comes to a curator-

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,760
-This is that we have a professional ethical duty of confidentiality.

36
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,840
That means what you tell me it will stay with me.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,720
Unless you are in any kind of danger.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,840
Then I have to take it further.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,240
Maybe to parents or other instances that you need help from.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Then it does not always have to be so that you end up in a large process-

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
-As because you come to a school curator and talk about how you feel.

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,720
I meet many students where we may have three to four calls-

43
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,720
-And maybe we have some follow -up a little later.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,080
Some quick tips for those who might not be on top right now-

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,000
-This is that - number one: I think it's pretty normal.

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,440
You feel bad for periods.
 You will feel better!

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,280
Number two: Exercise.
 Try anyway.

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,000
All these things like exercise, diet, sleep - start there!

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,040
Because it will affect how the brain works as well.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,080
And of course: Take the help of adults around and their peers.

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,360
Are you worried about yourself or for any other-

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,240
-Is it important to put words into it.
 A first step toward feeling better-

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,320
-As to talk about how to do it.

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,080
You can always contact an adult at your school-

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,840
-But there are also many organizations that you can turn to.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
