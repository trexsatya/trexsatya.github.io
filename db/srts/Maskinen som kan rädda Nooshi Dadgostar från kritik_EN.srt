1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,280
What would Hamas have to do to make nooshi mildly condemn terror

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,240
Without getting internal criticism?

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,400
To answer that, I have taken the help of this old can.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,520
It is a left critic calculator it works canon.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,200
I am entering data over Hama's terrorist act

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,520
And so it calculates if Nooshi can condemn it without internal criticism.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,640
It's a bit complicated, but this is an old faithful.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,320
It has been with Lars Werner's time. It still smells of wine.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,200
You don't have to applaud your computer. It has no feelings. Applaud me.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,960
We start with this weekend's deed:

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,440
"The worst day of Jewish slaughter since World War II."

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,120
And then I press the "Nooshi condemns" button.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,400
Then it is internal criticism. It wasn't terror enough. Then it still works.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,560
We try something stronger. I find some evil Hamas can do.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,120
We feed in: "Hamas carries out the Holocaust 2.0."

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,040
And then I press the "Nooshi condemns" button.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,000
There was criticism again. Unbelievable. It must be even more serious.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,640
Now we release all the barriers.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,800
I have to come up with something really damn sick that Hamas can do. Oh, fuck.

20
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,880
"Hamas for free rental in new production."

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
And then we press the button. No criticism!

22
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
The whole party supports it!

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,880
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,240
In addition, the calculator says that Björn Alling pronounces:

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
“Bad double standards and populism of hamas”

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,960
"Licking marketing. Freeze the assistance in Palestine - now."

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,080
An incredible machine. Those are no longer done.
