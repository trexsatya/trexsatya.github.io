1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,180
To receive the alumni of the year at Halmstad University -

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06.920
- In fact, it is very much for me.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,600
I have a very long history here at college.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,120
Without ever being employed, I have -

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,420
- At all, had a connection to the university throughout my professional life.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,000
To be able to become the alumni of the year I think is

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,000
Very honorable.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,420
In addition to my education, one of the most important things I -

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,140
–Har brought me from college -

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,740
- The network all around.

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,720
I was very active in Halmstadspexet, in Småland's Nation -

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,020
–In the development and a lot of association life and it -

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,620
- networks I got with me from there has actually been -

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42.640
- More worth sometimes than what the education itself was.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,760
Halmstad University has helped me very much with reaching -

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,660
- I am today.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,940
From the beginning I got an incredible amount of help.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,580
Once we had gone out and left the student life, it started -

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,180
- I and a classmate company and then we - got

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,340
- Help in what was then called the Innovation Group.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,280
Had I not received that help and get started with the company so -

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,140
- I hadn't been where I'm today.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05.640
It made us -

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08.660
—There in the campus area for another five years when we -

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,140
- Drive the company, sat on the Technocenter -

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,660
–And had an incredible network of other entrepreneurs who all came from -

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,980
- High School in Halmstad from the beginning.

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,340
I still have that network with me today and -

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,860
Had a lot of benefit.

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,620
The university characterizes a lot -

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,620
- Both Halmstad and Halland and -

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,460
Therefore, it is important to keep ties to the university -

33
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,100
—Tore, it is from here much of the development and -

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,360
- The innovation in Halland comes.

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35.540
With my role in the region -

36
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,240
–As as an innovation strategist where I work with regional -

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,340
Development, after all, the University of Halmstad is an essential part -

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,020
- For the development that is taking place in Halland.

39
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,040
I think everyone who goes out of Halmstad University -

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,080
- Has something in the luggage that is very valuable.

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,740
I think-

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,160
—The value of studying at a college such as -

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00.240
—Halmstad that is a little smaller than many of the others -

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,620
–But that has a completely different network than what the big-

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,700
- The colleges and universities have.

46
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09.940
Maintain that network and bring it out into the professional life.

47
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,780
Use that network even when

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,580
you come out into the professional life

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,080
So you have a lot to gain from it.
