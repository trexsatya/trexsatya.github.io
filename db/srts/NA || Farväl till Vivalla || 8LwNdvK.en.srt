1
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.080
Is it okay if I take this one too?

2
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.080
The house is not sold easier because you put houseplants there.

3
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.480
The overall impression is crucial.

4
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.000
- Maybe you would meet them in town?
 - Don't you think my house is fine?

5
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.120
Sometimes the language is not enough ...

6
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.160
- Don't you like my tropical theme?
 - I as a buyer ...

7
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.240
... would be a bit skeptical of the sandy beach in the recreation room.

8
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:40.200
But imagine that a cold winter's day just have to throw yourself on the beach ...

9
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.200
It's not a beach, it's a wheelbarrow.

10
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:57.680
I don't understand that you want to move.
 Isn't it just a whim?

11
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.440
I have been trying to sell the house for three months.
 I love Jerker!

12
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.840
- I thought his name was Pontus?
 -Yes exactly...

13
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.280
Pontus and I love each other and want to live together.

14
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.840
- You have not known each other for so long.
 - You know how it is ...

15
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.920
You have made your mistakes, you have been looking and so he just stands there!

16
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.920
So it is with love - you know when you have met right.

17
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.000
C. Head talk - Hoho!
 –And when you have hit the wrong ...

18
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.040
C. Head talk guess who has fixed tickets C. Head Tapersill TV puck on Sunday?

19
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.440
They handed them out at Consum.
 It was only he who wanted.

20
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.600
C. Head Tapersv - Puck is the grain field C. Head talk of tomorrow's Three Kronor is growing.

21
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.320
- How many tickets did you take?
 C. Head talkative - 160.

22
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.800
C. Head Tapers - Sara and Pontus may be included.

23
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.920
C. Head talk would you have done if you saw the C. Head talk man with an attachment in your hand?

24
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:32.720
- It was a flower bouquet.
 C. Head Tapers - I sent a get -on -you -card!

25
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.600
- Sara, there are some outside your house.
 - The show does not start until four ...

26
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.000
I'll take this one too.

27
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.800
Can I take max instead?
 People have confidence in single mothers.

28
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.800
- take max.
 - No, mom, I don't want to!

29
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.320
C. Head talk if they want to buy tickets for the TV puck!

30
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.320
- How many have looked at the house now?
 - A 20th century.
 It will never be sold.

31
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.320
She should be happy for the C. Head talk.
 C. Head Taper What does she have in Stockholm?

32
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.160
- She wants to the man she loves.
 C. Head talk - he lives in Stockholm ...

33
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.200
Dad thinks that Stockholmers are parasites that suck out the country.

34
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.960
C. Head talk - it's facts.
 -What are you talking about?

35
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:49.840
About Sälen –87 when a Stockholmer passed by in the lift queue.

36
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.400
C. Head talkTareal not about it.
 C. Head talkative hair, screamed and high.

37
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.520
He would save an aunt from the lift and you refused to move.

38
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.880
C. Head Tapers I stood first!

39
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:15.880
It is good for Sara to move.
 You only fall in love once.

40
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.880
- They loved Max, but hated the house.
 - Did you not sell Max?

41
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.720
It's hopeless!
 What am I doing wrong?

42
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.720
C. Head Tapraredu must find some C. Head talk like your decor.

43
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.760
Don't they have blinded a national association?

44
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.200
When you at least expect it, the right buyer shows up.

45
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.120
C. Head talk we bought this house C. Head talk it has been for sale for a year.

46
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.880
C. Head talkative - no one had seen the possibilities.
 - But everyone had seen the house goat.

47
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:08.880
C. Head Tapersån there pedantry!
 C. Head talkative house you buy with the heart!

48
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.880
Then there is certainly some idiot who wants yours too, Sara.

49
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.880
C. Head talk, I'm not interested.

50
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.640
- How to do with the TV puck?
 - It's your turn to find something.

51
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.640
- What do you think about scarlet fever?
 - I had it on the corp final.

52
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.280
- You then, Lina?
 - I am going out with Linda in the evening.

53
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.640
In the worst case, I may well give him a glass of caustic soda in the evening.

54
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.960
- It stands a car outside Sara's house.
 - Imagine if she is selling!

55
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.440
- Sara must not move!
 - No, it will be strange.

56
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.440
Imagine, when I would have Max, Sara drove me to BB.

57
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:25.440
- Where was Dad?
 - It was the last part of Macahan.

58
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:33.120
It seems that Sara is selling the house!
 - Where are you going?

59
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.520
C. Head talk - did we not have champagne?
 - The car has been there for a long time.

60
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:49.600
C. Head talk if anyone would be interested in C. Head talk, she will not dare to complete.

61
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:57.560
- I think it's serious now.
 C. Head talk - As with that sea officer ...

62
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.640
The C. Head talk was only the sea that applied.
 C. Head Tapershon would sail around the world.

63
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.400
C. Head talk - What happened?
 - He drowned.

64
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.040
C. The head talk may be a bad example ...

65

C. Head Praiseal Sara's plans end with C. Head talk everything returns to the ordinary.

66
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:29.240

67
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.240
- They were there for a long time.
 - But he saw nothing.

68
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:44.200
He stumbled upon my Kongas and was fainted for twenty minutes.

69
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:51.360
-How did it go?
 - It became a notch in the bar counter.

70
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:59.360
- It's more outside the house.
 - Well, now I'm shit in this.

71
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:06.320
- You have to open to them.
 - I take a cup of coffee instead.

72
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.760

79
00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.120
- Should we take Staffan Staldräng?

 It is enough.

80
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:12.000
- Come again, Sara!
 - The ad has been out for 3 months.

81
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.640

82
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:24.040
Sold: Patricier villa with turn of the century ... Charm?

83
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.480
I thought you lived in a 1972 townhouse?

84
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.880
One must capture people's interest.

85
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:42.400
"Modern sports facility" - it's the ping pong table in the garage?

86
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:49.040
You must have a broker to help you.
 I feel a good one.

87
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:58.120
Gustav, give me the phone book.
 - Ralf Zachrisson, he is called.

C. Head talk - I sold Sara's house.
 - But you would just open the door.

91

C. HOVA PATERUE they want to sign a contract.
 C. HOVEPRATARARE is waiting in the kitchen.

Gustav!
 There are many different perceptions about you ...

93
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.600
... and many wonder what you are going for.

94
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:43.640
But for me you will always be ...

95
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.640

I understand what Max means.
 She has been a good friend.

105
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.240
Now it is over.

106
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:55.920
C. Head Tapersoke, VID, is facing a sad C. Head talkative fact, but so is earthly life.

107
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.320
C. Head Tableman does not know where even trains are going.

110
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:22.920
C. Head talkative life cannot be stopped.

C. Head talk - for the time that has been and ensure C. Head Tapers get again all borrowed gadgets.

112
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.400

113
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:42.680
C. Head talkatives - houses are too tight!

- I am going to Sara and help her.
 -Me too.
 Soon she's gone.

115

C. Head talkative arose was finished!

121
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:34.720
Maybe you should try it when you sell Posten's Christmas stamps next time.

122
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.680
C. Head talkative day when your father does not exist -

127
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:11.640
That's the fault, you can't talk to your dad about everything.

128
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:27.720

135
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:26.160
C. HUMANTPRATAREDEN WAS IT!

Strange that no one else had problems.

140
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:07.280
C. Head talk - if it works with Jerker, yes.

- You have never been to Stockholm.
 C. Head talk - JO!

145
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:36.280
A petrol stop in Södertälje is not counted.

146

C. The head talkative was enough!
 C. Head talkative self could feel the mood.

Greet them that Gustav and I can show them around town.

171
00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:05.120
C. Head talkative self wants to take a look at them first.
 C. Head talkative self protects the safety of the family.

172
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:12.040

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.640
Look!

174
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:26.520
How nice!
 There is something ... "Congratulations Peter 42 years".

175
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.960
Jen's father - he was celebrating years yesterday and they are allergic to marzipan.

176
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:42.320
C. Head talk - and the 150 kronor?
 - I thank you for.

177
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.840
I have prepared something for you.

178
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.800
I hope the sentence goes ahead.

179
00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:05.280
The grief tears life out of our body, abyss from Hades is heard.

180
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:12.560
Crushed is all hope.
 The stench from an open grave ...

181
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.600
No, what is this?
 I must have got the wrong book.

182
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.040
You think it's boring to move?

183
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:31.320
Yes, I want to thank you for making me feel like one in the family.

184
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.000
C. Head PrecateSara ...

185
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:42.480
C. Head PrecateSara ... C. Head Tapersvi has had our controversy ...

186
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:49.520
C. Head Tapers ... and you have not always C. Head Tapers' Moths notify my expectations ...

187
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:55.800
C. Head talkative way what you want, Sara, C. Head talkature you ... live closely.

188
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.640
It's not Vivalla I will miss, it's you.

189
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:13.000
The house has almost felt like my own.
 I have had my own place on the couch -

190
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:19.280
- And taken what I want in the fridge.
 If I have had a crisis with money -

191
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:26.200
- I have been able to remove the household cash register.
 I've had my own key.

192
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:33.320
- It's because we trust you.
 C. Head talkative - and completely lacks judgment.

193
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:39.320
Sara, can you accompany me and Max into the kitchen?

194
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.080
- Don't we keep up?
 -No.

195
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.640
Do you know what they have found?

196
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:56.680
C. Head talk, among others, the children have things on the heart C. Head talk as we should not know ...

197
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.680
C.Sangi am sailing, I am sailing ...

198
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.440
But, Gustav!
 - Hey sweetie.
 Did you sleep well?

199
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:26.440
The fact that Sara has moved is probably the most boring thing I have been through.

200
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:32.360
Have you forgotten when Dad showed us around at his job?

201
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:39.560
- She's probably arrived in Stockholm now.
 C. Head talk - not even the TV puck attracts.

202
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:45.520
Just that ... Max seems to have got back his mumps.

203
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:53.520
C. Head talk for the fourth time?
 He had the C. Head Practicator Post Choir would sing.

204
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.640
Now Sara will probably call soon.

205
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:04.600
- Sara?
 Shouldn't you be in Stockholm?
 - I ignore it.

206
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:10.000
I lay awake tonight and thought: Why am I doing this?

207
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:16.440
Why can't Pontus and I live here in Vivalla instead?

208
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.520
When Göran and Annika began to carry in their stuff-

209
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.920
- I didn't show why I would move.

210
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.920
C. Head talk, Sara ...

211
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:42.480
C. Head talk dream goes, but deep down C. Head talk to the old Vivalla.

212
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:50.480
We know C. Head talk.
 We know when the C. Head talk shops close and the buses go.

213
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:59.640
Thanks, Gustav!
 I found out why I had to move.

214
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:07.720
C. Head talk - What did I say?
 - See the positive in this:

215
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:14.400
No Sara who rushes in and will tell you anything or show anything.

216
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:21.040
Come here!
 Here in the bowl, spare keys are home to me.

217
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.280
Gustav usually lies here on the sofa.

218
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:37.160
In this jar there is their reserve box.
 Borrow what you need!

219
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.360
Lena works at a bank.

220
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:53.080
Keys also ... These keys go to the kitchen door.

221
00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.600
- When they come home?
 - They were behind the kitchen door.

222
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.600
