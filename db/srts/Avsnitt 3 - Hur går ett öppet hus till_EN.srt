00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,300
Today I will go to an open house.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Nobody else. I am here myself and should be a bit of a reporter and go around and ask a little about school.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Hang on!

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,900
There we have the school.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now I'm at school. Here is the entrance. So now I'm going to go in and get some knowledge about open house.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Knack, knock, knock.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,300
Hi Aliyah, welcome to our open house. Hi thank you so much. Fun to be here.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Here is a small suspension surface, where the students hang. And here we have lots of classrooms. A little student work here.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,900
We have the picture room here. Then we have our big media center in here.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,900
This classroom can be almost anything. It's huge.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,700
Then it is this corridor where we have everything that our students need.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,500
Why do you think you should go to an open house?

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,500
I think it is great to come to an open house where you get to meet students and teachers,

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,200
And feel the environment here in school.

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,500
What is it you can do at an open house?

16
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:16,000
You get to talk to us ambassadors, you get to see how the school is and experience a whole new world.

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,800
Now they will show me around a bit in the media center. Exciting!

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here we usually have our movie and photo lessons. We have lamps, flashes.

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,300
Here we have our editing room. This is our hall, for us movie and photo students.

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,550
Why do you think you should go to an open house?

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,450
I think you should go to an open house to get to school, see how the premises look

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,350
And ask questions to teachers and students to find the right school.

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,900
What can you do at an open house?

24
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:58,200
You can see what the schools look like, talk to teachers and students, and know how the education goes to make the right choice.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,200
I recommend everyone to go several open houses before you make your high school choice.

26
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,300
It is much easier to get a real picture of the school in place.

27
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:15,200
Right now, several schools also have digital variants if you do not have the opportunity to visit the school physically.

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,200
Another step closer to high school!
