1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,600
God, what a fail!

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,450
It's just sunny outside.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,160
Give it to me! Give them to me!

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,673
The mood went...

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,115
Alma is a little afraid of trains.
You have to respect that.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,160
It says Uaua. (Laura)

7
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:34,000
It says Uaua. (Laura)

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,160
- Does it say Laura?
- Yes.

9
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:39,800
- Let's see.
- Show it to mommy.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,240
- No, it says Alma.
- It says Uaua!

11
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,400
Yes, okay.

12
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:50,920
She really wants this pink stamp
to be her stamp.

13
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,880
Uaua!

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,880
We are currently trying out a new camera.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,494
Yes.

16
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,400
- A new camera.
- A new camera. Yes.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,400
So if the image or audio is a little different,
then you know why.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,650
This is what it looks like, the new camera.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,280
It's so small.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,587
And it's almost Christmas, you know,
so I'm wearing this.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,880
- Hello.
- Hello! What are you doing?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,120
I'm playing with my toys.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,640
- We're testing out the new camera.
- Mhm.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,600
- It's small, huh?
- Mhm.

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,829
How are you?

26
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:47,401
Good.

27
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,560
You almost seem a little sad.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,080
Nah.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,080
- Are you sure?
- Mhm.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,720
Could it be that you're a little angry
because you couldn't sit with the screen anymore?

31
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,226
A little.

32
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,240
Harry was playing Roblox
and then the screen time ran out.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,400
And yeah, the mood went...

34
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,320
We are quite used to it
and I think many families are.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,080
- What? Used to screen sickness?
- Yes. That kids get sad when you say no more screens.

36
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:30,480
Yes. Completely skewed dopamine levels.
I think that's very common.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,035
- I think we should try to get out of the house.
- Yes.

38
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:41,276
- Mommy, give me the pacifier today!
- No.

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,400
- What are you yelling about, Laura?
- Uaua have the pacifier today!

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,800
No, there will be no pacifier today.
We are taking the pacifier fight.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,800
NO, NOT THAT, MOMMY!
Uaua have the pacifier!

42
00:02:55,917 --> 00:03:01,818
- No, no pacifier. Only when you're going to sleep.
- No! I don't want to sleep with it!

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,685
No.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Wrong way.
Yes! Okay, good.

45
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,656
It's green!

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
- Come, come, come!
- Otherwise, the doors will close.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,160
NO, MY TURN THERE!

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,560
Alma is a little afraid of trains. You have to respect that.
She wanted you to get on quickly.

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,240
I was so scared.
Can't you help me?

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,880
Can't you hold my hand and hug me
and say that everything will be fine?

51
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,900
- Uaua have the stroller, then?
- No, no stroller now. You can have it when we get off.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,174
- We'll count to one first.
- One station.

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,400
Does your fear of trains feel any better?

54
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,480
Well, not really.
It's still tough to travel by train.

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,270
Yes, I noticed that.
But I was wondering if it has improved after this semester.

56
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,640
A little better, because me and Harry have gone by train
to school sometimes...

57
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,140
Look, the shadow of the camera is right over your face.
Sorry for that.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
But I know. And I thought about...

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:04,640
We filmed a morning routine where you took the train to school
in maybe September or October, and then you talked...

60
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:09,480
- Mommy!
- Hello! ...about your traffic phobia.

61
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,370
- Yes.
- We got a lot of super nice comments.

62
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,240
It was so nice. I mean...

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,160
It means so much that when I talk about something
that's difficult for me, that you dare to say that too.

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
Because I know it's hard to talk about.

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:37,000
- Can we buy ice cream and candy?
- Not right now. Alma is actually talking about something important.

66
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,560
Buy ice cream and candy...

67
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,320
So it really means a lot to me
that you chose to write so many nice comments, like...

68
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,600
"I'm afraid of that too,
and I feel this way, and I'm afraid of that."

69
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:58,190
I remember it so well, because you sat and read on my phone
and was almost in tears, comment after comment.

70
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,800
There were so many comments
so we didn't have time to answer them all, but we read them all.

71
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,000
We can take the opportunity to thank them now,
even though it's been...

72
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,560
A few months.

73
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,820
- Yes. Thank you for sharing.
- So nice of you, really. It means a lot.

74
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,560
- We probably haven't told you where we're going.
- No.

75
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,880
I've put on some clothes that I don't really care about
because we're actually going to buy a Christmas tree.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,880
- Me too!
- You too. Yes. Although we're only going to buy one Christmas tree.

77
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,400
I want a Santa.

78
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,000
- A Christmas tree and a Santa. That's enough.
- That's enough!

79
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,400
- Is this the tree we're going to buy?
- No, I think it's way too big.

80
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,000
We can't take this on the train.

81
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,320
I think this is a European silver fir...

82
00:06:56,408 --> 00:07:02,400
...which certainly holds up very well,
but I think it will cost a small fortune.

83
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:08,000
When we were here the other day, she had a bunch of Christmas trees.
That's why we went back here.

84
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,320
And now it only seems that the most expensive and finest one remains.
We'll have to ask her.

85
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,190
- She has a small store there, maybe she has more?
- Yes, exactly.

86
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,000
- Shall we check?
- Let's check.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,126
(Portuguese)
- Hello, do you have other Christmas trees?
- I have that one, and one that's closed.

88
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,880
- There.
- Oh! Okay!

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,880
This is the only other Christmas tree they have.

90
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,880
It's a little depressing, it's sitting here in the backyard.
But it looks very big.

91
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:02,400
- Yes. Although it's easier to transport.
- It's much, much easier to transport.

92
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,880
- What do you think, Harry?
- I think it looks pretty good. I like tall Christmas trees.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,720
But you're buying the tree in a poke.
You don't know what you'll get.

94
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,480
No, but I was expecting a much smaller one
than the two she has left, I can tell you that.

95
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,880
These have been left behind because they're so big.
No one has space for them.

96
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:25,160
- (Portuguese) Thank you.
- Thank you.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,400
- What shall we do? Shall we buy a giant tree?
- I mean, yeah.

98
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,800
But how are we going to get it home?!

99
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:44,800
She says she can get someone to deliver it to our house,
but I mean...

100
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,670
It's unclear. We don't know.

101
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,320
Hey, you. Those two were just in the Christmas tree.
Why are you carrying them around?

102
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,000
Give it to me! Give them to me!

103
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,740
- "Give them to me"?
- God, how spoiled.

104
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,880
Chip 'n' Dale can stay here. They can't come home with us.
Portuguese Chip 'n' Dale.

105
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,160
- They come home with us.
- No, they can't come home with us.

106
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,320
They come home with us!

107
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,160
They come home with us!

108
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:25,800
You're a good negotiator, Laura. But I don't know.
We have to discuss it with the rest of the family.

109
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:07,720
We got the tree delivered,
but not the same day we were there but the day after that.

110
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,000
And then another day passed
because it needed to get used to the indoor climate.

111
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,015
Yes.

112
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,480
And I needed to move some potted plants and such.
But now it's here and it's huge!

113
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,160
- It's huge.
- Yes.

114
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
And Alma and Harry have done their last day of school.

115
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,560
Yes.

116
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,240
- How does it feel?
- Good.

117
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,480
- Does it?
- Yes.

118
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,240
Very cool.

119
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,640
Now I see that you're looking at yourself on the screen.

120
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
Axel, help me so he doesn't see it.
Having a new camera...

121
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,139
Then I have to spin it around.

122
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,987
- Gosh! And then I'll do this.
- Yes.

123
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
But tomorrow you have graduation.

124
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,886
- I have to see myself.
- Oh, stop!

125
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
How do you feel, Alma?

126
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,480
It's a little sad and a little fun because it's the end of something,
but also the beginning of something else.

127
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,000
- Yes. It'll be your last day at this school.
- We'll kind of see how it turns out.

128
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,640
- Yes.
- We'll definitely see.

129
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,400
Where's Laura now?

130
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,880
Laura is at her crèche - her kindergarten - so...
And she probably hasn't even had a snack yet.

131
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,160
I know.

132
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,400
So we have some alone time without her.
Yippee!

133
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,560
- Are you happy about that?
- Yes, quite.

134
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,880
- She takes up quite a lot of space.
- Mhm. Quite.

135
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,850
- Okay, she takes up a lot of space.
- Lots of space.

136
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,160
We paid 80 euros for this tree.

137
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:55,880
That's a lot of money here in Portugal, but these trees
don't grow here naturally the same way they do up north.

138
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,090
- But how much does a Christmas tree cost in Sweden?
- Yes, how much does a Christmas tree cost in Sweden? I have no idea anymore.

139
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,190
- Comment below, or what?
- Yes, you could say that. Comment what a Christmas tree...

140
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:16,327
- Have we been robbed with our, like, SEK 900 tree?
- With home delivery. Yes, maybe. But it's worth it, for a little Christmas spirit.

141
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,240
Right, how is the Christmas spirit?
Alma, you're walking around in summer clothes.

142
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,640
I mean... it's so-so.
But I don't really think the Christmas spirit is snow.

143
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Huh? Of course it is.

144
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:40,800
Well, snow is a big deal, and also that it's cold outside,
but the Christmas atmosphere is so much more.

145
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,560
- Are you feeling any Christmas spirit, Harry?
- No, not at all.

146
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,000
And why is that?

147
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,480
I mean... mostly because we're in a very hot country.

148
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:59,010
It's not even snowing. It's just sunny outside.
The sun is setting.

149
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,480
- Hello.
- Hello, hello!

150
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,240
Ta-da!
It's the Christmas tree, Laura.

151
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,720
- Gosh!
- Did you get shy now?

152
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:22,000
Hello... my friend! Did you get a little shy... in front of the tree?
Or what happened there?

153
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,400
God, what a fail.
We thought she would be surprised.

154
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,800
And happy.

155
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,400
- No.
- No.

156
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,400
- Weren't you happy when you saw the tree?
- Are you going to put your little Chip 'n' Dale in it?

157
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,430
We got one. Chip.

158
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,080
- Up in the tree.
- Shall we put it up there?

159
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,400
Yes.

160
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,800
You managed to negotiate for yourself a Chip
who lives in the tree.

161
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,576
- It's a little fun after all.
- Give it to me, then.

162
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:59,080
- "Give it to me, then."
- Oh, now you'll start picking them out.

163
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You want to sit on my lap?
You're so funny.

164
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:14,800
You can look at it. There are many beautiful lights in the tree.
And lots of Christmas bulbs and presents and...

165
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:38,400
- What do you have there?
- Corn.

166
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,640
It's a new day again.

167
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,800
- And Alma and Harry are at graduation.
- Yes.

168
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,750
- We were not allowed to come.
- No. Sad, but that's how it can be sometimes.

169
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,560
And Laura is at kindergarten.

170
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,800
Every year, we get the same Question of the Day
from several people.

171
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,000
We already got it on Instagram, and that is:
"What will the children get for Christmas?"

172
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,720
Yes. We understand that it's exciting.

173
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,842
And since this video comes out the day before Christmas Eve,
we can show you-

174
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:22,240
-because then Alma and Harry
won't have time to sneak a peek.

175
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,800
No, exactly.

176
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:31,560
Laura doesn't really have the skills yet.
But we can start with her Christmas present from us.

177
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,800
A new "o bebê", which means "the baby."

178
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,379
Right.
And what happens when you pull out the pacifier?

179
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,399
No, this will be annoying.

180
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,320
- It can also talk a little.
- "Mommy. Mommy."

181
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:57,273
- It said "mommy." That's me. No, that's Laura!
- Yes.

182
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,200
- And... Would you like to show Harry's present?
- Yes, I can do that.

183
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:08,800
Harry is in a time of his life where he has to start
keeping track of just that - the time.

184
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,640
So that's why I bought him a watch.

185
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,240
This is a watch from Swatch.
The watch brand.

186
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,560
But it's a special edition
which has been released together with Omega.

187
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,800
So it resembles a classic Omega watch.

188
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,480
It has a timer and a regular clock,
so I hope he likes it.

189
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,000
I like it anyway.
If he won't use it…

190
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,480
It's one of those gifts that you really wanted.

191
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,450
I'd basically want this now, but yeah…
So, this is for him.

192
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,800
Alma has wanted a set like this
with rhinestones.

193
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:58,400
I don't know if you can see it through the plastic
but there are small crystals that you glue on...

194
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
In lots of different colors.

195
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,480
...on a phone case, bags, shoes, and so on.

196
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,400
Here's some applicator thing,
and here's a large pair of tweezers to go with it.

197
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,240
She's very excited about this, so yeah...

198
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:13,400
It will be interesting to see
what her shoes look like later.

199
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,720
- Yes. These were the three gifts we feel we can show.
- Yes.

200
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:22,200
- And now we're going to wrap them up.
- Yes, we will.

201
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:32,800
Once upon a time, I was very good at wrapping presents
because I worked as a clerk at NK, the department store.

202
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,240
But yeah, no longer.

203
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,240
- You've lost it a little.
- Oh, God. Are you kidding?

204
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,560
We had to take a gift-wrapping course,
we who worked at NK.

205
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,000
- So it would go fast or look nice?
- So it would look beautiful.

206
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,090
What kind of weird image is this?
You only see the bed.

207
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:56,190
- You're supposed to see the presents.
- Oh, gosh.

208
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,380
- We can raise it a little.
- Give me the tape.

209
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,400
Now there's a lot of complaining.

210
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,400
There we go. Nice.

211
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,080
Oh, the wall looks green, I think.

212
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,000
What do you guys at home think?
Does it look green or blue? It's blue.

213
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,600
There.

214
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,400
They don't have cards or names written on them.

215
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:35,320
No, that's true. Shall we do that?

216
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,480
Shucks!

217
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,720
They can guess and think about it.
They can sit here and dream away in the Christmas tree.

218
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,880
It's good.

219
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,000
This was a pretty slow vlog
that extended over several days.

220
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Yes. I think it was quite nice for us
to make a vlog like this.

221
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:59,560
It's been quite a stressful and hectic fall.

222
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,513
Yes, indeed. There have been a lot of projects and travels
and all kinds of things that we've been up to.

223
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,080
You've had a lot at school too,
and with training and such.

224
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,320
- And I have written a book.
- Yes!

225
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,720
So good!

226
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,240
And the club and Kenya and, yeah.

227
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:22,640
Yes. So it felt right to just slow down before Christmas
and just go at a leisurely pace.

228
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:25,880
I started to wonder if it was this camera
that slowed us down a bit.

229
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,320
I don't know. What do you guys think?
Is it slow?

230
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:35,800
Please leave a comment about the audio,
the image, the camera, and...

231
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,320
- What you like and what you dislike.
- Yes, exactly.

232
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,240
And finally, we would like to wish everyone a...

233
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,880
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

234
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:51,200
Yep.
And of course, we'll see you before New Year's Eve.

235
00:19:53,811 --> 00:20:00,560
Thank you for watching this video!

236
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,160
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

237
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,720
Comment, ask questions
and take care until next time.

238
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,800
- See you!
- Bye-bye!
