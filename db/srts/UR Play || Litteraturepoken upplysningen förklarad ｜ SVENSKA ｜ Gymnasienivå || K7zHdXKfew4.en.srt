1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,200
This is Denis Diderot.
 In 1748 he gets an idea.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,640
He will gather all the world's knowledge into a single work - an encyclopedia.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,760
People should themselves be allowed to form an idea of the world-

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,840
-and not have to blindly rely on priests or illuminated kings.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
Diderot collects over a hundred employees in the project-

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,440
-The so -called encyclopedists.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,640
Here they are on a group board.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,640
The French encyclopedia with 70,000 articles took 40 years to write.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,640
There they tried to gather everything knowing.
 It was a fantastic idea.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,680
There, the 18th century man can learn everything from baking and surgery-

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
-To fencing and clock building ...

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,440
... in ordinary language, with pictures, to form people.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,320
It becomes a bestseller, even though we talk about heavy volumes.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,880
Encyclopedia is typical of the epoch known as enlighten-

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,960
-This, the lantern of reason should light up in the darkness of ignorance.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:22,160
But what was the enlightenment?
 What more than encyclopedia wrote and read?

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,840
The enlightenment occurs in Europe in the 17th century-

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,880
-And becomes the leading stream of ideas in the West throughout the 18th century.

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,760
Now great progress is taking place in science.

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,480
Isaac Newton gets an apple in the head and lists how the law of gravity works.

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,440
The two central countries are the UK and France-

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,320
-But also in Sweden the idea of ideas is visible.

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,120
We have Carl von LinnÃ© with his classifications.

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,160
Anders Celsius defines a temperature scale-

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,960
-When he a little humble baptizes for himself.

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,000
However, despite the gravity and a temperature based on the properties of the water-

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,920
-Is life no dance on roses for the 18th century man.

28
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,520
The 18th century Sweden is very unpleasant.
 It stinks terribly.

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,120
Sweden was not unique.
 The 18th century was disgusting for almost everyone.

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,240
We have nothing similar to modern welfare.

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,880
No, it's not fun for most people.
 Here somewhere the thought-

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280
-They if man can tame science-

33
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,120
-Why can't we tame and make the whole community better?

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,040
The great news with the enlightenment-

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,680
-while is a water divider of historical proportions-

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,560
-Is to affirm change.

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,680
Power lies with two authorities: the church and the state.

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,600
They decide everything and have patents on the explanatory models.

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,600
There are very few in the 18th century who do not believe in god-

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,520
-But many are starting to question the church as an institution.

41
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,240
Central is the revolutionary idea that all people can think for themselves-

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,280
-And that we are free and independent.

43
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,720
"Freedom" is probably the most beloved word of enlightenment.

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,080
You also attach great importance to reason.

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,960
The English philosopher John Locke says we are born as unwritten leaves.

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,040
The empty leaf is filled during life.

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,640
What is our reason are our overall experiences and knowledge-

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,120
-So what is now on our paper.

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,160
Society bubbles with optimism.

50
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,880
Through science and reason you can solve the world's problems.

51
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,400
The optimism is also visible in the literature.

52
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,200
By reading novels, people can understand themselves and develop.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,480
It is in the UK that it takes off.

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,440
The fact that the novel begins to bloom in the UK is due to the book market.

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,480
There are readers, printers and publishers.

56
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,640
A book that many on the British Isles read takes place on an island-

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,280
-dock not an equally densely populated one.

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,760
Where in his loneliness lives a man who loves reason-

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,240
-and to fill sitting empty leaves with knowledge.

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,720
This is the book "Robinson Crusoe" by Englishman Daniel Defoe.

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,920
The adventure novel "Robinson Crusoe" comes out in 1719 and makes incredible success.

62
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,520
Defoe becomes world famous and the book becomes one of the world's most translated.

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,800
The action is well known.

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,320
Book poiler: "Robinson Crusoe".

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,040
Robinson Crusoe suffers shipwreck and drives alone in land-

66
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,160
-On a nearly uninhabited island.

67
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,160
He salvages some things from the wreck-

68
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,760
-and thanks to common sense and inventive wealth-

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,200
-He builds his own community on the island.

70
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,960
He lives alone until he gets social

71
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
-When a man he rescues from the cannibals.

72
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,240
He baptizes him a little slim until Friday after the day of the week-

73
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,160
-And Friday becomes his servant.

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,120
Finally, after 28 years, 2 months and 19 days-

75
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,040
-Red Robinson and can return home.

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:01,080
Robinson embodies the ideal of enlightenment.
 He is sensible and practical.

77
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,720
He solves problems by observing and learning from his mistakes.

78
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,240
When he does in the way of enlightenment - acting with reason-

79
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,680
-He changes his poor life on the island to an idyllic existence.

80
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,280
He is incurable optimist.
 He does not panic by loneliness-

81
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,040
-On struggles and believes in himself and his ability to solve problems.

82
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,560
Robinson Crusoe is a man of action.

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,960
He is driven by a Protestant Christian, moral thought-

84
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,040
-To work is the best.
 It lifts man and makes us better.

85
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,120
When the book comes out, many believe that the story is true.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,280
It is written in I-form and the word "I" is common.

87
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,560
It is a novel that will attract stretch reading.

88
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,960
It should be exciting and accessible to many.

89
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
But Robinson is also a colonizer.

90
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,640
In the book, we see that the enlightenment's mindset does not apply to everyone.

91
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,040
It is clear in relation to Friday.

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,200
That he would already have a name before they meet-

93
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,680
-has not hit the island hero.

94
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,920
Criticism has been directed at Robinson Crusoe based on postcolonial theory.

95
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,480
One has pointed to the problematic, imperialist thought-

96
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,840
-Do the only culture and civilization that counts is the European-

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
-and in this case the English.

98
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,240
When Robinson Crusoe comes-

99
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,800
-The he saves Friday from his lost condition.

100
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,600
There have been protests against it, and writers have made other versions.

101
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,240
For example, Michel Tournier has written the book-

102
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,080
-"Friday or a life in freedom".

103
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,840
There he recounts Defoe's story from Friday's point of view.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,640
The enlighteners had probably been proud of the criticism.

105
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,480
To question, after all, was a supporting part of what you did.

106
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,920
The language of "Robinson Crusoe" is in I-form.

107
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,720
In some parts it is written as a diary.

108
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,000
Robinson as a person was really arrogant.

109
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,680
He thinks he is the best and that he is better than others.

110
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,800
But I would also say that he is really smart-

111
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,960
-And really fights well, because he doesn't give up.

112
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,160
But the book requires patience.
 In the beginning I got tired and wanted to stop reading.

113
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,080
Then it will be fun because you see everything in front of you.

114
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,760
It feels like you watch a movie but still read.

115
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,640
The style goes again in much of the enlightenment literature.

116
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,920
There are few metaphors, few adjectives and the focus is on the action.

117
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,960
What happens is the important, not painting words.

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,600
One reason is that fiction has more functions than maintaining.

119
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,560
It should spread the enlightenment to the masses.

120
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,960
Literature is used to convey messages.

121
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,360
Part of the enlightenment philosophers-

122
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,400
-As also what we today call fictional writers.

123
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,480
The middle -class activity reading is therefore not just about entertainment.

124
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,640
It gives the author a chance to raise the reader.

125
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,000
It is no coincidence that one suddenly gets the novel-

126
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,080
-which can discuss in fictional form.

127
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,400
Science, how we can think philosophically about different things life ...

128
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,360
How do you become a good person?
 How do we live good lives?

129
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,640
Several philosophers become fictional writers to reach out with the ideas.

130
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,520
We have Jean-Jacques Rousseau which in 1762 publishes the book "Ã©mile".

131
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,440
On the surface it is about a young man without parents-

132
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,960
-But is really an instruction book in child rearing.

133
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,200
"Raised in rural simplicity, your children get a clearer voice."

134
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,120
"There, they do not acquire the stuttering of the city children."

135
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,160
During the enlightenment, fiction is used, with straight language-

136
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,960
-As a tool for learning, raising and making us better people.

137
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,960
There is a completely different style that is in contrast to the skill fixation.

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,280
It provokes, attracts to laughter and writes awful things-

139
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,680
-To arouse emotions and debate: the satire.

140
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:18,640
In the 18th century, satire is used to criticize society.

141
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,200
It is not only funny, but should improve.

142
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,640
Other enlightenment literature mediated knowledge-

143
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,240
-But the satire was used to criticize the maladminist-

144
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:37,360
-dolt behind jokes.
 A index finger with clown peruk against the authorities.

145
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,080
A well -known example of satire is Jonathan Swift who wrote ...

146
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,400
He is best known for "Gulliver's travels"-

147
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,160
-But also wrote the rather rugged script "A modest proposal".

148
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
At that time there was terrible starvation in Ireland-

149
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,680
-And England didn't help Ireland.

150
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,560
He pretends to be serious and leaves this "humble suggestion"-

151
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,880
-If raising Irish, poor families' children so that they become obese-

152
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,680
-and you can eat them.
 It became a scream when people read.

153
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,160
If you do not understand that it is satire, "a humble proposal" is completely ill.

154
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,360
"A child becomes two dishes when invitation for friends"-

155
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,960
-"And when the family dines alone, FramfjÃ¤rding becomes a decent dish"-

156
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,360
-"especially winter time with pepper or salt."

157
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,400
"Let hang three days before it is cooked."

158
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,360
Despite the absurd content, the text is factual and logical.

159
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,120
It is presented as a scientific solution to a difficult problem.

160
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,160
In addition to Swift's prompt to eat child-

161
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,120
-e one of the enlightenment's most famous works a satir-

162
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,200
-written by another central figure, Voltaire.

163
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,360
He was also one of the encyclopedists.

164
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,600
The most well-known Enlightenment Agency is Voltaire's short novel "Candide"-

165
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,120
-Or also has an eternal readership, because it's fun.

166
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,960
It is written with a twinkle in the eye and is a satire about how the kingdoms guide-

167
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,240
-If prevailing philosophies and on -understanding.

168
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,360
Voltaire inspired Swedish Anna Maria Lenngren-

169
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,920
-As used jokes and satire in their poems.

170
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,360
She is an exciting writer with a very broad production.

171
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,080
She was known for her irony, and there is the most famous-

172
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,040
-and debated the poem she wrote-

173
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,000
-"A few words to my dear daughter, if I had any".

174
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,240
"With reading not time away, our gender so little it needs."

175
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,520
"And should you read, make it short, that the sauce must not mill over."

176
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,520
Women should therefore preferably not read and educate themselves-

177
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,840
-And if they do, do it quickly to avoid chaos in the kitchen.
 Or?

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,400
For a long time it was believed that it was serious, and that Lenngren was conservative.

179
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,960
Now we know that the poem is multifaceted.
 It is skilfully rhetorically designed.

180
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,680
Among other things, Lenngren uses irony.
 So the reverse message is-

181
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,800
-That women should of course have education.

182
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:38,080
The written satire could be mixed with something forbidden - pornography.

183
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,880
Researchers have shown that pornography could be used as a social criticism-

184
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,040
-and spreading malicious rumors about what the king and the queen did.

185
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,160
There were serious things that were sold freshly on the streets of Paris and spread in the country.

186
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,680
It was forbidden literature.

187
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:06,560
Much of the criticism is aimed at the monarchy, the king and the queen.

188
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,000
It is mainly in France - a central country - like that speed.

189
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,320
You are tired of poverty and injustice.

190
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,720
We have a community that almost bubbles over of restrained anger-

191
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,000
-Above how terribly unfair and bad it is.

192
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,480
Do you remember Diderot, he with encyclopedia?

193
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,600
In addition to conveying knowledge in thick books, he said this ...

194
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,280
Diderot says:

195
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,480
"Man is not free until the last king has been strangled"-

196
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,960
-"of the last priest's intestines."

197
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,240
Hard words!
 And in the late 18th century it breaks loose in France.

198
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,640
The enlightenment ideas will become a reality and the dream community is really built.

199
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
There is revolution going on.

200
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:11,040
Here is the revolutionary spark.
 One claims that there is no reason-

201
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,120
-To a small elite should control a majority of the population.

202
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,160
You require freedom, but also equality.

203
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,560
1793 In January, the king is executed.

204
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,080
The people should control and legislate over their own destiny.

205
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,360
The French Revolution leads to the overthrow of the king-

206
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,120
-But then it goes quickly.

207
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,800
People literally lose their heads, almost everywhere.

208
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,240
All suspected counter -revolutionaries are at risk of getting ...

209
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:57,160
... during the guillotine that starts to walk on treadmills, publicly in Paris.

210
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,200
The revolution, which would make enlightenment ideas to reality-

211
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,160
-The leads to a bloody horror.

212
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:11,040
Building the perfect community with reason proves more difficult-

213
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,520
-Ever it was to rewrite.

214
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,360
Enlightenment and the 18th century end with revolution, war and death-

215
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,280
-But much of the ideas and literature still lives on today.

216
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,480
The enlightenment is an exciting time, and extremely important.

217
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,880
This is where modern democracy is launched, with freedom and equality.

218
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,800
Robinson Crusoe's adventure has given rise to a genre: "Robinsonader"-

219
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,480
-the one person or more must survive in a deserted place-

220
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,080
-Tore after an accident.

221
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,960
To pretend it is for real and mix truth with illusion-

222
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,920
-As it still popular.

223
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,080
The encyclopedia's fact transfer we have continued with-

224
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,000
-An if we use screens more often than books.

225
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,880
The ambition to form people to get a better world-

226
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,240
-We have continued from the enlightenment onwards.

227
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,680
The Swedish Academy was also founded under the Enlightenment-

228
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,920
-And the literature began to be seen as an institution.

229
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,280
Satire - using jokes with cape - is today a common grip.

230
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,320
The very idea of looking at society, see where improvements-

231
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,800
-And make his voice heard, it also lives on from the enlightenment.

232
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,000
The idea that man can change his world and reflect on it-

233
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,640
-Set up and criticize, thus change ...

234
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,880
The message that you can do this is the enlightenment's legacy to us.

235
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,000
Some love and others despise it.

236
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,760
It is probably related to the fact that so much light creates strong shadows.

237
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
