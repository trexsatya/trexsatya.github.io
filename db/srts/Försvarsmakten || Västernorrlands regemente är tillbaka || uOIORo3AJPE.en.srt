00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,646
Today is a historic day, we have just re -inaugurated Västernorrland's regiment with Jämtland's field hunter corps.

2
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:28,440
This is a big day for many, it is a big and important day for the Armed Forces.

3
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:35,639
As we can grow with additional military associations in a strategically important area.

4
00:00:36,658 --> 00:00:42.882
It is important for the army, today we have taken further steps to reintroduce the infantry.

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:52,760
For Sollefteå and Östersund it is also important. This growth allows opportunities for the resort. \hrs

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:01.477
It also allows the opportunity to contribute to strengthening society with the associations we are now setting.

7
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:08.640
Last but not least, it is a long-awaited day for so many of those who have worked on Västernorrland's regiment and-

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,865
-Jämtland's field hunter regiment now that we are inaugurating the two parts.

9
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:25,920
It feels fantastic. I have longed for this day since 2005, when the business was closed down in Östersund.

10
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:32,959
It feels great fun and we have very good conditions here locally, to train conscripts.

11
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:44,072
I look forward to training infantry associations in Norrland's inland and in the mountain terrain where we enjoy and feel at home

12
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:50,399
It is a big challenge but also something I look forward to doing.
