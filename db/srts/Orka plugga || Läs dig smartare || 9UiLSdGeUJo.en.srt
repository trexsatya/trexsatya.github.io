00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,200
People say that today's youth 
doesn't read enough.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,920
But why is it so important 
to read books, specifically?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,720
To handle regular adult life, meaning 
to be able to follow news broadcasts-

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,360
-follow instructions and directions, 
and understand newspaper articles-

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,080
-a person needs a vocabulary 
of around 50,000 words.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,280
If a 17-year-old hasn't read 
or listened to books regularly-

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,480
-their vocabulary will consist 
of around 15,000-17,000 words.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,520
But regularly reading 
different types of texts-

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,600
-will stimulate and expand 
your vocabulary.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,600
That means 
you can express yourself better-

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,920
-since you will have access 
to more linguistic nuance.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,560
This is really helpful in school-

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,600
-where you will often need to use 
your own words to explain your thoughts.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,160
Reading comprehension is the 
foundation for every school subject.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,520
It's obviously important in Swedish, 
but it will help you in other subjects, too.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,000
Understanding instructions and texts 
is required in basically every subject.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,120
Strong reading comprehension also 
helps you review statements critically-

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,240
-and thereby avoid being manipulated.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,440
FAKE, FACT

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,280
Reading books helps your brain stay fit.

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,480
Your brain has to work a lot harder 
when you read than when you watch TV-

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,280
-and that boosts your brain capacity.

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,880
Reading also stimulates your 
imagination and analytical ability.

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,680
Finally, it enhances our ability 
for empathy, since it helps us-

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,880
-put ourselves in someone else's shoes 
and understand how they feel.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,360
Make sure to read 
different types of books and texts.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,920
And of course: 
the more you read, the better.
