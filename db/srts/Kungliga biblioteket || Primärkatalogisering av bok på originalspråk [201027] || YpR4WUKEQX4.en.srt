00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:19,276
Hello! My name is Olof Osterman. I work on the national bibliography here at KB.

2
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:32,054
It is I who will do this instructional film over a cataloging of a book, a monograph. A primary catalog of a book in original.

3
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:46,183
The book we will be based on, which we will catalog, is called Swedish murder stories and is written by Sebastian Krantz and Cyril Hellman.

4
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:55.293
So, now I will switch to Libris XL and show there how to do this.

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
I will split the screen here.

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:10,655
So, when you enter Libris XL you get this screen, opening screen, and then you have headlines at the top here.

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,240
I have start, search, create new, catalog care, help.

8
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:22,025
And then we will click Create new and choose something called Mall.

9
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:28,576
But before we do, I just have to say that this is an exercise so this book is cataloged before.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,420
In reality, so to speak, one should of course be very careful to first search the books on both ISBN numbers, title and author

11
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:51,999
To really make sure that the book is not cataloged before, so that you do not do any duplicates in the base.

12
00:01:52,128 --> 00:02:01,274
And if there is already an entry, you use it and hopefully you just need to put on a stock on it.

13
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:09.222
And if there is a preliminary item, you use it as well. You just update it.

14
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:12,775
They can be very rudimentary but these are the ones to use anyway.

15
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:21,161
But as I said, this is an exercise, so we pretend that this book is not cataloged before and that we primarily catalog it.

16
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,712
So then we start from a template and then we click here at Create new.

17
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,552
And then we get these alternatives.

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,160
The first option is just a very ordinary book.

19
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,792
And it is the one we should use. That template. So I click here on Choose.

20
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
So, and then we get a template here.

21
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53.568
This one is quite long this template and here there are different fields to be filled in.

22
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:05,236
What you can say about catalog items is generally that they are divided into three parts in Libris XL.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The first part you see here is the instance of works,

24
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:23,596
And the other part here, which comes after it is highlighted that it splits a bit here, is the instance itself,

25
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:27.516
Or what you also call the manifestation.

26
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:35,452
And the third part is admin metadata. Simply just data about the directory post itself.

27
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:44,098
And I usually start by filling in what is on the body.

28
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:56,337
And in order for this one not to be so long, this post, now that I work with it, I fold the instance of works by clicking on this arrow.

29
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59.616
So, it disappears there.

30
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03.712
So then I can devote myself to this place.

31
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
And the first ...

32
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,642
The first field that we are going to fill in is ISBN number,

33
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:21,314
And ISBN numbers are in the identifier field.

34
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27.519
And for books, the most common identifier is ISBN.

35
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,357
Then we fill in the ISBN number in the value field.

36
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45.951
So.

37
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,424
Often the ISBN numbers are specified in the books with hyphens

38
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57.471
It is almost the most common that they are, but we fill in this without a hyphen.

39
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03.846
And the next field we have here is distinctive addition.

40
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:10,271
And this is not a nuclear element, distinctive addition,

41
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,391
So you can choose whether you want to add an addition or not.

42
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:26,774
If you want it, the most common thing you usually put in is whether the book is hardcover or if it is stapled and so on. And this book is hardcover.

43
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
I enter here that the hardcover.

44
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
That's how.

45
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:44,392
Then there are three filled fields here. Publishing methods, media type, carrier type.

46
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:54,787
These are defaults for printed books so you don't have to touch. They just lie there in the mail.

47
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:04.455
So, then comes the next field and it is has the title.

48
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:18,623
Then we will fill in this book's main title in the first field. Then we start from the title page which is the primary source in the book. It is the one that you always assume.

49
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:26,341
And on the title page we have the title - Swedish murder stories. So then we enter this.

50
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,263
And then we have another field here, other title information.

51
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:44,228
And here you can add eg. A subtitle if it is. In this case, there was no such thing. Then you just skip that field.

52
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
It then disappears when saving

53
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,599
And then comes origin.

54
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:58.707
The origin details are the person or persons who have written the book.

55
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:06,495
And the origin details here are Sebastian Krantz and Cyril Hellman.

56
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09.055
So we fill in their name here.

57
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,671
Like that, and you fill it in as per title page

58
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:37,456
Sebastian Krantz is first on the title side and then Cyril Hellman is located. You do not change this but it is filled in as it says on the title page.

59
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:48,216
What you fill in here in the copy's task must be descriptive. You describe what the title page looks like.

60
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52.831
What you can do, on the other hand, is that you can put in punctuation if needed.

61
00:07:53,087 --> 00:08:01,679
In this case it is only Sebastian Krantz and Cyril Hellman, but we put in a comma between just for the sake of readability.

62
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:11,030
And if there had been any other authors, they would also have put them in this field. For example. If there had been any illustrator

63
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,759
or any photographer or translator or something like that there.

64
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,973
This is also laid in this field. But now it was only these two so now the field is done.

65
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:32,511
And the next field to enter something in it is the circulation task.

66
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:41,073
Not all books have a circulation task. Especially when they come out the first time then it is often just skipping that task. Or the publisher does.

67
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:46,591
But if there is a circulation task then you should state it.

68
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
And in this case, it does.

69
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,834
And we find it here on the back of the title page.

70
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:03.403
And if you look at it you can see that it says the first edition on the back of the title page.

71
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
And then you quote just as it stands.

72
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,325
So we write the first edition.

73
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,359
Had first stood with a number you would have written so too, or then you would have written with a number.

74
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,223
This is a descriptive field so you write as it says.

75
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,575
Then we move on to the next field - publishing.

76
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,671
And we have already completed the country of publishing, Sweden.

77
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
And that's right in this case.

78
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42.567
But had we cataloged another book published in another country so just click

79
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,288
The cross there and remove it and add relevant country.

80
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,663
And then we will add a publishing site here.

81
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
On site here.

82
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03.903
And then we look for here in the book if there is any publishing site specified.

83
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:15.038
On the title page there was no one but on the back of the title page we find an address to Pagina called the publisher.

84
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,799
And here it is Stockholm printed so then we can only enter this.

85
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
That's how.

86
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,035
Had it not been in the book you would have had to cling to it instead.

87
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:44,175
So. Then we move on to the next field. It is the publisher, the entire publisher in this case that is the publisher and it is completed in the agent and under the term there.

88
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:52,285
And then I start from the title page which is a primary source and there we find Pagina.

89
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
So, spelled that way.

90
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:03.039
If you look at the back side of the title page, it says Pagina Group AB,

91
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,135
But it is the title page that applies so that is where you take the task.

92
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09.951
So that's how we enter it.

93
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,373
The two next fields are years and date.

94
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:24,940
And years is a numeric field. So you just specify it with numbers.

95
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:31,199
And then we look for when this one was released. It was released in 2019 I have for me.

96
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35.551
Right. And then I write in 2019 here only.

97
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:48,729
And this field is what controls, for example, hit lists if you want them in chronological order, etc.

98
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
That is why you have to enter that.

99
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:57,823
And next field is date

100
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:09,122
And in the date, you should enter the publishing year or if it is the date of release if they have added both months and day to the publication.

101
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,927
Not so common, but it occurs.

102
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,133
In date you should enter the release year

103
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:22,899
And then we have to look for if there is any publishing year here. There is nothing on the title page.

104
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:31,275
On the back we find only one print year, 2019, and a copyright year, 2019.

105
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:38,532
So then we have to construct a publishing year by clinging in 2019.

106
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,367
Since there was no real release year.

107
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Then we'll do it.

108
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
That's how.

109
00:12:49,535 --> 00:13:01,924
And we base this year of release on the print year and if there had been no pressure year we would have based on the publishing year on the copyright year.

110
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:14,235
And since there was no real release year, we must state what we have based on the publishing year.

111
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,843
And as I said before, we have based this on the manufacturing year.

112
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
So then we fill in 2019 here.

113
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:29,401
It is printed in Latvia 2019. We do not need to bring Latvia.

114
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:45,775
If the book had been printed in Sweden, NB usually fills in the print shop here as well. The printing room and name as well.

115
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:49,951
But since it was printed abroad, it is enough to just enter 2019 here.

116
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:56,095
We skip the field Copyright even if there is a copyright year here.

117
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,173
But since we had the print year that we based on the release year on, it is enough.

118
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:08.808
Range. It is therefore how many pages there are in the book

119
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,759
As we specify here and you just state the last pagination.

120
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:23,858
Although there would be more printed pages after, you just specify the last pagination and there are 203 pages.

121
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:28,826
If we move on here we will be able to measure.

122
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:36,732
Dimensions are not a mandatory field or a nuclear element as we usually say.

123
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
So you don't have to fill it out.

124
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:47,849
Most libraries probably don't do what we at NB do it so if you want you can fill in this

125
00:14:49,855 --> 00:15:02,225
What you have to keep in mind then is that you specify the book's height in centimeters.

126
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,272
And that you always round up.

127
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,504
And the next field are other physical details

128
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,087
Then let's see, was it illustrated this one?

129
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:37,332
It was it and the most common physical detail is whether a book is illustrated or not illustrated. If it is not illustrated, you do not fill in anything.

130
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:41,311
If it is, you just fill illustrations here.

131
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:54,574
If we move on here we have a series membership. If the book had been included in any series, this would have been stated.

132
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,231
But it doesn't do it so we just skip these fields.

133
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05.887
Then we come to a remark field.

134
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:15,352
And note it is used if you want to specify something that is not shown in the bibliographic description.

135
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:27,449
And in this case, we thought there was an information that could be interesting that we wanted to make a note here.

136
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,686
And then you do this.

137
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,071
I'll write rear cover here. So.

138
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:44,885
If you want to quote something, you talk about where the quote comes from.

139
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:56,926
And then we write "15 real cases from the success pod"

140
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:07,886
These crime cases they include in this book have apparently been dealt with in the pod in the past and may be of interest to include.

141
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:22,334
Otherwise, we usually do not include so many such quotes and similar things from the books, but often the bibliographic tasks that you add.

142
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:31,085
And then this instance, the manifestation, was actually completed.

143
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:40,831
And then you can move on to the instance of works instead.

144
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,703
So then I unfold this by clicking on the arrow here.

145
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
And then I'll fill in ...

146
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:57,759
At the work level are the author names in authorized form,

147
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:10,912
Here lies classification, here are subject words. Things that belong to actual levels of the book or the work should be said rather.

148
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,911
The type of work is stated as text.

149
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,239
And it is also lying and it is true, it should be so.

150
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
There is only one person who can become primary involvement, and that is

151
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:29,759
The one first stated on the title page that becomes primary participation.

152
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:35,391
And then we will add this person who is thus Krantz.

153
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:46,253
On primary participation, we add either in authorized form or also how the person should be presented in the index.

154
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:52,721
Often in inverted form, reverse form. The last name first and the first name later.

155
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
But then we click here on the plus.

156
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,278
And then a new window unfolds on the right.

157
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:13,151
If you have a very small screen, it will be all over the screen instead. But now it's on the right here and it's good.

158
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
And then we get a search box here and then we are looking for Krantz.

159
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:33,420
So, what was he called by first name? Sebastian was his name.

160
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:49,907
Then a Sebastian Krantz born in 1994 gets here and we can see that the business area is eg. Pod radio.

161
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:56,150
And that seems to be the person we are looking for simply.

162
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:07.861
Then we can add him. And then you click on the plus sign and then he will go into the instance of works here.

163
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:14,975
Then we have linked him to this cheese of authority.

164
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
And it is this name form he should have.

165
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:32,127
And the next field is a field of function. There you talk about the function the person has, and here it is already completed "Author" thus writer.

166
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:41,778
And that is true too and he has not done anything else so we do not have to add any more function code here.

167
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,999
So, then we have added that he is written there.

168
00:20:48,511 --> 00:21:00,146
But then there was also a co -author too, Cyril Hellman. We want to add him too. So then we do the same procedure here.

169
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:15,768
We click here on the plus and we are looking for Hellman, Cyril. And then we get a person here.

170
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:22,816
There was not as much information here but if you want to be able to right -click him here

171
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:28,704
And open a link in a new tab, and then you enter the authority post.

172
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:37,774
I think I skip to do it. It's a pretty unusual name this so I think it is he anyway.

173
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:48,125
When you do this procedure you also get to the books he has written. We can see that he has written 33 books.

174
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,000
But I click him here.

175
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
So.

176
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:06,524
And then we have the function here. It is only done on the first, primary, participation.

177
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:18,077
On the other you have to add yourself. It doesn't always have to be a co -author. It may be something else. It can be an illustrator or photographer or something like that.

178
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:23,556
This is how you add the function yourself. I click on the plus here.

179
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
And then I search for writers as he is.

180
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,960
That's how. Then I get a function code there, writer.

181
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:39,252
Click on the plus and then he comes in there.

182
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:51.021
Like that, and then this window remains here. If you want to remove that window, it is easiest to just press ESC and it will disappear.

183
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:57,792
Otherwise you can just click on the cross in the upper right and it will disappear as well.

184
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:10,232
Then we were done with participation and function and have added primary participation and participation for the co -author.

185
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,200
And then comes the next field. It's language.

186
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:22,964
And there it is pre -filled Sweden, or sorry, Swedish. The language Swedish.

187
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,976
And that's right. The book is in Swedish.

188
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30.304
So we just leave it there.

189
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:42,980
Then we come to genre/form. Genre/form is something you don't have to add anything to, except that fiction.

190
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:48,992
Then you have to choose whether it is a novel or short story or whatever it may be.

191
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
And then you add this under genre/form.

192
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:58,351
So you don't really have to add anything here but many libraries would like it to be completed

193
00:23:58,351 --> 00:24:03,328
Still with a code that is 0, for "not fiction".

194
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:09.872
It is easier for them to distinguish fiction and non -fiction then in their local systems.

195
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:17,053
So I always add this one. To be nice.

196
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,296
Either I search for "not fiction" or if I know the code then I can only press 0 here.

197
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:32,892
It simply becomes the same result. I usually do this.

198
00:24:33,162 --> 00:24:36,608
So. Then we got it in.

199
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:42,720
And then we have arrived at the classification, and

200
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:49,152
Most research libraries including KB use DDK nowadays.

201
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,552
While most public libraries are still using SAB.

202
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:04.056
Each library fills in the classification system they use.

203
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:09,376
So we at KB fill in DDK. But does not fill in any sab.

204
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:15,520
If there is any library using SAB, they fill in SAB but not DDK.

205
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,128
Or if they have any other classification system.

206
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:30,651
The code we will fill in here is this one.

207
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:44,627
Since this is not a course in classification, I do not go into the classification so much, but I just fill in this one.

208
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
That's how.

209
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:55.968
And this code means murder - geographical aspect - Sweden.

210
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:06,185
But I can also do the same on SAB. For the sake of pedagogy.

211
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:19,224
And then we use SAB, ie classification systems for Swedish libraries, and here we fill in OR-C, which is about the equivalent.

212
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:22,080
This means legal cases - Sweden only.

213
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,896
Then we have filled in classification here.

214
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:33,316
And then comes the next field which is subject.

215
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:39,488
KB recommends libraries that they should use controlled subject words.

216
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:47,400
And we at KB use Swedish subject words.

217
00:26:48,448 --> 00:27:01.014
So then we will add some relevant subject words to this post and the subject words we have chosen are murder, criminal cases and Sweden.

218
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08.506
We click on the plus here and enter murder.

219
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,992
And now there are several different subject word systems here.

220
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
You will get two murders here and it is Swedish subject words that we want.

221
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,163
It can be a little difficult to see sometimes.

222
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:32,992
Here you can see e.g. That there are children there, and here it says SAO there.

223
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,856
If I want, I can limit myself too.

224
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,440
For example. Subject word - general word word.

225
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,024
But then I still get these words of children too.

226
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48.608
You have to be a little observant here.

227
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,229
And I then choose murder, the Sao term.

228
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,683
And then I also want legal cases and Sweden here.

229
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,456
No sorry, crime cases and Sweden it was.

230
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:17,244
And when I'm already here in the box on the right, I don't have to get out of it but can continue to put on.

231
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:21,376
So I remove murder and enter crime cases here.

232
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
That's how.

233
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:31,017
And then I see here, say, then I plus on here I get it there ..

234
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,712
But then we want to add that there is murder and crime cases in Sweden.

235
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,890
I am looking for Sweden here and I get Sweden first.

236
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:54,981
If you have got a lot of strange hits, you can go here and choose geographical subject words.

237
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:08.096
And now not all geographical subject words are in the base so sometimes you have to put it in without it being linked.

238
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:14,112
So, but at least we choose Sweden that came up first here.

239
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
That's how.

240
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:22,284
It was the last here at the instance of works.

241
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:29,540
The next field is content type text and you just leave it there.

242
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:35,096
And this is also such a note that you do not fill in. In this case.

243
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:44,992
Then we can move on to the last part of this item and it is admin metadata.

244
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,212
And then I click there and get these fields to fill in.

245
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So, the first .. If you are a library library and catalog at the library level that is stated there, you never really have to go into admin metadata.

246
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09.673
But I will go through these fields anyway so you know what it is.

247
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:27,435
The first field to come here is bibliography and here you enter a bibliographo if it is relevant to the book.

248
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:44,506
Various bibliographies found in Libris are e.g. NB is understood, and Samb - Swedish Sami bibliography. If this had had any Sami connection in any way

249
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:50,314
Had you been able to put this in. Or it really does the Sami bibliography.

250
00:30:51,136 --> 00:31:01,744
For ordinary libraries, they do not have to care about this bibliology here, unless they have any bibliography that they maintain.

251
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:14,469
Then the next. Description level, and here is the library level. It is the most common level you use.

252
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,939
Possibly you could use the minimum level as well, but then you put in very rudimentary and it does almost no libraries

253
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:26,208
So most libraries probably always settle at library level.

254
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:30,560
So if you are uncertain, just use the library level and don't think much about it.

255
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,936
Post status is created automatically.

256
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
So you don't touch it.

257
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,450
It will say that this item is new when saving it for the first time.

258
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,759
But if someone were to go into the mail and do something, it will say it is upgraded.

259
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,928
Or it will say that it is "corrected or revised". So is the text.

260
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02.048
But it is set automatically. It's not something you have to care about.

261
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
Then so created by.

262
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:14,232
It is thus the library that has created the post. Here you can see that it says S. So it is we at KB who have created this post.

263
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,176
And you log in to your logins.

264
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:24,320
So you don't move either. I don't think it can touch it either.

265
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,160
And then we come to cataloging rules.

266
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:32,256
According to RDA, we are now cataloging.

267
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:40,148
And then it should be like this. In cataloging rules, you choose Marc/ISBD.

268
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:54,544
We use ISBD characters if needed, or they come automatically when converting to Marc and sometimes you have to insert ISBD characters as well.

269
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58.880
On this book we cataloged now we have not had to.

270
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:03.488
And then we have cataloging language.

271
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:12,722
And it is Swedish here and it should always be Swedish if we primarily catalog.

272
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,008
And it is also automatically set then.

273
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:26,659
So you don't move either. One should not mix the cataloging language with the language on which the book is written because it is already stated in the instance of works.

274
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:32,672
And the last one here, cataloging body. Here is the Marc/Cooperative Cataloging Program

275
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:42,263
And this one will be converted when saving the post, into Libris library/cooperative cataloging program.

276
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:50,237
When you produce this template, very much stands in English but it is then converted when you save the mail.

277
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55.712
Now we were actually done with this post.

278
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:04,145
The last thing you do when you have to save it is that you click on this tool at the far end here and then you click on "Create mail".

279
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,232
This green button with a goat.

280
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,560
And we can do that here so we can see what happens.

281
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
That's how

282
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:23,369
And then you have to put on stocks later, but it is another course where we teach to put on stocks.

283
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:34,056
So now I have shown you how to catalog a book in original language. Primary catalogization.
