1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34.560
I never had a genuine contact with the school that they

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,920
actually cared or how I felt.

3
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,359
It was just, you should do this and do this and do it

4
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,719
Here and came here and all that.

5
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,000
You are better when you are in school.

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,200
Once I was home most of the time I barely had

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
any contact with the school.

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,679
They called and said that if not you do this then you get f in it

9
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,479
Here's the course and.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,679
They just pressed.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,880
They didn't understand as well.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,159
But once I came to school, then it was

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01.719
also.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,239
Well, you are here now when it suits you.

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,159
And it wasn't like,

16
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07.519
-The fun that you are here now!

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
Once I was home from school I had nothing

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,719
Good life, no health really.

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,920
I sat at home and ate sweets and drank soda and energy drinks.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,079
Was like malnourished and I had computer games as abuse.

21
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,719
It sounds awful to say that a pandemic was needed to

22
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,719
I would do school, but that was what was needed.

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,480
When I was home so the school didn't want me to work

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,920
at home at all without they just wanted me to come

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,120
to school and do that and they didn't want to care about

26
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,040
My solutions to work remotely.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,480
I was home the whole seven, eight, nine and then it was

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,079
Not until one in one that I began to come

29
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,879
back to school.

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,680
I got the chance to start at a less adapted little school

31
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,680
And then it felt like I got another chance and the teachers

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,920
believed in me that I could actually succeed when I got

33
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57.040
go about eight and then it felt like I had more time on me

34
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,920
To learn and then perform in nine.

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,239
Now I have found the right line in high school, children and leisure,

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,799
and i have got some adjustments like most

37
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,879
Teachers follow, but it is still not quite.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,919
That they have perceived that they should follow it.

39
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,319
At this school.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,879
So it was.

41
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,759
Everyone had had this time when you were burnt out, one was

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,919
At home and you were sick for a longer period.

43
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,599
And it wasn't something I could explain to

44
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,439
My classmates before.

45
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,879
It wasn't so I could explain why I was home

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,199
Or why I didn't want to be at school.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,879
But now it was like.

48
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,159
We sat for hours and just talked about what we could say about

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,479
This was why I was home.

50
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,439
We were constantly discussing it and it was nice

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45.560
That someone understood.

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
One reason why I could get back to

53
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,360
The school was then again the relationship between

54
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,400
Pupil and teacher.

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,199
It was that they asked questions and they had.

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,159
Therefore, there are very specific questions and there were many meetings

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06.800
Before you started at school itself because they wanted to get to know

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,120
me as a person and know my needs so they could take it on

59
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,800
Sig and tie together.

60
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,960
Then once you started school and then it was at Bellevue

61
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,280
high school where I would supplement

62
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,199
My elementary school grades.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,800
Then there was a corridor that suited me.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,840
There were 15 students approximately divided into four classrooms

65
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,400
Maybe and then it was a quiet atmosphere during the lesson.

66
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,719
Fewer students.

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,879
Then you get easier help of course.

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,120
It becomes more individual.

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Plus that one had individual schedules that I think is one

70
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,599
Key to be able to cope with the school.

71
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,639
Autumn term there, when I started at the new school so

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,639
Was I at home pretty much anyway, but it was for

73
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,800
that I was not able to, because I was not used to

74
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,080
That pace.

75
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,159
So I was pretty much gone.

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,439
But then it gradually got better and we had good calls

77
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03.319
With the school about how I felt and stuff.

78
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,199
Now in high school I have a good mentor because he is

79
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07.800
Also one.

80
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,400
He sees me and knows what I need help with and understands

81
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,479
And pepper me.

82
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,560
It is like that is what is required.

83
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,639
And so it is with some other teachers.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,399
It was very much that made it one

85
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,439
So big change.

86
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,160
I had teachers who cared and understood and had background

87
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,040
To treat those with NPF.

88
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,759
I had friends.

89
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,759
I knew how to do in the dining room for example.

90
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38.560
I was no longer afraid to go there.

91
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,720
I had a very structured day.

92
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,920
I always knew what to do at school.

93
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
It was never so that I got there and so it was over me.

94
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,480
We're going to have outdoor day or something like that

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,439
were no surprises.

96
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52.040
It was good.

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,959
I felt that.

98
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01.920
Instead of me being to become

99
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,360
limited and treat like i was normal so i got to have

100
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,600
the problems I had and so the teachers learned

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,560
to deal with me.
