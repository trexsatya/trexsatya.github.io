The Catalog Care function means that you can move your library's stock from one item to another.

2
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:27,141
This can be done, for example, if a duplicate has been created in Libris or if one's stock has ended up wrong when it has been added via Libri's acquisition routine.

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:32,000
I can only move stocks for the one (s) I have permission for.

4
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:41,135
To see what Sigler I have permission for, I click on my name in the right corner and look at the roller list with Sigler.

5
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,877
I can also go under Settings and look here under active sigel.

6
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:55,552
Under Settings there are also contact information for Libris customer service if I need rights other than the ones I have.

7
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,577
Under the heading Catalog Care is an instructional text for how to move stocks.

8
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,407
I start by searching the title in Libris.

9
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:15,148
In order for the items to appear in directory care, I must click on the flag at each post.

10
00:01:15,463 --> 00:01:22,209
I do this either directly in the hit list or by going into each description.

11
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,344
Now the number 2 is visible in directory care and I can click there to move the stock.

12
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
Now I will choose the sender and recipient.

13
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:39,584
I click on Choose the sender and select the mail that I want to move from.

14
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:43,894
Now I see all Sigler who have stocks on the title.

15
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:48,800
If I happened to choose the wrong sender, I click on the cross in the corner and choose.

16
00:01:49,757 --> 00:01:55,907
Then I choose the recipient.
 I can only choose the entry that I have not already chosen as a sender.

17
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:59,167
Now I see the Sigler who have stocks on this post.

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,744
When I have chosen the recipient, I click on the sigel of my library and then on the "Move stock" button.

19
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:16,704
When I click on "Moving stock", a pop-up box comes up asking if I want to flag the sender.

20
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:23,104
Here I can do in different ways.
 If it is so that my library is the only thing that has stocks on this post,

21
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:32,285
That it has been created a duplicate that I will delete, then I can print "no", so that it becomes easier to find the post and remove it, because the flag remains.

22
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,952
If only a stock item is wrong and not a duplicate I can print "yes".

23
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:47,297
When I have deleted a possible double and am finished and want to clear the flags, I click on my name again and choose "Clean flags".

24
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:56,343
If it is a duplicate, but it turns out that other libraries also have stocks on it, so that they also have to move their stock before it can be deleted,

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,066
Then I can send a CXZ message to them and ask them to move their stock.

26
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:09,184
Information on how to send and monitors CXZ messages can be found on KB's website under Libris and Breach lists.
