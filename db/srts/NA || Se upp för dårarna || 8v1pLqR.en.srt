1
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.080
Watch out for the fools.
 The fools are closed.

2
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
Watch out for the fools.
 The fools are closed.

3
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.960
Does he understand what he says?

4
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.600
Yasmin and dilek!
 Take care.
 Have a good day!

5
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.520
Thank you, the same to you.
 We are in a hurry.
 You also.

6
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.320
-See up for the fools - the fools are closed.
 -Is it so hard to say the "doors"?

7
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.720
-You do not give a flattering image.
 -The Swedish cowardice is well famous?

8
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.360
-Is this an unfortunate tendency?
 -A in hell unhappy tendency.

9
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.760
-Is that your dad?
 -Id a pattern?

10
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.400
I want to demonstrate with my dissertation how we overwhelm responsibility.

11
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.160
I thought it was him.

12
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.400
A society that encourages citizens not to intervene is rotten.

13
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.440
-A community that digs its grave.
 -He is embarrassing.

14
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.120
Tjena, car tires!

15
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.080
You should not give up on my acid, because then you get to do with me!

16
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.480
Are you a police officer, right?

17
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.320
Spån head!

18
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.800
Stay!
 Damn!
 Damn shit!

19
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.200
What are you doing?
 Are you not really wise?!

20
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.800
-I do not have time!
 -Boken young people!

21
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.440
How did it go?

22
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.400
Are you dead?

23
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.280
Yes, I wonder if I'm not.

24
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.640
-Boken, what hurt it did!
 And you?
 -Yes...

25
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.520
-I'm intact.
 -How nice.
 Ouch!

26
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.200
-Com, I'll help you.
 -Thanks.

27
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.720
-Are you searching too?
 -Yes.
 Yasmin.

28
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.560
Elin.

29
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.040
Now you are still!
 Lay still!

30
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.320
Two!

31
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.680
God, how fast you were!

32
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.920
-"Patriarchal", what does it mean?
 -Fatherly.

33
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.720
-Elin enecke.
 -That's me.
 - What is this?

34
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.120
-The call.
 -What then?

35
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.680
Hi Elin!
 You are Ulf's daughter, I understand.
 Come here.

36
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.400
You will not remember this, but I met you when you were little.

37
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.320
-What has made you search?
 -I was born with police genes.

38
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.080
I want to stir a bit in the macho pine.

39
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.320
Well, and why do you want to become a police officer?

40
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.640
Mom was robbed, so I want to stop the violence.

41
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.200
Then you help people and so on.
 It is good.

42
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.360
-I want to work with people.
 -I need a job.
 I'm kidding.

43
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.760
My dad and my brother are cops.

44
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.440
I will be a good police officer.

45
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.960
-What is it for the mark on the sweater?
 -Cinesian Marine Corps.

46
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.560
If I am going to do an arrest, I know exactly how the guy works.

47
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.480
I know how his mother thinks.
 I know how he had it.

48
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.480
The most important thing is to know how citizens work.

49
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.640
-What has made you search?
 -I want to change the view of the police.

50
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.880
-Is it a problem, right?
 -No, but there is blood on the forehead.

51
00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.800
-Then let's see here ... here, take this one.
 -Thanks.

52
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:13.120
I got a bang before.
 I collided with a girl.
 Thanks!

53
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.040
Fuck!
 You, this is not holding.
 Come, we pull.

54
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.160
-Where are we going?
 -To emergency.
 My mom works there.

55
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.320
-DemiGllo, was that what you were called?
 -TemoGlu.

56
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.440
-What happened?
 -We crashed.

57
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.400
-Croken?
 - Do you feel ill?
 -No not at all.

58
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.880
Let's see...

59
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:50.840
It's not as dangerous as it looks.
 You don't have to be sewn.

60
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.200
I'll take and wash and change.

61
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.040
It was forever since I did this.

62
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.400
Not bad for the ear-nose-throat doctor.

63
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.120
I'm actually trying to solve this!
 How did it go on the test?

64
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.600
Good good good.

65
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.040
Now let's see how this goes.

66
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:26.440
My dad is also a doctor.
 Although he does not work like it ... shit the same.

67
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.920
Can't I invite you to dinner?
 That's my fault.
 Come tonight.

68
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.360
-What have you done with your head?
 -Nothing.
 I slammed with a girl.

69
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.640
-The did they put you to call you car tires?
 -No, "dilek, school horror".

70
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:50.920
A moment.
 What happened to your head?
 Come and sit down here.

71
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.480
Sit here.

72
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.680
Was it a butcher who did this?
 This must be sewn!

73
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:14.040
-They said I don't have to sew.
 -How can they do?

74
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.960
-No, not it!
 Not the Turkish bag!
 -Yes!

75
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.560
-Do we deaf?
 -It is called be-deaf.

76
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.400
-And the answer is no.
 -As you wish.

77
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.880
-You are always wet.
 -Wear and horny.

78
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.080
I invited a girl from the samples to dinner.
 Are you going on the floor?

79
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:05.720
Apparently.
 I didn't know if it was okay, but the guys are on me.

80
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.960
I fix dinner for you before I leave.

81
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.880
-What have you done with your head?
 -Nothing.
 It is quiet.

82
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.200
- Hi, Sinan.
 -Hello.

83
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.680
-Is everything packed?
 -Yes, everything is packed down.

84
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.240
Good.
 - But honey, you didn't say what happened to your head.

85
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.800
She crashed with a girl!
 And it was the worst bang, she just flew!

86
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.920
She was bleeding from her head.
 The girl's mother pasted the wound again.

87
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.320
When Dad got to see it, he got so angry that he Turkishly without stunning!

88
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:10.160
-So it wasn't.
 I wasn't angry.
 -Dad, you were fat angry.

89
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.960
Look, the old man.
 The main thing is ... sorry!
 Main ...!

90
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.840
Sorry!
 The main thing is that everything is well now.

91
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.840
We have to go now.
 - Come, old man.

92
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.960
-Erik sits and waits in the car.
 -I must go too.

93
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.520
Put on the bandage first.
 Put on the bandage now.
 Put it on!

94
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.560
-Dard ... -put it on.
 Listen to your dad.

95
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.520
-Thanks.
 -Let's go.

96
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.800
-Hello Hello!
 -Bye!

97
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.720
Thanks.

98
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.760
-Bye daddy!
 I love you.
 -Bye.

99
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.840
Chickedikow-wow-wow, who do we have here

100
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.520
-If not the adorable DI-Di-Di-dilek!

101
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.920
Put it on.
 It protects against bacilli.

102
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.080
Of course you have to keep the bag.
 Listen.

103
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.240
c. soundpip-pip

104
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.040
-I love you.
 -I love you too.

105
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.240
-Heah so fun tonight!
 -You too.
 Bye.
 - Bye!

106
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.920
-Hay, Yasmin!
 -Hello!

107
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.400
Hello Darling!

108
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.360
-Dilek's second bagi-Di-Bagi-Di-bag.
 -Bye!

109
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.400
-Have you badly in your head?
 -Yes.

110
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.520
I thought it was some fly.

111
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.920
You going out tonight?
 The guys will light up on the bandage.
 Yowsa, yowsa!

112
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.520
Yes, now let's see here.
 There she lives.
 There she lives.

113
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.200
How nice!
 Thanks!

114
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:55.800
-Are you coming?
 The puddle is finished.
 -I bring a couple of cold.

115
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.960
-I know her well.
 -Elin?

116
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.480
-Yes, Ellen!
 -Yes.
 Elin ...

117
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.800
-Do you know who more lives there?
 -No.

118
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.280
-Henke Larsson!
 -Oh really?

119
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.080
Hello!
 Welcome!
 How fun.

120
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.000
-Good.
 -My favvo.
 Tell now, then.

121
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.760
We came to Sweden twelve years ago.
 I was only eight.

122
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.400
Dad was one of Istanbul's best heart surgeons.

123
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:39.840
But one day the police came.
 He had operated on someone who was on the run.

124
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.880
He just does his job.
 We got a hell.
 We had to escape.

125
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:53.720
We ended up here.
 "Sweden also needs thoracic surgeons," Dad thought.

126
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.880
-But he was ttt.
 -TTT?

127
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.280
Turkish thoracic surgeon running a subway.

128
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.520
-Is it true?
 -To make a long story short.

129
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:11.480
He dips because he is not allowed to work with what he wants.
 He has given up.

130
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.800
Mom, on the other hand, works as an optician.

131
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.120
One day a Svenne slips in and will try a pair of sunglasses.

132
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.280
She fell in love and left Dad.

133
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.280
And in addition, the little acid gets shit in the plug.
 So it looks to me.

134
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.320
No wonder you want to become a police officer.

135
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:39.000
I want to do something important.
 Something where I can use my background.

136
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.120
I believe that there is justice.

137
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.520
Do you think I'm a pretto?

138
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.760
No.
 I just think it's so cool with your commitment.

139
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:58.240
-The bowl for it and for you.
 -Bowl.

140
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.360
I'm tired of my family.
 The Uniform family.
 The brother is also military.

141
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:10.600
As if the other plots were not enough.
 Am I independent?

142
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.720
-No, you probably have your reasons.
 -What are they, then?
 Actually?

143
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.560
-I'm not a shink.
 -Fan, then!
 They should see.

144
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.280
-Good!
 Go, girl!
 Bowl!
 -Bowl.

145
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.840
Okay!
 I have a dream!

146
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.920
-What is it then?
 -This is ... it's ...

147
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:49.480
It is not to become a doctor, as Dad wants, and inherit grandfather's medical bag.

148
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:55.920
Oh, it's the worst trauma.
 No.
 I'm going to be jus ...

149
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.360
I will become Minister of Justice.
 Your turn.

150
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.520
-You will think I'm ridiculous.
 -Try me.

151
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.760
Do you have to talk English all the time?

152
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.560
SOR ... sorry.

153
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.880
Okay.

154
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.520
I would like to work with horses.

155
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.840
-But you already do.
 -In a stable.
 I mean like Barard.

156
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.320
-Bay-what then?
 Baryard.
 -Yes.
 Damn, are you completely gone, right?

157
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.880
No, but that's not my thing.
 Snobbly racing riders and such.

158
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:45.160
It's the horse.
 Take the feeling of being one with the horse.

159
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.640
Speed.
 The atmosphere.

160
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.480
It would not be entirely wrong to be a riding police officer, right?

161
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:04.520
You know?
 You and I are needed at the police college.
 It's just that.

162
00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.120
-Bowl.
 For us.
 -For us.

163
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.000
-I am named Henke, and I live here.
 -Hey!

164
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.760
-Ni is doing well?
 -So damn good!
 Sit down, panky!

165
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.280
-Hello!
 -Here Yasmin.
 - Henke.

166
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.680
Larsson.

167
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.280
-What has happened to your head?
 -I was so customer.

168
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.080
She stumbled upon me who sat down.

169
00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.760
And then we had to go to mom.

170
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:06.040
There we passed the whole queue without paying a splash!

171
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:14.080
Mom would sew.
 But it didn't help, because then Yasmin went home.
 Then...

172
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:21.280
... her dad brought out the anxiety bag with this bandage!

173
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.120
Which she has had to walk around!

174
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.880
Do you understand?
 Worst sick day!

175
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.880
I'll get into that school easily as a plaque.

176
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.440
You probably need a cup of tea.

177
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.720
Yes thank you.

178
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.880
The c. soundtter door opens

179
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.800
-Are you awake?
 -Where have you been?

180
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.840
Do you know what time it is?
 Why don't you wear the bandage?

181
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.360
- Hall, wait a while.
 Have you been drinking?
 - Yes, I've been drinking.

182
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:43.320
- It's not good to drink in your condition.
 - Otherwise, I'm getting mad at this.

183
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.360
What's wrong with you?
 Why do you do this?

184
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.200
Why can't you speak Swedish?

185
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:58.160
I drive a subway.
 It is enough to be able to: "Watch out for the fools."

186
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.960
Stop!
 Just stop, stop, stop!

187
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.680
"Watch out for the doors!"

188
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.960
I get brain haemorrhage on you!
 You are a fool!

189
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.840
Don't come with that bitterness.
 "I'm a subway driver."

190
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.200
It's not even about it, but about making yourself a damn victim!

191
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:31.040
Yes.
 You are a thoracic surgeon out at your fingertips.

192
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:37.240
I know you.
 You know everything you want.
 You're just so damn proud.

193
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.640
You are so damn idiot!

194
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.880
That pride made mom stack-

195
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.640
-and will make me stick!

196
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.360
How can you talk to your dad like that?

197
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.680
Dad.
 I am not stupid.

198
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:23.280
When no one looks at, you do movements and mumble medical terms.

199
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.280
But I see.
 I see everything.

200
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.600
And I'm tired of this.

201
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.880
For God's sake, Dad.
 I love you.
 But you have to sharpen yourself.

202
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.760
Good night.

203
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.640
Good night.

204
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.480
-Good night.
 -Good night.

205
00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:48.400
Watch out for the fools ... Watch out for the doors.
 The doors are closing.

206
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.920
YES!

207
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.560
Elin!
 Are you coming?
 Suede and sweep properly.

208
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:22.120
Petra!
 Rinse and cool her, and then the green sweat cover.

209
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.640
-Do you on the course?
 -Yes.
 It went bad.

210
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.880
-Heh ... -But God ...

211
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.760
Is this you work?
 How nice it was!

212
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:12.320
You forgot this.
 I thought you needed it.
 A hose bell!

213
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.040
-The fun ... -I couldn't help it.

214
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.080
Excuse me to just extinguished.
 Was Henke Schyst against you?

215
00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.960
You have the nicest guy in the world.
 He made sure I got home by taxi.

216
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:33.360
"You should not ride a subway when you are packed. I know, I'm a guardian."

217
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.840
He probably thinks he's Clark Kent.

218
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.520
I don't want to be with a space hero.
 It gets so magnificent.

219
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.880
"Kind".
 I will soon spit on that word.

220
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.160
Turkish Delight?
 May I take one?

221
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.080
-Does it taste good?
 -So there.

222
00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:02.280
Maybe I'm just in a boring phase.
 Or I'm back.

223
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.440
We can't hold on and bend.

224
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.640
We have more important stuff ahead of us.
 A little bird whispered in my ear-

225
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.600
-That we have obviously gone on!

226
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.840
Now the physical tests are waiting!

227
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.080
Don't take yourself out too soon, the bride.

228
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.320
Hello and welcome you should be!

229
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:35.520
Stefan Ljungsäter.
 Today I replace Roland Hultberg who is sick.

230
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:42.600
I am the director of the operations but will today take care of the physical tests.

231
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.880
What a hottie!

232
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.840
Impossible mission.
 Is that what we are facing today?

233
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.200
Answer No.
 If you have trained properly, there will probably be no problems.

234
00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:02.360
If you've been a little bit over the past two weeks: Throw yourself in the wall.

235
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.520
Good!
 Do we have any questions?
 - Yes?

236
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.480
Surely the results requirements for women are not the same as for men?

237
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.080
That is correct.
 I will come to it.

238
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.800
-More questions?
 - Yes?
 -What does the test doll weigh to be lifted?

239
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.920
-Higher!
 -What does the lifting doll weigh in the lifting test?

240
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:39.640
The doll you should lift weighs 77 kg.
 Same for everyone, no exceptions.

241
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.040
Does it feel hard?

242
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.120
-Okay, are you tagged?
 -YES!

243
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.520
-Are you tagged?
 -YES!

244
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.200
Come on!
 Good!

245
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.280
-It is good!
 -Come on now!

246
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.680
Come on!
 Yeah!
 Come on!

247
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.520
-Come on.
 -It's good, come on!

248
00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.720
Good.

249
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.360
Damn, you were awesome.
 Good work!

250
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.040
129 doesn't feel good!

251
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.080
Pick her off the track!
 - Work!

252
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.320
What happens?

253
00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.480
Okay?
 Okay.

254
00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:31.600
Yes, is anyone else who wants to try my mouth-to-mouth method?

255
00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.720
-What are we doing here?
 -Don't start again.
 I don't pallet.

256
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:54.240
Tjena, young people!
 - Hi, little!
 Have you longed for me?

257
00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.440
-Tjena, Henke!
 How did the flooring go?
 -We won.

258
00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.120
I have threatened a new club.

259
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.640
It's my day, so I have to decide everything.
 - You write, Yasmin.

260
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.600
I start, then Yasmin, then dad.
 Then you can write DYP on the score card.

261
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.960
-What then "DYP"?
 -Type type.

262
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.080
-Do you talk or are you going to play?
 -I intend to do both.

263
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.800
Mom should not root among the bottles.
 I know exactly what we should have.

264
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.320
Here, honey.

265
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.440
And now he comes!

266
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.960
Sinan, the swing's sultan!

267
00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:49.560
-You don't boast about himself.
 -Sch!
 Dad concentrates.

268
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.000
-It became the nail!
 -It is called nail.

269
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.920
-I said so.
 -I give up.

270
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.280
Don't do it when I have my head in the nail.

271
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.840
-Whisky, Dad?
 -Javisst.

272
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.640
Here, Uffe.

273
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.960
My name is Ulf.

274
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:29.360
-How does the dissertation go?
 -No can say to me.

275
00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.840
Not much resistance.
 I lack challenges.
 Been there, done that ...

276
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.360
Bought the t-shirt.

277
00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:45.240
I hadn't heard it.
 Lill-Lieutenant, what will it be of you?

278
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.080
The captain is me.
 I was going to be general.

279
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:53.280
Sure, why not?
 But you have to control the place.

280
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:59.080
The defense staff is a joke.
 How do you solve their structural problems?

281
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.680
I had the second best result of the girls on the freezing test.

282
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.720
-Who had better?
 -What does it matter?

283
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:13.640
-Yasmin.
 She was damn good.
 -Yeah, is that the Turk?
 Demiro-Gl-Gl ...

284
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:21.800
Demiroglu.
 Her parents are from Turkey.
 How do you know her?

285
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.760
You have to go when your little girl is going out into the big world.

286
00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.320
Check out the competition, talk for the item.
 In this case you.

287
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:37.600
-And it doesn't hurt to be called Enecke.
 -I don't want your help.

288
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.400
But you are likely to need it.

289
00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.160
Why are you so mean?

290
00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.120
Little friend, I care about you.
 You are looking for a profession-

291
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.720
-Where you need to be stress -resistant, tolerant, honest ...

292
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.560
-Se something of it in on you?
 -Ulf!

293
00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.640
A little she has to tolerate if she is to become a police officer.

294
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.920
Patrolling police, it's no play.

295
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.080
She wants to become a riding police officer.

296
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.720
Nämen, Lilla Hjärtat, Now you have got it.

297
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.760
Baked together your dreams.
 Adorable!

298
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:27.760
It seems wise, considering your experience.
 Fully realistic.

299
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.840
What gives you the right to constantly turn on me?
 Any academic points?

300
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.320
You laugh, but I know what I can do.

301
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:44.120
I'm not as cynical as you, and I'm terribly happy about that.

302
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.520
Ouch!

303
00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.120
-Elin!
 Did you just want to leave me there?
 -Yes.

304
00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.480
I'm so damn tired of your style.
 If you pull, you pull for good.

305
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.440
Elin?
 Elin?

306
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.640
And then it gets off!

307
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:46.040
It worked.
 I can breathe again.
 Then we can only see if the other works.

308
00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.120
Hi, you've come to Elin.
 Leave a message and I'll call.

309
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.520
Call and say where you are somewhere.

310
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.560
It's so sexy, this line.

311
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.600
You are nice, you, Miss Enecke.

312
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.120
-Intensive.
 -You are not so stupid either.

313
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.800
-Is it okay if I close my eyes a bit?
 -You do it.

314
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.200
C. sounds

315
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.840
Hello!

316
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:18.720
I can not sleep.
 I think of mom.
 May I lie with you?

317
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:25.360
Obviously you get.
 But we can go in to you, it's much nicer there.

318
00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.400
Leave a message.

319
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.320
Hello.
 I meant what I said.

320
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:45.000
It was damn bad style to just leave me with your parents, and ...

321
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.480
But I don't want you to be sad.
 So that...

322
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:57.080
And then I get a little worried too, because you don't ... Damn, come home!

323
00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.720
Do you think mom will come back?

324
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:08.160
I do not know.
 But it will be good.
 Try to sleep now.

325
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.480
c. sound signal

326
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:35.080
Yasmin!
 Yasmin, wake up!
 Your phone rings!

327
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:42.080
Yasmin!
 Hurry, then!
 It is ringing!
 Hurry up!
 Hurry, then!
 Respond!

328
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.040
-Hello?
 -It's Henke.

329
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.360
I didn't know who to call.
 I don't know where Elin is.

330
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.240
-I thought she was with you.
 -No.

331
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:06.680
-What is it, Henke?
 -I hope you can fall asleep now.

332
00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.280
-Good night.
 -Good night.

333
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.920
-Who was it?
 -A friend.

334
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.240
-Who is Henke?
 -A friend.

335
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:31.280
-Is that your guy?
 -No, it's Elin's guy.

336
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:37.040
Why does he call you, then?
 Why does he call so late?

337
00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.120
-Sleep now.
 -He is probably in love with you.

338
00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.800
-Stop!
 -He is probably it.

339
00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.440
-You are stupid.
 -You too.

340
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.760
-Ravi!
 -Heah, dilek!
 - Hi, the doctor!

341
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:42.800
Always just as serious.
 Someone has to drive the train.
 Is it me?
 Is it you?

342
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.560
No, it's you!
 Come!

343
00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:02.240
-You don't say "watch out for" ... doors?
 Only in horror traffic.

344
00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:11.280
C.Sangen Wonderful Morning C.Sangen Wonderful Morning we have here

345
00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.200
c.Sangdet is you, it's me ...

346
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.000
She is, it's safe!
 - Mom!

347
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:35.440
-Darling!
 -The fun that you are here, mom!

348
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:41.120
-What are you doing here?
 -I had the roads past and thought ...

349
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.600
I have a little run.
 So I have to go.

350
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:51.640
Sure, of course.
 But we see you at the play?

351
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:57.120
Nothing can make me miss Dilek's magic violin game.

352
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.160
-Mom, I have to go now.
 -Bye.

353
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.640
-Bye daddy!
 -Bye.

354
00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.680
- How are you, Sinan?
 -I feel good.

355
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.280
-Lite alone, maybe.
 -We are all alone.

356
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.680
You have changed.

357
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.440
I must go.

358
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.400
-Where have you been?
 What has happened?
 -I am nothing!

359
00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.280
Elin, I don't hear what you say!

360
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.360
I've been with him!

361
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.600
-With whom?
 -With Stefan!

362
00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:08.680
-What Stefan?
 -Stefan Ljungsäter!

363
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:15.000
-It's not true!
 -I wish it wasn't.

364
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:20.320
-I'd you in love with him?
 -No, he's the worst mucus!

365
00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.320
Elin, it's hard to keep up now.
 What did you think?

366
00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.320
I didn't think so much!

367
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:33.120
You, I have to take a customer.
 I'll call you as soon as I can.

368
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.120
-Is it closed?
 -Yes.
 No.
 I'll just open.

369
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.000
Thanks.

370
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.320
What are you doing here?

371
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:03.120
-She never came home last night.
 -Yeah.
 Well, what a strange thing.

372
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.480
The battery for the mobile is probably over.

373
00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:16.760
And then she is stubborn and a little varnish.
 Do you know what I think she has done?

374
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:22.560
-That she has moved out to the horses.
 -Do you think so?

375
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:28.240
Damn, how smart you are!
 And how fucking stupid is I?

376
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.320
I haven't even thought that thought.

377
00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:45.240
-What long it took.
 -He was here.
 Henke.

378
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:51.600
-What did you say, then?
 -You probably got to the stable.

379
00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:56.520
I hate to lie, grasp it!
 Elin, you have to tell me!

380
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.960
Where the hell have you been?

381
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.680
-Do you be at work?
 -I will go soon.

382
00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:08.680
-Where have you been?
 -I needed to be for myself.

383
00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:14.640
-I went to the stable and slept there.
 -I know you slept in the stable.

384
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:20.160
-Why did you ask, then?
 -You could have heard from you.

385
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.760
-Have you listened to the answering machine?
 -No, because I have no batteries.

386
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.120
Damn sunny in today, right?

387
00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.320
-Sorry.
 -Who fuck are you really?

388
00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:45.320
What do you want with me and yourself?

389
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.760
Check out Yasmin.
 She is passionate about something, but you ...

390
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:58.960
Welcome!
 I would have taken care of you on the freezing tests a while ago.

391
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:05.080
But then I got a flu, so Stefan Ljungsäter had to move out.

392
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.560
With that honor, I understand.

393
00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:13.920
Hörni, last round you were 3,500 who fought.

394
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.880
Now we are down to 780 people.

395
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:24.960
The number of places we have to offer is 528.
 Continue fight.

396
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:32.800
These two days you should do an acting test and psychology conversation.

397
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:38.400
You will write an essay and will be interviewed by two police officers.

398
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.920
Some questions?

399
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.720
Okay, then we drive.
 Good luck!

400
00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:52.960
-Are you a little happy today, right?
 -To meet the idiot Pungsäter.

401
00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.880
He doesn't remember you.
 You are probably part of his mental email box.

402
00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:07.360
-Swrit your impulsivity.
 -I can bridle it.

403
00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.000
Today I have control over my life.

404
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:19.800
What do you see most as?
 Woman or immigrant?

405
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.840
Human I see me as.

406
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:32.040
Yes, Elin ... The police profession is not completely unknown to you?

407
00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:37.640
-No.
 -So what is your motivation?

408
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:43.640
-My motivation?
 -Yes, your very own.

409
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:49.000
I think I as a woman can contribute another way of thinking.

410
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:54.240
Maybe with my presence I can have a calming effect in situations.

411
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:59.920
That I am perceived as less threatening than a male colleague.

412
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.400
You master the language extremely.

413
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:10.200
-Ar it been extra important to you?
 -Yes.

414
00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:14.400
-How do you look at your background?
 -I'm proud of it.

415
00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:19.360
-Do you feel that you blend in?
 -Yes absolutely.

416
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.600
Conny: Should we train Muslims?

417
00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:28.600
When talking about the troll: It's pork today.

418
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:34.520
Isn't it a little hard for you to be here on the immigrant quota?

419
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.640
I must not be provoked.

420
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:52.240
-Something doesn't match him.
 -Type that his brain should be replaced.

421
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:58.640
-I think he's a criminal.
 -Criminal?
 What do you get it from?

422
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.520
If he is punished I will find out.

423
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.920
Oh really?

424
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:10.280
-To you're called Enecke, right?
 -Just.

425
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.520
Check out a Conny Svensson.

426
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:21.080
Suddenly it fits with Dad's help.
 Why would I do that?

427
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:27.240
It is an unpleasant racist devil that is entering school.

428
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.800
-Is he's been stupid against your Turkish friend?
 -Do you hear how you sound?

429
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.120
He harasses her when no one sees.

430
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:41.280
-Is not the black skulls easily offended?
 -What the hell are you saying?
 Are you crazy?

431
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.760
Little, I'm just kidding.
 You are so grateful.

432
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.840
GL-GL-GL-GL-GL ...

433
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:08.240
Life is not just a play.
 It's a dance on roses too.

434
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.960
Damn too!

435
00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:01.200
-Thanks, please singoalla!
 -Yasmin was what my name was.

436
00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:08.160
Yes of course!
 Now I remember!
 But you look like Singoalla!

437
00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.160
-I know those who live there.
 Ellen.
 -Elin, yes.

438
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:18.640
Yes.
 And do you know who lives there more?
 Henke Larsson!

439
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.960
-But hi!
 Henke Larsson!
 -Come in.

440
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:30.960
Elin said she would be delayed and you would feel at home.

441
00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.600
-You do well by this time.
 -Is I here too often?
 Now I'm ashamed!

442
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:41.320
No, puck.
 We love company.

443
00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:46.680
It's cozy to have you here.

444
00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:52.280
-In addition, I win over you in TP.
 -In your dreams, Henke.

445
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.400
-Joho.
 -No.

446
00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.080
Damn, I have to take a shower.

447
00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:08.240
-Can you fix tea for so long?
 -Absolutely.

448

c. sounding pot piper

449
00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.240
Can you pick up a towel in the large closet?

450
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.920
I am coming now.

451
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.720
-Yes, excuse.
 Well ... -Gee here the towel.
 I'm freezing.

"Ulla has a puppy. Kalle has a cat. Nisse sits still on a chair."

453
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.000
"Anna dances in her beautiful k-skirt."

454
00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:50.480
-Waver skirt.
 -Skirt.
 "Eva is out with little brother."

455
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.640
"The sun is shining. Eva has a new k-skirt."

456
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:56.880
-Ny skirt.
 -Ny skirt ...

457
00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.520
I am home!

458
00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.040
Hello!
 What are you sitting here for?

459
00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.760
-Is not yasmin here?
 -No.

460
00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.920
What is it?
 Surely no one has died?

461
00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.840
Elin, I have to tell you one thing.

462
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.360
I have kissed ...

463
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.800
... someone.

464
00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:41.800
It was great that you told me.
 We should be honest with each other.

465
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.160
In fact, I have also kissed someone.

466
00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:51.040
-Have you also kissed anybody?
 -Japp.

467
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:55.200
-What then, now?
 -No not now!

468
00:58:55.360 --> 00:59:02.120
It is not the whole world.
 We have had it swaying, a situation arises.

469
00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:09.000
A kiss ... it was just a kiss.
 There was nothing more, right?

470
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.000
No absolutely not.

471
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:16.160
-Did you do anything more?
 -No.
 Nah.

472
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:22.000
-Do you want to know who it was?
 -Absolutely not.

473
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:28.640
I think we just forget this.

474
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.640
-It was yasmin.
 -Wo?

475
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:37.760
-I kissed Yasmin just recently.
 -What the hell...

476
00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:42.280
-Sorry.
 -What then "sorry"?

477
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:47.480
Henke ... it's so damn run between us.

478
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:53.680
It has been so damn long between us.

479
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.960
You can just go to hell!

480
01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.000
Elin: Cheers for us.

481
01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:48.560
Turkey's new Foreign Minister Mehmet Ipekçi arrived today in Stockholm.

482
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.680
Thick Mehmet!

-Hi Elin!
 How are you?
 -I feel good.

486
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:12.080
-Dad, Dad!
 It was Elin who came!
 -Hello!
 Nice to see you!
 Sit there.

487
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.000
Sit, sit,!

488
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.960
Excuse me, but I'm a little excited.

489
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.560
He is Turkey's new Foreign Minister.
 We went to the same class at Galatasaray.

490
01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.880
We called him thick Mehmet.

491
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:38.320
-Galatasaray is a football team?
 -A neighbourhood.
 We went on a boarding school.

492
01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.200
-I have I told you?
 -Yes, 75,000 times.

493
01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:47.280
-Where was he who kissed on him?
 -No, he wasn't.

494
01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.120
He was just thick and smuggled in lots of sweets.

495
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.760
-And now he is Foreign Minister.
 -How fun!

496
01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.040
Unfortunately, I have to go.
 I would just leave a few stuff to Yasmin.

497
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.440
Are you going already?
 Yes Yes.
 Farewell!

498
01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.000
You follow me to the door, right?

499
01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.720
One thing you should have clear to you: I never want to see you again.

500
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.840
-Joel Bergqvist?
 -Yes.

501
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.240
Yasmin Demiroglu?

502
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.440
No Yasmin Demiroglu?

503
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.760
She is at home and rumors the camel.

504
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.680
No.
 Can anyone imagine where she is?

505
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.920
Yes.
 When she has applied here, she has suffered racist hopes.

506
01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:09.840
Therefore, she does not want to come here.
 Give me an hour and I have her here.

507
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:17.040
One hour.
 That's all I want.
 I interpret it as a yes.

508
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.200
Yasmin!
 I know you're there!

509
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.320
But damn, open the door!

510
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.800
I knew you were here!

511
01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.840
Do not leave because it hits me.
 You ran at 8.30!

512
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.240
-8.48.
 -8.48 or 0.7 does not matter.

513
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.000
No one is better than you!
 No!

514
01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.760
I will still end with Henke.

515
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:56.360
Come, we'll put a little racist there too.
 We don't have time to stand here.

516
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.120
-Are you on the track?
 -Definitely.

517
01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:12.600
You have a seven hell's good friend in that girl.
 You know, huh?

518
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.360
It goes well!
 You do not need to worry.
 You are the wet dream of the corps.

519
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:26.800
Young, talented woman of foreign origin.
 Okay, bad jokes.

520
01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.320
Oh!
 Then it was lunch!

521
01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:35.520
I'm going to daf that Conny bastard.

522
01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.440
I go in and then you keep an eye out.

523
01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.160
YES!

524
01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:26.120
-Tjena Hi!
 And here you stand.
 -Yes, I'll take myself again a bit, just.

525
01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:31.000
-Is it so strenuous?
 -Yes.
 No, it's stimulating.

526
01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:37.320
-You get easily overstimulated.
 -Yes, it can certainly be.

527
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:42.200
Drive hard, you can go a long way!

528
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:42.200
c. soundyasmin coughs

529
01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:45.520
-Thanks!
 -Are you okay?

530
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:51.880
I know a very good grip otherwise, inspired by the Heimlich method.

531
01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:58.560
-It's calming down.
 -Okay.
 I keep your thumb.

532
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.480
-What just happened?
 -You favvo fucks.

533
01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:16.080
-Help!
 Where is he now, then?
 -He went in.

534
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.920
Here I have stuff.

535
01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:24.000
-Is Conny punished?
 -Is Pope Catholic?
 Check this out.

536
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.440
Damage and gross abuse.

537
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:33.480
He sat at Österåker November 2002 to June 2003. Now we have him.

538
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:52.440
-And how did you get this?
 -Does it play any role?

539
01:06:54.280 --> 01:07:00.600
We must not go into the registers and check those who apply without asking.

540
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:08.480
You definitely can't do it.
 This can have serious consequences.

541
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.360
-Is there anything we can do?
 -No has already done too much.

542
01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:19.600
We cannot see between the fingers of your illegal business.

543
01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.720
Our illegal business?
 You can do whatever you want with the information.

544
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.920
We have only taken our responsibility.

545
01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.920
I'm sorry to have to say it, but you are loose.
 Unfortunately.

c. sound "The flower time now comes"

547
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.600
Hi, what a good thing you had!

548
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.880
-Erik, then?
 -He is not coming.

549
01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:04.960
I'm leaving now.
 I sleep with Nisse tonight.
 It's probably best for both of us.

550
01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.760
Yes absolutely.

551
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.080
Call if there is anything.

552
01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.160
I thought you would know.
 It is to cross the limit.

553
01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.680
Thank you for looking past.
 I appreciate your loyalty.

554
01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.440
-I am happy to be at service.
 -We keep in touch.

555
01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.000
-Hello!
 -Hello.

556
01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.360
What the hell have you been doing this time?

557
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.440
Have you put in systems not to answer?

558
01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.800
You have dragged my name in the dirt.

559
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.680
You can forget the police college!

560
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.240
-Mom, what kind of moving class?
 -Do you know somewhere I can live tonight?

561
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.360
You come with us.

562
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:53.040
His world turned black since we moved to Sweden.
 He closed me out.

563
01:10:53.200 --> 01:11:00.600
I didn't reach him.
 I couldn't stand anymore.
 I need the joy.

564
01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.600
-But he is happy now.
 - Right?
 -Yes.

565
01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:12.200
-Will it work now?
 -I do not know.
 I want it.

566
01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.400
-I love your dad.
 -And you chose Erik.

567
01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:24.360
-It's easy to be after -sound.
 -You probably won't worry about Erik.

568
01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:31.080
I don't think he gets depressed.
 He is always kidding.
 He is another kind.

569
01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:39.600
The old man, what about yourself, then?

570
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.720
Shit it is.
 We are totally interrogated.
 We have sabotaged everything.

571
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.360
I wish I was eleven years old and you could do all the good again.

572
01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.040
Sit here and every eleven years again.

573
01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.960
Come.
 Come.

574
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:10.760
You are amazing.
 There is nothing you can't do.
 Nothing.

575
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:16.920
-I admire you so much!
 -There are things I can't do.

576
01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:23.200
Hörtu, it is the same girl who would be Jusissi ... just minister.

577
01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.400
Attorney General.

578
01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.240
I will become Justice Minister.

579
01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.960
Yes, Jussisisominist ...

580
01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.800
Jesustisti ...

581
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:49.600
Jussistim ... damn Swedish languages!

582
01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.360
You have to bring your eye stone!

583
01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:02.960
Take it you.
 It fits in the TV corner.
 Then, then it wasn't much more.

584
01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.440
-How big does it have it?
 -A third.
 His acid lives there too.

585
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.280
Hello!
 I was just thinking I was going out and greeting.
 Hello!

586
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.680
-Sara.
 -Nisses sister.

587
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:22.560
-Elin.
 -I know.

588
01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.160
No, I just wanted to thank.

589
01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:32.560
-Thank?
 -To you dropped him away.

590
01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:38.320
There is no one like Henrik anymore, and then I got a copy.

591
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.160
Yes ... the world is full of shit boots.

592
01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:50.720
Although I think you will find someone, with your lovely mood.

593
01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.120
Henrik has told us.

594
01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:02.840
Do you know that Sara is also horses?
 She competes.
 Very good!

595
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.520
Our next bayrad.

596
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.240
Baryard is called it.

597
01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:15.680
I am selected as a reserve in the national team.
 Great fun!

598
01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:20.800
But I am most happy that I can join.

599
01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:28.160
What fun it was to meet you, Elin!
 Hello with you!
 Fun!

600
01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:36.720
Yes...

601
01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:43.520
I pick up the rest late.
 Nisse can help me with the sofa.

602
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.680
The keys.

603
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:18.360
Mom, I'm so tired of myself.
 I go ahead, I scream and gap.

604
01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:24.880
-It's not very attractive.
 -Do not say so!

605
01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:31.520
You are the only really brave in the family, the only one with civil remedies.

606
01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.520
I wish I was little.
 That you would do all the good again.

607
01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.840
-Now you aren't.
 -I know that.

608
01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:55.600
-Is that police officer?
 -I'm probably fried.

609
01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:00.600
-Do you want that?
 -Yes, I want that.

610
01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:10.120
-What exactly are we doing?
 -You have to trust my gut feeling.

611
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.240
-The guy is a stone sadness!
 -Get it together!

612
01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:24.640
- If Turkey changes, you must be part of the EU.
 - Yes, and that's why we work on it.

613
01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:31.520
- Do you still prison journalists?
 - No, they are as free as you are.

614
01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:37.280
Mr. Minister, now we're going for lunch.
 Swedish buffet, herring and potatoes ...

615
01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.000
Mr. Minister?
 Mr. Minister?

616
01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.040
Call for the ambulance!

617
01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.200
Turkey's Foreign Minister has collapsed.

619
01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:00.080
Listen.
 I want Sinan Demiroglu.

620
01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:05.720
-What did you say?
 - I want Doctor Sinan Demiroglu.

621
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:12.800
He is a heart surgeon.
 He lives in Stockholm.

622
01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.680
-Elin, we're going home now.
 -No!
 Come on now!

623
01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.880
He wants a Sinan Demiroglu.

624
01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.120
-What is it?
 -A Turkish physician living in Sweden.

625
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:36.920
-He is completely indefinite at that point.
 -Can we get information on ...?

626
01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.960
-What did you say his name was?
 -TemoGlu.

627
01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:46.480
-Sine Demiloro, something ... -Man in his 50s ...

628
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:53.200
-He is a doctor, not a subway driver.
 -Suri, I can help you.

629
01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:59.520
Pulse 140, blood pressure 100/60 and separation 95.

630
01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.360
Heart disease in the genus.

631
01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.640
A case at the highest government level.
 You need your help as a surgeon.

632
01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:14.160
-Now I do not understand.
 -The patient wants you.

633
01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:18.840
-Who is the patient?
 -Turkiet's Foreign Minister.

634
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.960
Thick mehmet ...

635
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.480
Agility?
 What the hell is that?

636
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.320
-Dog dress.
 -In!
 In!

637
01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:40.120
Beware!
 Gently!
 Beware, beware, beware!

638
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:44.880
Suddenly he's just gone.

639
01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.040
-It was you who ended.
 -You can get rid of?

640
01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.160
Only I don't have to hear.
 The horses do not get abrasions in the ears.

641
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:59.000
You are funny, you ... yes, no ... otherwise?

642
01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.360
-We suck.
 We are completely useless.
 -Yes.

643
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:11.440
What do you say about moving in?
 I've always wanted to live with a comedian.

644
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.800
Do you want an ice cream?
 I go shopping, you stay and guard.

645
01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.000
We have a criminal over there.

646
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.760
The doctor!
 The doctor!

647
01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:34.400
The doctor!
 I take over the train.

648
01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.640
-I understand that we are in a hurry.
 -Alt time just as serious.
 Good.
 Hurry!

649
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:46.080
Watch out for the doors.
 The doors are closing.

650
01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.160
Good luck!

651
01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:08.320
-You don't want to look like me at the waist.
 -I think you are beautiful.

652
01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:14.320
Not many people do.
 An old, thick, flabby guy.

653
01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:22.920
-I need information about the case.
 -I call Karolinska directly.

654
01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:32.240
We must start mocking shit at Malin Baryard now that we are not coming in.

655
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:36.680
After all, I have it in the blood.
 Damn too!
 How could it turn out like this?

656
01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:42.120
-We are nice people.
 -Yes is not it?
 Morally infallible.

657
01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.920
Justice Minister ... Tjena ...!

658
01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:52.680
Riding police: Hello then!

659
01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:58.160
-Where there is a poem, right?
 -Yes.
 Verner von Heidenstam.

660
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.680
I thought I recognized it.

661
01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:34.560
Hello Hello.
 - Do not worry.
 I'm here now.
 Everything will be fine.
 Do not worry.

662
01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.840
-Where did he come from?
 -He applied for a job here when I was new.

663
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.680
Surely you will operate me?
 I just trust you.

664
01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:52.720
-What are they doing?
 -Weapons boxes.

665
01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.560
Stay him.
 Stay him!

666
01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.880
Hello!
 Would you look at that!
 A friend and colleague!

667
01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:20.280
I think I've been lost.
 It's not really my neighborhoods.

668
01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:28.200
I can't the country.
 I get spinning of all the red cottages with white knots.

669
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.080
-You keep in my dog.
 -I do.

670
01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:44.520
Nice!

671
01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:51.560
Welcome!
 Nygård, thoracic surgeon.
 I will perform the operation.

672
01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:58.280
I have respect for your knowledge, but we can't let you operate.

673
01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:06.000
I'm sorry, but we have to stick to Swedish legislation.
 Unfortunately.

674
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.280
As a student, I saw one of your guest operations in Frankfurt.

675
01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:18.760
It was extremely impressive.
 But it would be an honor if you want to assist me.

676
01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.920
SAW.

677
01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.320
Diathermy.

678
01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.480
Hook.

679
01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:55.800
-Start heart-lung machine.
 -The heart-lung machine goes there.

680
01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:04.600
c. sounds many beeps

681
01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.840
The back first.
 - You also.

682
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.800
-Can he bring the dog with him?
 -Mom can take it.

683
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.080
-What does she have for numbers, then?
 -528 37 66. Her name is Ing-Marie.

684
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.720
-We'll fix it.
 -Thanks!

685
01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.480
Put yourself in the car now.
 Watch your head.

686
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.280
In with the legs.

687
01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.440
c. sounds many beeps

688
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.040
We must probably redo his anastomosis.

689
01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.920
You do it.

690
01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.360
-Watch out for the fools.
 -You are thoracic surgeon!

691
01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:15.680
I know you!
 You know everything you want.
 You're just so damn proud!

692
01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.440
That pride made mom stack-

693
01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:24.680
-and will make me stick!

694
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.320
Dad.
 I am not stupid.

695
01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:38.320
When no one looks at, you do movements and mumble medical terms.

696
01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:42.520
But I see.
 I see everything.

697
01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.000
-Do it.
 -Thanks.

698
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.840
So, the doggie.
 We are not police officers and will never be.

699
01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.440
Now we are done.

700
01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.400
-We get off the heart-lung machine.
 -I go down in flow.

701
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:39.240
We are holding on your thumb.

702
01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.200
-Gratulates, Doctor Nygård.
 -It I'm who will congratulate.

703
01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:53.000
-Thanks, Doctor Demiroglu.
 -Call me Sinan.
 - Thank you everyone!

704
01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.280
-Hi Elin!
 -Hello!
 What are you doing here?

705
01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.360
Sorry, I didn't want to bother.
 But...

706
01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:19.040
I just wanted to say it to you directly that Conny Svensson is a lifting.

707
01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:25.680
-He sits on the Kronoberg detention.
 -Have they decided on me and Yasmin?

708
01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:31.120
There will be no reprisals, despite your overtramp.

709
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.440
-Did you have anything to do with it?
 -No.

710
01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.480
-No.
 -Nice horse.
 It's yours, huh?

711
01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:46.520
I have a brown, small pony.
 The one I always had.

712
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.920
Yes, after all.

713
01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.600
What happens to us?

714
01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.480
I hope you come in!

715
01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.160
-What are you sitting there for?
 -I wait for the letter with the message.

716
01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:25.400
There is a postal strike throughout Sweden.
 Just kidding.
 You looked so sad.

717
01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:31.880
You have to laugh in life too.
 - Dilek, hurry up now!

718
01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.440
The old man ...

719
01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.960
Come here, the man!

720
01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:42.280
-DOKNA at the hospital!
 -Thanks!
 I'm happy for us.

721
01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:49.080
I must go now.
 - Good luck you with, old man.
 - Bye!

722
01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:14.520
-I will not come in, dad.
 -Does it matter?
 Nothing.

723
01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:18.880
The main thing is that you have fought.

724
01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:25.280
You have been so wonderfully good.

725
01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.760
I may not have managed to show how proud I am on you.

726
01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:36.240
You are so strong, my girl!
 Both in the head and in the body.

727
01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.680
What I am trying to say is-

728
01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:52.400
-That already this is a victory.

729
01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:01.680
-Doesn't it?
 -Yes.

730
01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:07.600
-Have you plugged in Swedish?
 -I have read some Henry Mankell.

731
01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:20.000
It's time for me to move.

732
01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:29.640
Isn't it a bit early, my girl?
 You are just the child.

733
01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:39.200
Imagine that you have become big.

734
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.880
-You are an adult now.
 -Yes.

735
01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.000
My little girl.

736
01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.680
Yes Yes...

737
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.360
Yes.

738
01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:01.120
Good luck today.
 Health Foreign Minister.

739
01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:07.960
Good luck to yourself.
 I really hope you come in.

740
01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:24.440
Now you got away again, your thick!

741
01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.320
What have you done to me, huh?

742
01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:40.320
And all this because I didn't invite you to candy at school ...

743
01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.920
No, you didn't.
 Thick and stingy, you are in cubic.

744
01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.280
But do you know what?
 I give you whatever you want now.

745
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:57.360
If you want to buy you a whole candy factory.

746
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:02.760
Oh, so easy you will not get away.

747
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:10.520
You follow back to Turkey, right?

748
01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:14.560
We really need like you.

749
01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.600
How could I go back?
 My whole life is here now, my friend.

750
01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.960
Sinan, I'm so endlessly grateful.

751
01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.280
You've saved my life.

752
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.200
c. sound gate opens at both

753
01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.800
Damn!

754
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:11.000
-Yes?
 -I got it.
 See you in the middle.

755
01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:29.560
Hello!
 Okay.

756
01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:03.920
Doctor Demiroglu?
 We have met before.
 Georg Lagerkloo.

757
01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:08.680
I remember you.
 You are the head of Thorax.

758
01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:14.640
Right.
 So you could say.
 We are extremely happy to have you here.

759
01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.760
So it didn't sound ten years ago.

760
01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:23.440
Ten...?
 Now we should not talk about the past, but look ahead.

761
01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:27.200
This meeting takes place more formally later.

762
01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:33.200
You have a competence that we are in strong need to have.

763
01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:38.800
I have two questions for you.
 Would you like to work with us?

764
01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.680
And if so, is the language a major obstacle?

765
01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:50.480
-The question one I answer yes.
 -It's good, that's good!

766
01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:55.960
On question two I say: It's a small obstacle.

767
01:34:56.120 --> 01:35:02.600
There we have the needle eye.
 The language.
 You have to take an intensive course in Swedish-

768
01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.720
-With the focus on medical terminology.

769
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:14.520
But everything will happen according to your needs and desires.
 What do you say?

770
01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.240
I say:

771
01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:20.040
Fat well.

772
01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:07.440
