00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07.720
"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:17.560
In 1969, the year when man for the first time set foot on the moon, an important step for AI research was also taken in Sweden.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,920
The same year, Erik Sandewall became the first year in Sweden to defend in artificial intelligence.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,040
A research area that was often met with skepticism.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:40,320
In 1975, Linköping University was founded. An environment filled with new construction spirit and with a great desire for renewal.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,480
At LiU, Erik was given the opportunity to create broad basic education specially adapted for AI.

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49.560
It required courage!

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,720
Today, Linköping University has over 100 courses in artificial intelligence and expertise in AI at all our institutions.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,080
At Liu there is also a supercomputer for AI, Berzelius.

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,000
It was inaugurated in 2021 and provides important technical conditions for leading developments in the area.

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,760
Today, there are strong research environments that study the interaction between man and AI.

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,800
We ask the innovative questions that the future requires:

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,600
How can we combine with flying robots on the streets and squares safely?

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,400
How should self -driving cars be able to distinguish between a car, a cyclist and a wheelchair, and at the same time also learn

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,080
How new types of road users act?

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,680
How can we visualize large amounts of data to support decisions?

17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,720
How can doctors get support from AI in their assessments?

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,960
How are people affected when they meet AI?

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57.560
And how can AI treat all people equally, without preconceived sentences, so that man can feel confidence in robots

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01.640
For example in elderly care, preschool or at a job interview?

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,200
Swedish AI research has a natural place at Linköping University.

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,120
By helping man and AI to coexist and collaborate, we lift our eyes to seek renewal!
