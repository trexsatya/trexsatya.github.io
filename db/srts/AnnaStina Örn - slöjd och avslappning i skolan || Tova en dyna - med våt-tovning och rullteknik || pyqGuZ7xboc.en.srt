1
00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:10.000
Here we will look at how to tag a cushion with wetting and rolling technology.

2
00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:15.161
The film is suitable for the craft theme "something to sit on".

3
00:00:17.194 --> 00:00:19.227
To wetting with rolling technology so you need

4
00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.209
something to roll in.

5
00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:26.784
It can be a bamboo, a yoga mat or bubble plastic.

6
00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:32.401
So we also need a round rod, a little longer than the yoga mat/bubble plastic.

7
00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:33.804
Rubber band,

8
00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:35.448
soap

9
00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:36.973
or hand soap.

10
00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:40.733
The best thing is really olive soap.
 Both for hands and wool.

11
00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:43.523
A Denkese Bottle,

12
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.255
A spray bottle.

13
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:52.688
A funnel can be good.
 Deciliter dimensions, tape measure, paper and pen.

14
00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:55.139
And a washing bowl.

15
00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:00.277
So we also need carded wool.

16
00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:09.062
If we have a drawing for our "something to sit on" and want a round cushion for it.

17
00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:12.531
With the diameter of 340 millimeters.

18
00:01:14.332 --> 00:01:20.750
Then we need to make a calculation, to see how wide we will put out the wool.

19
00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:24.151
Wool shrinks when we swallow it.

20
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:32.855
So to know how large the surface we are going to lay out the wool, we need to figure out the size of finished pillow

21
00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:34.859
Plus fifty percent.

22
00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:41.207
With a cushion that is to be thirty -four centimeters wide

23
00:01:41.207 --> 00:01:45.417
Will we need to put out the wool fifty centimeters.

24
00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:51.086
We produce what we should roll in and a tape measure.

25
00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:58.149
And measures out a square with the sides fifty centimeters.

26
00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.115
It is important that we leave a bit out to the edge, so that the wool is a bit in.

27
00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:16.061
Here we can see a schematic picture of what is shrinkage and what gets ready cushion.

28
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:20.732
Then we will put out the wool.

29
00:02:20.732 --> 00:02:28.827
With a light but firm grip we can pull out the fibers and get just a big "flare" of wool.

30
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.538
We put the wool with the fibers in the same direction, next to each other, to the desired width.

31
00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:47.721
The second row we put the wool a little up on the former, a little wrap, like tiles on one roof.

32
00:02:49.146 --> 00:02:58.529
When we put out the entire first layer.
 We add one to layer with wool, on top the first layer, in the opposite direction.

33
00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:03.076
With the fibers at ninety degrees angle to the first layer.

34
00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:11.049
In the third layer, the wool is laid out with the fibers in the same direction as the first layer.

35
00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:17.757
And so we continue, layer by layer and put out the wool, in opposite directions.

36
00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:26.437
Here we can see the technique of how we pull out the wool.
 We can't hold too hard, but we have to release a little.
 Then it goes easy.

37
00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:31.027
Several thin layers are better than few thick, for good quality.

38
00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.651
We need to post about six layers.

39
00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:40.097
By lightly pressing the wool, we can get a feeling for how thick the cushion will be.

40
00:03:42.432 --> 00:03:51.027
Hot water and soap or soap, which is basic and helps to open up the epidermis mountains, found on the wool,

41
00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:52.622
facilitates the felting.

42
00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.743
We mix to three deciliters of water

43
00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:02.937
And about a teaspoon of soap.

44
00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:07.499
We also prepare our Denks bottle.

45
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.782
The beam on the spray bottle needs to be set, to a soft beam.

46
00:04:16.415 --> 00:04:19.567
Then we spray around the whole wool.

47
00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:23.480
It can be nice to change hand sometimes.

48
00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:28.626
All three deciliters are sprayed over the wool.

49
00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:33.155
Then we will roll in the wool.

50
00:04:33.828 --> 00:04:37.605
We fold over the piece of extra support we have.

51
00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:43.088
To protect the wool, when we put on the round rod.

52
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:53.775
Gently we start rolling.
 We lift over the round rod so that the wool remains.

53
00:04:55.762 --> 00:05:00.816
And then we put on rubber bands, to hold the roll together, when we are going to roll.

54
00:05:02.043 --> 00:05:04.789
In the beginning you need to roll gently.

55
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.395
Move your hands out and in along the roll.

56
00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:11.200
So that there is even pressure.

57
00:05:11.877 --> 00:05:16.551
Roll for about two minutes, before opening the roll.

58
00:05:17.402 --> 00:05:19.824
Also it needs to be done carefully,

59
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.589
In the beginning when the wool has not felled together properly.

60
00:05:25.228 --> 00:05:27.925
We can still see that it has started to fell a little.

61
00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:31.122
So we move to the sink.

62
00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:39.931
Tie on an apron, to protect the clothes from garbage water.

63
00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:45.664
So we wet the wool with more soapy water.

64
00:05:45.664 --> 00:05:53.140
It is possible to fold the wool on the edges and "glue" with soap water, for more even edges.

65
00:05:56.586 --> 00:06:01.576
We roll everything together.
 Now you can print a little more.

66
00:06:02.288 --> 00:06:04.555
For the wool holds together better now.

67
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.321
We put on the rubber cords.

68
00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:14.073
And continues to roll.

69
00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:19.430
And moves your hands out and in.

70
00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:23.557
With a little more pressure than before.

71
00:06:23.557 --> 00:06:29.001
Then we roll about two more minutes before we open again.

72
00:06:32.543 --> 00:06:36.253
When we open, we see that the wool has felled further.

73
00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:43.641
Now we will roll about two minutes from each direction.
 Front and rear, from behind and front.

74
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.477
From right to left and left to right.

75
00:06:46.648 --> 00:06:50.736
But we can turn everything around so we can roll from the same direction.

76
00:06:52.576 --> 00:06:59.186
So we start by turning it in the opposite direction.
 And dinks on plenty of soapy water.

77
00:07:00.947 --> 00:07:07.224
Then continue to roll with pressure.
 Press properly because it is the pressure that causes the wool to be together.

78
00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:12.942
We need to fill with soapy water.
 Several Denken bottles will be needed.

79
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.705
About one tablespoon soap to five deciliters of water.

80
00:07:20.623 --> 00:07:28.307
When we have rolled for two minutes, from all four directions, it is dax to turn the wool.

81
00:07:29.573 --> 00:07:33.235
And do the same procedure on the other side.

82
00:07:34.165 --> 00:07:38.217
Roll from the front, from the front, right to left, left to right.

83
00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:41.204
But first on with plenty of soapy water.

84
00:07:42.609 --> 00:07:48.425
Roll with a pressure from all four sides.
 Fill with soap water in between.

85
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.005
When we roll the wool at the end it is really wet.

86
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.498
And the last time we open up, the wool has felled well, well,

87
00:07:59.665 --> 00:08:01.804
to a cohesive textile.

88
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:09.864
If you want the wool to shrink further, but you do not want to roll more, you can rub it, pick it against a washboard,

89
00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.026
Or against the grooves in her.

90
00:08:12.026 --> 00:08:15.830
Another tip is to throw the wool in the ground a few times out.

91
00:08:16.682 --> 00:08:21.175
So it is very important to wash out the wool at the end.

92
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.875
Wash out the soap and any dirt that has remained in the wool.

93
00:08:30.559 --> 00:08:37.132
We use olive soap or unpainted hand soap to wash out soap scent.

94
00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:41.487
And for it to be gentle on our hands when we wash.

95
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.467
Then it is important to rinse to the water is perfectly clear.

96
00:08:47.177 --> 00:08:51.845
We measure the wool and see that it is a little too big still.

97
00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:55.451
Then we can do so that we can shock the wool,

98
00:08:55.451 --> 00:09:01.330
In alternating giant warm and giant cold water.

99
00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:04.311
Then the wool shrinks further.

100
00:09:07.576 --> 00:09:13.462
Now that we measure the wool, we see that it has shrunk to thirty -five centimeters.

101
00:09:13.957 --> 00:09:18.841
Then we hug properly and put the wool on the dryer.

102
00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:28.373
Also clean everything you used, so that it can be used many times by several.

103
00:09:30.098 --> 00:09:37.269
Wool is a natural fiber, the sheep's hair, so wool can be composted.
 It turns into soil.

104
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:42.004
And not only that also increases the humus content in the soil,

105
00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:44.162
that helps the plants grow.

106
00:09:44.848 --> 00:09:51.688
And the plants they collect carbon dioxide from the air, so wool on the compost is good for the environment in several ways.

107
00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:58.807
When the cushion has dried, it can be cut to the desired size and shape.

108
00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:02.684
We take the help of a passer to get a round cushion.

109
00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:06.677
The cushion can then be decorated in different ways.

110
00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:10.689
For example, using a template and textile print

111
00:10:11.229 --> 00:10:13.293
directly on the cushion or on a case.

112
00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:16.445
Or with dry turf by stencil.

113
00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:21.483
