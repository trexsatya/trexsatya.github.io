1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,400
Describe your feelings 
about the national tests.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,600
I'm really stressed-out 
and scared that I'll make mistakes.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,560
If I mess up the maths for example, 
I might drop down, which I don't want.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,840
You can't really study for it-

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
-so it's OK. But it's still stressful.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,000
It affects your grades quite a bit.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,080
For me it's stress first and foremost. 
Then it's nerves as well.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,920
If I'm really nervous, 
I have a blackout and forget everything.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm more nervous about saying 
something wrong or not remembering.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,320
Often I know what to say, but then 
it's like: "What was I going to say?"

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,480
That's not a great feeling.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,600
It varies individually, students' 
approach to the national tests.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,880
Some are stressed-out, others not, and 
there are those who don't care much.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,240
One piece of advice is: 
Believe in yourself! Trust yourself.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,160
Believe that you're capable 
of doing a good job.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,560
And try to visualise the test, 
the day of the test and the outcome.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,840
That's a key component. What happens 
when you get a tricky question?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,840
How will you tackle the problem?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,640
It's common to have a blackout, 
and your thoughts go elsewhere.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Then it's good to have visualised 
the situation in advance-

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,600
-so you know how to deal with it.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,240
As well as visualising the test, 
you can utilise some strategies-

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,480
-in case your brain goes blank. 
Start by taking some deep breaths.

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,280
Try to lower your stress levels.

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,240
Remember that the test isn't everything.

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,400
When your stress levels have reduced, 
it might be easier to think clearly.

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,400
If you struggle to find the answer 
even though you actually know it-

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,320
-ask for a piece of paper and write down 
everything you know about that topic.

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,040
If you still have no answer, 
leave the question for now and move on.

30
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,520
You might think of it a little later.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,800
Read the instructions carefully 
so you don't miss anything.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,240
Mark everything that's expected of you. 
That way you'll know it's all done.

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,920
My top three strategies are: study, 
eat and get a good night's sleep.

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,240
My teacher says 
to take it easy and rest.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,160
Recharge, so I can do my best.

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,640
Like sleep, so I'll have more energy, 
eat well, do a bit of exercise.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,760
Take it easy and think it through 
so you don't make any mistakes.

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Stressing through it isn't good.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,960
Reading comprehension 
might be an issue.

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,920
It's not only about 
understanding the text.

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,760
It's also about even starting to read 
and taking in all the information.

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,320
It's too much, it looks messy. 
A piece of advice:

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,440
Try to change your way of thinking.

44
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,720
Not: "That's a lot of text!" Instead: 
"Great, I get to read this now!"

45
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,600
"What will I learn from this?"

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,240
When we change our way of thinking, 
our brain behaves differently.

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,040
And hopefully this will help.

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
It's hard to study 
for the national tests-

49
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,120
-but a good way to prepare 
for the linguistic parts-

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,480
-is to listen to podcasts 
and read books in that language.

51
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,560
This makes you practise the habit 
of listening and absorbing information.

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,320
Remember that the tests are long, 
so prepare for that.

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,440
Check with your teacher if it's OK 
to bring some food or drink.

54
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,320
And perhaps most importantly: 
Believe in yourself and try to relax.
