1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.180
I'll catch up during the last swim boys, I'll catch up during the last swim.


2
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.040
I’m back on my horse of steel.


3
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.900
On my way to HEAD in Nacka


4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.100
Where I will be meeting up with Per, and also with Dennis who works there.


5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.960
As well as my teammate in swimrunning, Lisa.


6
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.460
We did ÖTILLÖ together last autumn.


7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.140
What we are going to do is basically try out some wetsuits.


8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.760
there will be some tips for you who are looking to buy your first wetsuit, but we are also going to check out the latest gear for 2016.


9
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.080
It can be good for you who want complement or update your gear.


10
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.780
So, come with me!


11
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.800
Hi, good to see you.


12
00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.640
You too.


13
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.240
Hi.


14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.420
Hi! How are you?


15
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.420
How are you?


16
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.060
I’m doing good.


17
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.780
Nice.


18
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.000
My name is Dennis and I work with PR and marketing of CBM products.


19
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.920
CBM products have the brand name HEAD in the nordic countries.


20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.620
I have a passion for open water swimming and swimrun.


21
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.340
We see great potential in an extremely fast growing sport


22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.760
Ah, there we have the limited edition Ångaloppet.


23
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.840
Cool.


24
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.740
They are made for races where the temperature is a little higher.


25
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.320
Yes.


26
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.320
But considering that the swimrun format is growing so rapidly in europe


27
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:52.720
and that there are new races coming in Spain, Italy and Greece, there’s one in California and Australia.


28
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.220
There you dont want to be in a full body suit.


29
00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.140
Therefore we have produced this, it is just like the race-suit. It has a six mm buoyancy panel.


30
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.500
If you would like to, you can combine it with a tank top.


31
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.060
So you won’ t have to run without anything on your upper body.


32
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.600
Hi, welcome.


33
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.760
Thank you, Per.


34
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.980
Dennis.


35
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.720
Wow, sponsors and stuff. Limited edition.


36
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.340
It’ s an honor to get to wear these. Will I fit in these?


37
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.340
This is the new one.


38
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.340
The upper part is "race"


39
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.240
Yes.


40
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.420
But the lower part is "rough"


41
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.240
Right.


42
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.560
To increase flexibility and make it much easier to run in.


43
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800
And it doesn’ t have any buoyancy panels.


44
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.640
It' s been requested by a lot of people, a faster suit.


45
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.660
Easier to run in, nothing unnecessary on it. It doesn' t have a zipper on the back either.


46
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.280
No.


47
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.020
Like we used to before. Because.


48
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.900
There is alot of people who say, me for example, I never open the back


49
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.460
I only open the front.


50
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.660
We have also shortened the zipper a little.


51
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800
So this one will be super fast.


52
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.740
You have done alot of swimrun, but you are also good in open water.


53
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.640
It would be fun to hear about your trip to Morocco. It was a little bit of an unusual swim adventure


54
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.220
Yes.


55
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.620
What were you doing there?


56
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.440
I swam 25 km in four days.


57
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.600
There were people from all around the world and all types of gear.


58
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.040
Wetsuits, swim caps,, some didnt use any of it at all.


59
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.680
It was about 17 degrees in the water, so I thought it was too cold to not use them.


60
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.100
But I got jealous at those who had these


61
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.640
tank tops.


62
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.400
I thought it was too cold to only have a swim suit on.


63
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.480
One day we were running late, African time.


64
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.760
There was tide.


65
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.480
We were chasing buoys, the others were kite-surfing. What are they doing?


66
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.840
This is much more fun.


67
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.620
You want to try?


68
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.960
Lets try that new one on, it seems cool


69
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.680
Aero.


70
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.360
Yes.


71
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.260
It fits really well.


72
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.280
Yes, and what I have found hard


73
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.860
is to get them to fit well around the torso.


74
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.820
I don't think I have ever tried one that fits this well around the torso.


75
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.440
The fact that there is only one zipper is no problem.


76
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.820
Would you keep it like it is or would you cut it? How does it feel in the knee pits?


77
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.260
Well, now it doesn't feel like it's as important to cut it.


78
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.840
I don't think there would be any problems with keeping it like this.,


79
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.540
No.


80
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.520
You could almost keep it like this to keep your knees from going stiff.


81
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.020
From the cold.


82
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.640
I'm thinking, I haven't put it on the wrong way right?


83
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.320
No, because you have the wizzle here.


84
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.300
It's too small?


85
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.920
Yes.


86
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.020
You can see that here because it doesn't...


87
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.800
It unzips by itself


88
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.160
You're too big across the chest.


89
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.440
Put on the other one.


90
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.060
Yes.


91
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.860
It will fit.


92
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.520
So you run with the glasses?


93
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.020
Yes.


94
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.640
Yes, you know we are trying to cut that hundredth of a second.


95
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.600
Definitely.


96
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.800
Now I understand why people have it as gaol to get a pair of trousers to fit.


97
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.300
I have never understood that.


98
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.020
You can just buy a bigger sized one.


99
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.560
Shit, you look like Superman.


100
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.520
Yes well I am Superman.


101
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.140
Maybe this one fits well?


102
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.960
Maybe it fits well.


103
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.660
Börje and Ragee are getting nervous now.


104
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.740
I think they are getting really nervous.


105
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.740
Sitting in Japan biting their nails.


106
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.000
I have to send send them a hello.


107
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.660
Hi Simon and Ragge, Perra here, currently at HEAD.


108
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.700
You are skiing and I'm preparing for Ångaloppet. Priorities,  priorities.


109
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.760
It fits you well, how does it feel.?


110
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.660
It feels good.


111
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.380
It doesn't feel tight around your shoulders and between your legs?


112
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.240
No.


113
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.040
Because even if it feels claustrophobic now, it is supposed to.


114
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.420
It will go away, it gets half a size bigger when you get into the water.


115
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.060
And when running you unzipp it.


116
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.000
Yes, exactly.


117
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.080
Who is your teammate?


118
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.660
My old swimming buddy, Erik Olsson.


119
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.360
Okay.


120
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.540
He has performed a little bit better maybe.


121
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.300
Not this year.


122
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.340
No, not this year.


123
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.120
We'll see, I think he's a bit nervous now.


124
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.640
I think he watches every single episode and is sitting there going "damn it"


125
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.200
Per looks fast, Per looks fast.


126
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.920
Thanks Dennis, nice of you.


127
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.680
Thanks Lisa for coming and doing a little modeling.


128
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.680
It looks cool with the logo.


129
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.820
Limited edition.


130
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.940
Yes, yes, yes.


131
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.560
I will be walking around the office in this.


132
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.640
24/7


133
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.600
Yes.


134
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.560
Sleep in them.


135
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.460
Anna will be going "it smells!" And you will say.


136
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.560
I'm not taking them off!
