1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,089
Went off the road in Spain.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,699
Got stuck there and was picked up
by a farmer with a tractor.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:13,590
Then I had an engine failure
on the highway in Spain outside Valencia.

4
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,389
It was quite scary.

5
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:24,186
Hello Hello!

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,385
Thursday again and time
for a new episode of Motornörd.

7
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,316
And today we revisit Tomas
who sold his Tesla,

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,349
bought a Renault truck
and converted it into a camper van.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,720
So let's take this opportunity
to check the situation.

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,950
What has it been like to be away
for a whole year?

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,945
Hi Douglas! Good to see you again.

12
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:45,976
It's the same Tomas, what's up?

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,956
It is very good.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,930
It feels a bit strange
to be back in Sweden.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,509
I have mixed feelings.

16
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:58,159
I've been on a long trip and now I'm home.

17
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,625
But I don't feel at home
because I don't live in Värnamo

18
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,636
but only exist in Värnamo.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,779
It makes me feel like an alien
or outside of society.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,536
I haven't had that feeling
when I was traveling

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,930
but you have been
in a different mentality.

22
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,886
Now I am back.

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,405
Absolutely fantastic year.

24
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:19,405
I am very happy and proud
that I have done it

25
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,685
and I have learned a lot from it.

26
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:26,265
It has been a challenge
and a great experience.

27
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,166
I'm super happy with it.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,486
When I drove in
here, I have seen some changes.

29
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:33,456
First, you have the cover on top
where you can insert

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,540
your Star-link wind de-icer.

31
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:39,886
The Star link is recessed
and it has worked.

32
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,739
The star link is
a game changer is unprecedented.

33
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:46,636
No problems whatsoever anywhere.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,576
It just works.

35
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,629
300 megabits anywhere all the time.

36
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,255
I highly recommend it.

37
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:57,220
Awesome! It costs 1050 bucks a month,
but it's worth it every time.

38
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:58,076
It works well.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,326
No major problems.

40
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,596
I've had minor mishaps
but that's to be expected

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,996
when you're out and about.

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,089
So what's the big deal?

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Went off the road in Spain.

44
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,479
Got stuck there and was picked up
by a farmer with a tractor.

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:20,339
Then I had an engine failure
on the highway in Spain outside Valencia.

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,250
It was quite scary.

47
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,055
Went into safe mode.

48
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,139
Can drive 50 on the highway.

49
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,986
20 kilometers to Valencia.

50
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,169
Google for a Renault workshop.

51
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,809
Coming in on Friday evening
at 17:55 principle.

52
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,055
Asked for help.

53
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:45,000
We can help you, but you have to come back
on Monday morning at 08:00.

54
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:47,639
Camping in Valencia works well.

55
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,770
In addition, on Sunday
there was the summer time changeover.

56
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,350
Then, on Monday morning, I wake up
and step outside.

57
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,115
If it's pitch black
outside, I get in the truck,

58
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,746
start it up and what I'm not told.

59
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,335
When I drove out on Friday,
it was still light outside.

60
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,276
Is that no lights work at all
in the front,

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,410
lights, tail lights, hazard lights,
position lights, instruments.

62
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,649
Not a single light in the entire truck.

63
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,800
I am in Valencia.

64
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,186
There is carbon black with a carbon
black truck,

65
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,039
driving on Monday morning
in rush hour traffic in Valencia.

66
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,606
That trip was not fun.

67
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,496
Bloody hell.

68
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,580
So it was a bit exciting.

69
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,115
Came into the workshop
and they fixed an electrical fault

70
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,639
so they fixed and it was great
and 4 hours later I was on the road again.

71
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,436
But what about the letters?

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,406
I gave up!

73
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,919
The letters were a wrestling match.

74
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,059
I tried to get rid of them.

75
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:55,736
After I got all the letters off,
I took boat polish, medium,

76
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,826
antioxidant and polisher to it
and it ended up

77
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,649
making the letters much shinier.

78
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:08,160
But so were the other parts of the fleet.

79
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,826
So even though I did all the work,
it was just as big a difference

80
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,195
as it was before
but everything was shinier

81
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,279
and the letters were still visible.

82
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,715
So I ended up buying paint
and rolling over them

83
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,970
just to get rid of the letters.

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,265
But all the boxes have worked?

85
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:29,935
On one of my films that I published,
one of the switches for the box

86
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,609
had become waterlogged.

87
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:36,605
After the rain, it ran down the side
and straight into the switch.

88
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,225
Then when I emptied it,
it had standing water

89
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:40,735
throughout the switch.

90
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,230
So there I found a new replacement
and replaced just that dilemma around it.

91
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,549
But it was only a ten-minute job,
so it was no big deal.

92
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:53,325
When I drove down last fall,
I drove south all the time

93
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,649
and then I had the sun low down
so I was dazzled all the time.

94
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:05,309
So I got tired of it and added duct tape
to protect myself from the sun.

95
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,715
I forgot about that so I kept it
for the whole period in Portugal.

96
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:15,519
So now I can't get the glue off,
it's so embedded in the bench.

97
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,679
It doesn't matter what I use for anything.

98
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,250
From razor blades to.

99
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,029
Acetone to bought this at Biltema.

100
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:28,735
Label off.

101
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,685
It works, doesn't it?

102
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,255
Nothing works as far as I have tried.

103
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,519
It's burned into the glass somehow.

104
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,445
I don't know how to get rid of it.

105
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,045
Tips are gratefully received.

106
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,595
How do I get rid of this shit?

107
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:44,585
I have no previous experience
of driving a truck,

108
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,029
but I must say that it has been
incredibly easy to drive.

109
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,085
It is like any other small car.

110
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,339
It is not heavy, it is not difficult.

111
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:55,605
It works very well.

112
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,809
Size-wise, I have also discovered
that I have.

113
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,929
Due to the fact that I have the isolation,
I have an exemption.

114
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,809
It is extra wide
so mine is 2.60 in total width.

115
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,295
Most large caravans are 2.35
so I'm quite wide,

116
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,549
but I have no problem with that part.

117
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,049
I think it is almost more of a challenge
and a bit of fun.

118
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,079
Trying to squeeze in
all the small villages with this wide one.

119
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,670
What I have a problem with is the height.

120
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:26,209
I'm not sure about the height.

121
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:31,215
The total height is 3.42 centimeters
and I've been under a couple of bridges

122
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,185
that are 3.50 centimeters.

123
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,785
It is not funny.

124
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,655
I crawl forward.

125
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:40,615
I also have all the solar panels
with a glass exterior

126
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
which is the highest peak.

127
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,055
Is it 3.50 on the bridge.

128
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,235
Don't know how drunk
the guy was who measured

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,570
or if it was before
or after on the new asphalt.

130
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:53,885
The heights do not like.

131
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,045
There is so much in it.

132
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,885
Even when I drive on highways
and you have five meters

133
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,269
up there, I sit
and duck to wait for the impact.

134
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,040
So I have a phobia about bridges.

135
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,519
Engine-wise, it's fantastic.

136
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:13,425
It's quite strong at 220 horses,
which is more than most in this size.

137
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,990
The Spanish mountain pass and all that.

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,475
Not the slightest hesitation.

139
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,125
No overheating whatsoever.

140
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,209
No overheating of the brakes.

141
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,679
In terms of trucks, it has been very good.

142
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,855
I am very happy with it
and the fuel consumption

143
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,160
has been well above expectations.

144
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,975
I have no experience whatsoever
with trucks before

145
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:34,835
so I thought it would be much worse.

146
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,715
3-4 liters per mile or something.

147
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:40,025
It is locked at 90,
but normally you are at 80

148
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,605
and if I am at 90
and maximize, I draw about 1-1.9

149
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,195
and the lowest I have been down to when
I drive 80

150
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,635
and drive calmly down there at 1.6
and 1.7 and 1.8 is normal consumption

151
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,480
on it and I think
it is good when it weighs 7.5 tons.

152
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,975
There have been no problems and diesel
has been cheap down in Portugal,

153
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,785
at €1.40 per liter.

154
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,869
14 kr a liter it costs down there.

155
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,130
Well, it was different
when we had 28 kr a liter here.

156
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,779
It is a good fuel price.

157
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,429
By the way, how many miles
have you traveled by truck?

158
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,235
I had an app that I have been using.

159
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,425
It keeps an eye on me.

160
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,315
It's only been 1,500 miles.

161
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,950
I've been standing still for so long.

162
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,245
I do a 30 mile drive
and stay there for a couple of days

163
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:33,520
and see 30 more miles
and stay for a couple of days.

164
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,979
It's actually less
than I thought it would be.

165
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,066
The rear ramp.

166
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,966
Did you do anything about it? No.

167
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,546
It is the same.

168
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,835
You get used to it.

169
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,640
It sounds quite a lot to fold it up/down,
but I did it for about two weeks.

170
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:49,869
After that, I don't give a shit.

171
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:53,190
There are so many barking dogs
and screaming children and so on.

172
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,066
That may sound like me too,
but it has taught me during the trip

173
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,176
that I went away
with the intention of being stealth

174
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
and being secretive.

175
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:11,106
But that's not how I've been living,
I've got 25% max that I'm freezing.

176
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,926
But 75% of the time I've been on pitches
and campsites

177
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,950
and living on farms and things like that.

178
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,119
So making the truck in stealth
to be secret, it was a waste.

179
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:29,096
It's not that I don't think I've used it,
but the opposite effect has been

180
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:32,286
that if you have
a large or small old or new motorhome

181
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:35,186
and you enter a campsite,
people will look at it

182
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,996
as if a new one is coming in.

183
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,849
But when I arrive, they look wide-eyed
because they think I've made a mistake.

184
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,960
A goods delivery to the restaurant
or something.

185
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,400
That I attract more attention on campsites
than regular motorhomes.

186
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:55,205
And I think that, without exaggeration,
maybe 200 people

187
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:58,989
have been inside the camper
and looked at it.

188
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,895
I've received a lot of feedback,
a lot of ideas

189
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:08,496
and a lot of suggestions
and thoughts that have made my head spin.

190
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,246
What are you doing now?

191
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,575
I check how much sun

192
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:18,789
there is. It provides 1680 watts.

193
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,876
Incoming such excess capacity
that I have probably fully charged

194
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,666
the battery before lunch.

195
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,256
So I have very good solar panels
and I've been very happy

196
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,596
with the batteries.

197
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,726
It works great.

198
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:37,226
Again, no gas at all
but everything is electrically powered

199
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:41,469
so it has worked beyond expectations.

200
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,750
Water production has worked
but has been undersized.

201
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:50,960
It works, but what happens
is that I delay filling the water.

202
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,976
Instead of filling the water tank
every five days,

203
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,510
you need to fill it
once every 15 days or so.

204
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,395
So I have a little bit
too little capacity on it,

205
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:02,150
but the principle works
so it's no problem.

206
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,250
Are you still drinking the water?

207
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:05,286
No, not anymore.

208
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:09,096
I did it in the beginning,
but out of sheer security or something.

209
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,630
When months have passed and you don't know
if there are bacteria and so on.

210
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,960
So I use it to make tea
and cook pasta and all this.

211
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:20,635
The only water I drink
is clean drinking water.

212
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:23,030
Everything else I use for this one.

213
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,026
And it's the same there.

214
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,575
I use the toilet all the time,
it works really well.

215
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,186
I have used the shower less
than I thought I would

216
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,619
and that is because my living pattern
has been different.

217
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:40,216
I haven't fricampa as much as I thought,
but I have toilets and showers

218
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,159
easily accessible on campsites,
so it's easy to run there.

219
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:50,669
The shower is overkill,
you could call it that.

220
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,145
In the last movie before I left, I said
it was 90-95% complete.

221
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:57,739
I'll do the latter along the way.

222
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,739
These will be the last strips to be added.

223
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,036
It never happened.

224
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:08,710
One of the things
was that I hadn't painted in the closet.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It is still unpainted.

226
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:13,786
The idea is good, but not always.

227
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:16,950
It is so easy to forget about it.

228
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,186
I have a thing that broke very quickly.

229
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,966
It was probably no more than 10,
15-20 miles

230
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:26,140
before I broke it the first time.

231
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:33,520
When I slid it out on the wardrobe module,
I had a locking device on it.

232
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:37,556
But it is such an insane amount of load.

233
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,816
When cornering, the bracket is high up
and has a lot of weight,

234
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,869
so when the truck swings,
the brackets come loose at once.

235
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:52,429
So it was a simple but effective solution.

236
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,090
It's when I'm going somewhere
that I push it in.

237
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,000
I lock it all the way in.

238
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,866
A temporary solution I made
after 10-15 miles.

239
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,726
It has been there ever since.

240
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:10,229
There is nothing as permanent
as a temporary solution.

241
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,856
In terms of trees, I'm super happy.

242
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,325
It's a bit boring but nothing remarkable.

243
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,169
It just rolls on
and works like any other apartment.

244
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,546
I have never felt claustrophobic.

245
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,015
I have varying views
through the back door,

246
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:32,736
but otherwise it's the same old apartment
that you move

247
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,096
around with.

248
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:40,416
I have actually eaten a lot inside,
due to the fold-down seat,

249
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,969
so we have been six people
plus a child at most in here.

250
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:49,789
6.5 people have eaten so it's been great.

251
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,015
Precisely because it has so much
more volume inside,

252
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:56,039
if the weather is bad,
people choose to sit inside.

253
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,500
It's better to sit in a tent.

254
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:05,135
So I've had a lot of people and people
I've gotten to know that I've eaten with.

255
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,726
This works well,
it takes 5 minutes to shit

256
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:12,409
and then it takes
5 minutes to clean up too.

257
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,656
It is surprisingly good.

258
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:17,070
It is made for cat and dog hair.

259
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,859
So it's motorized
and that makes it a good choice.

260
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,446
It is. I am very happy with it
and that is one of the reasons

261
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:35,010
why I find it very difficult
to see myself moving back.

262
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:39,940
Buy a 200 square meter house
or a 100 square meter apartment.

263
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,046
That is not going to happen.

264
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,140
It is a fundamental change that is valued
in a completely different way.

265
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:50,229
I have my 15 square meters
and it is absolutely perfect.

266
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,825
Just what you need.

267
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:56,325
The TV is the first thing
I turn on in the morning and then it's on.

268
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,126
All waking hours of the day.

269
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,276
This works great!

270
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,496
Super happy with it!

271
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,265
By the way, I have a 360 security camera,
I have not plugged it in,

272
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:08,596
it has not gotten my thumb out
and bothered me

273
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,645
and the reason is that I have never ever
during the trip

274
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:17,599
even felt the hint of threatened
or unsafe or insecure anything.

275
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:24,575
So the ability to close up and shut down
has meant that I am completely relaxed

276
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:25,726
all the time.

277
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:26,776
Wherever I have stood.

278
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:32,166
Before this trip I had the same old bike
for 15-20 years or so

279
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,429
and during this trip
I have grazed four bikes.

280
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,419
What!? Yes, I become a cyclist
in the process.

281
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,820
I bought an electric bike
and it was great.

282
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:52,109
I managed to use it three times
before it was stolen down in Halmstad.

283
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,626
I did not get far.

284
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,276
From Halmstad
I went further into the Netherlands

285
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,639
and if you are in the Netherlands
you can't do without a bike.

286
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:06,479
So I bought another electric bike
that I had for a while and it was okay.

287
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,840
Not as good as the first one I had
so I sold it at one campsite to another.

288
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,806
Then I ordered the exact same one
that I got rid of.

289
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,349
But then there's some rascal
who has your blue one in Halmstad.

290
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:21,616
Yes, it is.

291
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,455
It was locked outside the savings bank
and after 5-10 minutes there,

292
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,436
it was more picky.

293
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,606
You get angry about that,
but there's not much you can do about it.

294
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,645
It has a 4-5 mile range on it,
goes away and up hills

295
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:45,000
and anything can go shopping
in the backpack and just beep on.

296
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,809
When you live in a camper van,
the bike is your second car.

297
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:52,979
It's a key part of what you want
in a really good e-bike!

298
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,436
I got eleven countries in total.

299
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,256
By far the two best countries
that I am in love with

300
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,015
are Portugal and the Netherlands.

301
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:06,796
I have probably ten weeks
that I was in the Netherlands

302
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,916
and then it was six months
and over the winter

303
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,186
I was in the Algarve coast
in southern Portugal

304
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,430
and it is incomparable. I recommend it!

305
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,346
But what have you done with your days?

306
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,359
Have you made lots of trips
and met lots of people?

307
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,959
So many exciting personalities to meet.

308
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,855
I can feel it.

309
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:32,239
I'm going to be cruel,
but they lump everyone together and so on.

310
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:36,245
But to me, it feels like caravan owners
are hooking up

311
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:41,046
and then they go out for the weekend
with the family and barbecue

312
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,839
and so on
and then they go back on Monday or Sunday.

313
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:48,400
Whereas motorhome people
are very different.

314
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,625
Many pensioners
have sold their houses in Sweden.

315
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:58,495
They leave a small cottage or something
in a forest glade,

316
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:03,765
sell their house, buy a camper van
and spend 6, 8, 10 months down

317
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:07,515
in southern Europe
where warmth and comfort

318
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,599
are the most common.

319
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:12,819
Then we have another group
who are digital nomads.

320
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,910
A lot of people working on the road.

321
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,985
Has it been expensive?

322
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,729
No, especially not this year.

323
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:27,015
When you hear friends and acquaintances
complaining about electricity bills,

324
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:30,880
food prices
and so on, you feel very privileged.

325
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:37,836
I have lived in a long term stand
and I have a campsite

326
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,910
where I paid 7 euros
per day for the stand.

327
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:48,349
Then if you had electricity,
it was an extra 1.40 euros per day.

328
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,906
It has been expensive
and the food is not even half

329
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:53,446
the price of Sweden.

330
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,150
There have been very few YouTube videos
from you as well.

331
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,430
Yes, I have taken a break.

332
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,936
I don't know how to explain it.

333
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,729
Mentally, it has been hard to make them.

334
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,686
It was fun in the beginning
telling us about the truck

335
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,865
and telling us about plans and everything.

336
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:13,199
But then when I'm out on the road,
it feels too flashy.

337
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,985
I don't know how to describe it.

338
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:19,745
Me, me, me watching me and watching me
and it's rare to post a video

339
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:23,096
on a Tuesday afternoon
when it's pouring rain

340
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,380
and you're doing the laundry.

341
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,829
I'm in new places all the time
and I don't like the selfish focus.

342
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,449
I have taken a break,
but it is definitely not dead.

343
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:36,566
I have a...

344
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,166
I have an upcoming project
that will make

345
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,089
me resume Youtube again.

346
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,105
Then we'll have to say goodbye!

347
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:51,745
Take

348
00:19:51,829 --> 00:20:00,140
care!
