1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,520
<i>Since the end of the 1990s, there has been
a trend toward a digital publication system</i>

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,440
<i>for research results.</i>

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,280
<i>These developments have been spurred on
by the shortcomings of the traditional system,</i>

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,920
<i>such as increased subscription prices
and locked-in research results,</i>

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,880
<i>but also by the technical possibilities
afforded by the internet.</i>

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,760
<i>An important milestone
in the development towards open access</i>

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,000
<i>was The Budapest Initiative manifesto
of 2001,</i>

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,920
<i>which was established
during a conference in Budapest.</i>

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,440
<i>The manifesto defines open access
as follows:</i>

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,200
<i>"By 'open access' to this literature, we mean
its free availability on the public internet,"</i>

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,760
<i>"permitting any users to read, download,
copy, distribute, print, search,"</i>

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
<i>"or link to the full texts of these articles,"</i>

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,760
<i>"crawl them for indexing,
pass them as data to software,"</i>

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,400
<i>"or use them for any other lawful purpose,"</i>

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,640
<i>"without financial, legal,
or technical barriers,"</i>

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,400
<i>"other than those inseparable
from gaining access to the internet itself."</i>

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,640
<i>"The only constraint on reproduction
and distribution,"</i>

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,680
<i>"and the only role for copyright
in this domain,"</i>

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,720
<i>"should be to give authors control
over the integrity of their work"</i>

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,320
<i>"and the right to be properly acknowledged
and cited."</i>

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,680
<i>The Budapest Initiative was followed
by several similar manifestos,</i>

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,480
<i>such as the Berlin Declaration of 2004.</i>

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,240
<i>"The internet has fundamentally changed
the practical and economic realities"</i>

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,160
<i>"of distributing scientific knowledge
and cultural heritage."</i>

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,560
<i>"For the first time ever, the internet now
offers the chance to constitute a global"</i>

26
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,840
<i>"and interactive representation
of human knowledge,"</i>

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,720
<i>"including cultural heritage
and the guarantee of worldwide access."</i>

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,480
<i>The primary reasons
for the trend towards open access are:</i>

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,040
<i>The need to be able to disseminate
research results freely,</i>

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,040
<i>so that more people,
including researchers, decision makers,</i>

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,480
<i>professionals and the general public,</i>

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,120
<i>can access and use the research results
in their daily lives and work.</i>

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,560
<i>The high subscription prices
within the traditional model</i>

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,720
<i>for the distribution of research results.</i>

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,400
<i>Initially, open access was focused
on scholarly publications,</i>

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,240
<i>but now research data are also included</i>

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,960
<i>as a category of information
that should be accessible.</i>

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,280
<i>"Research data" includes results
from experiments, measurements,</i>

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,080
<i>observations, statistics
and interview responses.</i>

40
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,440
<i>In other words, openness has come
to encompass the entire science system,</i>

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,200
<i>as well as processes having to do
with collaboration, communication,</i>

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,840
<i>and the dissemination of research results.</i>

43
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,400
<i>An increase in access to scholarly
publications benefits the society.</i>

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,040
<i>UNESCO stresses that open access
is of fundamental importance</i>

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,080
<i>in order to achieve at least 10 of the 17
sustainability goals for 2030.</i>

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,840
<i>There is a great need for access to research
results at hospitals and healthcare centers.</i>

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>Within a subscription system,
cost becomes an obstacle.</i>

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,280
<i>Hopefully, open access will change this.</i>

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,680
<i>Industry, non-profits, politicians</i>

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,480
<i>and a number of other members of society
will also benefit</i>

51
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,080
<i>from being able
to freely access research results.</i>
