1
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:06,630
(The noise is coming from a baby downstairs)

2
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,619
This is how I closed the door

3
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:24,000
You have to turn the key

4
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:27,694
and release it, then it's locked

5
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,435
The door moves

6
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:30,383
stops here

7
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:31,391
Where are we right now?

8
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:34,000
We are at EkenÃ¤s Castle

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,622
You have to turn the key. Come closer
(dog/baby in the background)

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:47,135
It has to go around the edge. You see? 
It must be like this, otherwise I cannot close the door

11
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:51,378
This is what locks the door

12
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:54,556
And you closed it?

13
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:55,898
Like that

14
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:59,270
It's not possible to open

15
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:00,643
Closed

16
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,672
That makes this even better

17
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah

18
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,509
And it stays there...
It could easily have moved like this

19
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:13,617
if it's the wind...like this

20
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:19,271
The door stops right here, and then it closes

21
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,856
at full speed

22
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:32,328
You have to turn like this to open
And you turn it on the outside like that

23
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:38,766
And it gets stuck here, behind that iron thing

24
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:43,386
Check what it looks like when I close.

25
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:44,125
Do you see?

26
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:44,851
Yeah

27
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:52,595
Like that

28
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:53,263
Nice!
