1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,811
(The sound in the background comes from the castle bailiff's baby on the floor below)

2
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,619
This is how we did, or I

3
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:24,000
You hear.
 I feel here and have to turn the key

4
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:27,694
And then release it, then it is haspad

5
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,435
And that's when the door comes

6
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:30,383
Stays here

7
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:31,391
Should you say where we are somewhere?

8
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:34,000
We are at EkenÃ¤s Castle.
 That's where it happened

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,622
You see, you have to twist.
 If you get closer here ..

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:47,135
This one must around the corner.
 You see, now I can't close it.
 (dog/child in the background)

11
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:51,378
So it is the one who locks the door

12
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:54,556
And you closed it?

13
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:55,898
That's how

14
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:59,270
It's not possible...

15
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:00,643
Closed

16
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:04,672
And it really makes it all even better

17
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:10,509
And it stays there.
 It might as well have been able to do so ..

19
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:13,617
If it is winds.
 You see ...

20
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:19,271
So the door stops here, then it pulls again

21
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:21,856
at full speed

22
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:32,328
You have to turn this lock on this to get it.
 And it turns on the outside so

23
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:38,766
And it hooks stuck here, behind the iron case

24
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:43,386
So if you walk in the inside once and see what it looks like when I close

25
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:44,125
Do you see now?

26
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:44,851
Yes

27
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:52,595
So

28
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:53,263
Nice!
