00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the EFN market we often talk about when it is time to buy stock-

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,160
-And why to buy, but rarely when it's time to sell.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,120
Or should you even sell? We also draw examples with Warren Buffett and SBB. Welcome.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,360
Welcome Christina Sahlberg, economist at Compricer, and Henrik Johansson-

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,480
-VD for young stock savers. How's it going? Is it good?

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,080
-Just great. Fine. -Super. Fun to be here.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,000
Fun to have you here. We will talk about when selling shares. Most often one speaks to-

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,000
-How you find the right shares and when to buy, but often forget the "sales".

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,280
Henrik, when did you last sell a share?

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,000
Most recently, I sold some Japanese index funds I had in the portfolio as an experiment.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,200
Slowly, but surely I sold a little per month. It was the latest sales.

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,520
It went pretty well?

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03.840
Yes, I experimented with having something in the portfolio-

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07.400
-what not at all correlated with the others since a few years-

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,520
-And has gone out of it slowly, but surely. Now only a small slack is left.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,720
-You then, Christina? -Schibsted shares.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,600
I work at Schibsted, but I have a savings program-

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,600
-and because I have quite a few Schibsted shares in relation to other-

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,960
-I sold a little a few years ago because I wanted to balance it up a bit.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
-Maintain the portfolio diversified. -Exactly.

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,840
We will talk about "buy and keep" strategy first. - You like it, Christina. Why?

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,520
Well, we often think we can choose shares and know when to buy and sell them.

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,160
But we got that superstition on the savannah when we climbed the hierarchy-

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,120
-And tried to get high up. We often can't do it.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,800
Therefore, it is better to buy a lot of shares or funds-

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07.960
-To to spread the risks considerably and then sit on the money-

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,200
-To a few years before you need them, so you can sell on time.

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,840
-So you never sell? -I never sell.

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,320
-What do you like that strategy, Henrik? -When Christina describes it it is good.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
But in some situations I am against it.

31
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,200
When people use it as an argument to stay in a company-

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,680
-When they have made a pretty bad investment. As you talk about it is the amazing-

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,720
-But many private savers use the rule incorrectly.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42.560
"As long as I don't sell I haven't lost anything."

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,400
An idiotic way of looking at it.

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52.720
You have a house that burns down. "I haven't lost anything until I have sold."

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,640
Many people use it to stay in a really bad company.

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,760
Then it is not good, but if you are wide and well diversified it is a fantastic strategy.

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09.360
If you have a lot of companies, perhaps nothing if some of them do not deliver?

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,360
Yes, then you may not have to act. In the Corona crisis ... I almost only have funds-

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,920
-But they went down almost 30 % in type two weeks and I got a little panic.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,880
But I know they are going up again. After less than a year they were up again.

43
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,360
Also because I have a lot of shares. It goes up after a while. Patience.

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38.560
But I agree. It is important to think: "Would I buy the share today?"

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,360
But at the same time, understand that one cannot probably value the share better than anyone else.

46
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,880
If a company in the portfolio changes direction ...

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,520
"That's not what I bought."

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,520
Do you then sell or accept even then ...? "I have 49 other companies, it gets rid of."

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,520
I can definitely sell. If a company does something I disagree with.

50
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,760
But at the same time think ... that I should value it is better to sell than to keep-

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,720
-When the whole market says it is worth so much ... then I would rather stay.

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,480
The picture shows Warren Buffett selling stock-

53
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:32,120
-For SEK 135 billion in May this year. A considerable sum even for him.

54
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,320
Everything is relative ...

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,160
He often argues that you should never sell, but still he did it himself.

56
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,960
What do you think he violates his mantra to never sell?

57
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,200
I think about what he said when he was a little younger ... that when he was very young-

58
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,760
-He had a lot of good ideas, but not so much money. Now he has much more money-

59
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:06,960
-An good ideas. When he was younger and did not have so much capital he must sell sometimes-

60
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,200
-To invest in the best option.

61
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,880
Selling a share is reasonable if you find two, three new cases all feel better-

62
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,960
-An the company you are sitting on. Sell that company and invest in the new ones that feel better-

63
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,640
-Where you think you get more returns.

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,640
What is the biggest advantage of never selling a share, Christina?

65
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,240
"Never" never means. You invest to use the money sometime.

66
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,120
Warren is quite old and may want to use the money for something else.

67
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:52,280
You should definitely sell when you need the money. But the absolute best ...

68
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:00,000
Studies show that only one in five actively managed funds strikes index over time.

69
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05.040
A lot of studies also show that fewer than 1 % of all professionals and amateur-

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,200
-lean index over time by choosing shares.

71
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
So to be on the stock exchange as long as possible without selling-

72
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,960
-Is the best you can do and then be very diversized.

73
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,960
Preferably a global index fund that is cheap. You buy the entire world's shares.

74
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,200
So I think the common man gets the best return.

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,120
But it is against our nature not to believe that we can beat the index.

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,320
Everyone believes that. Sometimes we succeed, though it may often be chance.

77
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,440
There are those who succeed, but they are very few.

78
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,640
Do you think you can beat index?

79
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,000
-The jump is the last to leave man. -There's actually.

80
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Sure I have a faith. But my strategy is to choose a company for yourself

81
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00.920
-And have all kinds of funds in the other half.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,920
I become a better investor in my individual companies-

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,400
-When I have a large base in funds. It gets a little easier to keep away the emotions-

84
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,720
-When not everything is invested in the shares I have chosen myself. Do i do away completely-

85
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,200
-I still have the funds like my wide base.

86
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,400
But in a number of situations, I feel it is time to sell a company.

87
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:32,360
Although I buy companies I would like to marry or be with for a long time.

88
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,880
Are there benefits to selling sometime?

89
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,080
If the company has a very bad time ahead, it is a good idea to sell.

90
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,080
But no one knows it. I myself have some criteria. If this happens, I sell.

91
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,600
I lose confidence in management and board-

92
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00.560
-That they don't act in a way I think is good for the company.

93
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:07.440
Or if their incentive does not match why I own the share. Board and management

94
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,240
-have may not have any shares themselves and have no incentive for the company to go well-

95
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,600
-Th has a different agenda than the shareholders' interests.

96
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,880
Then I feel that I do not want to own the share in the long run.

97
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,360
Confidence is a big deal. Or as we said before: that better alternatives exist.

98
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,800
It is always a matter of valuation. Value is what you get, but that's the price you pay.

99
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,160
Do i have a company and the price of the share goes up too much without anything to happen-

100
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,640
-while it corresponds to, or that the prospects look better ...

101
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46.560
Then I can start selling a little at least.

102
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,360
I think the average Swede has five shares in their portfolio.

103
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,680
-It must be too little. -Far too little. Maybe 30 % have a share.

104
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00.360
You may have received a share in inheritance or gift.

105
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04.640
There we have a big reason to sell shares, because it is too little.

106
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,520
If you do not want to make a decision, sell half or 90 % of the value in these shares-

107
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,080
-and buy 10, 20 or preferably 50 shares to, or a fund. Good reasons to sell too.

108
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,440
Another good reason to sell- if you start talking to their respective

109
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,720
-If it is time to buy larger accommodation, perhaps in a year-

110
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32.560
-So we will need to fill up with more down payment.

111
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,040
Could it be a situation then to sell in the portfolio even if it is one year left?

112
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,720
Really. Maybe two years, because it can easily turn in a year. Two, three years are good.

113
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,880
I have saved to my children and when I noticed that it will be needed money-

114
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,960
-I have reduced and sold funds that I have saved to them-

115
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:01,000
-And has money in a savings account with interest to avoid selling just in decline.

116
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,960
There are easy ways to get away from being completely wrong.

117
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,240
Just like almost everyone has monthly savings. Fantastic way to get into the market.

118
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,800
You can have the same strategy when selling, both a single company-

119
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,680
-or when you sell from your portfolio as a whole. Sell by step by step each month.

120
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,040
I often do that now. It used to be that when it went out everything went out.

121
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Then maybe a fantastic report came the week after.

122
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,960
Now I often go out in three, four steps as I find something better.

123
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Or if you are going to buy an apartment.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,520
Start selling a little, so you don't have to get anxiety if it goes up a lot afterwards.

125
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,640
We go back to something that I find interesting.

126
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,280
There is a reasoning that is about reviewing your equity portfolio and asking:

127
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,280
"If I didn't have the shares but money, would I buy exactly the same again?"

128
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,920
If the answer is no, it is time to sell those you answer no to.

129
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,640
What do you say about that reasoning?

130
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17.560
You will probably have a better answer, but I think the same way I said before.

131
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:23,000
After all, there are feelings and perceptions you have around these shares.

132
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,400
You can see when you look at how good shares have gone historically-

133
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,480
-So not a clear sign of how good they will go late.

134
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,880
It's probably dangerous to do it too often. Those that are more active instead of passive-

135
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,680
-Fears worse return.

136
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,160
Make too many decisions that cost both in purchases and sales.

137
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,280
It is dangerous to do it too often but it is good to look over-

138
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,480
-If you believe in the companies still. But not too often.

139
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,040
So those who sit on their hands have statistically better returns?

140
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02.040
They have that. It is proven all the time.

141
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,400
When I was very new to the stock exchange, as soon as I had a few percent in profit-

142
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,360
-So I felt I had to take home the profit.

143
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,080
Then I realized that I was constantly lost to the index and read some books about this.

144
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,560
A book really lifted this with not anchoring to the price you bought on-

145
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,080
-For it doesn't matter what you paid for the stock's future.

146
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
At the bank I was shopping on at that time-

147
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,680
-You can set yourself what price you had bought for.

148
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,600
You could adjust that, at least what it looked like.

149
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,960
Then I reset everyone, so I didn't know if I had a profit or a loss.

150
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,400
And then I became much more passive.

151
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,520
When I had a loss for a while I did not sell immediately when I was plus minus zero.

152
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01.880
But then I had to consider every time I would sell-

153
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07.800
-Do if the analysis instead of relate to what I had bought.

154
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,080
That's a tip. Try to ignore what you bought the share for.

155
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
The anchoring effect is so strong.

156
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,920
Tests have been done when people have been told the last two digits in their social security number.

157
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,440
And then you could say if you wanted to invite that figure to a bottle of wine.

158
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,120
Then it was an invitation opportunity.

159
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,160
Then it turned out that those who had a higher figure paid more for the wine.

160
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,800
It has nothing to do with it, but it was because you saw that figure first.

161
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,880
Knowing what you bought a share for will affect you.

162
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,120
That is why you can see that large electronics chains put very expensive stuff at the entrance.

163
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Exactly. They raise the price and they lower. 70 % sale, it feels so incredibly good.

164
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,840
Perfect. What a find.

165
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,480
I thought we would look at an example, the Swedish real estate company SBB.

166
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,440
Here we have a course graph on them. Up like a sun, down like a pancake.

167
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,000
Is there any occasion in SBB's case, any event or signal-

168
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,480
-which could have made one abandoned a "never sell" strategy

169
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,120
-And, after all, sold its shares in the company?

170
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,320
I think a lot about the fact that there were very many who might be-

171
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,120
-Irritated on management and board long before selling their shares.

172
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,880
For when you sell your shares and maybe make a brack loss-

173
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,240
-If you have been wrong in some way.

174
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,440
But the truth was that they had doubts against management and board-

175
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,720
-long before then.

176
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,960
But when they were about making a wrong investment themselves, then they shot it.

177
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,920
If many have gone after if they had confidence in management and board-

178
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,640
-So they had gone out of this company earlier.

179
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,880
It is a share that I believe is the most owned share of some actors.

180
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,480
Only there can you think about survival bias.

181
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,200
The story is written by the victories. Same with shares.

182
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,560
There are so many who have listened to friends. "Check it goes up."

183
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,760
And then you jump on yourself. It is a risk that you have to think about.

184
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,120
We follow each other, the flock frequency.

185
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,320
You should keep that in mind. Then you could sell when it had gone up a bit.

186
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,720
-And when everyone has already bought, who more should buy? -A little. In the end, it must turn.

187
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,880
A share is driven by two things - that the profit goes up or the multiple goes up.

188
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,960
In the long term, it should preferably be the profit that drives.

189
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,520
But during periods it may be the multiple that drives, as it was in SBB.

190
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,200
The profit had not run away how much, but it became a multiple effect.

191
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,720
It can be a great reason to sell a company: now the multiples are so much higher-

192
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,320
-But the future does not look better now and then it might be time to start selling a little.

193
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:23,680
You want to sell expensive and buy cheap, which is much more difficult to do in practice.

194
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,200
It sounded easy when you said it but is sickly difficult to do in reality.

195
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,800
What would you recommend small savers who are unsure whether to sell or not?

196
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,960
Do you have any tips?

197
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,960
I think that you have very few stock-

198
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,720
-So sell a little of all the few and invest in an index fund, and you are expanding.

199
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,320
And otherwise, just think "his still".

200
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,720
It will go up if you are diversified.

201
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,520
I would encourage to dare to leave a company over some time.

202
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,200
You don't have to sell everything at once. If you start to lose faith in the company, sell a small part.

203
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,840
As you become more confident that it is a company you do not want to own, sell even more.

204
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,200
Then maybe you get back confidence in the company and then you can also buy back.

205
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,440
To scale in and out of companies to both sust-

206
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,920
-The I am a great way to diversify the timing.

207
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,760
That's all we got along today. Thanks, Henrik Johansson and Christina Sahlberg.

208
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,160
Thanks also to you who have looked. We are obviously back soon.

209
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,280
