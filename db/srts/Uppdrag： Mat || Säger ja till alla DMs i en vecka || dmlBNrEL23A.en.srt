00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,520
This morning, Victor asked if I wanted to be a rabbit on his birthday paintball.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09.680
So now we drive!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,080
My name is Mauri Hermundsson.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,680
Since I became Youtuber I have started getting lots of requests in my inbox.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,080
But I always say no because I'm a coward.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Now, however, there will be a change in that.

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,080
This week I will open my inbox every day and accept the first thing that shows up.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,880
What strange places will it lead me to?

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,280
What unexpected people will I meet?

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280
And how far will I be prepared to go?

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,280
- Do you want to take Elin Olander to your wife?

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
This section is also in collaboration with Wolt. But now we are running.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,280
- Monday we have cleared. Now we will accept something new.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,280
And the first thing that appeared now is that a woman named Pirjo wants to show me Finland.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,280
You receive such mail. That is why we do this section.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,280
I get so heavenly random mail. She did not write her number, but I will look for it.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
If you see this now, then that's what we do tomorrow.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:33,280
It is early in the morning and now I will pick up Pirjo for today we will be traveling to Finland.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Is it Pirjo?

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
- My name is Pirjo.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39.861
- Mauri

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,280
- Who has been so stupid?

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
- Yes.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
- Does it sound too damn good or?

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,280
- It's an old guy.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
- Is it?

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
- No it suits you. You look like a Mauri.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,280
- Okay.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,280
Against the boat!

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,280
- Against the boat!

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
- Now! What fun to go on vacation with a strange guy.

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Or guy or boy what are you called?

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
But I'll watch you.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
There are cute girls in Ã…land.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Or boys. You never know.

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
- If you can guess what do you think I'm most craving? Boys or girls?

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
- Both.

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Is it true?

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
- Is it true? Hit me hand!

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
What is yours?

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Yes, that's right.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
- What are you looking for then?

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
- Just old men.

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
- Just old men?

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,800
- Yes, I think you might find someone. I might find someone captain.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
- You are craving the captain?

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,080
- You just never know, these nice hats and stuff.

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,760
Yes, and a little stomach and like this.

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
- Is it sexy?

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,480
- The old man should have some stomach.

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,360
- Not under 200 boilers? 300 kilos?

52
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
- No. Where does the limit go?

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
- It's two and half.

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,240
- 250 kilos?

55
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,280
- But if he's big!

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00.507
- You should suffocate when you are under him.

57
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:01,960
- or over.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06.560
- You should suffocate when you lie above him. Then you are big.

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07.720
- Who is the longest of us?

60
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,880
- I. I have much more strength.

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,920
- Are you stronger? - I can lift you.

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,597
- It's easier for me to lift you.

63
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:19,464
- Try

64
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,360
- It will look strange for all cars?

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,960
- No, it doesn't matter. You should lift me.

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,399
- Don't I wave?

67
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,280
- I take everywhere on your body?

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,080
So! So, don't! Me too, me too!

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,520
- It's a lot of cars.
