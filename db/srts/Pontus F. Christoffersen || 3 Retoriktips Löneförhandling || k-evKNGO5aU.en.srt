Negotiating your salary can feel both uncomfortable and

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.810
hard probably because you've never been taught how

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.390
one should actually prepare and conduct a negotiation

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.237
in a good way.
 But it stops now.

5
00:00:10.237 --> 00:00:15.271
In this video you will receive three concrete rhetoric tips to succeed in your payroll negotiations

6
00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:16.622
For you who are new here on the channel

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.120
This is how my name Pontus F. Christoffersen I run

8
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.160
rhetoric consultant.com where I train the company to become

9
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.210
skilled communicators and increase their profitability through

10
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.645
Their presentations, meetings and negotiations.

11
00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:30.430
Before we start: Do you have any specific arguments or

12
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.340
objections you usually hear and want me to give a good answer to

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.680
Write in the comments and I promise to come back.

14
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.450
Okay tip number one to negotiate your salary.

15
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.140
Avoid arguing from emotion and what you think you deserve.

16
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.740
Develop rational reasons why you

17
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.300
deserves the increase now they pray, how are you more valuable to

18
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.860
company now than a year ago how will you be more

19
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.940
Valuable for the company in the coming year

20
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.110
What have you done that was above expectation or that went beyond expectation

21
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.320
Your boss usually has an opportunity to keep track of

22
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.940
everything that everyone does, which means you need

23
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.760
become good at telling you everything you do so that your

24
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.610
The manager knows about it.

25
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.820
Tip number 2 to negotiate your salary.

26
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.090
We all almost make the mistake of going into a conflict

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.130
when we negotiate.

28
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.350
But instead of going in like a bulldozer and tell

29
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.690
that you should have an increase and it should be this large lay

30
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.009
Instead, it is like you want to grow with the company.

31
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.080
You want to become more valuable and for it to be

32
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.990
Motivating it needs to be fair in both directions.

33
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.890
You generate more value for them and they pay you more for

34
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.004
that you are more valuable.

35
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:31.339
So shape it as you have a

36
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.630
Discussion about the future.

37
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.350
Where you together try to find the best solution for

38
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.863
to develop together.

39
00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:38.540
Tip 3 to negotiate your salary

40
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.134
And this is the most important strategy that you bring with you.

41
00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:45.311
The absolute best thing you can do to raise your salary.

42
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.070
It is to discuss in advance how you can get where you want

43
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.140
be and set goals with your boss.

44
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.480
You can end the hearing you are going to in soon with that

45
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.106
Say something in the style of to get my salary to 32,000 next year.

46
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870
What do I need to do until its

47
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.550
Set clear things that you are going to implement, because it will be very difficult for your

48
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.500
boss when you follow up on this a year later in the next

49
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.680
wage negotiation and you have done everything you will

50
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.760
Agree to not give you the salary that you asked for.

51
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.340
It is much smarter to work proactively in this way

52
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.210
than to try to argue your salary during a negotiation.

53
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.630
Okay that was all for this video if you want to learn

54
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.660
Negotiation technology so you should watch this video as well.
