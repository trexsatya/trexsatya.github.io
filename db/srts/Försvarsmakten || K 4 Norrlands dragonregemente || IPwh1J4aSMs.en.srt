1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,600
Norrland's dragon regiment K 4 in Arvidsjaur.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,800
Educates, develops and leads the hunter union-

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,760
-With qualified ability to work in particular subarctic terrain.

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,280
It is characterized by sparse infrastructure, rock, forest and is crossed by watercourses.

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,160
In winter it is cold, dark and plenty of snow.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,720
The main task of the regiment is to deliver the Armed Forces' foremost association for combat-

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,200
-And scouting on the depths of areas controlled by the opponent.

8
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,440
The bandage operates in small, independent units.

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,280
Scattered over large areas.

10
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Where they have the capacity to cause the opponent's boundary abilities-

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,160
-Thending losses.

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,200
To act as a hunter soldier is demanding both physically and mentally.

13
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,600
Our soldiers are therefore specially selected and specially trained.

14
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,680
The training to master the most extreme environments also creates conditions-

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,687
-To work throughout Sweden's territory, as well as outside the country's borders.

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Our unique knowledge and conditions make us relevant to exchange-

17
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,880
-And exercise with both Swedish and foreign units.

18
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09.880
At the regiment there are management and support functions.

19
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,200
As everyone together contributes to the final target image.

20
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,160
To educate soldiers and bandages who are dangerous to the opponent.

21
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,680
In direct connection with the regiment area there is an exercise field-

22
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,480
-optimized for training and practice of hunter associations.

23
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,480
We build an even stronger defense for tomorrow.

24
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,840
Our most important building block is and remains the high-performing individual-

25
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,480
-O which is motivated and grows with challenges.

26
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
Norrland's dragon regiment K 4 in Arvidsjaur.

27
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,840
Small units.

28
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
Difficult conditions.

29
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,880
Great effect.
