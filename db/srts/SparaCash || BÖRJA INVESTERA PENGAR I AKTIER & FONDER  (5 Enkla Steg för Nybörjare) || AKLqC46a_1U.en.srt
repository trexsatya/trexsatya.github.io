1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,328
In this video, we will go through five simple steps

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,632
to how you can start investing your money

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,192
My name is Marcus and I run SparaCash

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,520
SparaCash is for you who are a beginner who wants to learn

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,592
Start investing your money in stocks, mutual funds and more.

6
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,384
Now we start with step number 1!

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,664
Step number 1.

8
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
Start by opening an account at a bank

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,832
And I usually say to open an account at Avanza bank or at Nordnet Bank

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,160
They make it easy for you to invest your money

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
In both equities and mutual funds

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,048
Traditional big banks they like to make it difficult for you

13
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,376
They do not want to make it easy for you because they want you to go to the bank

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,960
&amp; you should get help from those There Because then they can

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,984
Lock yourself in

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,520
In their own

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,288
Products

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
They do so to

19
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
they should be able to make more money on you as a customer

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,992
but Avanza and Nordnet want to make it easy for you so that you can understand that you can trade shares and mutual funds yourself

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
Because that's how they make more money

22
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,064
In short, good

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,648
Open an account on Avanza or Nordnet there is the link below

24
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,920
They make it easy for you to start investing

25
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,280
It takes about 3 minutes to open an account at one of the 2 banks.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,376
I recommend you open an account at both banks

27
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,960
Because then you can take advantage of both their new customer offers

28
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,776
Step number 2 is that you should open

29
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
an ISK account

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,800
A so-called Investment Savings Account

31
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,680
An investment savings account makes it easy for you to invest

32
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,016
I have a video on how an investment savings account works

33
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
Both advantages and disadvantages.

34
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,648
If you want to know more about an investment savings account, you can watch that video

35
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
An investment savings account is perfect

36
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
For you who want to start investing your money and can not keep track of what you have bought and what you have sold

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,704
How much are you going to pay in taxes and declare and stuff like that cumbersome fuss

38
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:51,104
Without opening an investment savings account, you deposit money you start investing, and then redeem yourself

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
And you get a very low tax

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
The only thing to keep in mind when investing money

41
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,528
An investment savings account is that money you invest

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
should stay in the investment savings account.

43
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
You should not use your ISK as

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,488
a salary account when you lock in and out money without money that you deposit in an investment savings account

45
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
stay there, this for tax reasons

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,376
Step number 3 I usually say but start by buying a fund

47
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,960
Buy a free Sweden fund, for example

48
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,720
Advance. Zero or Nordnet Indexfond Sweden

49
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
These two free funds

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
They spread your money among a variety of stocks

51
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
On the Swedish stock exchanges

52
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
And completely without a fee

53
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
It is perfect to start with these two types of funds

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,640
Just to get started - because it is getting started that is the most important thing

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,816
So you can try by depositing maybe SEK 100 in one fund and deposit SEK 100 in the other

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,352
And then compare these two

57
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,936
How your hundred bucks differ how they go up and how they go down

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,240
Quite a few want to start by buying shares

59
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,080
I usually say start with a fund so you can learn how the process works

60
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
Is that how you feel you want to start buying shares instead

61
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,760
But do not really know what it is, of course I have a video about shares for beginners that you can watch

62
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Step number 4

63
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
You have to decide how much

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
money you can save every month

65
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
The best thing is that you set up a monthly savings account

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
these funds

67
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
So that you every month

68
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,840
Invest the same amount all the time so you buy both when it is high

69
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
And when it's low

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:23,008
let's say you invest SEK 100 every month for 20 years with a 10% annual return

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,040
It will be approximately SEK 72,000 in the end

72
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432
If you instead invest SEK 500 every month for 20 years

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
To 10% annual return

74
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
In the end, it will be approximately SEK 361,000 with interest on the interest effect.

75
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
Do you not know what the interest rate on interest rate effect is?

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
And

77
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
I have a video for it;)

78
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,488
The last step, yes it is step number 5

79
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
and that is that you should: Put yourself on your hands! 
And what do I mean by that?

80
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
You have to be patient

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
In other words

82
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
The more patience you have

83
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
The more money you will earn

84
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
It is in the long run that you make the big money

85
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
And as I always say

86
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
It is a high risk to invest your money.

87
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
One last tip and that is that

88
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
The earlier you start

89
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
The better with the interest rate on the interest rate effect

90
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
then the money will work for you

91
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
the more wealthy you will become

92
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
Money As you invest it is money

93
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
which you should be able to afford to lose

94
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,232
money that you can afford to spare

95
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
thus to be without

96
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
for maybe three to five years at least

97
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
Keep in mind that historical returns are

98
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
no guarantee of future returns

99
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
It therefore means that

100
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
Equity funds that have performed well in the past

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
So there is no guarantee that

102
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
They will do well in the future

103
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,223
But if you look at the history, we see that the stock markets have given 6-10% return approximately per year

104
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
if you pull it out in the long run

105
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,367
So here are five simple steps you can take to begin the process of preparation for mediation

Hi!
