1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:02,678
We have created a family club!

2
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:05,837
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

3
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:09,637
- The last push for the autumn semester now.
- Yes.

4
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,410
I feel like I'm wearing my school uniform.

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,278
- Hello!
- Hello!

6
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:18,615
My very own plushie!

7
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:20,958
Look!

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:34,289
- Good morning.
- Good morning. It's a weekday morning.

9
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:40,242
- Yes, and I'm actually going to school soon.
- Yes. New braids.

10
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:47,243
New braids that mom made.
I'm doing volume, volume, volume.

11
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,779
Now I don't understand anything.
What do you mean "doing volume"?

12
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:54,479
Volume, volume...
I'm pulling on them a bit, like this.

13
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:58,520
Oh. I didn't understand anything.

14
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:01,254
What did you say, Laura?

15
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:03,838
What did you say?

16
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,560
- I'm drawing.
- Yes, you're drawing. It looks so nice.

17
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:10,561
An ant.

18
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:13,564
An ant. Well...

19
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,346
A lobster.

20
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,901
An ant.

21
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:23,539
- Okay, it's a Laura ant.
- A lobster.

22
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:34,747
Today I thought maybe we should
do some gaming.

23
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:39,946
- Yay, how fun!
- After school. It could be fun, right?

24
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:45,619
Check out that smile.
There's someone who likes gaming.

25
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:55,897
- The last push for the autumn semester now.
- Yes. Bye-bye!

26
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:59,500
- Have a nice day at school.
- Yes. Bye-bye!

27
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:05,705
Alma and Harry have taken the train to school
and I've dropped off Laura at kindergarten.

28
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:10,375
- So now it's just the two of us in the vlog.
- Yep, for a while anyway.

29
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:16,914
There's a lot going on in our family right now.
Well, that goes for all families before Christmas, I think.

30
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:21,518
But, we've had an idea
which we've been working on for quite some time.

31
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:25,889
Yes. An idea we can finally talk about.

32
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,425
- Yes. We have created a family club.
- Yes, a community.

33
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,961
- Where the membership is free.
- Yes.

34
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:43,363
- And we think you should become members.
- Yes. The basic idea is to save time and money for families with kids.

35
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,919
We know that there's a lot you want to do as a family,
but the more people there are, the more it costs.

36
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:57,338
Yes, and we know it's hard to find the time
when you have kids of different ages.

37
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,543
So in the club, we will collect
nice offers and discounts-

38
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:12,249
-on everything from necessary things such as grocery bags,
to fun experiences that you want to do as a family.

39
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,384
Yes.

40
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:17,854
Over the years, we have built up
quite a large experience-

41
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:24,793
-about what our family and our kids think is fun to do,
and what you think is fun to do.

42
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:33,666
So we have contacted places that we have been at,
and they're in the club now with great offers.

43
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:39,204
- We have built a website with very small means.
- Very, very, very.

44
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:41,406
We don't have a bunch of money.

45
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:46,543
We are doing this in collaboration with Miia and Ramin,
our friends down here, who have been in our videos before.

46
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,123
- Yes. And now we're actually going to go in and meet Ramin.
- At their office in Lisbon.

47
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,300
- Yes.
- And take a look at the club website.

48
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,655
- Aren't you supposed to say, "Come along"?
- Come along!

49
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:25,507
- I always feel like a child when I wear a backpack.
- And I feel like I'm wearing my school uniform.

50
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:31,179
Yes, you're also wearing a backpack.
But it's the best way to carry a computer.

51
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:37,287
Yes, I feel that my back is getting old,
so I can't seem to carry it any other way.

52
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,318
Then I get back pain.

53
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,654
- Oh, it got so dark.
- Oh!

54
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,940
There. Now.

55
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:48,993
- It takes a while before the camera catches on.
- Yes.

56
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,397
- Hello!
- Hello!

57
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:56,669
- Hello!
- Welcome!

58
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:59,510
- How's it going?
- Fine, thanks.

59
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:03,271
- Hey!
- Hey! Oh, what a colorful shirt!

60
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,673
- Right?
- Stylish!

61
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,008
- The African find.
- Yes.

62
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,747
- Perfect. Welcome.
- I'm very happy with it. Thanks.

63
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:17,352
- I see that Ramin has filled the fruit plate.
- We need the extra calories.

64
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:22,356
- When we were here last, we ate everything.
- It's necessary.

65
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:28,361
God, how funny. It really looks like
it's the one who's listening to music.

66
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,307
- It's my pal in the office now.
- So cozy.

67
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:36,701
You can turn off the music,
it may be copyrighted.

68
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,202
Yes, exactly.

69
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,349
- Oops!
- They fell off right when the music stopped.

70
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:50,612
This is Harry's squishmallow.
He'll get to talk more about that later, won't he?

71
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,020
Yes.

72
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:58,084
- Look. Here's Laura's.
- It doesn't look quite as happy.

73
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:02,855
I know.
But yeah, this is how they come packaged.

74
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:07,625
God, we're being so secretive now.
We'll talk more about that later, simply.

75
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,520
- Shall we check out the website?
- Let's do it! Fun!

76
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:20,502
I really like this green color against the blue
which comes back here in the picture of Alma drawing.

77
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:23,871
And... the gray one fits great.

78
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:29,342
And the pink pops really well
so you really see where to click.

79
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:30,343
It'll be great.

80
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:34,365
- "This way." Can you click it, then?
- Click, click!

81
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,416
Yes.

82
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:42,486
- It took us to the page. Good.
- Yes.

83
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:46,160
We've talked about separating these,
"Weekend Adventures & Everyday Projects."

84
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:48,858
- Right.
- Exactly.

85
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:53,828
It's in the making,
but it will take some time.

86
00:06:53,895 --> 00:07:01,223
- Yes, but now the final push is here.
- Yes, I know. So now it's full intensity. Now we just go.

87
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,940
Here we go!

88
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:07,272
You know much more about all that than I do
and have someone you usually work with and so on.

89
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,542
...and get back with your thoughts,
and then we can try one meat and one fish.

90
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,079
For a long time, we have wanted to give back
to families and followers.

91
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:25,854
That's why we're starting an online club
which will become Sweden's most active family club.

92
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,004
- Hey, what's going on?
- They're fighting.

93
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,407
- You're home from school.
- Mhm.

94
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:53,676
- Where's Alma?
- She's at padel practice.

95
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:59,347
- And Laura?
- She's at her "crèche". They're very slow there.

96
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,816
That's actually true.

97
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:10,689
Harry's after-school center closes at four.
If we go to get Laura then, she hasn't even eaten her snack yet.

98
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:16,694
The whole day is pushed back
here in Portugal for the little ones.

99
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:19,230
- But Harry?
- Yes?

100
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:24,701
How about you come up instead of being under the bed,
in your little room there.

101
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:31,606
Get on the bed to show your…
plushie, or squishmallow.

102
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:34,008
What do people call these?

103
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:41,347
- I think they say plush toy.
- Plush toy, okay. Your very own plush toy.

104
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:47,952
They've seen it earlier today.
What is this?

105
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,822
It's a plushie.
My plushie.

106
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:54,758
Yes, that's your plushie.

107
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:58,694
I don't know if you remember,
but we talked about it a long time ago.

108
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:03,164
When you did "Kids in Charge",
we were in a toy store.

109
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:07,535
Remember we asked:
Would you like it if we made our own plushies?

110
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,938
- Yes!
- Yes! The viewers definitely wanted that.

111
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:17,809
So we've been researching this
and it's a jungle, I must say.

112
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:22,346
It's a fun project, but it also takes time
when you have to design yourself,-

113
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:26,183
-and you look at different designs
and what you can do and so on.

114
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:33,155
During the time we've been looking,
we found this one, and...

115
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:38,359
- Could you bring Laura's over here?
- Yes. Here.

116
00:09:38,492 --> 00:09:47,050
We found a manufacturer that had one each
which suited Alma, Harry, and Laura.

117
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,669
- Yes.
- Shall we get Alma's too? I'll do it.

118
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,943
Check this out.
Here's Alma's bunny.

119
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:08,920
Listen, it's very tidy here now
because we had a house cleaner here today, I must admit.

120
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:14,287
- It has such beautiful cheeks.
- Yes. Look, when I squeeze it...

121
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:18,891
- Check this out!
- Yay! The whole family is together.

122
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,225
Yes!

123
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:27,498
We sell these in our members club,
in a little webshop that we have.

124
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:31,067
And in that webshop,
we have some selected products.

125
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:35,756
- A few selected products.
- Exactly. A few. And...

126
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:39,607
There, we try to push prices down
as much as possible.

127
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:46,480
We know, for example, that we have put these at a price level
which is about half compared to in a toy store.

128
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:51,490
- And they're very soft!
- And big, almost like a pillow.

129
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,920
Right, this is a pretty big plushie.

130
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,623
You can squish it so that it becomes small,
but for a large plushie, it's about half the price.

131
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:02,893
But if you're going to shop there,
you must be a member of our club.

132
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,296
So, first you have to become a member,
and then you can check out the webshop.

133
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:10,298
- And it's free.
- Yes, membership is free.

134
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:14,869
But... we haven't even said
how they get to the club.

135
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:22,542
Right. The URL is:
www.swedishfamilyclub.com

136
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:29,570
- We will put a link in the video description.
- The link is below. But first, you have to watch the video.

137
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,016
- Yes, because now we're going to pick up the girls!
- Yes!

138
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,390
Let's go!
Are you going to bring the plushies?

139
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,090
- No, they can stay.
- They can have a conference with the other friends there.

140
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:42,491
Yes.

141
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:51,431
Here's the local padel and tennis club.

142
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:01,873
Alma!

143
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:04,358
- Hello!
- Hello!

144
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:07,344
- How did it go?
- It's gone well.

145
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,212
- Was it fun?
- Mhm.

146
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,348
- It's so yellow in here. Such a Christmas feeling.
- Yes.

147
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:17,085
- It's actually decorated for Christmas.
- Yes, I see that.

148
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:19,020
- Hello, girls!
- Hello!

149
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:26,359
Hi, Laura! How are you?

150
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,361
She wants to kiss. She wants to kiss.

151
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:36,967
This was my first time inside Laura's kindergarten.
I didn't know you could go inside.

152
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:41,271
Of course you can, it's not c*vid anymore.
Well, it is, but...

153
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:45,340
- It was really cozy in there.
- Yes, it's a really nice kindergarten.

154
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:48,000
But I can't film in there.
I can't come along.

155
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,212
No, because there are lots of other kids there
and we don't have their permission.

156
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,280
I want my pacifier.

157
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:55,549
- Oh, was it...
- I want my pacifier.

158
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:58,151
- You want your pacifier?
- Yes.

159
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:03,622
- When don't you want a pacifier, Laura?
- Exactly. Pacifier and playing with earlobes.

160
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,520
- Let's go home!
- Yes!

161
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:25,672
This is my favorite food.
This pasta sauce.

162
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,745
But that pasta...
You'll have to fix that.

163
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,500
- Yes, but wait. Stop, stop.
- Push it down.

164
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:40,250
I need to do it perfect.
Look, it goes down, because it gets wobbly.

165
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,687
Okay.
And also, this is normal...

166
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:48,300
- I want ice cream!
- You want ice cream. But we're going to eat dinner first, little one.

167
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:51,093
- I want ice cream!
- You can have ice cream after dinner.

168
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,295
- No, "omeal!"
- You can have ice cream after dinner.

169
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,964
No, "omeal!" "Omeal!"

170
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,699
- Oatmeal.
- Yes.

171
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:01,760
- But listen, take out the pacifier so I can hear you.
- Want "omeal!"

172
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,870
Okay. I'm fine cooking you some oatmeal.

173
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:10,074
She's so hard to feed right now,
so I'm fine making oatmeal for her.

174
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:14,411
What I was saying was that
this is normal spaghetti, Alma.

175
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:17,680
Hey you, who has been eating wheat-free
for all these years.

176
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:24,953
Yes! My doctor has told me that I'm not gluten anymore.
I've grown out of it.

177
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,889
She's not gluten.
You have done new allergy tests.

178
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:33,960
It's funny, "I am gluten."
No one is gluten. Right?

179
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:38,030
- I mean... Gluten allergic.
- Alma is gluten. Or, you were gluten.

180
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:41,299
- No, she was hypersensitive to wheat. Hello?
- Yes.

181
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:45,669
- But anyway. She's fine. She can eat anything!
- Yes.

182
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:47,204
Happy days!

183
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,541
We have received a lot of Question of the Day about it.
Now you got an answer.

184
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,676
Yes.

185
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,178
There.

186
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,842
Oops. Difficult.

187
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:04,684
Now Laura wanted pasta anyway.

188
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,687
But I cooked oatmeal.

189
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,223
Do you want it?
No. Anyone else want it?

190
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,024
Me!

191
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,560
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

192
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:22,098
And Alma's favorite is pasta sauce
with ham and mushrooms.

193
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:26,335
- No, I don't want it!
- No, you don't want it.

194
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,869
Is it the same in your household?

195
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:33,474
- Don't want it!
- No. Okay, okay. Would you like some ketchup, maybe?

196
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:37,277
- Okay! My turn.
- Good. Your turn. Mm.

197
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:39,094
It's enough.

198
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:57,293
- Here comes the cuddly duck!
- Is the cuddly duck coming? How cozy!

199
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:02,363
- It has walked down the stairs.
- Oh, has it? Come sit here with me.

200
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,698
How cozy.

201
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,234
What are you guys doing?

202
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,734
We're having a game night.

203
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:14,844
I promised Harry we would play a little,
so now I'm Spider-Man and I'm fighting Harry.

204
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:17,634
- No!
- Yes! I won.

205
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:24,081
We have a gaming console
with thousands of old games.

206
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:29,544
So, games from when I was a kid.
Like, 100 years old.

207
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:35,356
Such as Sega Mega Drive games,
PlayStation 1 games, Atari...

208
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:38,125
- Dad, fast! Now! You're fighting!
- Oh!

209
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:41,027
And arcade games. Great fun.

210
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:46,144
- It doesn't look very modern.
- No, but it's fun.

211
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,602
Oh! A power-up!

212
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,003
No!

213
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:55,741
No, your mushroom!
Wait there and it will probably go back.

214
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,422
Mom, come on!

215
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:04,613
Now it's my turn.

216
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:18,957
♪ Happy Birthday to You! ♪

217
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,359
Is it "Happy Birthday"?

218
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:24,695
Back.

219
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:26,764
It's Lucia, isn't it?

220
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,698
Back.

221
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:31,768
- Do you want black?
- Aha.

222
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,937
I don't think there is a black one.

223
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,205
What day is it today?

224
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:42,895
It's Friday. There's no school or kindergarten today
because it's a red day here in Portugal.

225
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:45,879
- Pink.
- Yes, it can be a pink day.

226
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,347
A pink day...

227
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:53,309
But Alma, what happened to your room?
It was so nice and tidy yesterday.

228
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:59,423
I know, it got really messy.
And Laura doesn't help much with the mess.

229
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:07,259
Speaking of messy homes,
we actually have an offer in the club on house cleaning.

230
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:10,031
I fit that in nicely.

231
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:15,736
There's a lot of good stuff in the club now,
and there will be more!

232
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,271
Yes. This is just the beginning.

233
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:27,078
The more members we get in the club,
the better the discounts and offers we'll be able to negotiate for you.

234
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:34,150
So now we want you to click the link
at the top of the video description and register as members.

235
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:38,287
It's a simple registration.
You have to be an adult to do it,-

236
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:46,960
-so if you're a family, then one of the parents enter
the children's birthdays, because we have an idea...

237
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:48,895
Laura has birthdays!

238
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:53,966
Yes, you have a birthday too, and everyone likes birthdays,
and many like to receive a greeting.

239
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:58,470
- Laura's birthday.
- Yes, you'll be three next time.

240
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,847
That's just two. One more.

241
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:05,675
We have an idea about being able to send out
birthday greetings via the club.

242
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:11,613
- To all members.
- Yes. That service doesn't really work now, but it will eventually.

243
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,014
Eventually.

244
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:19,820
