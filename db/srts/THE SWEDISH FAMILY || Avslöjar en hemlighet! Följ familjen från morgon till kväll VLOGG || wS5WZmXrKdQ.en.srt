1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,678
We have created a family club!

2
00:00:03,528 --> 00:00:05,837
♪ Happy Birthday to you!
 ♪

3
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,637
- Last jerk in the autumn term now.
 - Yes.

4
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,410
I feel like I have my school uniform on me.

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,278
- Hello!
 - Hello!

6
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:18,615
My very own "plushie"!

7
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:20,958
Check!

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:34,289
- Good morning.
 - Good morning.
 It's everyday morning.

9
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:40,242
- Yes, and I'm actually going to school soon.
 - Yes.
 New braids.

10
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:47,243
New braids that mom has done.
 I am doing "Volume, Volume, Volume."

11
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:50,779
Now I didn't take anything.
 What, "is doing and doing volume"?

12
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:54,479
"Volume, Volume ..." So, I pull them out a bit like this.

13
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:58,520
Well.
 I didn't take anything.

14
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:01,254
What did you say, Laura?

15
00:01:02,158 --> 00:01:03,838
What did you say?

16
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,560
- I am drawing.
 - Yes, you are drawing.
 Getting really nice after all.

17
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:10,561
An ant.

18
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:13,564
An ant.
 Well.

19
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,346
A crayfish.

20
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:18,901
An ant.

21
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:23,539
- Okay, it's a Laura-Myra.
 - A crayfish.

22
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:34,747
Today I thought we might go a little neighbor.

23
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:39,751
- Yeah, how fun!
 - After school.
 It could be fun, huh?

24
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:45,619
Check out that Smajlet.
 There is someone who likes Gejming.

25
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:55,897
- Last jerk in the autumn term now.
 - Yes.
 Bye.

26
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:59,500
- Have a nice day at school.
 - Yes.
 Bye.

27
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:05,705
Alma and Harry have taken the train to school and I have left Laura in kindergarten.

28
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:10,375
- So now it's just the two of us in the vlog.
 - Yeah, for a while anyway.

29
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:16,914
There is a lot going on in our family right now.
 Or, it does well in all families before Christmas, I think.

30
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:21,518
But we have had an idea that we have worked for quite a long time.

31
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:25,889
Yes.
 An idea that we can finally talk about.

32
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,425
- Yes.
 We have created a family club.
 - Yes, a community.

33
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,961
- Where membership is free.
 - Yes.

34
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:43,363
- And we think you should become members.
 - Yes.
 The basic idea is to save time and money for families with children.

35
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,919
We know that there is a lot you want to do as a family, but the more you are the more it costs.

36
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:57,338
Yes, and we know that it is difficult to make time enough when you have children of different ages.

37
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,543
So in the club we will collect nice deals and discounts-

38
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:12,249
-To everything from the necessary stuff like grocery bags, to fun experiences that you want to do as a family.

39
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:13,384
Yes.

40
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:17,854
We have over the years built up a fairly large experience-

41
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:24,793
-Kring what our family and our children think is fun to do, and what you think is fun to do.

42
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:33,666
So we have contacted places that we have been and visited, and they are now in the club with good offers.

43
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:39,204
- We have built a website with very small means.
 - Pytte, Pytte, Pytte.

44
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:41,406
So, we don't have a lot of money.

45
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:46,543
And we collaborate with Miia and Ramin, our friends down here who have been seen earlier on the channel.

46
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,123
- Yes.
 And now we are actually going to go in and meet Ramin.
 - In their office in Lisbon.

47
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,300
- Yes.
 - And look a little on the club website.

48
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,655
- Shouldn't you say, "hook on"?
 - Hang on!

49
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:25,507
- I always feel like a child when I get in a backpack.
 - And I feel like I have my school uniform on me.

50
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:31,179
Yes, you also have a backpack.
 But that is the best way to wear a computer.

51
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:37,287
Yes, I feel that my back is getting old, so I can't carry any other way.

52
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,318
Then I get hurt.

53
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,654
- Oh, how dark it got.
 - Yes, oh!

54
00:04:42,854 --> 00:04:44,940
So there.
 Now.

55
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:48,993
- It takes a while before the camera hooks on.
 - Yes.

56
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,397
- Hello!
 - Hello!

57
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:56,669
- Hello!
 - Welcome!

58
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:59,510
- How's it going?
 - That's good, thank you.

59
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:03,271
- Well!
 - Well!
 Oh, what a colorful shirt!

60
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,673
- Yes is not it?
 - Handsome!

61
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,008
- The Africa discovery.
 - Yes.

62
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,747
- Perfect.
 Welcome.
 - I am very happy with it.
 Thanks.

63
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:17,352
- I see that Ramin has filled the fruit barrel.
 - A little extra calories are needed.

64
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:22,356
- When we were here last we ate everything type.
 - It needs.

65
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:28,361
God, what fun.
 It really looks like it's the one who listens to music.

66
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,307
- It's my "PAL" in the office now.
 - Cuddly.

67
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:36,701
You may turn off the music, it may be copyrighted.

68
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,202
Yes exactly.

69
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,349
- Oh!
 - And so they went off while the music ended.

70
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:50,612
This is Harry's squishmallow.
 But he should tell you more about it later, right?

71
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,020
Yes.

72
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:58,084
- Check out.
 Here is Lauras.
 - It doesn't look quite as happy.

73
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:02,855
I know.
 But yes, here they come packaged.

74
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:07,625
God, how secret this was now.
 We talk more about it later, simply.

75
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,520
- Should we check the website?
 - "Let's do it!"
 Fun!

76
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:20,502
I really like this green color against the blue that comes back here in the picture when Alma sits and draws.

77
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:23,871
And then ... The gray fits great.

78
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:29,342
And the pink pops really nice so you really see where to push somewhere.

79
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:30,343
It will be great.

80
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:34,365
- "Hitåt."
 Can you push, then?
 - Click, click!

81
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,416
"Yes."

82
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:42,486
- Now we came on!
 Good.
 - Yes.

83
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:46,160
We have talked about separating this.
 "Weekend adventure & everyday projects."

84
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:48,858
- Right.
 - Exactly.

85
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:53,828
It's "in the making," but it takes some time.
 (It's on)

86
00:06:53,895 --> 00:07:01,223
- Yes, but now is the last jerk here.
 - Yes I know.
 So now it's full intensity.
 Now we just drive.

87
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,940
Here we go!

88
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:07,272
Of course, you know a lot more about all such arrangements than I do and have someone you usually work with and such.

89
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,542
... and come back with your thoughts, and then we can try a meat and a fish.

90
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,079
We have long thought that we want to be able to give back to families and followers-

91
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:25,854
-And there we have come to the conclusion that we start an online club that will become all of Sweden's most active family club.

92
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,004
- Hello, what is happening?
 - They are fought.

93
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,407
- You're home from school.
 - mm.

94
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:53,676
- Where is Alma, then?
 - She's on the paddle.

95
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:59,347
- And Laura, then?
 - She's on her "cream".
 They are very tough there.

96
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,816
That's actually true.

97
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:10,689
Harry's leisure closes four.
 If we go to pick up Laura then, then she has not even eaten mellis.

98
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:16,694
The whole day is shot here in Portugal for the little ones.

99
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:19,230
- But you, Harry?
 - Yes?

100
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:24,701
I thought you should come up instead of being under the bed, in your little room there.

101
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:31,606
Go up to bed to show your ... plushie, or squishmallow.

102
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:34,008
What are you saying about these?

103
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:41,347
- I think you say "plush toy."
 - "Plush Toy", okay.
 Your very own "plush toy."

104
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:47,952
They have seen it earlier today.
 What is this?

105
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,822
It's a "plushie."
 My "plushie."

106
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:54,758
Yes, that's your "plushie."

107
00:08:54,824 --> 00:08:58,694
I don't know if you remember, but we talked about it for a long time ago.

108
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:03,164
When you made the "children decide" we were in a toy store.

109
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:07,535
Do you remember that we asked: Would you like to see us make your own "plushies"?

110
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,938
- Yes!
 - Yes!
 Viewers absolutely wanted to see that.

111
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:17,809
So we have been doing and investigating this and it is a jungle, I should say.

112
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:22,346
It is a fun project, but it takes time even when designing yourself,-

113
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:26,183
-And you look at different designs and what you can do and so there.

114
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:33,155
While we have been looking, we found this, and ...

115
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:38,359
- Can't you bring out Lauras?
 - Yes.
 Here.

116
00:09:38,492 --> 00:09:47,050
We found a manufacturer who had each one that suited Alma, Harry and Laura.

117
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,669
- Yes.
 - Should we pick up Almas too?
 I can go.

118
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,943
Check this out.
 Here is Alma's rabbit.

119
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:08,920
And so Hörrni, it is very tidy here now because we have had a maid here today, I will admit.

120
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:14,287
- It has such a nice cheeks.
 - Yes.
 Check out, when I press together ...

121
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:18,891
- Check this out!
 - Yeah!
 The whole family is gathered.

122
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,225
Yes!

123
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:27,498
We sell these in our member club, in a small webshop we have.

124
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:31,067
And in that webshop we have some selected products.

125
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:35,756
- A few selected products.
 - Exactly.
 A few.
 And...

126
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:39,607
There we try to push prices as much as possible.

127
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:46,480
For example, we know that these we have put on a price level that is about half compared to a toy store.

128
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:51,490
- And they are very soft!
 - And big, almost like a pillow.

129
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,920
Exactly, this is a pretty big "plushie."

130
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,623
You can squeeze it together so it gets small, but for a big "plushie" it is about half the price.

131
00:10:58,756 --> 00:11:02,893
But if you are going to shop there, you have to be a member of our club.

132
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,296
So first you have to go in and become members, and then you can check out the webshop.

133
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:10,298
- And that's free.
 - Yes, membership is free.

134
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:14,869
But then, we haven't even said how they find the club.

135
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:22,542
Right.
 The address is: www.swedishfamilyclub.com

136
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:29,570
- We will put a link in the video text.
 - The link is below.
 But first you have to check the video clearly.

137
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,016
- Yes, because now we will go and pick up the girls!
 - Yes!

138
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,390
"Let's go!"
 But should you bring the toys, right?

139
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,090
- No, they may remain.
 - They may have a conference with the other friends there.

140
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:42,491
Yes.

141
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:51,431
Here is the local paddle and tennis club.

142
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:01,873
Alma!

143
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:04,358
- Hello!
 - Hello!

144
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:07,344
- How did it go?
 - It has gone well.

145
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,212
- Was it fun?
 - mm.

146
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,348
- It's so yellow in here.
 You get the worst "Christmas feeling."
 - Yes.

147
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:17,085
- It's actually Christmas decorations.
 - Yes I see it.

148
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:19,020
- Hello girls!
 - Hello!

149
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:26,359
Hello, Laura!
 How are you?

150
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,361
She wants to be kissed.
 She wants to be kissed.

151
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:36,967
It was my first time I was in Laura's daycare.
 I didn't know you had to go in.

152
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:41,271
Obviously you get, it's not C*at anymore.
 Or yes, it is, but ...

153
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:45,340
- It was really nice.
 - Yes, it's a very nice kindergarten.

154
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:48,000
But inside I can't film.
 I can't come in.

155
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,212
No, because there are lots of other children there and we don't have their condition.

156
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,280
I'm craving a pacifier.

157
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:55,549
- Well, it was ... - I'm craving a pacifier.

158
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:58,151
- You are craving pacifier?
 - Yes.

159
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:03,622
- When are you not craving pacifier, Laura?
 - Exactly.
 Pacifier and ear pill.

160
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:07,520
- Lets go home!
 - Yes!

161
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:25,672
This is my favorite food, this pasta sauce.

162
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,745
But then you, that pasta ... you have to fix that.

163
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,500
- Yes, but wait.
 Stop, stop.
 - Press it down.

164
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:40,250
"I NEED TO DO IT PERFECT."
 Check out, it goes down, because it becomes "wobbly."

165
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,687
Okay.
 And you, this is common ...

166
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:48,300
- I want ice cream!
 - You want ice cream.
 But we're going to have dinner first, Hörrudu.

167
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:51,093
- I want ice cream!
 - You get ice cream after dinner.

168
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,295
- No, "Göt!"
 - You get ice cream after dinner.

169
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,964
No, "Göt!"
 "Ingot!"

170
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:58,699
- Porridge.
 - Yes.

171
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:01,760
- But listen, you have to take out the pacifier so I hear.
 - Want "Göt!"

172
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,870
Okay.
 I can actually imagine boiling some porridge for you.

173
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:10,074
She is so difficult to get in food right now, so I would like to make oatmeal porridge for her.

174
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:14,411
But what I would say was that this is ordinary spaghetti, Alma.

175
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:17,680
Hörrudu, who has eaten wheat -free all year.

176
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:24,953
Yes!
 I have received from my doctor that I am not gluten anymore.
 It has grown away.

177
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,889
She is not gluten.
 You have done new allergy tests.

178
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:33,960
It's funny that with, "I'm gluten."
 Surely no one is gluten.
 Or?

179
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:38,030
- So ... gluten allergic.
 - Alma is gluten.
 Or, you were gluten.

180
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:41,299
- No, she was hypersensitive to wheat.
 Hello?
 - Yes.

181
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:45,669
- But anyway.
 She's "fine."
 She can eat everything!
 - Yes.

182
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:47,204
"Happy Days!"

183
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,541
We have received a lot of today's question about it, so now you got who asked answers.

184
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,676
Yes.

185
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,178
So there.

186
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,842
Oh oh oh.
 So.

187
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:04,684
Now Laura wanted pasta anyway.

188
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,904
But I actually boiled a porridge.

189
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,223
Do you want it?
 No.
 Anyone else who wants it?

190
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,024
Yeah!

191
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,560
- You are welcome.
 - Thanks.

192
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:22,098
And Alma's favvo is pasta sauce with ham and mushroom.

193
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:26,335
- Uää!
 No, I don't want!
 - No, you don't want it.

194
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,869
Do you have it like this at home too?

195
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:33,474
- Don't have it!
 - No.
 Okay okay.
 Do you want some ketchup, maybe?

196
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:37,277
- Okay!
 My turn.
 - Good.
 Your turn.
 Mm.

197
00:15:37,343 --> 00:15:39,094
It is enough.

198
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:57,293
- Now comes the gos-anchor!
 - Will the Gos anchor come?
 How cozy!

199
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:02,363
- It has gone down the stairs.
 - Well, does it have?
 Come and sit here with me.

200
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,698
Oh!
 How cozy.

201
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,234
What do you do?

202
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,734
We sit and have "Game Night."

203
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:14,844
I promised Harry that we would play a little, so now I'm the spider man and I fight against Harry.

204
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:17,634
- No!
 - "Yes!"
 I won.

205
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:24,081
We have a gejming console with several thousand old games.

206
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:29,544
So, games from the time when I was a child.
 Type 100 years old.

207
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:35,356
Type Sega Mega Drive Games, PlayStation 1 Games, Atari ...

208
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:37,958
- Dad, fast!
 Now!
 They are fought!
 - Oh!

209
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:41,027
And arcade games.
 Great fun.

210
00:16:41,694 --> 00:16:46,144
- It doesn't look very modern.
 - No, but it's fun.

211
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,602
Oh!
 A "power-up!"

212
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,003
No!

213
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:55,741
No, your mushroom!
 Wait there and it will probably go back.

214
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:02,177
- Mom, come on!
 - (Joanna Tjar)

215
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:04,613
Now it's my turn.

216
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:18,957
♪ Happy Birthday to you!
 ♪

217
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,359
Is it "Happy Birthday"?

218
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:24,695
S -speed.

219
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:26,764
Well, it's Lucia?

220
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,698
S -speed.

221
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:31,768
- Do you want black?
 - AAA.

222
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,937
I don't think there is black here.

223
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,205
What day is it today?

224
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:42,895
It is Friday.
 We are vacant from school and kindergarten because it is red day here in Portugal.

225
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:45,879
- Pink.
 - Yes, it can be a pink day.

226
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,347
A pink day ...

227
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:53,309
But Alma, what happened to your room?
 It was so tidy and nice yesterday.

228
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:59,423
I know, it got really great.
 And Laura doesn't help so much with the mess.

229
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:07,259
Speaking of messy homes, we actually have an offer in the club on home cleaning.

230
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:10,231
There I got it too.

231
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:15,736
There are a lot of good stuff in the club now, and there will be more!

232
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,271
Yes.
 This is just the start.

233
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:27,078
And the more members we become in the club, the better discounts and offers we will be able to negotiate to you.

234
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:34,150
So now we want you to follow the link at the top of the video text and go in to register as members.

235
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:38,287
It is a simple registration.
 One should be adult to make it,-

236
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:46,960
-So if you are a family, then one of the parents enters the children's birthdays, because we have an idea ...

237
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:48,895
Laura has birthdays!

238
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:53,966
Yes, you also have a birthday, and everyone likes to fill years, and many people like to have a greeting.

239
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:58,470
- Laura is celebrating years.
 - Yes, you turn three next time.

240
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,847
That's just two.
 One more.

241
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:05,675
We have a thought of being able to send out birthday greetings through the club.

242
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:11,613
- To all members.
 - Yes.
 That service doesn't really work now, but in the long run.

243
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,014
Eventually.

244
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:19,820

245
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,358
