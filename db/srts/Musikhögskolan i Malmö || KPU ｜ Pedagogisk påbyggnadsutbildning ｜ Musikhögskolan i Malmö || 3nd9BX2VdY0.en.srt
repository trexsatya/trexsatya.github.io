1
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,800
KPU, that means supplementary educational education

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:20,000
And it is aimed at people who have a professional experience, a professional background in music.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,320
When I have previously attended a musician education, I have focused on myself

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,744
And my own expression, my own musicianship.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,584
But here at KPU, all these gaps are filled with

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,192
how I am as a teacher and educator, how I talk to people, how children learn

7
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,544
And how to work with teaching different kinds in different forms.

8
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49.840
We also have ensemble management here at the School of Music

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,400
And that was one of the reasons actually that I chose KPU here at the Music University in MalmÃ¶.

10
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:02.901
One day you sit in seminars and discuss literature and the other day you have to play electric guitar or drums.

11
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:05.160
It's simply a good mix.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,387
My study is about group creation, so here to compose in groups.

13
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:16,032
I have a professional life behind me and an artistry, while I have pedagogy.

14
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616
I can work at an aesthetic gym for now I have to rate.

15
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,664
So I feel it's a width

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
In what is there, professionally.
