00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13.560
Hello and welcome to the City Library

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,100
and this conversation about Ursula K. Le Guins

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,420
"The uninhabited", the new edition of it actually,

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,860
In Swedish, for the first time in quite a while.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,660
My name is Anders and I am a youth librarian here

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,320
At the City Library's youth department Dynamo.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,980
And with me I have

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,420
Jens and Andreas.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,580
Welcome.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,220
Thanks, Nicely Done!

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32.512
Thought we could

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34.304
Start talking a little bit about

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
Ursula K. Le Guin is a

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37.888
portal figure, a giant within

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,680
Science fiction and fantasy also actually.

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
Your relationship with her

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,480
as a writer.

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,120
The first thing I read by Le Guin was enough

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
In the middle school actually

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,480
An old book called it is called "The World is called Forest".

21
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55.808
An allegory of the Vietnam War, it did not understand that time.

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,520
At that time I read everything that was science fiction.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,960
But it was probably the first lit neighbor

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,100
socially and ethically challenging

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,580
The science fiction book I read.

26
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Then I found more of Le Guin.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,500
I tried on this book, Shevek was named in the edition that was there when I was little.

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,080
I was just too young for it then.

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,660
But that particular book has then comes back to me

30
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
on several occasions

31
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
and Le Guin has become a

32
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,320
A favorite writer.

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,420
Partly because of this book but also other books she has written.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,480
For my part so well

35
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
this book

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38.304
More than her as a writer.

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
It is well like the main thing. I read it as very young

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,440
And understood half.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
And thought some stuff was cool and other stuff was just strange.

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
And then so

41
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,128
Has it been stuck so I returned to it,

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Yes, throughout life. I have read about the book devil.

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01.856
Type in high school age, high school age, becomes adult and young adult and so on

44
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04.416
And have always found new gadgets in it.

45
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06.720
It has, like sat stuck

46
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,000
In my bookshelf since then.

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,600
And become a favorite book for ...

48
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
Mainly because it is so

49
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
What is the name?

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,480
Ambivalent.

51
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,320
It is probably the charm of it.

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,480
Now we have held you who are looking at the halter because why are you just two here? You may wonder that.

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,100
Andreas works with the publisher, Federative's publisher, and Jens has illustrated the book.

54
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,280
Exactly, that's why you are here.

55
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,500
But now one might wonder why this particular book when Ursula K. Le Guin has written quite a lot

56
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,420
For a long time, I think this book came in 1974 and you may correct me if it is wrong

57
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,940
But I want to remember that they were so that it was first released in English.

58
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,720
So why exactly this book

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52.540
by Ursula's big publication?

60
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,200
Yes, you may think it is a bit strange that the publisher that Federatives publishes a science fiction book.

61
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,296
Federative's publisher otherwise publishes the most books about

62
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07.400
different forms of workers' struggle or organization.

63
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,520
But even more recently quite a lot of fiction within that genre.

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,120
And this is where this fits in as it is a

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,240
perhaps the best of literature, at least as I know, realized

66
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:26,336
vision of a society organized from below

67
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,640
On principles of

68
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,840
Participant democracy and

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,280
grassroots organization.

70
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,624
Where those who worked those who decide on work

71
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,140
with a minimum of centralization.

72
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,880
This is no one has no new translation of the book but it is Gunnar Gällmos translation from year?

73
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,200
1976 maybe. Quite early.

74
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55.860
But have you worked with the text in any way?

75
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,820
Yes we have done that.

76
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,160
It is not a new translation but we have modernized

77
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05.240
the text a little bit in terms of some spelling

78
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08.840
Conventions that have been updated. A little word choice here and there.

79
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,120
Corrected to a few small, very few, but some small misses in the translation

80
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,260
From the original that we succeeded.

81
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,980
The most controversial may be that we have

82
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,120
Chosen to exchange the word fraternity with siblings in the book.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,860
In the English original, Le Guin writes

84
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,480
“Brotherhood” everywhere

85
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,980
But if you look at her discussions about this after

86
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
For example, the epic book "The left hand of darkness"

87
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
so we felt it was justified

88
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,960
to use the word "sibling" instead.

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,200
There is no corresponding word in English.

90
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,080
The book previously came in Swedish twice I think

91
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,460
And then it had another title. Then it was called Shevek and Shevek is a character in the book.

92
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00.300
This book is called "The Obvious".

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,780
Any thoughts about it? I know it was a process to find a suitable title.

94
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,680
The starting title was the best.

95
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,680
As discussion groups are called: "Karatebook".

96
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,160
It is almost an impossible title to translate from English.

97
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,780
"The Dispossessed".

98
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,520
It is not like a comfortable term in Swedish.

99
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,655
"The uninhabited" is as close as you can get to involve all these details at the same time.

100
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,340
"Shevek" was a pretty flat title.

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,600
Because instead of focusing on what is happening,

102
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,940
On the act itself, on everything it becomes that you focus on the main character.

103
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,500
And it remove a large part of the book

104
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,360
Well, be one of the arguments for change.

105
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,680
But what one would be called.

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,100
It was a long and strange discussion. For it started with 'open hand' and therefore 'karatebook'

107
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,700
It was like ...

108
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,160
Exactly, the open hands are a symbol found in many places in the book.

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,180
But the fact is that even Gunnar Gällmo at that time when he translated the title thought about "the uninhabited" as the title.

110
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Finally

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,060
could they not at that time to decide

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,400
If Dispossessed is about being obsessed

113
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,400
or to be the beset.

114
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,920
Since you could not get that ambiguity in the Swedish title, they chose a different path.

115
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,720
While we thought "the uninhabited" is a better title, a suitable title.

116
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,920
The book has been around since the mid-70s so there are perhaps quite a few who read it, however, not all.

117
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,260
So maybe we should just mention what it is for a book really, what it is for action

118
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,800
What the world we are in and characters. Main characters, not all because there are quite a few.

119
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,720
I sat thinking about it yesterday

120
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59.337
How to summarize the book in that way.

121
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,160
It is not possible.

122
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02.760
So we don't!

123
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,120
We can go home now.

124
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,120
One can read it as a symbolic story, it can be a political narrative,

125
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
it can be a clean

126
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Scifi story

127
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
You can disconnect. That is why it worked so well

128
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,860
For me as a child.

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,440
And as good for me as a middle -aged man in that

130
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,540
You can disconnect some pieces and still have a good stock of the book.

131
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,460
But simply. What to say?

132
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37.540
Researcher...

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,100
I don't know what to say. You can take this!

134
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,960
One of the reasons why it is difficult to summarize the book is that it takes place in

135
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,260
Two parallel time tracks.

136
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,340
I don't want to reveal too much about the action here of course

137
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,420
Because they can stand on their own legs, I think.

138
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,220
But it starts with the main character Shevek

139
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,340
A scientist

140
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08.191
make their exit from

141
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,055
This anarchist planet Anarres to go back to the mother planet

142
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
A planet is very similar to spring called ancestry.

143
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,920
In order to be able to conduct his research because he does not have

144
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,020
been able to conduct it in the climate that was on Anarres.

145
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,300
The political and social climate.

146
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,280
And then the book jumps back and forth if you get like an insight into why.

147
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
What is it that is led him to this rather bold decision

148
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39.620
For Shevek is a revolutionary and anarchist in soul and heart.

149
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,700
It is not that he abandons these ideals when he goes to an urban.

150
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,920
But how does he come to this decision then

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,900
As the whole book begins with?

152
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,720
To go to the lecture

153
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,380
that is, in some sense then, according to many of his siblings

154
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00.020
On Anarres, an enemy plane still.

155
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,260
This thread is then switched out

156
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07.327
in two parallel tracks where we partly get to know

157
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12.703
The processes that led up to this decision and also Shevek's upbringing and what shaped him.

158
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,700
And also society.

159
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,620
At the same time with his experiences and the cultural clash that is on ...

160
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,780
With his meetings with

161
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,740
More

162
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27.807
For us acquaintances and hierarchical

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,640
Society.

164
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,200
I remember the stage when he walks on Shoppinggatan.

165
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,800
It is very memorable, how he reacts to this, how he meets from his

166
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,143
comprehension of the world and conviction of the world and

167
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,940
Coming to the learf it is very striking I think.

168
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,420
Did you have anything more?

169
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,480
No, drive on!

170
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,360
So some

171
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54.943
English editions have the title

172
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57.247
"The Dispossessd - an Ambigous Utopia"

173
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,428
And it is sometimes described as a utopia. Utopias always have two ends so to speak

174
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,207
But is sometimes described as a utopia.

175
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
How do you think about this with ambiguous or ambigous?

176
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
I'm going to throw myself in this.

177
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,900
That's the absolute best thing about the book.

178
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,480
That is what, in my opinion, does it

179
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20.031
And make it so devilishly readable.

180
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
Le Guin was an anarchist himself.

181
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,960
Kropotkinist if you are to be very pilly with theists.

182
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
This is like hers

183
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,120
Utopia could be assumed.

184
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,207
But instead of doing, as I think many political

185
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,660
fiction writers would do,

186
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,300
That is, make it perfect.

187
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,143
Make like those who agree with me they are always right in all situations.

188
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
And it will be just as I had imagined.

189
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
So she has

190
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51.519
allowed to do ...

191
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,639
... to beat the whole idea and accept that things can be real cash

192
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Even in this ...

193
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
Her perfect world.

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,300
To let things be bad.

195
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,420
This is what makes absolutely the whole book and why it is ambivalent this utopia.

196
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,700
After all, it becomes like ...

197
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,900
It is not a utopist book, many see it as a utopist book

198
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,380
Because it describes her dream world so to speak.

199
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,471
But at the same time, she refuses to be a utopian writer.

200
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,440
She lets things go to hell. She lets people be people through all this

201
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,240
Instead of making this perfect dream values that would have been complete uninteresting.

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,480
So she sounds everything ...

203
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
In this case the whole book ...

204
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,740
Spinning around that something is really cunning

205
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,160
on Anarres.

206
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,487
And that's what drives Shevek to get away.

207
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,900
And it is not something positive,

208
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,220
It is no utopia, but at the same time has the utopian sound because of it goes together with her ideology.

209
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,500
And that's what is so hugely brilliant and why,

210
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,800
If I get to hit it,

211
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,383
Why I at the age of twenty could come back to the book

212
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,200
And discover that there is an ideological foundation.

213
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,540
But instead of being a bit like Star Trek captains.

214
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09.860
Star Trek captains are always quite independent whether they are wrong or not.

215
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
So instead it will be ...

216
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,780
... that he is wrong, this world is wrong. Everything is wrong.

217
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,480
It is an extremely human utopia. I would call it instead of a

218
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
An ambivalent utopia is a very human utopia.

219
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
Thus no utopia at all without

220
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,431
An alternative maybe-more-positive-not-the-world.

221
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,780
It also makes me not believe that the ideologically tied as

222
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,900
As a reader, you do not have to share her perceptions at all. You may have completely opposite views

223
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,480
And still find something in the text.

224
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,080
She never writes the reader on her nose.

225
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
She never writes down

226
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
someone that way without it is very

227
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01.311
Well, this is how it. You can read it as a science fiction novel instead.

228
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,660
And that's what is hugely brilliant.

229
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,220
There is some disagreement about whether this book is

230
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12.063
feminist or not. Thus one looks at how society organized on

231
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,391
Watched which is the mother planet and on

232
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
Anarres so it is quite

233
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,900
Divorce how gender records. Do you have any thoughts on that?

234
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,400
Because I know there is one ..

235
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28.703
... that not everyone agrees.

236
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
No, that's right.

237
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,960
It is definitely not her most feminist book.

238
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,400
But I definitely think there is one

239
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
feminist foundation in it.

240
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,780
Just in the conflict,

241
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,620
In the ideological conflict between Anarres that is equated between the sexes

242
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,320
and it

243
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,060
Very patriarchal A-II

244
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
that is the land on the leaflet

245
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,800
that Shevek ends up in.

246
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,440
And then

247
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02.495
is there a great deal

248
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,359
Performances also at Anarres, not least at Shevek himself.

249
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09.151
Which is...

250
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
Dealing

251
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
What characteristics which gender possesses.

252
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Maybe you can think a little dusty today.

253
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,951
But at the same time, there is probably a part of this that shows that it is not

254
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,160
Perfect utopia. Not everyone goes around in Toga raised over

255
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,580
over all ideals.

256
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,160
There are flaws everywhere.

257
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,500
So I would squeeze in that as a book it doesn't seem to be ...

258
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,660
Given, that is, it is difficult because Le Guin wrote "Left Hand of Darkness"

259
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,740
One of the most classic feminist scifi works.

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,080
Should one measure it up to it is not about feminism at all

261
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,120
However, Le Guin as a writer

262
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,719
She had her opinions and it shines through her authorship, all her authorship.

263
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,839
So even though the book may not have it as a focus, you can see a lot

264
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,420
details from feminism or wider feminism in the book.

265
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
Things that are in as

266
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:13,919
His and his friendship, he has a male friendship.

267
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,640
There all that ...

268
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,260
What is it called in swedish?

269
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,807
Toxic masculinity What is it in Swedish?

270
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
Toxic masculinity.

271
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,183
That it is removed from the equation.

272
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
It's not there.

273
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:32,095
Such things, such details draw a kind of feminist book but at the same time

274
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,655
It is not about it. Really.

275
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,480
After all, it's ok to read it as so. I mean it is a book so you can read it how you want but.

276
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,620
But I will always be compared to "Left Hand of Darkness".

277
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,680
And that makes it almost impossible

278
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,220
really to call it a feminist book

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,860
If one is to weigh the two against each other.

280
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,360
I think about some level. Very clearly it becomes when he comes to

281
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,340
Watches first and on anarres

282
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01.860
so regardless of gender you work with what you are suitable for

283
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,140
And on Anarres (urban) he comes to this research world where everyone is men.

284
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,640
I even think they say, now I spoil a little here, but they say

285
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,280
That women do not have the ability to deeper thoughts or abstractly thought in that way.

286
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,080
Where the women are wives.

287
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,440
Yes, or mistresses.

288
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,980
Yes exactly but they don't have it ...

289
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
It becomes very clear there anyway.

290
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,060
Absolutely.

291
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Can I just squeeze in there?

292
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,480
So now there is a risk of spoilers too and then you have to cut the iron.

293
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,040
It is too

294
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,900
Some of those who make it so devilish ambivalent and strange.

295
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,140
He is the hero, but he does not behave like a hero.

296
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,540
He does things on another anarres

297
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
like everyone

298
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,920
Le Guin, the reader, thus all normally found readers think what the hell is doing ...

299
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,580
This is wrong!

300
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,300
Now you think of the leaflet certainly but ...

301
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,980
Sorry, sorry, urban.

302
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
The thing is that this is what makes it so brilliant.

303
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,520
He does not really have straight answers in much of the book.

304
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:10,300
He behaves like a puck on occasions and he does really pledged things and quite horrible things.

305
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,960
At that particular time.

306
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,640
And that's what is so amazing.

307
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:20,120
There is no one who is right coming in and says you are wrong

308
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,120
and everyone turns and "you have so the right smart guy"

309
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,520
Now we do as you say. That's a little bit of everything gets to scratch.

310
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,340
And that's what makes the book so incredibly good

311
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,940
That it must hurt, it must be embarrassing, it must be bad.

312
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,460
There is not this one

313
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,080
straight comfortable hero saga that one is used to otherwise common otherwise especially when it comes to

314
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,140
science fiction or all fiction

315
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,920
Where the protagonist or world shares the author's views at large.

316
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,300
She has completely skipped the comfortable story Arcen.

317
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,260
In this edition you have also brought a short story.

318
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,620
Named...

319
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,960
Named "the day before the revolution"

320
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Just.

321
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10.047
Can you tell us a little about it how it relates

322
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,360
The story I haven't been able to read it yet.

323
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,920
So I'm excited!

324
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,180
Step Aside! Okay!

325
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,600
What I thought you from Federative

326
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,280
Made so damn smart.

327
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,700
Was just picking up ...

328
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,820
Not only to keep the basic text, "Shevek" or "the uninhabited" as their own ...

329
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,260
This is the book, now it's clear!

330
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,980
But instead bring in the amazing preface

331
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,040
and

332
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,580
"The day before the revolution"

333
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:50,100
That binds everything together to more than just the basic text. It's easy to just throw

334
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,620
Out a new edition but this gives more meat on the legs.

335
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,140
And "the day before the revolution" was written long after

336
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Long afterwards.

337
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,860
No, it was actually written the same year.

338
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,440
The same year!?

339
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,360
Now talk! No no no no!

340
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,820
It is your turn. I'm not going to talk to you anymore!

341
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,340
What I like is that, what it does is that it gives a different perspective on it.

342
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,980
Instead of a youth story, it is an aging revolutionary.

343
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,540
Who see these

344
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,847
yes but long -haired youth

345
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,380
Lalla around her.

346
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,520
And feel a little disappointed a little happy. It is such a bitter -lying story

347
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,200
Which really moves out the story of these two worlds from Shevek.

348
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,340
Otherwise, it becomes easy to get stuck on a main character.

349
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,880
And picks the story out of him.

350
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,100
And somehow squeezes it.

351
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,560
I always want to say a really good storytelling sandwich. But it feels really foolish.

352
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,700
Good word!

353
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02.060
I really love that short story too.

354
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,160
It is such a fantastic inside portrait

355
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,520
of this one

356
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08.063
aged

357
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,695
the revolutionary. An aging woman

358
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,800
As his entire life has worked for their ideals.

359
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,140
And that is now 80 and she has ailments.

360
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,263
She doesn't really understand the youth anymore but

361
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,360
She is idealized and she doesn't like it.

362
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,660
Yes, it's amazing.

363
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,300
I'm looking forward to it.

364
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,960
It's a pretty moderate edition. It is very nice. There is also a nice explanation for why the book is green.

365
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,920
Looks like it does.

366
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,460
But this is the first Swedish illustrated edition?

367
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,380
Yes.

368
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,220
Ever in the history of the entire universe.

369
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,700
And the first time the short story was published in the same volume in Swedish.

370
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,500
And the first time Karin Tidbeck has written the preface to this one.

371
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08.880
And the first time the cover is green.

372
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,800
It is the first of a lot.

373
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,640
We might be able to talk a little about how you got this assignment

374
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,760
And how you felt about it when you got the question.

375
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
I don't really know how it went. You can tell you a little about it.

376
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,600
So illustrates the book.

377
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,200
Yes. Thanks.

378
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,420
I received an email from Andreas asking about ...

379
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:33,300
The thing was that you feedback with me. Because this was probably a previous discussion from the beginning. Long before.

380
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,360
Because you had been given tips that I might.

381
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,220
I received an email.

382
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,300
And more or less I said I do it for free or free or for anything.

383
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,368
Only I can make in chapters illustrations as well.

384
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
I would just cover from the beginning.

385
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
But.

386
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,352
The thing is that when someone asks "Hi, want to illustrate your absolute favorite book?"

387
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,240
It's like. He could pay me in carrots. I had done that too.

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,140
And I also the world's worst negotiator so I was very like "sure, certain shit in the payment !!"

389
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,580
Now we should say then because we are owned by a trade union.

390
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,200
So I get paid.

391
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,280
No, but Jens said yes I do. But I intend to illustrate it and

392
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,880
If not taking my illustration, I intend to break into the print shop and put them in myself.

393
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,140
Damn how disturbing I sound when you say so.

394
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,320
We are very happy that you wanted to illustrate it, Jens.

395
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,160
Thanks!

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,240
There's alot

397
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,100
both cover and illustrations in science fiction back in history where one has often focused on

398
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,000
A little more classic science fiction element.

399
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
It is common with spaceships. Now there is not so much spaceship in this.

400
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,160
It's not so much radiation guns and so on.

401
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,780
Unfortunately!

402
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:06.060
But as you approach this assignment. For your illustrations have other focus.

403
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07.820
It is interesting to know how you thought about it.

404
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,980
Okay. Firstly it was because I

405
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,160
As an adult when I read.

406
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
Read now.

407
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
So I don't see it as a scifi story.

408
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,856
As a child, I saw it as mainly a scifi story. A fantastic story.

409
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,392
But as an adult I see it ...

410
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,280
... totally decoupled from the fact that it would be science fiction. It is somehow disconnected.

411
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30.304
And

412
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,632
The greatness of the book for me is not in ...

413
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,728
There is not much laser and space battles in the book Direkt.

414
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,280
There are no even.

415
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Even zero.

416
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,520
So that I thought the illustrations would somehow be moved out

417
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,220
out of it and would be about mood instead of

418
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,552
Like has a descriptive picture of what kind of laserpick they had.

419
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,120
Getting back to it all the time.

420
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920
And then so it was ...

421
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,780
I mean regardless of how happy I sounded at that email. Yes I was on and of course

422
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,320
shit me down with fear.

423
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,540
Once again, that's my favorite book.

424
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,540
I can really ruin this illustration. This will be really ugly.

425
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,120
And it was back and forth and there were different forms of illustration.

426
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,460
And it was crying and toothache from my side.

427
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,560
Until I landed in

428
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,840
The illustration form that was to somehow return to how I was as a teenager when I was drawing.

429
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,540
That is, paper and pen.

430
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,440
Cheap tin pen and just sit and draw

431
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,580
by a table.

432
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,460
And that is what somehow

433
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,840
Get back to also in terms of mood.

434
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,240
To let it be a little scary. Leave it a little, like,

435
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,300
You should see that here it went to hell. It should be such stuff.

436
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,500
But also to focus on the mood more than

437
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,200
The amazing thing.

438
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,832
Now I am on and you have to cancel because I can talk about this until we go home.

439
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,856
But

440
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,184
Then so is the book's

441
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Cyclic form

442
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06.560
And like how time jumps back and forth. And how

443
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,912
A large part of the theme in the book is a recovery.

444
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,400
A quote that comes back in the book.

445
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,800
And

446
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,848
I somehow wanted to weave together

447
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,432
Each chapter as if you look at the pictures, you see that

448
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,248
I try to connect the chapters that should be ...

449
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,832
Depending on the form and what it is in the picture.

450
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
So the shape of something

451
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,700
can return the next chapter on the two chapters connected.

452
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,080
And just as I have tried to balance everything.

453
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,960
So there was so much anxiety thinking and over -thinking

454
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,900
As I don't think anyone will see.

455
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,080
Now arrears ...

456
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,020
Nice that you can say this then. So we so!

457
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47.560
Yes. Great!

458
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,420
But there was deep anxiety and a lot of notes.

459
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,000
I filled a notepad with that.

460
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,140
To conclude.

461
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,432
I think of some ...

462
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,296
If you get to choose two favorite illustrations as well as say a little more about.

463
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00.576
What is it?

464
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,780
It is sickly difficult for a large of the illustration job is just about

465
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,980
Be able to weave the whole book together with different illustrations.

466
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,960
My absolute favorite It is associated with the favorite chapter and it is the middle chapter.

467
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,720
Where the two chairs will represent these two worlds that meet

468
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,180
and Shevek's complete customerness.

469
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,800
Once again we should not spoil too much.

470
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
The second is the image to "the day before the revolution",

471
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,360
Which was also hugely difficult.

472
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,600
It was brand new.

473
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,820
I hadn't read it until just before.

474
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,100
The feeling of it on what made me quit.

475
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,800
Usually I am very fond of covering the paper

476
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,020
with ink if possible.

477
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,880
But in this case: "Well, it must be so."

478
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,180
It should be empty and a little lonely and sad.

479
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,680
The two are probably my absolutely clear favorites.

480
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,260
And also those who seem to have been home best with a lot of people.

481
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,400
Fine.

482
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,560
Thanks.

483
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,500
Thank you so much for this call and

484
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,460
because you told you more about the amazingly fine edition

485
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,120
By Ursula K Le Guin's "The Dispossed".

486
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,220
Thanks.

487
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,140
Thanks so much.

488
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,640
It was sick to be here.

489
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,380
Thank you.

490
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,420
Bye!
