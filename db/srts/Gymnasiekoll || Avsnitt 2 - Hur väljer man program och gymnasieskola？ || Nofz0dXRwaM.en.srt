1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,360
Back!

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03.560
Now we keep track of how the high school choice goes to

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,400
But how should I know which program

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
that is best for me?

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,200
Should i take it my friends take

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,280
Or should I go based on my own interests?

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,800
I have invited a person

8
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,160
Who will give us knowledge about this.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
What's your name?

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,280
My name is Jessica

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,120
And I work as a study and career counselor.

12
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,680
There are 18 different national high school programs,

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,400
Is there any big difference between them?

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,680
The biggest difference is between

15
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,000
the college preparatory programs

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And vocational programs.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,440
On a college preparation program

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,480
Is the idea that after high school you will study further.

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,320
The vocational programs prepare you for the labor market

20
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,440
So that you start working after high school.

21
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,960
What is it required to be adopted

22
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,760
to a national high school program?

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,800
A foundation of a portion of the requirements is in any case

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,920
Grades in Swedish, math and English.

25
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,000
You can read more about which permissions

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,360
As needed for each program here in the articles

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,880
at high school.se.

28
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,400
Good there, high school!

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00.840
What program do you go?

30
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,120
I go to the IT program.

31
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,120
Why did you just choose that program?

32
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08.880
I've always had a great interest in games and such.

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,560
That's probably why I chose the IT program.

34
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,600
Once I got into it it was wow!

35
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,000
Since then, interest has only grown and plant.

36
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,600
What program do you go?

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,520
I go the aesthetic program with a focus on interior design.

38
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,400
Why did you just choose that program?

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,680
I wanted three fun years ahead of me

40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,360
and I wanted to do something practical

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,120
Because I liked the picture when I attended elementary school.

42
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,160
Can you only attend high school programs in Swedish?

43
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,800
No, there is also an alternative called IB.

44
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,640
Where you read college preparation programs

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,680
With all courses except the Swedish lessons in English.

46
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,880
Because there are so many different programs,

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,160
What to think about when making your choice?

48
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,240
The most important thing to think about

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,880
is what you are motivated by and are interested in.

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00.960
And what you think is fun!

51
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03.640
If you are reading something that you are

52
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05.320
interested and motivated by

53
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07.960
So it often generates good results.

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,000
That you get better results in the courses you read

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
gives you the opportunity to reach higher ratings.

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,160
Then it is also important to think about

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,480
If you already know a profession that you want to work with.

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
Gives this program the permission

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,560
Or eligibility for further studies to that profession?

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,280
Thank you so much for all the info,

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,080
Now I feel that I have a great look!

62
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,600
We have barely had coffee.

63
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,560
What fun I could be helpful!

64
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Why did you just choose your program?

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
I personally was pretty sure of my choice,

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,840
I have long wanted to work with something in finance or law.

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,720
So for me the choice was pretty obvious!

68
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
You see,

69
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,440
Choose what you want!

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,000
Another step closer to high school!
