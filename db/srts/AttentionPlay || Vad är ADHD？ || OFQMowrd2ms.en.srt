1
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,156
How common is ADHD?

2
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:10,133
You really are not alone in having ADHD.

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,863
There is at least one child in each class.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,475
There are people with ADHD of all ages.

5
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:20,318
ADHD is available in all countries.

6
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:26,368
What is ADHD on?

7
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:29,618
It's something you are born with.

8
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:32,519
It is hereditary.
 It means

9
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:33,836
that it is common for several

10
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:35,860
people in the same family

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,000
Has the same diagnosis.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,500
ADHD has to do with how the brain works.

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,483
How is it noticed that you have ADHD?

14
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:46,308
There are mainly three areas

15
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:48,558
which is affected when you have ADHD.

16
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:51,975
It is concentration, impulsivity

17
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:53,857
and activity regulation.

18
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,050
Concentration.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,700
How the concentration is affected

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,574
can look different from a human

21
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:01,961
to another.

22
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:04,791
For Simon it may be like this:

23
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:08,485
- I am easily disturbed by different sounds

24
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,682
And hear everything that sounds in the room.

25
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,705
It can be a clock ticking,

26
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,518
a fan as whistling,

27
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,156
Or pens that scratch.

28
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:17,733
Some types of light

29
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:20,183
Can also disturb me very much.

30
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:22,756
When something feels boring or hard

31
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:26,136
I easily disappear in completely different thoughts.

32
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:28,583
When it is not clear what to do

33
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,315
I often become completely paralyzed

34
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:32,021
And do nothing.

35
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:34,011
When one has ADHD it is

36
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,691
Usually it goes great

37
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:36,941
to focus when something

38
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:38,851
Is fun and interesting.

39
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:40,681
It is very difficult to concentrate

40
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,141
when something feels hard or boring.

41
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:45,431
When someone holds long reviews

42
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:47,707
is it incredibly easy to disappear completely,

43
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,107
And daydreaming instead.

44
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:51,267
Sometimes it can be difficult for others

45
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,107
to understand that it can be easy to do such

46
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,208
which is fun.

47
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,938
But super difficult to do such

48
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:57,175
which is sad.

49
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:58,585
Impulsivity.

50
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,471
When you have ADHD it is common to man

51
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:04,144
have difficulty controlling their impulses.

52
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:05,581
This means that one is fast

53
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:06,941
and reacts quickly.

54
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:09,472
And often do not stop and think about it.

55
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,824
It is clearly noticed for Ella

56
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:12,264
when it comes to emotion.

57
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:15,492
- I feel different emotions very strongly.

58
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:17,915
And I can turn between the emotions

59
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:19,162
very fast.

60
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:21,152
It can certainly be difficult for others

61
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:23,302
to keep up with sometimes.

62
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:26,341
Sometimes I can react more powerful than others.

63
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,851
I can quickly get angry

64
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:31,021
For things friends say.

65
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:33,541
One day I can feel

66
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,580
Great in someone.

67
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,640
The next day I feel nothing.

68
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,410
Sometimes I can be very angry.

69
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,800
Then I usually say things

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,420
which I regret afterwards.

71
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,267
When I hear about an injustice

72
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,847
Can I be super joint.

73
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:51,807
Often much more sad than my friends.

74
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,467
It is also common to man

75
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,767
have a hard time waiting for their turn

76
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:55,977
When you have ADHD.

77
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,511
It can be so difficult to queue.

78
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:00,975
It's easy to give up

79
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,095
And leaves.

80
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,450
Or that one stoop to it

81
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,220
To stand out with waiting.

82
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,200
To raise your hand in school

83
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,985
could be a major challenge.

84
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:12,815
It's easy to say things straight out.

85
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:15,416
It is also easy to accidentally interrupt

86
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:18,276
Someone talking.
 Or that one fills in

87
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:20,146
what the other is going to say because one

88
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:24,236
Unable to wait.
 People with ADHD

89
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:26,286
Often get a lot of good ideas.

90
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,076
Starts new projects but

91
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:30,836
can't always be able to complete them.

92
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,896
It can be difficult to plan in the long term.

93
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,874
For some, the money runs out at once.

94
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:39,234
And it's hard to save.

95
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:41,744
Activity control.

96
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,984
Activity control means that one has

97
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:46,694
difficult to influence their level of activity.

98
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:49,196
You rarely have a lot of energy.

99
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,426
Either you have way too much,

100
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:52,686
Or too little.

101
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:55,326
Some things take a lot of energy from one.

102
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:57,296
Although it is fun.

103
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:59,696
For Sam it feels like this:

104
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,156
- Outdoor day at school

105
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,616
is a great example.

106
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:04,816
On the way there I look forward to the day

107
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,146
and charging for all activities

108
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,196
I want to be part of.

109
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:10,466
When half the day has passed it feels like all

110
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,306
Energy just disappears.

111
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:13,596
It's like I crash and

112
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,166
Not able to be involved in anything.

113
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,186
I can hardly get home.

114
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:18,726
It's so typically

115
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,016
that the energy is not there

116
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,156
When I need it.
 In the evening, however

117
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:24,776
I usually have a lot of energy.

118
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:25,666
When I will fall asleep

119
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,146
So the thoughts spin in the head

120
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:30,156
And it feels like a dryer.

121
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,466
In the morning,

122
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:34,126
When I will wake up and get started

123
00:04:34,126 --> 00:04:35,826
So it often doesn't work at all.

124
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:37,716
I have no energy and press

125
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:39,826
All the time on the snooze button.

126
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,046
It can be incredibly hard

127
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:43,056
To sit still when you have ADHD.

128
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:44,316
It feels like one constantly

129
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,266
Has ants in Brallan.

130
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,096
It may feel hard to keep up

131
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:50,736
The energy for a whole day.
 It is common to man

132
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:52,656
Finds some different strategies

133
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:53,936
To spike.

134
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:56,416
One usually split up the diagnosis of ADHD

135
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,336
in three subgroups.

136
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:01,876
A, there are those who have ADHD

137
00:05:01,876 --> 00:05:04,456
mainly inattentive form.

138
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:06,896
Add.

139
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:10,096
B, there are those who have adhd

140
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,916
mainly hyperactive,

141
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,406
impulsive form.
 And then there are them

142
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:18,706
Which has it combined, A + B.

143
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:20,466
Now you have been told many examples

144
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:22,802
on what it might be like to have ADHD.

145
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:23,949
It is important to consider

146
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,786
That all people are unique.

147
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:27,566
Also those with ADHD.

148
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,366
The challenges that appear in conjunction

149
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:31,976
with adhd can see very

150
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:34,966
different out between different people.

151
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:37,166
What is a huge challenge for someone,

152
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,116
Maybe not at all difficult for someone else.

153
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,496
Your brain works differently

154
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:44,146
because of your ADHD.
 It does not mean

155
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,816
that there is something wrong with your brain or

156
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:47,366
That you are less intelligent.

157
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,906
In this movie we have had a lot of focus

158
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:52,856
What difficulties you with ADHD can have.

159
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:55,046
Important to remember is that you,

160
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,276
just like everyone else,

161
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,446
Also has a lot of strengths.

162
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:00,816
It is good for society that we are different.

163
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:03,236
That we think in different ways.
