00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04.096
My name is Angelica and I come from Stockholm from the beginning.

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,376
And I then plug in a civil engineer in computer technology.

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,496
In the spring in one we did a project in Java.

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:14,120
We made a chess. It was after the course I felt - wow!

5
00:00:14,232 --> 00:00:17,152
Now I have actually learned. We have done this from scratch.

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,992
No one has helped. It is completely our own solution.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,320
That's when I felt, yes this feels right.

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,160
What I think is good about Liu is the community.

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:32,256
Right now I'm in something called Donna,

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34.048
D-Section Women's Association,

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,912
which promotes community for women and non-binary, precisely at the D-section.

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:45,388
The day before you start, Donna arranges a coffee

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,128
For all new girls and non-binary who start here.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
That's what I think is so good with student life. Everyone is

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,552
Open in the beginning, for everyone wants friends. Everyone has moved

16
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59.904
from home from their families. And want to get their new family in LinkÃ¶ping.

17
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,000
If you are unsure, dare to take the step to search.
