1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Should you choose high school?
 Shit how much you have to keep track of program, merit value and lots of dates.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,500
But you can be calm, I Aliyah, in 9 short sections will find out everything you need to know.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we start from scratch, how does a high school choice go?

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
What's your name?
 - My name is Melinda and I work as a study and career counselor.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,500
What does a study and career counselor do?
 - We help with everything related to study and work.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Both if you already know what you want, but you also have no idea what you want to do.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,000
When should you make your application to high school?

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When it comes to making their high school application, the admission opens in January.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Then the date, what you need to relate to and how the application itself goes to look different.

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Therefore, it is important to check with the study and career counselor at their elementary school and the upper secondary school for your particular municipality what applies.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Are there different school forms you can choose from?

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,000
You can choose between a municipal school, a free school or a school with national recruiting intake.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,000
What does the last thing you said mean?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
National recruiting intake, which means that you can apply for this school no matter where in the country you live.

15
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:33,000
If you are looking for a municipal school outside your home municipality, it is important that you check that you have the right to be first adopted, or if you will be adopted as a reserve regardless of your credit value.

16
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:41,000
If you apply for a free school or a school with a national recruiting intake, you have the right to be first adopted regardless of which municipality you live in.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
What was the hardest thing about the high school choice?

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
Which line I would go, what school.
 Everything was very difficult, everything was pure chaos for me!

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,500
I thought it was very busy that I would quit the school I went to, because I have attended that elementary school all my life.

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,000
But then I got tips from friends.

21
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,000
What was the hardest thing when choosing high school?

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I would say above all it was probably the choice of schools, because there are many options to choose from.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You have to weigh in things like the route and above all what lines there are, you still want to try to have someone you know at school since before.

24
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,000
What can be important to consider when making your application?

25
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:29,000
The most important thing is to think about which program and focus you are most interested in.
 And how you want to prioritize these choices in their application.

26
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:39,000
Then it is also important to have several alternatives in your application because there can be great competition for the places on a program, so you are not standing without a high school place.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Some programs also include reading a modern language.
 Then it is important to consider whether you want to continue with the language you read in elementary school or if you want to read a new language.

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,500
This can have different impacts on your credit value if you search for high school.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There are aesthetic programs and sports education that have slightly different admission tests.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
These can look very different, so it is important to check what applies to the particular school you are interested in.

31
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,000
If you want to apply for a gymnasium, what to think about then?

32
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,500
There are 3 different options, they are called RIG, NIU and Liu.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,500
When it comes to RIG and NIU, you need to make two different applications at different times.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You make an application for the sport itself and an application for the national high school program.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,500
So to get a place you need to be accepted both on the sport and the program.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,500
How can an application for the sport go to?

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
It may look very different depending on which school and sport.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Therefore, it is important to check what applies to the particular school you are interested in but also check with the sports association.

39
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you so much for wanting to be involved in answering all the questions!

40
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Thank you for being involved, it has been great to talk to you.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,500
The most difficult thing was probably if I had chosen the right direction, I think, I was not entirely sure whether I would be happy or not.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But hairdresser is really a really open program with lots of social people.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
One step closer to high school, nice!
