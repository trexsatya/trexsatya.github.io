8
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.280
Tell us about an event that was the 14th eh of September this year and I was thinking

9
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.680
really that I will ask pretty much open question to you there

10
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.719
I ask you first try thought back even if it is hard attempt intended

11
00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.760
back what was it what happened this evening

12
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.040
My husband and I were home came from work and

13
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.840
eh the clock just around what i eh would lay me

14
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.240
eh so go into like the room and realized that our daughter who lives at home with us

15
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.680
What would at the theater after work with with a friend

16
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.159
And then text messed her up and asked how she would come home she should have a taxi home

17
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.759
or should she go commuter trains then she replies that she takes

18
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.399
the commuter train that runs 2224 from town

19
00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.360
Eh I go back to the living room Emir sits in the living room watching

20
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.520
on the TV I go to him and say Ida will take the train so you can go

21
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.399
and pick her up at the commuter train station and then he asks okay what exact time

22
00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.400
comes the train so I know the commuter station is not so far

23
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.920
from our house but we we don't want her to go so late herself

24
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.400
eh and so i said yes but i go back and check in at SL what time will

25
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.959
The train to Djurbro I go back to the bedroom

26
00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.959
And then I see the lamp the role curtain is reduced

27
00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:43.959
eh from the bedroom so I see that the lamp lights out and then I hear something

28
00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.920
eh some sounds so I looked a little behind

29
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.239
curtain and saw two two figures two children I experienced they

30
00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:07.040
which had to go on it actually reminded me of when we have children as as

31
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.319
rings on the door when there is bus or candy they mumbled something and they were

32
00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.920
A little high Judah so I thought yes v what is this

33
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.959
For something they had hoods I saw they from behind it was something strange who is

34
00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.760
that is coming now so late thought of the daughter but no it can't

35
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.200
tune so i hold in my

36
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.680
phone and start walking from the bedroom and then I just hear that she

37
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.760
starting to knock so it was, after all, it was not

38
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.480
ordinary without i think they knocked with with

39
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.519
pistols i just squat in between at the frame between the bedroom and

40
00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.560
the front door and so thought no it is something that is not right there

41
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.319
The hoods I thought they scared me the most and then I hear my husband Emir say

42
00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.519
from the living room who is it he is used to we open but I thought it is

43
00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.120
no one who comes home to us after nine without calling then and so

44
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.479
Does he come from the living room and I told him only we must not open

45
00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.800
that is something sumt I thought and fortunately he did not open up because he

46
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.360
usually open and why should we not be able to open so we have lived in

47
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.360
the house for 23 years and in the same weave they start shooting

48
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.240
The door bursts and so we panic both I

49
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.960
goes against living room toward the bedroom he starts to pull me toward

50
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.639
The toilet yes

51
00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.199
Mm then we call or he says to

52
00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.479
me call the police i hold in and he serer that i hold the phone i

53
00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.479
can't the number i start calling beat 114 14 he says

54
00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:21.800
112 and then we are in the toilet then the police responded or they answered and so

55
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
I say they shoot

56
00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.319
then

57
00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.639
m

58
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.680
Yes what we have listened to your conversation with the police

59
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.880
where you

60
00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.960
Eh I think like this eh you described that you were in

61
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.319
the bedroom and you saw that the light was lit eh so I understand you right where

62
00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:56.560
somewhere the light comes on it is when you come in eh at the gate so is

63
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.800
it a lamp above and it feels yes then I understand and when you look out

64
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:11.360
And you say you see two children outside where do they stand when they stand by they pull

65
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.120
Just that was it maybe I forgot to mention that I heard that we have a

66
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.199
a glazed entrance and it is like all spirits and then I hear how they open etc.

67
00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.919
But fortunately it was open as the daughter has not come home we

68
00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.840
usually close it in the evening but it was open for her to come

69
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.520
had it been closed then they would not be able to open it because there is no one

70
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.440
handle and there are many who do not know that you should only pull the glass then

71
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.639
would probably start shooting and i lie in bed bed is hit mm

72
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.400
the bed mattress is damaged, so it is completely silk so it was clean

73
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.880
Lucky there that it was open m plus that

74
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.199
We were that we had unimaginable so it was after all

75
00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:02.000
It was fortunate that we moved on my husband and I all the time had we been

76
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.960
In the bedroom then we would be shot so

77
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:15.280
that yeah i don't know we had real angel yes with us and i think like this

78
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.319
Then now you have described that the ones they had pulled away so they came in through this

79
00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:27.319
the glass door when they knock on or I will ask later when you see them they stand

80
00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:32.680
at your front door then or where do they stand somewhere eh they stand they stand

81
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.360
by when I heard or when I saw mm that when I felt that the lamp

82
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:45.479
light up when I looked then they were just off the window of the bedroom but it is

83
00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:52.960
entrance to this entrance or to the entrance to the house so they first saw

84
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.599
the ones there while I panic or I go against I was going to go to against

85
00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:06.000
against Emir living room etc. and then I heard that they came in mm into this entrance

86
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.360
The entrance changes the door yes and then they are inside and should I knock on the door etc. so

87
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.720
it is the door they knock on they knock on the door not on everything a door no and

88
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.000
you said you you perceived they knocked hard and you thought it might be

89
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.840
the guns they knocked out with it must be something it was not ordinary no ordinary

90
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:32.839
So sounds you also mentioned you said you perceive that they let them talk a little

91
00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:37.479
neighbor if I understood it right and so that as they mumbled

92
00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:43.000
something or it was something that they could not decide which out of the

93
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.560
should shoot i got feeling or something like they mm a little put on

94
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.120
each other and so there I also saw when standing at Eh Alander

95
00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.519
mm you can you can hear reach something what they say

96
00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:03.040
No

97
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.839
no when they knock on they shout something or say they

98
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.800
Something then

99
00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:19.040
ehm no no i remember don't you know i no i don't remember i don't remember if i

100
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.560
Thought I went into the bedroom completely and no it was so I was

101
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.160
was in shock state so I I I heard nothing to no

102
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.600
And then I have understood you right as you may confirm if I have taken

103
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.399
right that you were in the bedroom first but you go out of the bedroom out towards the hall

104
00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:48.399
and emir he was in the living room and also comes out towards the hall M exactly when

105
00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:54.560
They will start when the first shots come what or first shot comes

106
00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.079
can you try to describe what you and emir as carefully as you can

107
00:10:00.079 --> 00:10:08.120
from home I am I am at the frame yes there and Emir stands for that

108
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.519
The toilet door is just behind and he stands there

109
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.800
and yes you can say that it is a few meters apart you and yes we but that

110
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.640
maybe a meter a meter or one and one two meters max so not even so no that

111
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:30.320
must be one meter apart he came just yes and so they start

112
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:36.560
shoot mm and when when they start shooting comes

113
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.880
You remember how do you react when eh runs you put it down what do you

114
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.440
I was on my way then I know I was on my way to the bedroom because it is after all

115
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.120
the same it can say it is only the door that is away there eh I

116
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:59.399
know that I thought I will inhibit myself under the bed or and so in the same

117
00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:05.680
With that, Emil pulls me mm against and so we say to the toilet he says

118
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.880
Mm mm i

119
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:19.519
understands and he lives you scream he he said after all

120
00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:25.639
Yeah what are you doing and yeah so there idiots or i know i don't remember

121
00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:30.079
exactly but I know he yes said something to them

122
00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:36.519
mm I understand and you have already described a little neighbor you said you

123
00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:43.880
Perceive it as there were two children and they had the main assigned etc. do you have if

124
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.720
you try to think there is something more you can describe them in appearance

125
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.880
Long -term clothing in terms of something they were, after all, they were not long

126
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.399
When when I serve they were short then I think of our son who is 193 mm

127
00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:09.040
long and then I think yes they are short they were not so long no mm and what about

128
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.000
you try to put words into what it is that makes you perceive that they are children v

129
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.360
What is it that makes you think so length and figure thus and that

130
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.560
they put on each other for themselves

131
00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:30.440
eh body language maybe or yes if I understood it correctly you saw them from behind

132
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:37.240
When you saw them etc. just m then have you been to it but you

133
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.320
described a little so you were shocked but if you try to describe a little more v what

134
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.440
did you feel when this when the shots

135
00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:56.720
came yes I thought it was it was run

136
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:06.600
for us that now they will kill us so it was mm because yes no that

137
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.120
be no but it is reminiscent we come from the war ourselves we so

138
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.959
is a traumatic experience that you have experienced now etc. that you have needed

139
00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:25.880
experienced now again etc. so it is, after all, it is terrible it is not possible to describe

140
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.440
cannot find words and describe how I feel it jabar, so that one should

141
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:38.160
have to escape again or thus is what I have lived in Sweden for 32 years and came

142
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:45.199
hit to be able to live normally now we feel that life has

143
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:52.199
stopped and why so what is it so worth no that you need to

144
00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:57.000
experience this and it is

145
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.040
Terrible

146
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.920
Have you been able to live in the house anything after no indeed

147
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:18.360

148
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.360
there is no screen anymore in the house we who have invested so much on it and so

149
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.880
fought throughout life you can say

150
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.040

151
00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:43.240

163
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.240
So there is a room upstairs too

164
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:56.399
where there had been a ball through the roof cup approximately mm is the daughter's room

165
00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:59.680
then the daughter's room okay yes I just understand

166
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:07.880
mm and then so you've heard me say that there has been some worry around Alin

167
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.279
Before that you feel it is true or

168
00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:21.079
Eh yes it was m that was according to eh yes according to police so it was a little

169
00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:27.240
just exactly and Alin wasn't home for the last three years so he was after all

170
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:33.519
Eh yes he was not at home no and i have understood that he vase abroad eh no

171
00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:37.920
From May he is abroad from May he is abroad yes but think so so

172
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:43.519
Was he placed eh according to social services and absolutely I thought from May so is

173
00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:47.720
he abroad and you just thought was a good solution for exactly

174
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.880
just support him if you say so yes exactly

175
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:57.160
mm you I stay there thanks so much yes thank you for thanks so much gabriela

176
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.680
Malmborg would you like to ask questions yes thank you eh I was going to start by

177
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.319
Ask you later on what I said earlier today was something of what I said

178
00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:13.720
that was incorrect in any way or so or was it correct it was correct mm and how

179
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.720
Does it feel to you now to be here

180
00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:22.319
today yes it feels terrible to have to be

181
00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:31.120
Here at all a right up and running, and it feels special h sow

182
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.880
reasons so that no it does not feel yes

183
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.720
mm and I thought I'd ask you some questions about the time now

184
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:47.240
After this shooting in your home you can tell us a little about it and I told

185
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.080
It is also that you had contact with Bob's Police Personal Protection you can tell a little

186
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.640
about that contact too but we still have that we have had

187
00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.720
Contact D It took time before they heard but

188
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:11.400
eh we those according to them so we should not live at home so we fi but we got no help

189
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.640
So the ones we did not get they have not said you can live here or there but yes we

190
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.720
Don't think you should live at home We think you should go from

191
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.120
Sweden so they could not guarantee anyone

192
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.320
security for us no for you you have mentioned to me that there was a short -term and

193
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.200
A long -term plan can you tell us a little about what they asked if we had

194
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.480
thoughts to move abroad entirely permanent eh yes long -term plan

195
00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.600
In short, we have the opportunity to go now and that we had

196
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:56.200
And we did then we went abroad etc. and you did pretty much

197
00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.480
fast and eh additional occasions we have g in a receipt or a basis

198
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.480
for a trip but there have been other trips also precance just we went first

199
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.320
we went September 21 eh and then we went

200
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.840
in October

201
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.960
Again, so that was the terrible situation that, then, that

202
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:30.159
man after the shooting the police tell us that we should we should not remain in

203
00:19:30.159 --> 00:19:36.200
The house then we went to our friends was where we haven't even slept in the morning so

204
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:41.400
All of us three are going to work so you are just shocked and we can't

205
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:47.960
accept that we cannot live normally and according to the police they said

206
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.960
Yes eventually so maybe that day they told us too yes but it is a house you

207
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.120
Can maybe come back since the day after so they say no no no you will

208
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.440
Absolutely not stay at home and no we didn't dare

209
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.240
at all prime.se

210
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:09.000
Yes and eh i understand that it was very dumb but right there in

211
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.720
beginning how was the job there you went to work or how did it see

212
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.200
Out yes I went to work but I

213
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.080
Eh I took vacation as well as I had I could take sick leave

214
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.679
me so I was not I could not concentrate or anything so I

215
00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:32.200
Thought I had six weeks of vacation savings as I got sick after all

216
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.600
Last year and

217
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:40.200
operated and then I thought then I take vacation instead I took some

218
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.240
holiday days too but at work so it is

219
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:52.159
the rather demanding work as eh store manager and staff too as s i

220
00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:55.880
should take care of so it was not the easiest

221
00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:04.440
But I fought and m I don't know but and how will it

222
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:11.200
themselves that you took out vacation and did not take out sick leave for those days what

223
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:17.679
was the reason for it yes it is because I thought then

224
00:21:17.679 --> 00:21:21.520
May i get more paid if i take sick if i sick leave i dont get alike

225
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.080
much paid as I had my saved days

226
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:30.520
So I took out holiday days

227
00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:37.880
mm just that and if we go into more on your feeling then you have you have gone through

228
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.600
a little now all the time when you have talked and so but can you describe more how exactly it

229
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.240
Here the event has influenced your

230
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:56.240
everyday it affected in the way that I don't live my life

231
00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:04.080
longer that you feel insecure cannot sleep concentrate

232
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.720
me i'm still sick after my illness so it has only gotten worse now

233
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.200
does it feel

234
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:24.720
who know me terribly all so small

235
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.520
destroyed

236
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:44.400
As I said it is difficult to describe how one feels

237
00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:53.400
So feel that I no that I am not the same person as me

238
00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:04.840
Be yes I don't know etc. We can't spend time with our daughters in the same way they

239
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:11.440
cannot we cannot be in our house we cannot spend time with our friends and

240
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:19.480
relatives thus it is not the same life you have as one had really

241
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:30.600
not mm and i showed a medical certificate that you have received a sick leave certain

242
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.960
time and then it was under medical treatment so it stands soothing and then

243
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.320
Did you get a referral to a psychologist yes exactly I got to write a written

244
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:45.480
sedatives and and it mir and i got sleep agents too you also got sleep

245
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.440
Medicine etc. was something that you chose to take or what did it look like

246
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:57.400
with sedative medicine and as a means there was something yes you so it is

247
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:03.279
quite often i need both we both need to take and now you say in the presen so it is

248
00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:07.799
still so you need to take yes just can still not sleep and no

249
00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:13.080
So I yes it is a trauma thus that can not describe as Emil said after all

250
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.480
When you were in the war then you knew which side to be careful and

251
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:25.360
scared against but here you don't know that you don't really know so it is

252
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:33.039
After all, it is fear all the time so I am afraid of my daughters too and

253
00:24:33.039 --> 00:24:37.880
So it's awful

254
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:46.919
Mm and then you met psychologist on three occasions exactly and it what touched

255
00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:49.080
the

256
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:55.159
Contact sorry what did you say about eh the contact i guess it touched

257
00:24:55.159 --> 00:24:59.520
This situation yes exactly and how to process maybe or yes

258
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.120
exactly eh you serve the only only way is to

259
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:11.000
You have to process it and then he gave me some tips and so on and but but

260
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.200
But it will be difficult it will be difficult to process indeed

261
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:22.640
So it felt like one day maybe being good but the next three days are

262
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.840
The horrible and

263
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:32.520
yes mm eh and then I know then that it is

264
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.760
You who really had contact with people who, although it became now then that

265
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.000
It ended up on EH EMIR's individual claim so it is you who had the contacts

266
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.880
simply ehm and eh there were things that were destroyed so might be able to start with

267
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.520
And and tell us what what did you look like at home and you after this event

268
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.200
Yes it was yes it was terrible it was holes everywhere

269
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:07.600
and yes so there was glass in the hall outside also all thander it was

270
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:14.000
the glass there and no it was awful to be in there and come we

271
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.520
came eh after three days four days and would pick up medicine emir's medicine and

272
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.640
some things and so we went in with the police and no but it was

273
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:32.799
horrible really mm and i have also written in my individual claim or

274
00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:36.320
Our individual claims there that there were several things that broke, among other things

275
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:47.320
refrigerator and just doors and windows and alternative door outer door windows

276
00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.480
eh bat mattress

277
00:26:51.640 --> 00:27:01.080
The duvet cover pillowed even yes and the OP floor also h stm and and and

278
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.120
I said the thing about scaffolding illegal then that they did not want to

279
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.919
Ehm yes but come home to you to do this inspection and before that

280
00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:18.279
They would have to grant you some compensation and then and then I got there too

281
00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:23.039
a question about the difference where I too thought you can explain a little so

282
00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:27.760
That it will not be wrong exactly what that contact looked exactly eh Folksam says

283
00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.720
that eh in view of the circumstances so

284
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:39.799
Can't we send an entrepreneur to you and eh do inspection nose okay then

285
00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:43.159
asked it have you changed the condition or no that is

286
00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:51.360
The yes it is advice we have received and so there MHM okay then you can hire your own company

287
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:57.720
or something any company and we did and what the company has done

288
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:04.000
as a diet suggestions when it thought Folksam or officer at Folksam to

289
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.799
Eh, for example, establishment and that is to move on furniture

290
00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:16.320
EH is a cost and that they also paid for extra security because it is

291
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:22.679
not many companies that wanted to come eh and inspect and take the job on and that

292
00:28:22.679 --> 00:28:26.399
is what cost as Folksam did not think they need to be responsible for the cost

293
00:28:26.399 --> 00:28:32.000
and that's what the difference etc. and you also said that establishment was

294
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.200
to move on furniture eh and do you just want to clarify why you couldn't do it

295
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.679
ourselves then because we dared not be in the house etc. and we according to the police we shall

296
00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:50.480
not be in the house at all mm just that and

297
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.480
eh since I have also understood it as it is you who really had it

298
00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:00.279
the main contact with Bobs even what has touched Emir so have you still had it

299
00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:08.760
Contact eh and what did they say anything about to you then about eh emir's company

300
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.919
as he had his car company what did they say about it just eh he asked me can't

301
00:29:14.919 --> 00:29:20.559
your husband lock in eh while he works and you can

302
00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:24.880
not work with customers and lock in there are no customers coming and yes

303
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.159
to one a closed workshop so so to

304
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:41.399
end he had to put down his workshop after 21 21 years for it went

305
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:48.080
not especially when we were told later that someone had called Emir something

306
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.159
numbers that were strange too mm and when was it like it

307
00:29:54.159 --> 00:30:00.440
The decision was made you can remember on October 24 he closed down the workshop etc.

308
00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:06.360
prime.se and then he also terminated in connection with the then lease then

309
00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:11.519
Exactly the agreement was until last December 2023

310
00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:18.000
eh and then he would empty the workshop and he

311
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.159
was sick and it was not possible and then we had to extend a month eh at

312
00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:31.080
the company and then we had to pay 25,000 or 23000 something rent for January

313
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:38.960
Month of January 2024 mm just that and eh can you tell us how

314
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:44.200
How have you experienced that Enem Mirr has been affected by it

315
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.919
Here yes

316
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:58.960
that he doesn't feel good he doesn't sleep on he sleeps we sleep

317
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:05.200
not both but he he can wake up in the middle of the night and cannot fall asleep

318
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.679
If he has had heart problems for 10 years he has had a heart attack then it

319
00:31:10.679 --> 00:31:16.440
This has not given anyone better that he feels better but of course be

320
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.000
worse he could not he cannot concentrate as one serves lump in

321
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.919
stomach all the time terrible feeling

322
00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:30.200
mm so it has taken

323
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:36.880
on him too of course and and I read from his

324
00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.600
journal notes that there were suicidal thoughts and stuff like that

325
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.200
As you have noticed on something

326
00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:54.760
So put

327
00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:04.039
I I wont talk about it no eh but then have no more questions for you

328
00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:09.279
Sending thank you very much Anton Sundberg would you like to ask questions no question please

329
00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:12.919
no questions for the sig you have any question yes thank you any short question just so i

330
00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:16.880
understand things right ehm you you have described this one

331
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.000
event I will not ask you to describe it again I will just say that I have

332
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.559
recorded some things correctly eh you you saw two kids outside and I record

333
00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:33.200
that they mumble something and e put on each other these kids yes

334
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.639
just that is it on it is hard to explain but then it reminds me

335
00:32:37.639 --> 00:32:45.240
about that when you hear that children run towards the eh entrance for example as when they

336
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:52.159
runs at Easter or at Hallowen or eh that was the way I experienced

337
00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:57.960
that they were children they were short as I said eh but when I look short so they

338
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.840
may be 1 75 too and so I think they are understanding but you didn't hear what

339
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.279
as SAS but some kind of discussion was going on between them at least PR they

340
00:33:06.279 --> 00:33:10.559
mumbled something mm mm and then it felt like they put in to that when

341
00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:15.960
I checked eh when I removed the curtain it was maybe two three cm when I

342
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.840
checked so I saw I see them I see them and so I see

343
00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:26.720
that, like that they are to come to mind who

344
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.200
are as to come to first in the door etc. there to the door or something like that in

345
00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.919
all cases did you see who it was that knocked no

346
00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:42.200
we can't see it because we have what is it called

347
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:51.880
The eh glass is shimmered so you don't see no you saw any weapon

348
00:33:53.720 --> 00:34:01.440
No, then I thought about asking about these different costs that you have had only as

349
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:08.800
I understood right you flew away abroad I should not ask where or so eh without

350
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.119
I understand the right that you flew abroad on the request of the police to

351
00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:17.560
The police thought you would fly except it would be best for us and escape and

352
00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:25.320
Leave the country okay eh late in terms of this work as

353
00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.919
Utv at your home for I understand the right that the insurance company thought that

354
00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:34.520
This eh cost proposal that had been submitted from the company was not reasonable

355
00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.639
Mm exactly they thought part of the cost was after all

356
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:44.919
eh too high as, for example, when there is an establishment, they were meant that you

357
00:34:44.919 --> 00:34:49.879
should move on furniture etc. eh while you have to paint because you had to

358
00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:54.159
repaint the walls what are we talking about for sum as

359
00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:59.480
They thought was unreasonable you know that eh what we got what had the insurance company

360
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.560
Seemed to be reasonable you got any such explanation total costs you mean

361
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.680
Or yes they thought this was unreasonable yes 28,000 they thought it was

362
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:12.839
It was too much but then we got 200,000 so 48.00 is what they took

363
00:35:12.839 --> 00:35:16.920
away that establishment and there is the security that companies have paid

364
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.280
because they take the risk as well and come home to us okay so

365
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.079
The insurance company made an assessment that the sum they pay out it is reasonable

366
00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:29.720
It is a reasonable amount just okay as we did not get we have unlucky

367
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.160
Vall Insurance but Ollys

368
00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:48.960
Fall Following this event because others did not want to eh they took that

369
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.920
is one that they say it is the security that they pay for as to extra

370
00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:00.480
paid because of the risk or what to say mm

371
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:12.000
Okay you have any idea what this extra is that they took for this eh

372
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.880
How much extra they took for think it was maybe five

373
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:22.200
5000 including VAT I think it's a guess then that yes I think it etc. I

374
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.480
Can check there may be any cost proposal

375
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:35.000
left eh then i had a question i think prosecutor mentioned it

376
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.319
initially that your son's residence has been Utsö for

377
00:36:41.319 --> 00:36:45.880
more landscaped fires earlier eh you don't have to mention any

378
00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.800
addresses at all I just want to say my question is just that is meant

379
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:58.119
that then the depths of 317 eh our son has never had any other accommodation except

380
00:36:58.119 --> 00:37:01.920
at home with us and I have reacted to the majority as well

381
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:08.319
Eh what are the numerous fires that we know we have received a police report

382
00:37:08.319 --> 00:37:13.040
on it and it's shortly after this event and it's October 4th and I

383
00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.720
asked Eh Frida yesterday also what is meant by

384
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:25.240
this eh she wondered too so no it was only once and it should have

385
00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.800
Happened after this yes it is October 4 Okay mm

386
00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:39.160

Thank you I am satisfied Visel Abdalla do you want to set

388
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.000

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.400
Monday thanks etc. Yes I have no questions but yes thought to do an enlightenment late

390
00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:59.440
just yes but then we can end the hearing first if there are no more questions

391
00:38:00.319 --> 00:38:03.560

set yes, please hello hi eh senida has told us about this event but i

393
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.359

394
00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:16.720
that you would be able to tell you then with your own words and then maybe I ask some questions

395
00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:25.079
After that okay I can bore yes etc. as she has said I sat with

396
00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:32.000

434
00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:47.960
Eh yes thank you we have to share a bit on this microphone now m eh i think i

435
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:54.640
should ask about the same questions that I ask eh sinida around your

436
00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:01.359
Feeling can you can describe partly in this particular moment when you pull her in on

437
00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:06.839
toilet we might be able to start there how did it feel for

438
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.800
you v at the moment I thought what can you do best that you survive you know I

439
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:20.599
was perhaps more conscious than she because I was in such situation you know I

440
00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:29.359
experienced such stuff not she and one try your best miga way

441
00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:35.680
I think I have done right anyway etc. It turned out that was right mm

442
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:42.599
Yes it really did eh but so but know you you know when such happens you know

443
00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:49.200
via becomes panic you know when you want to get out or something you know then you are

444
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.520
Open but it is important to react

445
00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.040
you see

446
00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:04.760
they easily have me in the lump but I interpreted as you anyway

447
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.800
tried to act rationally there on the spot and think out solutions and so

448
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.960
But how has it affected you after this then when it may have been in

449
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:20.119
what has happened to how has it affected you in your everyday life then

450
00:44:20.119 --> 00:44:29.040
Yes it disappeared a security as he had joy

451
00:44:30.319 --> 00:44:33.599
I don't know if will

452
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:40.960
back and then but the work you know I have had

453
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:47.760
vests 20 years you know I thought i have two three years left for retirement thought

454
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:53.800
drive on the last two three years since it has

455
00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:01.640
Happened It is not possible to describe

456
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:08.040
feeling no you can try to describe how how did you come to that decision that you would

457
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.680
close again and how was it just

458
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.640
bitten sam tke you know that one should be lying down

459
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:28.960
Tr still i'm not cool it it is hard for me you know

460
00:45:29.119 --> 00:45:34.800
After 20 years we've had pretty nice cone you

461
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:43.640

463
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.230
Mm mm and

464
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:59.280
[Music] eh it also appears by your

465
00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:06.839
medical certificate that you got some physical complaints because of this yes you know so

466
00:46:06.839 --> 00:46:14.720
Säve my work so one cannot properly concentrate on work or

467
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.240
I want

469
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:29.359
don't want to do careless job you know it g I parry the car you know so that is too

470
00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:36.280
risk to others if you do something wrong

471
00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:41.400
Mm mm eh it also states that if I do not

472
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:47.040
Miss me now eh so it says that it felt in the stom almost and it is

473
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:54.800

474
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.839
it happens all

475
00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:06.000
Time it disappears there when we go a little abroad after two days release

476
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.920
a little you know then if you intend to come back it will come back it

477
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.480
The feeling etc.

478
00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:25.839
ehm and then so how would you describe the nights then after this

479
00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:28.839
The event

480
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:35.119
Yes sleeping badly wakes up

481
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:42.440
often yes yes it says it says you fall asleep

482
00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.839
But that you wake up and then cannot fall asleep if that task is true

483

something about what happened down in Jordbro it

557
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:28.480

559
00:55:36.039 --> 00:55:43.359
the one on Larsbergsvägen why do you record it

Bergsvägen It is true, etc. is the balcony you meet before you go

563
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.680
Down to Jordbro no comment no comment

564
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:20.839
No since then we've watched a movie when you like me say you've played

565
00:56:20.839 --> 00:56:27.880
in and sent to San when you say this is loaded the other one is in there and

566
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:33.760
Then he has one that what what does what do you want to

567
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.520
us if there could be nothing anything

568
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:43.200
could be anything yes yes and then I think because it may be what

569
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:47.119
preferably you want to tell us what it might be for something then no no one

570
00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:53.200
comment no because it is one when you zoom into the movie so you see a

571
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:59.240
weapons with a particular serial number and that number we then find the same weapon thrown

572
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.839
under one under a camper is something you want

573
00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:07.559
Comment No.

574
00:57:08.599 --> 00:57:15.440
no yes if I claim then you may comment if you want eh I say that

575
00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:20.039
you hold a loaded weapon one in the box and that Danny sitting in the driver's seat

576
00:57:20.039 --> 00:57:25.119
have right would you like to comment on that no

577
00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:34.880
no v you tell me why you record the movie i miss comment

578
00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:43.079
no may it have to do with San V say Diner and GS sends to you eh

579
00:57:43.079 --> 00:57:49.559
Just before you send a movie showing all all weapons no one

580
00:57:49.559 --> 00:57:57.920
comment no after the deed and we'll see how you

581
00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:03.680
record a movie and so you say something like this aina came the second we

582
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:09.039
began to flutter eh they were there right away approximately

583
00:58:09.039 --> 00:58:15.039
so tell me about it no comment doesn't remember it no

584
00:58:15.039 --> 00:58:22.039
because by saying so walla eh or jalla or what you de aina came the second

585
00:58:22.039 --> 00:58:28.160
We started to flutter so you get quite clearly the impression that but we are

586
00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:33.039
two people at least two or more and then I wonder was there two or where

587
00:58:33.039 --> 00:58:39.520
several people who shot no it was only me was I had said wrong during

588
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:45.039
the time you it was you really meant you would say I but then you said we

589
00:58:45.039 --> 00:58:48.559
because you mistook

590
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:57.200
Yes why do you say that Aina came then because they did not do no one

591
00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:04.680
comment is that you are afraid of someone because you

592
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:12.240
recording the movie to try to pretend that A came canceled because you were clinging to you

593
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:19.200
A comment because you do not complete the assignment you do not do what you were

594
00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:25.039

01:04:31.079 --> 01:04:35.160
that you have said so to the police eh

645
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:40.079
No may it be true that you have said so to the police if it says

646
01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:43.440
Note I know

647
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:48.030
[Applause]

648
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:56.960
Not since but you you don't remember this

649
01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:03.680
No if I ask you like this then who was it who got this job eh no one

650
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.000
comment okay

651
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:17.279
Then I was going to read what is on page 600 EH 651 second paragraph from above

652
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.640
eh question is how does he give the contact we are still the first hearing so I read

653
01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.079
from the second sentence I would rather not answer what the friends are called

654
01:05:27.079 --> 01:05:32.640
not been involved it was me who got the job the friends heard it will

655
01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.440
Remember that you have said this to the police I know

656
01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.240
It may not be true that you have said this if it is recorded by the police

657
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.520
maybe i won't

658
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:59.599
remember and on talk about this eh I or

659
01:05:59.599 --> 01:06:07.720
We remember how you expressed yourself in your first hearing about who shot it was

660
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:12.920
me or we no I remember

661
01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:20.480
not again with the court's permission on page 651 then we are 1 t 3 fourth paragraph

662
01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.039
top mm third sentence in so I read

663
01:06:26.039 --> 01:06:31.079
recorded like this Daniil He writes that there is a job that you can do and

664
01:06:31.079 --> 01:06:36.799
Earn MONEY YOU'RE ONLY SHOULD SHOULD AT A HOUSE I thank I I thank you later

665
01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:40.559
The next day I do what I went there and shot

666
01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:47.200
The door do you remember that you have said so to the police in comment in comment can

667
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:53.559

Yes well hey daniel rodden named

671
01:07:12.119 --> 01:07:19.480
I I was going to ask you eh on the same theme as these parts out of

672
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.359
The interrogations just read up would you like to answer the question of what you perceived

673
01:07:24.359 --> 01:07:28.760
that you had been given for assignments so what was it really you would

674
01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:34.520
do no okay it was read up now something that one would shoot at a

675
01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:39.359
Port or similar would you like to comment on why it is expressed or

676
01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:46.960
noted that you have expressed yourself so in interrogation okay yes I stay there thanks more

677
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.960
questions from they complain yes I do and I can say that I chose to let everyone

678
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:55.839
Ask questions first before I choose to go in and want to play parts M and

679
01:07:55.839 --> 01:08:01.400
Since then some parts eh are preferred from interrogation, I intend to do so that

680
01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:07.480
I intend to play a number of minutes out of a hearing and then I intend to set

681
01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.119
Questions until it goes well It goes well thank you what hearing is that then

682
01:08:12.119 --> 01:08:24.440
interrogation two it was held on the 3rd of November 2023 mm Eh and I do this way I yes

683
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.440
eh

684
01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:35.040
should just get on so that sound is with here put it ht or been on

685
01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:41.520
Something here you see introductions to the interrogation then as often on like this at

686
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.440
Child interrogation so it will see that there is a camera where yes etc. yes apologize I

687
01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.880
have not connected me it is me like

688
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.560
So now it first starts about five minutes

689
01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:03.359
with questions about general character so I will leave it and so I think that

690
01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:09.520
I go forward just to show which deed much like or what deed

691
01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:15.920
As Danil is served so that he is notified of him, he explains what this is about

692
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.080
If he is not served the suspicion but one explains what he is about it is

693
01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:26.400
about five minutes into it now I will play about six minutes

694
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.159
Yes tell me

695
01:09:31.159 --> 01:09:36.960
Mm it was probably the most important

696
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.040
Eh i guess you know why you are here today m

697
01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:50.560
Mm and why are you here today and should talk to me it's a v

698
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:59.080
is it called for shooting in Jordbro, etc. now it is so that you are under

699
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:04.080
15 years and therefore I can't share you any suspicion

700
01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:10.560
mm But if you had been over 15 years old then I thought I should read up what you

701
01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:14.320
had been suspected of then

702
01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:20.920
Eh and then I had served suspicion of attempted murder by together

703
01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:27.719
and consensus with others planned and completed a slide with firearms against one

704
01:10:27.719 --> 01:10:30.719
Property at

705
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:45.520
the depth of 22.22 in the evening in Haninge municipality and you had also become then

706
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:51.520
spelled suspicion of serious weapons offense by consultation and in consensus with

707
01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:59.040
other illegally or and up one held several guns and then had

708
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:06.679
The crime was considered serious when it was sharply charged and in public place and so

709
01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:10.640
happened then this crime then eh

710
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:19.800
2309 September 14 at approximately 2222 and it is the same address then on the animal's slide

711
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:28.640
317 In Jordbro Haninge Municipality it would have sounded if you were 15 now you know that

712
01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.520
Then I want you to tell you as accurately as possible

713
01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:38.880
The story from the beginning

714
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:44.239
Eh i didn't remember as much it was still quite a long time ago but i can

715
01:11:44.239 --> 01:11:51.639
Explain the most I can eh so me and my friend we had been sitting

716
01:11:51.639 --> 01:11:56.360
somewhere and we had been sitting and talking just

717
01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:00.120
Then I had gone away I was going to go

718
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:05.280
to another friend and we would meet some and then I went home after that

719
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:11.880
But this first friend I was with he had met someone I didn't know

720
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:16.199
who it was he had said there were some stuff we could do too little

721
01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:21.120
money and that's when I had intended to be

722
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:29.159
well could have done it but I don't know who this person exactly where it was

723
01:12:29.159 --> 01:12:35.719
my friend who had talked to him and who is your friend

724
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:45.920
Eh It is important that you say the name now he was called something on the dedan something on I

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.120
Friends

728
01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:03.480
But you were with this friend etc. not at home with him in one you know

729
01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.280
There are this smoke balconies okay there and then you can sit

730
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:12.960
where we had a armchair where he was not my closest friend I did not know he so

731
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.280

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.719
him there etc. he lives there or no he lives in another place etc. tell

733
01:13:23.719 --> 01:13:28.880

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.639
But I don't usually call him the surname where I don't know his name

736
01:13:38.639 --> 01:13:46.080
How did it come that you were there eh at this guy yes there on this one

737
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.639

It's not me you should ask no you mean it's the other guy but

773
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:40.320

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:46.679
Mm Describe how you go then all so I just follow him

775
01:17:46.679 --> 01:17:54.400

781
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.679
it is it you notice if it is reaching where so ehm it

782
01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:35.120

786
01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:04.600
Pressing off where hits how many shots do you shoot eh I don't just know

787
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:12.600
I just track so many times I ran etc. and where to meet these shots what

788
01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:19.199
Are you aiming for I mostly believe only on the front door, etc. and your friend eh

789
01:19:19.199 --> 01:19:23.560
No, but I do not know at all but you were both wide in each other you said that

Both knocked on the door yes then who shoots first we both start shooting

791
01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:34.920
Yes against or toward what then the door itself is only toward the door that it shoots is

792
01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:39.639
It certainly I think so, but then we ran after from there yes so we

793
01:19:39.639 --> 01:19:43.840
maybe hit the glass or something like that you might hit the glass or

794
01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:49.000
maybe kind of behind the door i might be something you feel

795
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.320
to or as you have minna of so we shot and then the house you needed like this go

796
01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.400
so m so we went so and since we ran so we kept shooting bar and then while

After all, he just disappeared yes and where are you throwing these

804
01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.320
The guns I don't know I ran bar so I threw it somewhere on yes but

805
01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:50.760
you have to think a little you said you ran etc. yes and then maybe type i

806
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:56.719
ran through a forest m then I threw it I think and then I ran yet

807
01:20:56.719 --> 01:21:06.560
more then and then you ran even more even more we pause where you know that it is

808
01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.679
No excuse you will the police have worked with this

809
01:21:09.679 --> 01:21:17.199
the case like that and there I would like to ask some questions to Danil

810
01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:26.120
Mm Danil now you have heard yourself do not tell you once without quite a few

811
01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:35.360
times what we did so that more than one person do things tell why say

812
01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:40.840
you so no comment but you are not

813
01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:46.040
shocked while sitting in this hearing at Annbritt Bö it was your

814
01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:50.159
Explanation before why do you tell us this one

815
01:21:50.159 --> 01:21:56.520
time no comment no

816
01:21:57.679 --> 01:22:04.040
Otherwise so no yes eh do you remember where you threw

817
01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:09.600
the guns somewhere no no comment is that

818
01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.920
really that you ran through a forest and threw things I don't remember you remember

819
01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.199
not no then i think i'll take some little ones

820
01:22:21.199 --> 01:22:25.719
section to MM I also get tab in with questions than this paragraph is

821
01:22:25.719 --> 01:22:28.400
want my questions at the end I just ask

822
01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.679
The question sees prosecutors is appropriate you the hare you have we may be able to take it so then

823
01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:36.960
If you have questions you are welcome to shout about if anyone else has questions but

824
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.159
Want to take your questions now about this then yes I ask my questions too

825
01:22:41.159 --> 01:22:44.920
around some things that have been said in this paragraph Danil and it is up to you

826
01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:52.199
As I said what you want to answer and comment eh I first thought to ask you

827
01:22:52.199 --> 01:23:02.840
If this you were asked by EH this interrogator about knocks on the door

828
01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:09.679
Mm and so it is recorded and we now heard that you should have said on the question

829
01:23:09.679 --> 01:23:14.000
Who is it knocking on the door and then you answer we both knock on

830
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.280
the door yes you heard it eh then held a hearing with

831
01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:28.320
you interrogation number three where you got the same question about these

832
01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.880
The knocking do you remember what you've said in it

833
01:23:33.239 --> 01:23:38.920
The interview you don't remember no I don't remember with the permission of the court I thought

834
01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:44.280
Then read on page 739 it is thus the third hearing held with Danil yes

835
01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:49.199
And it was also a child interrogation similar to conditions yes

836
01:23:49.199 --> 01:23:52.400
at the bottom of the page

837
01:23:52.719 --> 01:23:58.520
739 so reads had recorded like this and it should be verbatim what you have said

838
01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:03.920
Mm and so says the interrogator knocked both

839
01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:10.199
on and so it says that you answer no it was

840
01:24:10.199 --> 01:24:16.239
me and the interrogator say it was just you question marks how but how knocked

841
01:24:16.239 --> 01:24:23.239
you i just knocked yes with what by hand you knocked with your hand yes and that is

842
01:24:23.239 --> 01:24:30.840
Certainly etc. you remember you have said so to the police eh yes I remember it

843
01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:37.000
Mm which is correct then that only you knocked or that both knocked eh that

844
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.639
just me

845
01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:48.639
then tap so now I'll find back to the page where I was sorry

846
01:24:48.639 --> 01:24:52.040
It was difficult with this sight the numbering remembers someone where we were now

847
01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:56.320
otherwise i'm just sitting right away

848
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.880
676 eh Then you got a question what I also felt that you were a little interrupted

849
01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:12.400
eh of this interrogator EH and now I'm on page 676 in this

850
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.920
other companies we've just heard it

851
01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:21.639
Here what I felt you were a little interrupted so I was going to check if you want to

852
01:25:21.639 --> 01:25:25.960
comment or not comment eh where it is like this the longest

853
01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:31.840
up at the late 676 I just me just pushed so many times so I ran and for

854
01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.560
is heard so mm and what hits these shots where do you aim for and so stands

855
01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.760
The note I mostly only believe in the front door and so it stands like this

856
01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:48.480
The interrogator MM and your friend and then the answer will come from no but it knows

857
01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.480
I don't at all and then I mean you get canceled and the interrogator

858
01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.280
itch in and say but you are both praying each other

859
01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:05.239
When you say that I don't know at all you remember what you meant by it

860
01:26:05.239 --> 01:26:12.040
Eh I mean that eh I don't remember at all because there wasn't a second

861
01:26:14.159 --> 01:26:17.159
person

862
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:26.239
Ok or so but I don't know that at all

863
01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:32.880
Okay yes it was my questions about this m okay yes from the complaint continues then please

864
01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:38.199
And then I intend to go ahead It is a short piece only 39 o 30 in we will

865
01:26:38.199 --> 01:26:45.679
to come with the pages small if i am with here 39 and 30 approximately there will

866
01:26:45.679 --> 01:26:50.719
We see where we run started We have found some things and so

867
01:26:50.719 --> 01:26:59.239
clothes and so tell me about it eh what should i tell yes we have found

868
01:26:59.239 --> 01:27:04.119
Clothes in plastic bags tell us about it

869
01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:07.119
Mm

870
01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:17.159
eh we also had clothes with us etc. tell us more so to change etc.

871
01:27:17.159 --> 01:27:22.800
Tell me more eh it's kind

872
01:27:23.119 --> 01:27:33.320
Everything changed you eh within mm and what did you change

873
01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:41.400
to what did you switch to what was it for clothes before, so I was black clothes

874
01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:50.639
va mm and your friend no idea black clothes too and where somewhere changed

875
01:27:50.639 --> 01:27:59.320
you clothing eh there in what is it called the parking but was in the parking lot

876
01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.800
The parking you just stood up and down a parking lot and changed clothes no

877
01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:12.560
behind the car behind the car I stay there and want to ask the question to

878
01:28:12.679 --> 01:28:19.920
Danil why do you tell us we changed clothes eh if you say you were

879
01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:25.080
Alone no comment but I so I take

880
01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:29.239
not really for one thing is if you say no comment

881
01:28:29.239 --> 01:28:34.719
eh on all questions but when answering some questions and say I was

882
01:28:34.719 --> 01:28:39.400
lonely and some no comment is that it depends on who is posing

883
01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:45.719
the question of whether you want to answer or not no what is it because then why do you not want to

884
01:28:45.719 --> 01:28:49.159
answer the question why you say we change

885
01:28:49.159 --> 01:28:54.880
clothing it depends on the question then mm and then I wonder v Why don't you want to answer

886
01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.280
on that question simply I just don't want to

887
01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.480
Answer the question sorry I miss what you said I simply won't be carried

888
01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.159
Answer the question you simply do not want to answer that question

889
01:29:09.159 --> 01:29:15.080
Okay and now I'm a little unsure now I set

890
01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.360
Ask because I was a little unsure what your first answers right in begins

891
01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:27.600

Comment No No You have also received questions about this in Foren with the police eh

944
01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.800
And then I thought I would read it it is a hearing held on 25

945
01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:59.080
October It starts on page 589 and then I thought about reading on page 592

946
01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.440
eh and that's about the middle where eh what begins when the police ask feel

947
01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:08.480
you to a person named Danil Kosim and then they show a picture and then they start

948
01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:13.119
by answering no comments and then the police say no comments and then

949
01:35:13.119 --> 01:35:17.840
If you answer no I know him, you already know as the prosecutor said he said that

950
01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.639
We are comrades There are pictures of him in hand I know him it is not possible to

951
01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:29.000

have received questions about other chats in in interrogation, including then eh things like you

1019
01:41:44.199 --> 01:41:47.599
have written to your mom eh but there is mentioned this phone I thought that

1020
01:41:47.599 --> 01:41:52.679
I would read it too and it is a hearing held on November 24 and that

1021
01:41:52.679 --> 01:41:58.080
is on page 603 eh and it starts at the bottom where i think i'll read it for

1022
01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.880
to get context but they mention that they have found chats where you write to

1023
01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:07.080
your mother and then eh a few lines from the bottom so it starts with the police say then

1024
01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:11.719
You also write to your mom that you are home and pick up clothes so you answer yes

1025
01:42:11.719 --> 01:42:16.639
and then I jump down a few lines on the last line where you don't want to answer to

1026
01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:21.440
Your mom tells you to play football you remember that and then you answer

1027
01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.520
No it was a while since it's two months now i don't remember exactly

1029
01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:34.719
Empty my nap and it stands and that's it then is that is what I wrote I guess

1030
01:42:34.719 --> 01:42:39.199
This is how you mention that it is your handset is something you want to comment

1031
01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:44.840

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:48.480

1033
01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:53.320

What is written in chats then no no comments no

1047
01:44:09.719 --> 01:44:17.080
Eh since last week so eh was heard Danil and there he has then under

1048
01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:20.760
The preliminary investigation told us that you have done this together that you were there

1049
01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:26.159
in Jordbro together and that you eh went to this residence and and shot is

1050
01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:30.199
that something you want to comment no just that this is not right I did not shoot

1051
01:44:30.199 --> 01:44:37.560
So okay you want to develop it no okay so what Danil says that

1052
01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.560
is not correct no it is not true that I have shot no okay what do you have

1053
01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:46.480
done then no not shot you have done anything else nothing i saved on

1054
01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:51.320
No there is some reason for Danil to find this in terms of your

1055
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:57.800
In involvement Nothing Reply to No Okay I think I will release it then

1056
01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:04.000
Then I thought to have some other questions yes partly found eh traces of cannabis in

1057
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.400
Your urine is true that you had taken it I nothing to answer okay you have

1058
01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.159
any explanation for that there was in the urine no no

1059
01:45:13.159 --> 01:45:20.080
Eh and then we have taken in some other material from this iPhone mobile then

1060
01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:25.840
Eh i thought you would have the opportunity to comment on it eh partly from snapchat

1061
01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:31.599
so you can see then that you have sent out a message about eh that yes if several

1062
01:45:31.599 --> 01:45:37.000
people to several people about a rush etc. there is something you want to explain

1063
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.280
No because that does not apply to this event so I think you might

1064
01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.239
Still want to talk about it no I don't want to why not then forgive no I

1065
01:45:44.239 --> 01:45:49.199
Want not it okay and even then there is that you

1066
01:45:49.199 --> 01:45:54.199
sends out a question that you want to eh have a rush is something you want

1067
01:45:54.199 --> 01:46:00.560
Comment No No No We have also found pictures then on weapons and cash

1068
01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:05.239
and otherwise there is something you want to comment no

1069
01:46:05.239 --> 01:46:10.040
No, how do you feel about this event we the plaintiff was here and

1070
01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:15.320
told last week about this no nothing to talk about no

1071
01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:22.560
Why not then do not feel for no then I think I stay there

1072
01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:27.280
I have no one for question thanks no

1073
01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.800
Good Frida Vin Want to ask some questions no thanks no is it any of yes

1074
01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:36.560
You can start, of course, you want to start asking questions, where I said

1075
01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.560
initially Danny that you have not fired any weapon at the current

1076
01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:45.000
the opportunity that you have not shot at this residence in question thus

1077
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.080
The plaintiff's home is correct yes, so what I said from the beginning

1078
01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.960
So shot yes and this that you have not shot you have said this

1079
01:46:55.960 --> 01:47:00.000
to the police also yes it is all who have

1080
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.480
Asked you have said during the police interviews yes so

1081
01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:14.080
disturb yes thank m is it reaching another who has asked for it now no then is brought

1082
01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:21.719
finished so began to start with the questions please yes thank you I was going to start with

1083
01:47:21.719 --> 01:47:26.440
a bit like this as my colleague with background and so I was going to start by asking

1084
01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:31.320
you a little how you feel if you feel danny and

1085
01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:36.920
Daniel not actually the first time I actually see him and this one

1086
01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:41.760
the person in this courtroom I have never met them before and I

1087
01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:47.280
will yes start from there you have never met them before no actually not

1088
01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:54.679
ever no okay eh but i can say eh fact that they live in the same area

1089
01:47:54.679 --> 01:47:59.280
like me yes eh yes it is not so surprising there are many who live in as

1090
01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.400
the same place and so eh it is very possible that one can have each other on

1091
01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:09.639
social media but never met so yes yes it was a bit if you take it

1092
01:48:09.639 --> 01:48:13.840
precisely considering that you live in the same area you have never met at each other in

1093
01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:18.239
the area and so no there are many living in the area I know and

1094
01:48:18.239 --> 01:48:21.239
feel but he is definitely not my age so that is no one I feel

1095
01:48:21.239 --> 01:48:25.520
Personally No NO Do you know if you have any contact at

1096
01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:30.920
Social Media eh no I no actually I would just

1097
01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:35.440
say of what I have seen in the investigation so I know that I have had

1098
01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.119
him on snapchat m but there has not been a further conversation there

1099
01:48:40.119 --> 01:48:43.960
Are you talking about Danny now or yes that's right it's Danny you Danny have you

1100
01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.840
had contact with on Snapchat Danny I have had yes if that is the person who

1101
01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:51.119
is behind the snapchat account I have had on my snap then I mean it is

1102
01:48:51.119 --> 01:48:55.320
lofgren it is l yes yes exactly i have had that person on my snapchat but

1103
01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.440
there is no one that I know or have met you can add the person on

1104
01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:01.599
Snapchat with whom you have Gems the same friends so it is very possible that he

1105
01:49:01.599 --> 01:49:06.159
know my gems the same friends and yes but there is no one i have met personally

1106
01:49:06.159 --> 01:49:11.119
ever no and that's snapchat how is it on instagram you have contact with

1107
01:49:11.119 --> 01:49:16.440
any of those eh no i have not reach him on instagram signal eh much

1108
01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.599
possible eh if it is so that it is the person behind the accounts that I

1109
01:49:20.599 --> 01:49:25.599
have contact with eh so yes eh i was thinking I wanted to tell you something freely

1110
01:49:25.599 --> 01:49:29.599
Before you want to ask your questions eh what I will tell freely I am not

1111

1112

as well as interrogation I have had for reason I have not been able to see any whole in

1113
01:49:38.239 --> 01:49:42.480
chatting and besides, I have had questions read to me if I know one

1114
01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:46.960
person by that name instead of asking have you chatted with this alias for

1115
01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.080
I only know of some aliases in this preliminary investigation as we want to say

1116
01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.920
username that I have written with on some signal and that is what I feel

1117
01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.679
again in just that but i just got the question you feel this name person

1118
01:49:58.679 --> 01:50:02.159
By that name and so you say you show a picture then like I should recognize

1119
01:50:02.159 --> 01:50:06.119
But I actually do not and then you have also asked me the question yes but we

1120
01:50:06.119 --> 01:50:08.920
know that you have communicated with each other but how should I know that I have

1121
01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:12.520
communicated with that person but you don't even show something like alias or

1122
01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:16.840
Name or so on yes in terms of technical evidence so I just have

1123
01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.080
seen now in the investigation when I got to see the tatters so thought yes but it was at

1124
01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.599
The last hearing I have barely had so many interrogations anyway and then I have received

1125
01:50:23.599 --> 01:50:26.320
I think there have been pretty unrelevant questions I have had to ask

1126
01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.960
to me so yeah okay yes is something more you want to tell you about the investigation you can

1127
01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:36.320
Ask your questions yes okay eh but then I continue and ask if you have

1128
01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:41.840
Contact about it now that you have read the investigation then there are some of the guys

1129
01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:46.000
As you have then seen that you have had contact with what did you say again now

1130
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.760
Have you read the investigation and then I wonder one of the guys sitting here

1131
01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:55.239
Dani or Armando then or Danil have you had contact with any of them on social

1132
01:50:55.239 --> 01:51:00.639
Media ehm hard to say etc. you can develop

1133
01:51:00.639 --> 01:51:05.800
It is you kind eh I do not know directly what is behind which accounts

1134
01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:10.560
or whatever it is eh i know i have chatted with in a group chat that i have

1135
01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:14.079
participated what I have already acknowledged that I am Diner

1136
01:51:14.079 --> 01:51:19.199
and gs on signal yes eh, that is, I have chatted with alias called Peter

1137
01:51:19.199 --> 01:51:25.040
Jalla I have chatted with an alias called ehm, ie doo kk and they

1138
01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:29.079
other two aliases found in that group but i have never met i don't know

1139
01:51:29.079 --> 01:51:32.400
which ones are behind it or whatever it is that apply I

1140
01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:37.040
Takes El Hamilton it's something you recognize

1141
01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:43.000
No no mixtape who is there no idea i don't even know who is behind it

1142
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.520
alias but it has come to light that I have received many chats sent to me

1143
01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:52.280
of that aliaset eh, that is, it has sent lots of member to me I

1144
01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:57.000
cannot answer why or how the interpretation applies to that person who

1145
01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.159
have written this to me that is, he has sent me messages

1146
01:52:01.159 --> 01:52:04.079
But I have not responded to some announces and besides, I do not know

1147
01:52:04.079 --> 01:52:07.480
What I have answered so it is very difficult for me to explain the interpretation

1148
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:11.560
and what it is about because it can give a picture of how you can interpret it but I

1149
01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:15.679
do not interpret it in the same way no we we will return soon to it because you are to get

1150
01:52:15.679 --> 01:52:20.840
the opportunity to really tell yourself how you interpret things but the question was

1151
01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:27.639
mixtape no you have you don't know who it is no no idea you get the impression

1152
01:52:27.639 --> 01:52:33.079
because you have quite a lot of contact you and mixtape yes

1153
01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:40.119
It doesn't know what I can say about it no you Kane answer why you have so much

1154
01:52:40.119 --> 01:52:45.599
Contact maybe no I so the person might write very much to me

1155
01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:48.360
I don't know why I can't answer that

1156
01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:55.480
No you foxtot eh network know you something about it no i have nothing

1157
01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.679
with so to do nothing at all no you know that it has been a

1158
01:53:00.679 --> 01:53:05.360
Conflict with foxtrot and other networks It is normal there are the news

1159
01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.360
every day so there is nothing new no no i but sometimes i can say i

1160
01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.440
sat a pretty young last week where someone said they had never heard as

1161
01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:17.239
Foxtrot so I have to ask the question to you anyway no exactly I have talked about it

1162
01:53:17.239 --> 01:53:22.199
But I have no acquaintance with it or neither any connection to

1163
01:53:22.199 --> 01:53:25.239
That no

1164
01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:31.440
Ok so you have no contacts that you know are active within Foxtrot EH not by mine

1165
01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:36.840
So know no but my contacts on signal so they have some profile pictures

1166
01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:40.880
that can be perceived that but no one I have chatted with it may be possible

1167
01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.280
that I have a GSam group chat with them like these big group chats like me d

1168
01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:50.199
have reunion atts a phone or group chat where there is eh yes in

1169
01:53:50.199 --> 01:53:53.280
preliminary investigation but that is, I am only with a group and so you have

1170
01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:57.280
The Gems the same contacts it automatically become a contact one does not even need

1171
01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:02.159
have chatted or had something with that person to do okay no I understand

1172
01:54:02.159 --> 01:54:08.440
But if we take you should approach then this event that you have heard us

1173
01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:13.119
Talking pretty much about an event in Jordbro What do you know about

1175
01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:24.079
know what who have you found out the signal or when have you found out what

1176
01:54:24.079 --> 01:54:28.320

1182
01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:03.599
The last thing I wrote eh on the night it was at around 20 o'clock somewhere and

1183
01:55:03.599 --> 01:55:09.719
It was when this group chat eh go ended yes that I want to name it and

It was the last time I wrote so yes I thought we'll come back to it

1185
01:55:14.679 --> 01:55:20.199
here go chat but if we think earlier on the day where the 14th had you heard

1186
01:55:20.199 --> 01:55:25.599
Something about that there would be someone that there would be any shooting then

1187
01:55:25.599 --> 01:55:31.480
No any shooting taken over no not the view I had

1188
01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:37.320
No so then you have not been involved in any way it either I guess no

1189
01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:46.719
we the incident not neither BETE eh so no no you have

1190
01:55:46.719 --> 01:55:51.239

01:55:51.239 --> 01:55:55.520
Shootings no I don't recruit someone to shootings no okay

1192
01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:02.800
No you how do you feel sinida and emir them who

1193
01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:08.760
were here the plaintiffs eh i should explain briefly why eh that message has

1194
01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:16.079
been sent by me to Doo at KK on what regarding signal eh that message has

1195
01:56:16.079 --> 01:56:21.560
first sent by another alias in the group chat go eh I just want

1196
01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:27.760
So just as well as putting out that the chat itself, there are, like times that

1197
01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.599
does not match the time stated in the group chat it wants

1198
01:56:32.599 --> 01:56:37.520
say that there are certain times that a mobile phone has received it

1199
01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:42.320
So the message so I want to before that D MED as this alias

1200
01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.960
As I want to name as Abdi that I don't know who is behind that aliaset

1201
01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:50.119
have sent where it is the address and from there it has been sent long before

1202
01:56:50.119 --> 01:56:56.320
I would like to say around between 40 39 somewhere where 1740 17739 Eh there has it

1203
01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:00.360
been sent that message and from there I had been aware of it and so

1204
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:05.280
had I seen that that while would disappear and then I got a chat by man

1205
01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:09.159
wrote to me that you wanted like the address you wanted to google you were

1206
01:57:09.159 --> 01:57:13.920
Curious and then I had sent it to this delo and I had googled myself

1207
01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:18.440
on the two minutes later of sheer curiosity and that is why it stands

1208
01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:24.840
that I have looked it up on Mr k mm eh was that address you looked up or

1209
01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:28.840
were it the people on Mr k eh it was just the address i searched on so it came

1210
01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:32.599
forward so I was just curious wanted to see what it was why it was like man

1211
01:57:32.599 --> 01:57:36.560
sent eh then i also want to add that i didn't even notice that

1212
01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.159
It stood the last one in the messages Deter Meden where it stands

1213
01:57:40.159 --> 01:57:43.880
Step I did not notice it that you did not notice at all no I laid

1214
01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:46.520
not notice that, so I had just copied and pasted in and I had

1215
01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:53.040
not realized it was so kind of message even though i hang out with you now eh

1216
01:57:53.040 --> 01:58:00.719
you have received a message with their name and address to you then wait wait

1217
01:58:00.719 --> 01:58:07.119
I finished late and you get a message from any completely different person writing

1218
01:58:07.119 --> 01:58:13.840
to you and are curious about that address it is true but why then how to

1219
01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:17.159
one does not want the message to disappear man has disappear

1220
01:58:17.159 --> 01:58:21.679
disappearing messages in some chatter people usually set them automatically

1221
01:58:21.679 --> 01:58:26.480
or or just by being used to setting the disappearance message

1222
01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:30.400
and then the message would start disappearing therefore I copied I scrapped in

1223
01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:34.239
because that person probably wanted to search for it with curiosity and I was

1224
01:58:34.239 --> 01:58:38.560
also curious so that then I also googled it how did that person know you

1225
01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:44.000
had that then I wonder what did you say how did the person who heard of

1226
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.960
To you that you had received that message eh I have no idea

1227
01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:53.400
actually it may be very possible that it is a person in the group chat eh so yes

1228
01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:58.679
ok so he got the same message as you in the group chat but so had

1229
01:58:58.679 --> 01:59:03.320
disappeared from his phone so he heard from you and bar get this

1230
01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:07.000
That is true and then it had been sent and then

1231
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.840
Since after that I haven't had any further chat with that person no I

1232
01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:14.880
know that you have said that we will return to it

1233
01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:21.239
Eh dany danil we i have asked you earlier if you have met if you said

1234
01:59:21.239 --> 01:59:25.320
you that you have not done but therefore the question may be strange now but are they

1235
01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:30.079
near your home this day eh no i have no idea that

1236
01:59:30.079 --> 01:59:33.320
actually because i haven't even met them i can so i have been in my

1237
01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:38.760
housing both of these two days eh I can tough the day before the 15th so I had

1238
01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:42.760
passed out for a short while eh on your own it was just somewhere near

1239
01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:47.360
The area I have told in my interrogation that it had gone in a immediate area

1240
01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:52.040
For make an ATM thing then I went back home and that's the only time

1241
01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:56.079
ever has gone out of my home and it may stand straight off by my analysis of

1242
01:59:56.079 --> 02:00:00.840
where I have been and so and yes I share your view that you have been

1243
02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:05.119
at home i wonder if danil has been at home no they have not been home

1244
02:00:05.119 --> 02:00:11.719
with me no okay and they have you been involved in any way in that they go

1245
02:00:11.719 --> 02:00:19.880
Taxi from Larsberg No No EH has and when you sit at home there

1246
02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:23.679
the evening then eh when is the first information you

1247
02:00:23.679 --> 02:00:30.199
gets about what has happened when it is Jordbro eh can you repeat the question yes you

1248
02:00:30.199 --> 02:00:35.239
You are at home in Larsberg when is the first information you get what has

1249
02:00:35.239 --> 02:00:40.119
Happened down in Jordbro eh that event the first time

1250
02:00:40.119 --> 02:00:44.520
i get information about it it was about i would probably maybe someone

1251
02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:50.040
Half an hour 20 minutes after I get a message sent to me and then

1252
02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:55.000
I see it I look up and google and yes it was when I searched up

1253
02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.159
shots against residence Jordbro and such things by curiosity eh want to see what it

1254
02:01:00.159 --> 02:01:04.840
was that had happened to eh but before that so the only time i have ever searched on

1255
02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:10.040
just they yes if it is it was the plaintiff as it was then I had

1256
02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.320
searched for this with Mr K and googled it was out of curiosity when I got it

1257
02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:19.880
chat sent to me so okay and how did you think then when you first have

1258
02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:24.880
received in the evening where a certain address in Jordbro and then you find out that it

1259
02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:29.280
has become a shooting at that particular address v How did you think around it

1260
02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:35.000
Eh quite frankly I can say that it was maybe it wasn't immediately a shock

1261
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.960
eh man hill might have some kind of perception it might have

1262
02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:46.719
happened something but my view was well that yes I was not so surprised but

1263
02:01:46.719 --> 02:01:52.679
yes eh sin like it was a pity it happened yes it was my reaction you ask

1264
02:01:52.679 --> 02:01:57.480
any of those involved what happened and why it became like this and so

1265
02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:03.800
eh very possible hard to answer yes you do not know other words eh yes it is hard

1266
02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:09.239
Answering no question is not difficult to answer you can answer if you know if you

1267
02:02:09.239 --> 02:02:15.599
Don't know you say so but I wonder you checked with someone what did you say I check

1268
02:02:15.599 --> 02:02:20.000
what what a feeling was did you check with someone what had happened and why it had happened

1269
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:27.679
eh no i i didn't think too much about it no okay then so

1270
02:02:27.679 --> 02:02:34.239
you the movie that Danil has recorded on a balcony in Larsberg is on it

1271
02:02:34.239 --> 02:02:40.159
the floor where you live eh hard to say eh you can see that it you see after all

1272
02:02:40.159 --> 02:02:43.599
Like a balcony you see a staircase so I have a hard time seeing if

1273
02:02:43.599 --> 02:02:49.159
it is it or not eh i usually don't go out there eh so i usually just most

1274
02:02:49.159 --> 02:02:52.840
be in my home and then I go out through another exit in that building so

1275
02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:56.960
that I don't know about like this is the same building or not but I see when you

1276
02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:02.360
looks out of windows and so it looks so come from my building and because

1277
02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:06.360
The police have been and filmed from exactly that is true is exactly where I feel

1278
02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:10.360
again that it is my building but in terms of the movie I have a hard time

1279
02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.280
tough okay eh that I ask that because I wonder

1280
02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.760
If you have seen them on your balcony before ever no

1281
02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:28.599
No and the phone we took out of your hand when you were arrested it is your phone va mm

1282
02:03:28.599 --> 02:03:33.440
and is it you who only use it or is it any other eh it can I

1283
02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:38.840
not answer why not eh i have had other occasions when i have been

1284
02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:42.159
with friends who have borrowed my phone but I would not like to say that someone

1285
02:03:42.159 --> 02:03:48.360
Other have used my phone all the time so that I have said as I said testimony to

1286
02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:56.040
i have village used eh this phone so more than that i can't s

1287
02:03:56.719 --> 02:04:03.960
No and you heard my colleague ask questions to Danny about his GPS

1288
02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.559
shows a lot of connections just around Larsbergsvägen seven and that is after all

1289
02:04:07.559 --> 02:04:12.639
same with Daniil I ask the question to you too you have not seen them there what

1290
02:04:12.639 --> 02:04:17.719
Did you say once to you haven't seen Dan Daniil on this close of your home

1291
02:04:17.719 --> 02:04:24.360
no idea no eh and that have you told you that

1292
02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:31.880
are you who is your n gs correct you changed any username

1293
02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:36.559
After this event ehm yes I got it sent to me that they wanted to

1294
02:04:36.559 --> 02:04:40.880
that I would change your name eh so yes I can not say anything else so that

1295
02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:45.360
Probably I have changed its name to the Anra username so I would like to claim

1296
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:50.559
that it is a known username that I have used before it is only or

1297
02:04:50.559 --> 02:04:55.000
i know maybe something i till so yeah i have very possible i can just change

1298
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.639
a name but it is not of anyone like the further thought I might change it for

1299
02:04:58.639 --> 02:05:03.040
that I might not want anyone would s that I was called what I was named before on

1300
02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:07.960
because of that just someone reach some kind of concern maybe because it would happen to me

1301
02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:12.159
something and if you instead of saying what it might be trying

1302
02:05:12.159 --> 02:05:18.000
Tell us why it was you changed why did you change at 2252 this evening

1303
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:23.159
ehm no one I do not, as I do not know, but may be possible

1304
02:05:23.159 --> 02:05:25.639
that you wrote to me that you wanted me to bust so I didn't think so

1305
02:05:25.639 --> 02:05:29.719
much i just bust it is quite right that you wrote to you it was

1306
02:05:29.719 --> 02:05:35.239
so that mixtape wrote to you and therefore I wonder why you change username

1307
02:05:35.239 --> 02:05:39.920
when mixtape tells you and do it eh i don't really know i changed

1308
02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:44.719
just names I don't see it as a big deal really if someone wrote to

1309
02:05:44.719 --> 02:05:48.159
me brother rename your signal then I perceived it as yes but then

1310
02:05:48.159 --> 02:05:52.119
should I rename my signal so then I just gave it who is he in

1311
02:05:52.119 --> 02:05:56.760
relationship with you eh no one i know i have no relationship with him

1312
02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:00.840
Nothing at all a person you have no relationship with and that you do not

1313
02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:03.960
feel and as you previously tell you that you do not understand why he writes

1314
02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:08.559
lots of things to you he writes changed your name and then you do it right away

1315
02:06:08.559 --> 02:06:12.840
I will perceive you yes it is normal, so you do not need to feel

1316
02:06:12.840 --> 02:06:18.199
or have any relationship with a person to BTA a name on a

1317
02:06:18.199 --> 02:06:22.440
signal source there so it's not like you know everyone you write with

1318
02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:25.880
signal and you are in many groups and

1319
02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:31.800
so ok eh session we thought I'd talk

1320
02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:37.239
a little about the eh you remember when installing it about in time it stands

1321
02:06:37.239 --> 02:06:42.079
after all it is the investigation February but I very possible I may have had it at

1322
02:06:42.079 --> 02:06:45.440
that time eh i have had it installed on my phone

1323
02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:51.079
So but yes and what did you have for alias eh there is nothing that I want to answer

1324
02:06:51.079 --> 02:06:56.159
But I will see that I don't I vod I don't call myself Dinero on

1325
02:06:56.159 --> 02:07:02.079
session eh i have called me for other names on all my encrypted chats so

1326
02:07:02.079 --> 02:07:05.880
So chat apps I have had so I have used to call myself either

1327
02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:11.159
that named yours with gs at the end or so i have called me for yes that name

1328
02:07:11.159 --> 02:07:15.480
that I switched to or so I have called myself Z or that nickname

1329
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:19.639
named Soran with Z or yes very possible I used the names but I have

1330
02:07:19.639 --> 02:07:25.520
Not called me for Dinero on session it knows with determination what did you say that

1331
02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:30.040
Do you know for sure that you have not done, etc. you can then be kind and tell

1332
02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:35.159
for me what have you called you instead eh i have a hard time remembering it is

1333
02:07:35.159 --> 02:07:39.400
hard to remember man writing but maybe dinero gs or maybe i

1334
02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:43.520
have called me sino so I changed that name of signal so there is a lot

1335
02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:51.760
possible i had that name yes eh have you used session this evening the 14th

1336
02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:56.320
No but it is someone else who has done it eh I can't answer that

1337
02:07:56.320 --> 02:08:01.599
No you like this you heard me tell me this orally

1338
02:08:01.599 --> 02:08:08.960
eh that I say I will be able to show

1339
02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:17.239
that your phone is the one who has been logged in to session eh but you are holding

1340
02:08:17.239 --> 02:08:21.920
not with me about it no no i have not been to session in it

1341
02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:25.920
Current crimes the opportunity you are absolutely sure of this I am absolutely sure it is

1342
02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:32.159
nothing you sit and find on no no good

1343
02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:41.079
eh snapchat eh have you used it this evening eh yes what stands san puns it

1344
02:08:41.079 --> 02:08:47.079
is my username yes good and so were you in on it

1345
02:08:47.079 --> 02:08:52.159
that you had participated in the chat called go

1346
02:08:52.159 --> 02:08:57.920
Yes it was in signal yes just yes yes absolutely it is signal and i thought

1347
02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:04.199
hear with you what what is that chat about if you describe the general eh I

1348
02:09:04.199 --> 02:09:07.719
can reply to what I have written I cannot interpret what other people

1349
02:09:07.719 --> 02:09:11.880
have written because you might not write it directly to me eh but I

1350
02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:16.400
know from what I have written eh so it mostly I think was about some kind of

1351
02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:22.320
thing with some car eh so that's why I've written some chats there etc. so that it

1352
02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:25.960
But I don't know what else kind of planning it is if I do not open

1353
02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:29.000
everything in the chat and check my messages so that then there is a lot

1354
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.400
possible that things disappear at my phone so I don't see everything and that

1355
02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:40.199
is common with signal mm mm and if you try anyway i am asking you anyway

1356
02:09:40.199 --> 02:09:46.159
try to summarize what is this group chat g yes my perception of it

1357
02:09:46.159 --> 02:09:50.440
I know it was about what I wrote about it was about I needed someone

1358
02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:53.480
that could drive a car so that's what I had it

1359
02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:57.440
the perception of someone who had a driver's license who could drive a car that was the only

1360
02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:01.480
I perceived as I wrote about absolutely and then you tell me where it was

1361
02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:06.000
they would drive and why and there so where I don't know why I can't answer

1362
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:13.000
on it yes but then you had someone who could drive a car where

1363
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.559
would the person drive and why I said as I said I don't remember why so I

1364
02:10:17.559 --> 02:10:21.840
can't answer why but I had written only what about car and that

1365
02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:27.440
If I have seen it you can see in the chat eh when I write eh to call my

1366
02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:31.679
now drives and those things like that so they want it to act a driver to a

1367
02:10:31.679 --> 02:10:37.320
car it is shopping for a driver for a car just yes I thought we do this then then

1368
02:10:37.320 --> 02:10:43.639
that I take out the chat on the screen here etc. eh and so if I should see should just

1369
02:10:43.639 --> 02:10:49.440
Must plug in me of course too so maybe it will be easier and

1370
02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:54.920
as well as being able to give a little more clear

1371
02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:07.679
Answer and then it says like this they give all info brother then you can run already tonight

1372
02:11:07.679 --> 02:11:13.559
Do you say then say mixtape and I will say all the message

1373
02:11:13.559 --> 02:11:18.360
Am not here I should be clear with now but I have selected some so Peter

1374
02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:26.119
Bile and then 418 seated the Tingsen Jalla and where you can step says mixtape eh

1375
02:11:26.119 --> 02:11:31.400
And then you answer a little later tamam write n everything is clearly send the address there

1376
02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:40.599
they are now you want to tell you what is this about eh in terms of giving about

1377
02:11:40.599 --> 02:11:46.199
All info so it was probably the one who would the person who would inform h

1378
02:11:46.199 --> 02:11:52.880
about anything i don't know eh then what is about that those people

1379
02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.040
can do that I have not read because I did not open the chat at it

1380
02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:00.239
the occasion I went into the chat after so you see a gap between the

1381
02:12:00.239 --> 02:12:04.480
Two meant so probably something has been written in between therefore I wrote yes

1382
02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:07.679
but sending address where they are now so much possible that there was someone who

1383
02:12:07.679 --> 02:12:11.800
Wanted Pick I don't know what it was for but it was the picking up of something

1384
02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:15.880
So that I don't know eh but I have I will, as I said, not completed that I

1385
02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:20.360
have written an address or sent it so that I just want to

1386
02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:22.840
Clarify

1387
02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:30.119
so that the first is about driving any car the second it you have

1388
02:12:30.119 --> 02:12:35.679
I read it so no it is so that when you do not open notes on

1389
02:12:35.679 --> 02:12:39.679
signal and enters the chat later after, so messages disappear if you have

1390
02:12:39.679 --> 02:12:43.119
setting disappearing messages for a group so that's why I have not seen

1391
02:12:43.119 --> 02:12:46.840
these messages when on the occasion I went in and I have set it

1392
02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:50.119
On something else everyone can set it in their own way how to set up

1393
02:12:50.119 --> 02:12:54.079
Disappearing message so I haven't read that chat where they stand there

1394
02:12:54.079 --> 02:12:59.079
two people eh with the tag can step what did you write what did you put in for someone

1395
02:12:59.079 --> 02:13:04.119
this kind of eh time for disappearance then what did you say what did you put for time for disappearance

1396
02:13:04.119 --> 02:13:08.960
said i eh i don't remember i can have set it in five four minutes four

1397
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:12.400
minutes yes very possible five minutes you can set it how you want to yes it

1398
02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:15.480
do i know but will it not be difficult to be in a group chat if one sets

1399
02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:20.320
that messages disappear after four minutes yes but it is not I read after all

1400
02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:23.800
Not I don't see when things come in or not I get notes on

1401
02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:27.760
my phone and when i open and go into the chat then i know if i read

1402
02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:31.400
Or not so you don't see who has read what you can press

1403
02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:34.840
some chat and then you should see who has read it but I have not read it

1404
02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:40.040
the message what does it mean that they can step then what did you say if we think

1405
02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:43.520
to ignore if you have read or not what does Peter Jalla and Dani can

1406
02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:49.960
stepping apparently do something but I don't know what so the word steps

1407
02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:54.559
does not have to mean to go and do any shooting or so may

1408
02:13:54.559 --> 02:13:59.960
mean whatever it is like saying yes but eh i want i can do this

1409
02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:03.079
we should do a job or step forward can be anything so that I

1410
02:14:03.079 --> 02:14:10.960
Can't answer it really and then I wonder why should you write

1411
02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.719
eh why which address is what you send

1412
02:14:16.719 --> 02:14:23.159
ehm hard to reply to eh no eh I hope not what address will you send

1413
02:14:23.159 --> 02:14:26.159
Because you know apparently where they are somewhere

1414
02:14:26.159 --> 02:14:32.000
Ehm yes I have said this by sending address where they are now eh

1415
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.040
It would like to say where they are because they have certainly written to me wad they are

1416
02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:40.199
the people who want to pick yes and and Peter Jalla and Dani as this trade

1417
02:14:40.199 --> 02:14:44.239
If they are with you or how yes hard to answer that

1418
02:14:44.239 --> 02:14:51.480
Yes and then comes Peter Jalla who writes Bram what do we do if they don't

1419
02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:59.320
Opens we shall Panga the door or and then the mixtape answers slide from the box then eh

1420
02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:04.079
What is this about eh I don't know I can't interpret what others have written

1421
02:15:04.079 --> 02:15:07.239
I have tried to interpret as much as possible but I can not interpret I understand

1422
02:15:07.239 --> 02:15:14.159
not really because I what part is what you think is hard to understand that

1423
02:15:14.159 --> 02:15:17.119
Others write it does not have to do with me to do it is nothing like me

1424
02:15:17.119 --> 02:15:21.280
writes so that I don't understand it and I don't interpret it then don't read it

1425
02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:24.480
And do not keep track of it but if you read a newspaper or a book it is

1426
02:15:24.480 --> 02:15:27.920
Also someone else who has written you understand what it says no exactly

1427
02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:30.880
Yes but i don't read what i don't interpret it it is not me who has written

1428
02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:37.360
that so I can't interpret it to it no okay and then I think for this is after all

1429
02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:42.639
I think maybe I'm pretty central parts of this two guys like that

1430
02:15:42.639 --> 02:15:47.760
many you can take as possible no children only if it goes well today brothers I have

1431
02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:53.520
More tubes for your Danny and Delo What is it about ehm I

1432
02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:57.480
will s straight of the first one I write as many as you can take as possible and that

1433
02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:01.520
where eh it is as I said when I meant by a car because they wanted

1434
02:16:01.520 --> 02:16:04.639
Someone who would drive a car and so as many as you can take as many as you can check out

1435
02:16:04.639 --> 02:16:09.679
who can write to someone who can drive a car that you driver's license that can rattle an

1436
02:16:09.679 --> 02:16:13.960
car simply that was what I was referring to with that message since this with

1437
02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:18.159
That if things are going well for Erik this today then I have more so all that

1438
02:16:18.159 --> 02:16:22.239
the message it might be whatever I f didn't understand what you were then or

1439
02:16:22.239 --> 02:16:25.520
what it was for the thing but that customer was something they would do

1440
02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:28.599
obviously but i didn't understand what it was so it doesn't have to be either

1441
02:16:28.599 --> 02:16:31.679
something criminal so that I do not perceive it

1442
02:16:31.679 --> 02:16:35.679
So but you are with you that sometimes you might be able to understand what

1443
02:16:35.679 --> 02:16:39.359
Other people say you can't but this is you who have written now yes

1444
02:16:39.359 --> 02:16:43.080
Of course I write what I write is that I have more clocks to

1445
02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:47.080
But I mean that it is not what I mean is that I did not understand that

1446
02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:50.439
There was something criminal Russian or so then I said I more Russian and

1447
02:16:50.439 --> 02:16:54.760
That's why I wrote it so that the rushes you have to them then I have a hard time

1448
02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:58.280
say i don't remember i don't know it was something criminal either

1449
02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:01.280
nothing criminal it remembers but you do not remember the view I had

1450
02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:07.280
No but you but how can you know it if you don't remember what did you say if you don't remember

1451
02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:10.760
what it was for rushes how do you know it was not criminal then eh in order to

1452
02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:14.040
I usually write there is a rush and then it usually is not so much as

1453
02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:22.599
have with criminal do it okay eh and then I think like this eh in the balcony

1454
02:17:22.599 --> 02:17:27.040
Easy access from the ground floor what is the balcony to get they will access

1455
02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:31.120
eh obviously as one has written about something and then I have just placed

1456
02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:34.800
Questions about whether you have if there is access to a balcony I have for sure

1457
02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:39.639
just wondered a little i don't know yes but why do you wonder about the balcony in again i

1458
02:17:39.639 --> 02:17:42.479
have a hard time responding to what I can't remember

1459
02:17:42.479 --> 02:17:51.319
No and then you write further since you do not have to crush the balcony man

1460
02:17:51.319 --> 02:17:58.359
pushes in the glass and jumps in just tell me what is it about I

1461
02:17:58.359 --> 02:18:01.800
can't answer why I have written it but I can answer that it is

1462
02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:06.200
surely just small comments where one is discussing something so I don't know

1463
02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:11.439
So I don't remember what was discussed but I can say that I

1464
02:18:11.439 --> 02:18:16.439
So there are just small comments from me and most times you don't have it

1465
02:18:16.439 --> 02:18:22.519
have not been able to answer it so then you write about any other eh car is needed to

1466
02:18:22.519 --> 02:18:31.880
my kids and then answers ask abdi eh they can run eh and then you answer they should

1467
02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:40.160
be able to unite the kid knows how to handle gat what is this then this with that

1468
02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:44.559
I write car is needed eh then I write that I need implementers it was

1469
02:18:44.559 --> 02:18:49.679
It's all about and then to my kids yes kids can be anyone I

1470
02:18:49.679 --> 02:18:53.240
Know so I can't say that I am referring to these two I can refer to

1471
02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:59.359
Anyone eh then to go down there and then it is written as they can

1472
02:18:59.359 --> 02:19:04.000
they drive eh then i meant if they could drive a car but then this with one

1473
02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.280
the kid knows how to handle the street and so there was just some comment to

1474
02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:10.960
obviously I got the idea that someone knew it so that yes I

1475
02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:14.359
Don't know I can't answer that last message no what does the means

1476
02:19:14.359 --> 02:19:19.000
that one kid knows how to handle g hard to know I will not remember

1477
02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:24.399
Why so you don't know what you've written about eh won't

1478
02:19:24.399 --> 02:19:31.319
Remember brother lives the hustle they live near no they live on lidingö then do you know which young it

1479
02:19:31.319 --> 02:19:37.519
is what eh is what they said they ask if they live near eh they ask for sure

1480
02:19:37.519 --> 02:19:42.080
If the person he is referring to then I say no then lives at Lydinge that is

1481
02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:46.800
the information I had about any person who lived where I said will

1482
02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:50.319
Don't say who it is referring to but I can refer to anyone but I want to

1483
02:19:50.319 --> 02:19:54.399
have to whom it refers to I say that it refers to Danny and Daniil and

1484
02:19:54.399 --> 02:20:00.880
then i wonder v why who is referring to if it is not Dany danil eh hard to

1485
02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:05.600
say why is it hard because I can't think of who it was me

1486
02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:09.479
were referring to for this chat was not even up to date at the time of crime or

1487
02:20:09.479 --> 02:20:14.200
later planning this this chat that was deleted eh it was not even

1488
02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:19.280
up -to -date when I was not up to date in any execution of what was happening

1489
02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:25.800
And then then this address will come, etc. Eh that I have pointed out now

1490
02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:30.880
are you waiting eh and then you write i will call my driver now have to know where mine

1491
02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:37.200
drives and the kids pick up the car from they cannot ride municipal it harage with

1492
02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:41.600
cameras and then tell me what is it about in relation to it

1493
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:46.760
This address yes I have said earlier it was about a driver so therefore

1494
02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:50.680
did I write a driver because I had someone who could drive any car to

1495
02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:55.319
that they did not want to be seen on any cameras simply I don't know that it was

1496
02:20:55.319 --> 02:20:58.479
I wrote because they didn't want to go municipal to any place I remember

1497
02:20:58.479 --> 02:21:02.040
not what place they would go to and then when they sent this address it

1498
02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:06.120
have been sent long before that that I sent and that I have pointed out that

1499
02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:09.280
That is received for another phone I am with you on it that it may be

1500
02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:15.520
Earlier and then I just wonder why k What kids are you why they can't go

1501
02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:21.520
Municipal eh yes obviously there are probably some friends that I had someone I

1502
02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:27.680
don't know hard to remember which one I was thinking about

1503
02:21:27.880 --> 02:21:33.200
said eh then writes mixtape oh no brother

1504
02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:38.160
municipal will not be me I solve bolt in the worst case otherwise one of

1505
02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:45.439
The kids drive you write eh and then you write also leave the car and and they step

1506
02:21:45.439 --> 02:21:51.240
in eh they can no drive on large roads aina can stop those there

1507
02:21:51.240 --> 02:21:55.680
Do you want to tell me something about this n n I can see that it is about the car so I

1508
02:21:55.680 --> 02:22:00.240
don't know what about it is about mm

1509
02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:07.640
eh and so you write the change of clothes were here and mixtape answers but they

1510
02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:12.720
have own only blacks somewhat easier and you answer they have their own dressed on late

1511
02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:18.120
now who have clothes who have some clothes on which

1512
02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:24.840
people there is no idea so I don't remember that no but this

1513
02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:29.080
After all, you have been in custody in principle since this happened you mean like you

1514
02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:33.120
have not had any thought what was happening this evening and what

1515
02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:37.880
You were hanging out with and so there no because I was not up to date by later

1516
02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:41.479
planning or so or whatever it was this was just a group chat that had

1517
02:22:41.479 --> 02:22:46.280
written a little diligently and then ended it several hours before Handel later

1518
02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:49.960
I want to appreciate maybe two hours and then I have not been up to date at something

1519
02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:52.880
writing I have not been up to date at any of

1520
02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:56.680
the other people who are defended or something of the event we

1521
02:22:56.680 --> 02:23:01.080
Will return to it late yes exactly but I just want to point out

1522
02:23:03.479 --> 02:23:07.319
that and then you write like this and this

1523
02:23:07.319 --> 02:23:12.760
do i really want to hear you explain now okay bera press they get to go there do

1524
02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:18.120
the rusen s ride somewhere and change and burn old clothes

1525
02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:23.680
Explain yes I am a wore something where any comment I Leaved there so I

1526
02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:28.240
Do not remember it was safe for one to shit in a thing and make a

1527
02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:32.120
other things there were just lots of things I had commented then I haven't

1528
02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:37.120
remembered why it had written so but yes I don't have much to say about

1529
02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:41.279
It no but if you translate this into Swedish then it says that okay

1530
02:23:41.279 --> 02:23:46.640
there is no printing apartment then they can go there and do the rush job I can

1531
02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:51.680
Don't interpret that so no but I interpret now so you have to wait eh and go somewhere

1532
02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:56.240
and change and burn old clothes it is a straight pretty it gets

1533
02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:00.399
Translation to a little more Swedish and then I wonder what to have a printer

1534
02:24:00.399 --> 02:24:05.880
apartment to if we start where you can use for different stuff but I would

1535
02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:09.479
not say that I meant so I printed is probably some slang word that I have

1536
02:24:09.479 --> 02:24:12.520
written yes it is a slang word for printing apartment and pushes positions it

1537
02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:16.120
is in your opinion yes and what is your view then I cannot answer

1538
02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:20.160
that but now you may well give you but you can be different things it needs

1539
02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.880
not then it may be a place you want

1540
02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:26.680
be on too that doesn't have to mean it but it's your your opinion

1541
02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:29.720
and your interpretation my interpretation is not the same has found out your interpretation but you

1542
02:24:29.720 --> 02:24:33.840
Have so desperately difficult to give your interpretation I try to give you all

1543
02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.600
chances to tell yourself but you don't answer it yes I can't simply

1544
02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:43.520
reply to the message I don't remember so much of it then

1545
02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:50.560
so they are going home and pick up black clothes and put their clothes they have in bag and

1546
02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:53.880
take voj tell me what is this what is it

1547
02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:59.120
If can't answer it simply no

1548
02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:05.920
Eh then it will mean from Abdi they may take a taxi to Jordbro after the yep

1549
02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:12.800
guys the handsets the clothes throw eh and then you answer they will throw everything

1550
02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:19.279
their signal will be deleted and now you first get the opportunity to tell you how you

1551
02:25:19.279 --> 02:25:24.319
interpret this I interpret that as eh would probably

1552
02:25:24.319 --> 02:25:29.720
say something they wanted to have done and so I just want to get rid of the group and

1553
02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:34.080
what i had on my phone so i said yes but they will erase that

1554
02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:37.840
they will delete signal and so there was certainly yes any comment that they

1555
02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:42.080
would remove their things on their phone because I don't want anything with it

1556
02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:45.399
to do really but then when this whole group ended so it was enough

1557
02:25:45.399 --> 02:25:48.840
What I had written there yes but then the viaader group and take out all so I

1558
02:25:48.840 --> 02:25:51.960
probably had just written it because I want to get the group off my phone and

1559
02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:56.800
What does what does after the yep grabs the handsets the clothes throw what does that mean

1560
02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:01.040
no idea can't answer it not me who has written no what does it mean to

1561
02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:06.399
Jappa someone I can't answer it it might mean anyway the self

1562
02:26:06.399 --> 02:26:10.760
I don't know no and a pretty I say it's a pretty accepted

1563
02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:13.720
Meaning in

1564
02:26:20.319 --> 02:26:26.120
Should you throw the headphones and clothes eh how do you react to what I do not know completely

1565
02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:30.000
Simple so you say the yep my view it can be about what

1566
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:37.520
preferably so I can't answer that and why should they then how should they how can

1567
02:26:37.520 --> 02:26:43.520
you tell me they will throw everything and their signal will be erased I

1568
02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:47.160
Don't know I just wrote I just wrote that they would make them come like

1569
02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:52.240
Remove SAS apps and so on but then they were they then did it or not it was

1570
02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:57.520
not on mine on my call or as one would say

1571
02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:01.800
so i will take everyone out and erase the group is it you who yes it was

1572
02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:05.520
anything I did is the you who created the group Eh no I have not

1573
02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:10.560
created the group but I was going to delete the group for my phone eh but when

1574
02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:15.399
The group was created I do not remember how it became so that I was an administrator

1575
02:27:15.399 --> 02:27:19.240
And then you can change and take out who you want you can do anyone

1576
02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:24.560
Administrator is a group so yes I remember that I do not know I

1577
02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:29.240
can't remember who it has been created or so okay and then I thought

1578
02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:34.920
hear with you you remember if you had contact with eh so with mixtape anything

1579
02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:39.840
on some chat und cannot answer what you don't remember i said i can't

1580
02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:45.640
reply to it yes you want to tell me why you can't answer it what said you can

1581
02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:48.880
you tell me why you can't answer it then if it I can't answer that

1582
02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:53.960
Because I don't see what I have replied to that person if you apply if you talk

1583
02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:58.600
about the chat between me and the alleged mixtape yes I can't answer that I

1584
02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:02.319
have not answered him so that I can't see what I have written but just so

1585
02:28:02.319 --> 02:28:10.920
that we think right here now you mean seriously that all the means that exist

1586
02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:17.120
from mixtape to you he has written without you responding to a single that

1587
02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:21.319
is a chat of course I mean seriously that I cannot answer it he

1588
02:28:21.319 --> 02:28:24.760
writes because I do not see what I have answered so with it so I can

1589
02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:28.359
not I perceive that there is some chat that I write to with him I see

1590
02:28:28.359 --> 02:28:32.399
after all only a few messages he sends at spaces and spaces I

1591
02:28:32.399 --> 02:28:35.279
Don't know what I have answered so I don't know what it is about but are we

1592
02:28:35.279 --> 02:28:39.680
agreed that you have answered eh I cannot answer

1593
02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:44.680
it because you don't know or because you don't want to answer because I don't know no

1594
02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:50.279
well then i thought we look a little this one and what you are just right out on so

1595
02:28:50.279 --> 02:28:54.399
Ways that we have only one party and we all have that for it to be erased

1596
02:28:54.399 --> 02:28:58.160
After all, one way and so it left on the other but I thought we start and

1597
02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:01.920
so do you get what chat are we in on now then excuse it is the chat between San and

1598
02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:10.760
Mix tjs you happen to have any side just just a moment page 344 thanks

1599
02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:19.040
eh brother need yeps if there is eh what does it mean i can't answer

1600
02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:24.240

1603
02:29:34.720 --> 02:29:37.680
All the time I don't know I can't answer that no, it's clear that

1604
02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:41.920
may be so yes it may be candy he can mean candy he can mean it i

1605
02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:45.200
serger, as I said, I can't interpret what another person wrote to me for

1606
02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:49.520
I haven't responded to the message you haven't answered at all I don't know if I

1607
02:29:49.520 --> 02:29:55.080
have answered to or not that no then we go down it a few hours later

1608
02:29:55.080 --> 02:30:02.120
eh okay best brother thunder okay thunder brother check with the brother they are 100

1609
02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:05.680
What guys are it you have which ones you have checked with and no idea i

1610
02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:08.319
do not have I do not see anything that I have answered I can

1611
02:30:08.319 --> 02:30:12.800
not respond to another person but have the other clothes themselves

1612
02:30:12.800 --> 02:30:18.520
that they can switch to is someone you want to comment on it in some way don't know

1613
02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:24.680
I can't answer no eh so Mixtape writes send address and

1614
02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:31.200
Check Eh should check what it costs so I can solve a bolt eh and then wonder

1615
02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:35.200
Do you send any address to Mixtape No I have not sent any address you have

1616
02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:39.960
not sent any no no eh address for picking brother

1617
02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:46.240
Eh but you haven't sent anyone so he writes to wait for the car

1618
02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:53.479
should get in place first you are on your way on by car and tabs they can handle

1619
02:30:53.479 --> 02:30:59.240
Tabbar va eh this are three messages from mipp to you eh i

1620
02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:03.760
claims that they are about eh there to come a car I should ask this what

1621
02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:08.640
means tabs for you I can't answer that word so I don't know

1622
02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:14.439
I he he obviously writes some information about something eh I know

1623
02:31:14.439 --> 02:31:18.200
Not what I have answered I can't answer what it is about you don't know

1624
02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:23.240
what tabs mean eh eh, of course i can understand a part of the opinion but i

1625
02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:25.800
cannot answer it in this context no but you wonder what

1626
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:31.319
means tabs eh may mean that you have tabbed done done a ugly can

1627
02:31:31.319 --> 02:31:35.080
also mean as you are perceived as weapons but I do not know I do not know what he

1628
02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:39.120
meant in this context I have not responded to the medna anyway you have not

1629
02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:42.000
replied to them those there i haven't responded to no okay

1630
02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:47.920
eh brother clutch must be depressed when starting the car then put in one

1631
02:31:47.920 --> 02:31:51.840
Against the gas and release the clutch you know why he writes so to you mixtape

1632
02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:56.880
eh apparently safe if any car doesn't know no

1633
02:31:56.880 --> 02:32:03.680
YTN 526 What is it for something looks like a reg number m you know after having

1634
02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:09.279
sat on the negotiation that this is the rain number to the bolten that runs from

1635
02:32:09.279 --> 02:32:13.720
Lars Bergsgatan 11 to Jordbro and then I wonder why he sends it to

1636
02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:20.120
you ehm i'd probably say i don't know simply i get it sent to me

1637
02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:24.880
But eh I can say that I think he may have sent to more than just

1638
02:32:24.880 --> 02:32:30.000
I for those who are relevant to it it was not relevant to me either so that

1639
02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:33.479
there was nothing that was booked to me there was nothing that I was going to so that

1640
02:32:33.479 --> 02:32:36.920
I just trave that he sent it to multiple people yes it was going to

1641
02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:41.960
Dany and Daniel for it would be Dany Daniel who is going to go in the taxi so

1642
02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:47.520
that but no idea no has any connection with it says he wants

1643
02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:53.359
An address for picking from you can't answer that

1644
02:32:54.760 --> 02:33:02.359
no eh and then then 21 and 27 eh yes the tabs

1645
02:33:02.359 --> 02:33:09.880
there in five min as soon as we drove yes my guy has shown and then I wonder

1646
02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:13.479
This is not a mistake that is there in five minutes but it is after all

1647
02:33:13.479 --> 02:33:19.760
guns that are there in five minutes where would these guns I do not know

1648
02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:24.399
COME YOU Remember what it was for the question you asked as mix answers yes my guy

1649
02:33:24.399 --> 02:33:28.760
have shown eh I don't know I don't know what I have

1650
02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:35.120
written so I can't answer it after the event then I send

1651
02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:41.080
mixtape to you he just wrote he cut dad ask your guy to see how

1652
02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:45.439
many man shot what is this about none

1653
02:33:45.439 --> 02:33:50.479
Enter I don't even see as I said before I don't see what I wrote like that

1654
02:33:50.479 --> 02:33:55.319
I don't know why it is written so eh I can't answer either as I said about I

1655
02:33:55.319 --> 02:34:00.960
have answered that message or not no but mixtape seems to convey

1656
02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:04.840
To you that someone has told him that he

1657
02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:11.800
Have murdered Emir that is what it is about this eh and then so pray to tie to

1658
02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:17.160
Your guy should check how many you shot who is your guy I can't answer

1659
02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:20.840
That no

1660
02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:25.359
And almost a little later it is between me to say there is between between where brother

1661
02:34:25.359 --> 02:34:31.640
Rename D Signal to do Group EH you have told you already that

1662
02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:34.920
You change your name Only someone tells you so you change your name on

1663
02:34:34.920 --> 02:34:39.200
Signal mm eh

1664
02:34:39.319 --> 02:34:48.640
eh and then so 23 and 27 want to know where the tabs are fucking their mothers for

1665
02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:54.279
Hunge what is it why is he so angry mixtape

1666
02:34:54.279 --> 02:34:59.680
no idea eh i got, as I said I will tough he that person has for sure

1667
02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:03.279
Sent many messages to me that I just read you didn't answer I know

1668
02:35:03.279 --> 02:35:08.520
not why he writes so obviously depends why would aa

1669
02:35:08.520 --> 02:35:13.080
does he send 0034 to you eh do you have any idea what you sent

1670
02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:20.120
mediation before the no I know may not be that you have sent a

1671
02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:26.520
film to him that is about where Danil says Aina came the second we started

1672
02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:30.520
smack no i will point out i have never seen that video for even i

1673
02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:34.720
saw the preliminary investigation so no that is not right

1674
02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:42.840
Okay then I understand and now I'm going to look at the signal

1675
02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:48.880
and first it is session or first is signal but then it is session eh i

1676
02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:53.279
know your attitude i intend to set some anyway

1677
02:35:53.279 --> 02:35:59.760
Questions based on my statement namely that it is you who has this session

1678
02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:03.560
the account and then you can say if you want to comment or

1679
02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:10.120
not yes eh when you fixed the settings that

1680
02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:15.120
the pictures remove with fast eh be blacking remove the swing it stands

1681
02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:20.840
away me snapp keep in touch with mixtape

1682
02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:26.840
Based on this is the you who have sent I have

1683
02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:30.439
not written that the only message I would like to point out as I

1684
02:36:30.439 --> 02:36:35.359
have sent it is the one at the top who had with signal jajamän so yes I

1685
02:36:35.359 --> 02:36:39.520
would also like to point out that it has chatted before and it was valid it

1686
02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:42.520
the address with the fact that you wanted to google a bit on it and it was long before so it is

1687
02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:45.359
the only thing that has written that is with session I have not written anything over

1688
02:36:45.359 --> 02:36:50.399
that no and do you agree with me that it looks like

1689
02:36:50.399 --> 02:36:59.120
that any person knows how Danny Danil sees

1690
02:36:59.279 --> 02:37:04.160
out hard to answer i don't know no i can't answer that you hold

1691
02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:07.279
with me that it looks like there is someone who is also involved with mixtape

1692
02:37:07.279 --> 02:37:12.520
That you seem to be mixtape seems to be a common contact here eh can

1693
02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:15.760
I don't reply to it it's not me like

1694
02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:24.680
writes and then someone writes here as the bolten it has now gone now or that

1695
02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:28.520
seems to be someone who knows they are going bolt it's the rain number you sent

1696
02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:33.640
it a coincidence too, as I said, I have said I do not know what it is

1697
02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:39.200
I can't answer it no if they stop you say your clothes you are going to sleep

1698
02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:45.000
over with a friend n you change with you earlier wrote in the one where you were

1699
02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:50.359
because it was you so did you write that they would pick up clothes and have bags

1700
02:37:50.359 --> 02:37:54.840
I wonder again is not you who has written this it is not me like

1701
02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:58.279
Writes no late

1702
02:37:58.279 --> 02:38:06.560
Then send a video on everything you have before you are going to move and step send when you

1703
02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:11.800
lonely in the car eh and then wonders

1704
02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:17.399
me you have we have secured a movie in your

1705
02:38:17.399 --> 02:38:23.359

Pictures of where their weapons and stuff but there are things that may have been saved on my

1709
02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:43.279
Camera roll as late as this video I probably got it

1710
02:38:43.279 --> 02:38:48.920

Ask the driver about goose is it you who have written yes

1722
02:39:57.359 --> 02:40:00.080
obviously it is me who has written that then I have for sure

1723
02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:04.240
written yes but ask the one as a driver it was as I said that it was about

1724
02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:08.439
something about a driver eh obviously there is something with any drug with goose

1725
02:40:08.439 --> 02:40:12.760
It is usually a slang to smoke any joint eh it was safe for

1726
02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:16.680
that he wanted the one who has any person driving any car that may have

1727
02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:21.000
someone smoke with it it is obviously what it is about so and

1728
02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:26.240
How do you know he's sitting in a car eh we chat for sure

1729
02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:30.240
writes that person yes no what i write what do you then do nothing soft

1730
02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:34.880
In the car something like that where you might snap hard to answer yes it is just snap

1731
02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:39.840
We are watching and the first first first mediature is chilla then in the car and

1732
02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:45.800
Ask Driver about Gås How do you know that there is a driver in the car as well it can

1733
02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:52.399
be yes as I have said the one who drives a car yes I understand but that you know

1734
02:40:52.399 --> 02:40:55.880
that it is a driver it does not depend on it is not that it is because you

1735
02:40:55.880 --> 02:41:00.600
A few minutes earlier the guys put in a bolt from Larsbergsvägen 11 no that

1736
02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:06.720
have nothing with any bolt to do okay and then then 2036

1737
02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:13.760
Eh do not take them the kids it is quite similar to what you wrote before you

1738
02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:18.319
would take as many as possible but no children no it has no context and

1739
02:41:18.319 --> 02:41:21.760
It has nothing with that message this message I have written there

1740
02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:26.560
Eh that I want to say is that I obviously write something that had to

1741
02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:30.560
do with something that I have chatted with this person to do eh it has

1742
02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:34.479
not with any car to do eh or you can have but that it I mean it has

1743
02:41:34.479 --> 02:41:37.479
Not something with something else so you want to see I have certainly written off but take

1744
02:41:37.479 --> 02:41:40.760
them not the kids he probably obviously have written off but that

1745
02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:43.479
Is there here and this we have this I have solved this and but then writes

1746
02:41:43.479 --> 02:41:48.160
I certainly do not take them these kids it has nothing with any other form

1747
02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:55.479
of perception that you have okay eh why should you remove each other here

1748
02:41:55.479 --> 02:42:00.520
Eh i don't remember it there are long intervals they are sent there so i know

1749
02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:04.800
not what removes each other here i don't know what it is all about and then

1750
02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:12.200
yes eh there on session what is it about there I can explain very clearly that

1751
02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:19.920
eh it is found in my this analysis where there is a chat between me and one

1752
02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:25.000
vsto eh as to this as well as the short session conversation where it

1753
02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:29.720
Stands that I have seen the tire of type 300 seconds so I would like to say that

1754
02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:32.960
It is certainly about sending accept messages for the question

1755
02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:37.399
or so that is what you had

1756
02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:47.279
with ok so you sent to Dany that he will remove you on session you are no

1757
02:42:47.279 --> 02:42:53.479
I had written there send it means I add a person on this app

1758
02:42:53.479 --> 02:42:57.560
Yes and then maybe that person sends something to me and then he writes

1759
02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:01.520
something to accept a request for messages it was just that but that

1760
02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:04.720
where we have not had any further contact on the app as I said I usually

1761
02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:09.600
not use that app so much no but it still seems like you say to

1762
02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:16.160
eh danny to remove something should take a sport on session in any case and that tube

1763
02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:20.040
you is it should i perceive it is so i should perceive anyway it is

1764
02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:23.920
gap between it is snapchat It may have been more messages in between so

1765
02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:27.760
I can't answer what I know just that it was about eh that on

1766
02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:30.920
session just send you to accept the message for

1767
02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:37.080
the question but you have sent something to him on session eh surely I who will

1768
02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:40.680
Send type like this hello or something and then he gets up where it is unknown

1769
02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:43.880
the mean for the question that he should accept or send any message

1770
02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:47.560
FAK It's the same that if, for example, I have written to you on signal or

1771
02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:51.479
On Facebook on Messenger then you write something and then that person should answer

1772
02:43:51.479 --> 02:43:56.279
and then it must be accepted that a conversation should start so it is

1773
02:43:56.279 --> 02:44:02.160
it is about that is what it is about okay then I understand

1774
02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:10.520
eh you you change eh signal to sino and so mixtape writes that he should

1775
02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:15.439
Create a group I only take two members from the one it stands so shot about two

1776
02:44:15.439 --> 02:44:20.960
shot and then stuck or then and then three tabs and no one died

1777
02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:25.960
Eh it is a newly created group that you join in and four minutes after you go with

1778
02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:28.880
in it so do they come to land what is it

1779
02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:33.160
If don't know it is not me so I have not answered or written any

1780
02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:37.600
messages in the group chat I was admitted eh but I have not answered or

1781
02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:40.120
Written it

1782
02:44:40.399 --> 02:44:46.760
eh If I ask you this with Dinero never you who have Dinero

1783
02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:51.160

1784
02:44:52.720 --> 02:45:01.560

1829
02:48:51.279 --> 02:48:55.160
Ask questions yes I have and I wonder Kingen if the prosecutor can get

1830
02:48:55.160 --> 02:49:00.240
a page Poster or if I will be what I can take bbag just say the page yes but then is

1831
02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:06.960
Page 422 first there yes hey

1832
02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:12.040
Sven here is this group chat go and then I have understood that you you agree

1833
02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:16.000
that it is you who write here from L GS yes and you got a question from

1834
02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:20.040
the prosecutor before around this medium that is actually yellow here guys so many you

1835
02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:24.680
can eh as many as you can take as possible and so

1836
02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:27.920
did you say if I perceive it right that it is something about steering a car

1837
02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:32.920
was it right about what then can you repeat the question that it is about steering a

1838
02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:38.040
Thus, a car is true that many you can take so I sometimes say yes but

1839
02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:41.960
Check as many as you can take as can solve this or can solve it and then meant

1840
02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:48.000
I simply a car and what does the continuation mean there then no children just yes

1841
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:51.439
It means that I do not want to have no children who can drive a car

1842
02:49:51.439 --> 02:49:55.319
You can't you can't have children driving a car so it is, after all

1843
02:49:55.319 --> 02:49:59.800
is someone by driver's license up unable who can drive a car and then it was obviously

1844
02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:02.840
that was about a driver and that's what I was about with it

1845
02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:06.840
The message okay It does not mean to shoot as many as possible but

1846
02:50:06.840 --> 02:50:11.640
No children yes your view may be something else but I share

1847
02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:15.000
not what I share that it is about a car and there should be no children who

1848
02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:18.960
should have for this car it is about a driver okay because you can after all

1849
02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:23.960
messages that are on the page before here as prosecutors want to scroll up that D is

1850
02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:27.960
Not you who writes but but where Peter Jalla writes then EH should we only pange

1851
02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:33.239
The door or J Ni Panga box and mixtape write in the box from the box then

1852
02:50:33.239 --> 02:50:37.359
If you agree that in this context, it sounds like taking as many you can

1853
02:50:37.359 --> 02:50:41.080
But no children that it is about shooting no I would not perceive it

1854
02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:44.439
as the same context because then I would immediately replied that I write it

1855
02:50:44.439 --> 02:50:48.600
where the medium about a minute after and it was a comment about something else so

1856
02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:52.399
no okay yes so I don't perceive it as the same context no so then have it

1857
02:50:52.399 --> 02:50:56.279
fallen away something about steering a car that you needed a drive or

1858
02:50:56.279 --> 02:51:03.560
something yeah have okay yes eh you late so i thought on page 423 here in

1859
02:51:03.560 --> 02:51:08.760
Proof eh so you got questions from the prosecutor before about this as you

1860
02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:14.560
writes the balcony easy access from the ground floor and so a little further down eh so

1861
02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:18.840
stands what you do not need to crush the balcony you push in the glass and

1862
02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:24.680
just jump in eh i i don't know if i perceived your answer what what do you mean

1863
02:51:24.680 --> 02:51:28.239
Here when you write this way why were you interested in this eh

1864
02:51:28.239 --> 02:51:34.279
With the balcony yes there were questions about eh something and then I had commented

1865
02:51:34.279 --> 02:51:38.560
a little eh I don't remember exactly why it was written but it was small

1866
02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:43.120
comments about a place so I don't know why or how so I can

1867
02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:47.680
not directly answer but I know there was nothing about that era

1868
02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:51.760
perception where no i can't answer what my view is you write

1869
02:51:51.760 --> 02:51:56.720
explicitly you push in the glass and jump in just what do you mean by that

1870
02:51:56.720 --> 02:52:00.279
Do you remember that today I can't remember that I can mean something completely

1871
02:52:00.279 --> 02:52:03.880
otherwise it may be anything but I can't answer what I meant

1872
02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:07.319
don't remember it is quite explicitly what is here what did you say

1873
02:52:07.319 --> 02:52:10.000
It is quite explicitly what stands here you agree with what one should

1874
02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:14.920
pushing in and jump in yes so clearly yes but that I understand but I can't

1875
02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:18.760
say that I share an opinion that you share that there would be someone reach

1876
02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:26.200
type of deed or so so I don't remember so much of it late

1877
02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:31.000
Prosecutors want to bring out page 368 in

1878
02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:37.120
proven eh and so the last two messages about man

1879
02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:41.920
can school down to them eh now you have said that dinero it is it is not you

1880
02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:47.439
Without this, Possession is then as Dinero writes eh but

1881
02:52:47.439 --> 02:52:51.880
Eh question is really like this because then Dinero writes you into the house and

1882
02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:57.120
Do not shoot outside it is, like a little in line with it like Dinero GS

1883
02:52:57.120 --> 02:53:02.720
So you wrote in Signal chat go a little earlier in the evening you agree

1884
02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:06.720
that no so it is not me who writes on that app so that I have

1885
02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:10.040
not written that and i don't agree that I have said that that

1886
02:53:10.040 --> 02:53:15.880
only is as I have said that is what applies with signal so it is a coincidence then

1887
02:53:15.880 --> 02:53:21.479
that someone who calls themselves almost the same as you on signal thus Dinero here

1888
02:53:21.479 --> 02:53:27.960
at session writes that one should go into a house and do not shoot outside at the same time

1889
02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:34.359
as you have written on signal that you should push into the glass and jump in thus

1890
02:53:34.359 --> 02:53:39.680
It is not at the same time where there are two there are two yes there are two different times and

1891
02:53:39.680 --> 02:53:45.080
Then I also want to say Dinero is not an unusual name it is quite common

1892
02:53:45.080 --> 02:53:48.960
It means money in Spanish so I would not say it is random that

1893
02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:52.840
or that it is no coincidence I can't see it but I can see that it is not so

1894
02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:57.080
highly likely that it is the same person no for many can call it so that

1895
02:53:57.080 --> 02:54:01.080
Depends yes, of course, many can call it it I understand but in

1896
02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:06.680
the context so it sounds like it is like about the same plane as it

1897
02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:10.880
written as a friend I would not on no I would not claim friend a little like that

1898
02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:18.600
is written as in chat go where you go away that you have written that you should jump in

1899
02:54:18.600 --> 02:54:23.640
At the same time as yours down and writes like this in session it sounds a bit like the same

1900
02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:27.200
plan no I would not say that I have not written that you are going to

1901
02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:31.120
In any house and shoot I have not written that what is written in

1902
02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:35.479
session so that no I would not perceive it as the same context and

1903
02:54:35.479 --> 02:54:41.160
It's so long intervals in these times so I can't say that

1904
02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:47.279
am i no okay thank you i stop m thanks so much r hf have you any questions some

1905
02:54:47.279 --> 02:54:51.279
get left only you have answered a lot now that you hear what i say m yes what

1906
02:54:51.279 --> 02:54:54.239
good you can say if it is hard to hear I was going to start with this

1907
02:54:54.239 --> 02:54:57.600
After all, we have looked at it a few times where you see the plaintiff

1908
02:54:57.600 --> 02:55:04.040
name and address yes ehm and then just because it should be clear you say you

1909
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:07.319
had searched this because you were curious and we know you have printed

1910
02:55:07.319 --> 02:55:11.800
On Mister Koll link ehm what is it exactly you searched on will

1911
02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:17.800
you remember that eh I remember that I searched at the address regarding the people etc. and

1912
02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:24.200
then i had searched eh on just these as well as google man google it as

1913
02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:28.399
You have copied and then I google it and then there will be a link and so

1914
02:55:28.399 --> 02:55:31.880
If you press Mr Call you see the person so it's just I wanted to see who

1915
02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:35.560
it was mm okay but but v what did you write into google just so that it is clear

1916
02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:39.560
did you enter the names you had been allowed to send you or the address eh I wrote

1917
02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:43.960
only the address okay etc. yes but it seems to be true with what is in

1918
02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:47.560
The phone also since I follow the prosecutor's hearing I should say so that

1919
02:55:47.560 --> 02:55:51.160
I have put in some questions so it could be a little bit strange order about it

1920
02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:55.279
jumps but then everyone understands why I was going to ask you this balcony that

1921
02:55:55.279 --> 02:56:01.600
You have recorded a movie on EH that says reply Larsbergsvägen seven do you know

1922
02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:07.279
which which balcony the balcony the police have filmed from

1923
02:56:07.279 --> 02:56:12.160
Do you know which balcony it is yes what I recognize it so I

1924
02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:16.399
Don't see I don't usually be on the balcony itself but I recognize that it is

1925
02:56:16.399 --> 02:56:20.080
my area where I live and I recognize that it is building etc. and then is mine

1926
02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:24.840
Ask how to get to the balcony I can I know so I think it is

1927
02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:29.239
That you go up and then you have to go straight out in the corridor where I live and

1928
02:56:29.239 --> 02:56:32.960
So then surely you so so swing out a balcony where it is a public balcony

1929
02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:37.479
yes exactly it is no balcony you go through your apartment tk no no okay

1930
02:56:37.479 --> 02:56:40.600
And do you know if you say you don't usually be there but how common is it to

1931
02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:45.520
that people are there at all very common there are many who usually go hanging out

1932
02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:49.560
where there are many people who usually be where people go there because that is

1933
02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:53.760
the purpose of it is to be able to go there and and be able to smoke for

1934
02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:57.760
that there are no balconies in our apartments that we live okay etc. and then

1935
02:56:57.760 --> 02:57:01.319
usually there are also a lot of people where there are usually young people it usually is

1936
02:57:01.319 --> 02:57:08.120
people there and yes, etc. I was going to ask you too about session eh now we have you I have

1937
02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:13.920
received a lot of questions about it and we have eh yes we have received your answers to that

1938
02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:19.200
ehm you say you have used the session then even if it was not so frequent etc.

1939
02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:25.200
How to choose your name on session when downloading the app you can choose

1940
02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:30.920
and so start session It's like s one round as well as one as well as session

1941
02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:35.520
If you download the app, you start a session that is, a one -time

1942
02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:40.040
use mm and then you can set your name m but that's just the name you

1943
02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:42.800
Setting you not setting any email address or telephone num then when you

1944
02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:48.160
V has set it so you get a unique ID etc. and then you usually copy that ID: t

1945
02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:52.160
And then they add you through what you do not add through the name and then once you have

1946
02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:55.880
got id and you get a person so sometimes the person's name stands and then you set

1947
02:57:55.880 --> 02:57:59.319
self in what you want that person to be called as well you can change m if we

1948
02:57:59.319 --> 02:58:02.319
says you start a new session then as you call if you are going to chat with someone

1949
02:58:02.319 --> 02:58:06.520
Other MM do you have the same username as I'm not talking about the user for it

1950
02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:10.479
is something else but this name yes the username as in this case

1951
02:58:10.479 --> 02:58:14.640
Then the Niro has the same username if you start a new

1952
02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:17.720
session or you choose a new no you choose a new okay so for each

1953
02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:21.479
chat so you can choose to be called the same thing or anything else one might be called

1954
02:58:21.479 --> 02:58:25.399
how much you want whatever ok okay and is there any obstacle to that

1955
02:58:25.399 --> 02:58:30.200
Several people have the same username no there is no obstacle

1956
02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:35.479
No, since this I have already stated and I think we at least

1957
02:58:35.479 --> 02:58:39.640
There is a PM that I showed Sakam Consignment Visis regarding how one has

1958
02:58:39.640 --> 02:58:45.239
timed different messages in signal and in session and based on that we have

1959
02:58:45.239 --> 02:58:51.960
interpreted it that the time stated the time when a message was received in a

1960
02:58:51.960 --> 02:58:56.000
Phone etc. and then the police have then tried to puzzle these different

1961
02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:59.640
the cats there is something you want to say about it about this order of time

1962
02:58:59.640 --> 02:59:04.640
beyond what I have shown in my case yesterday yes eh I would like to

1963
02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:08.520
Make it eh to bring it out on the screen these time stamps I know

1964
02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:13.600
Not but it is these stamps that apply in the compilation so several are

1965
02:59:13.600 --> 02:59:19.000
times erroneous m eh compared to what one sees the raw material and so it is also

1966
02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:22.880
much of what is found in one phone compared to the other is not true

1967
02:59:22.880 --> 02:59:26.600
agreed with the time they have come and so there are many gaps in between so that

1968
02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:31.200
It is hard to say what time what exact things have sent mm yes

1969
02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:36.399
If we say this chat go then or go eh go or go on signal there is going

1970
02:59:36.399 --> 02:59:39.680
you you have been with it has been sent more messages than those who

1971
02:59:39.680 --> 02:59:44.359
is in the protocol so do you know remember yes it has the mm you sometimes see it as

1972
02:59:44.359 --> 02:59:48.279
Empty squares between different meanings Yes what have you been sent pictures or

1973
02:59:48.279 --> 02:59:52.160
Message you can you can say why it is Tomar Rute as far as you know eh I can

1974
02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:57.160
interpret it as being a message that has not been recreated and so possibly

1975
02:59:57.160 --> 03:00:00.479
maybe some picture there but most are means that have not recreated therefore

1976
03:00:00.479 --> 03:00:06.160
will it be an inch box okay and how maybe a little speculation from your side but can

1977
03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:10.120
you come up with something special that does not exist or or how it affects

1978
03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:15.600
The understanding of the chat yes I can come up with something special it is

1979
03:00:15.600 --> 03:00:20.359
regarding certain questions and things I have written in relation to connection with

1980
03:00:20.359 --> 03:00:25.040
the chat and then I have received questions that do not even have as well as someone

1981
03:00:25.040 --> 03:00:29.120
In the case to do in the chat and so I have written and answered that question and

1982
03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:32.920
so it has become that it looks like it is in the same context but it is

1983
03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:36.840
not mm and then I showed on the screen case production svis that it

1984
03:00:36.840 --> 03:00:40.680
has been asked any question, for example, about where people live but the answer Lidingö is located

1985
03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:45.479
on top of mm ehm you know why it may have become so there is a pm you have

1986
03:00:45.479 --> 03:00:51.600
any other eh point of view why the funds may be in disarray yes yes it is

1987
03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:55.640
signal usually be so it takes time for things to arrive i can write a

1988
03:00:55.640 --> 03:00:59.279
thing and so, for example, another person can write one thing and then it will

1989
03:00:59.279 --> 03:01:03.880
sent them at the same time then maybe the means end up before or after and that is

1990
03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:08.160
not always that they end up in the correct order so that times can be random

1991
03:01:08.160 --> 03:01:13.680
selected or they can be difficult and set simply mm okay

1992
03:01:13.680 --> 03:01:19.880
Ehm yes then you got prosecutors and you eh in the interrogation that prosecutor H talked a

1993
03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:23.399
part about the word step and then you said something that it can do a job

1994
03:01:23.399 --> 03:01:28.760
or step forward mm eh you can give some more specific example as you understand

1995
03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:32.560
Words step what can it mean more for the prosecutor claims it means it

1996
03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:35.960
here the shooting of course but can it mean anything else yes it can

1997
03:01:35.960 --> 03:01:42.520
that may mean that you should step forward simply eh it can mean step and

1998
03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:46.200
So it may have been a crime it may be something completely legal it can

1999
03:01:46.200 --> 03:01:50.319
Be anything so it is just step you should step forward etc. and you say

2000
03:01:50.319 --> 03:01:53.680
it may be something criminal like, for example, what it can in

2001
03:01:53.680 --> 03:01:57.800
bang Svis have something to go to step it means go on a robbery

2002
03:01:57.800 --> 03:02:02.040
something or step and do reach it may also have to do with just being able

2003
03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:06.279
Step forward and step forward on stage, for example, step it can be anything

2004
03:02:06.279 --> 03:02:09.319
It doesn't have to mean anything btig mm okay

2005
03:02:09.319 --> 03:02:14.520
eh and since i don't have so many questions left now san i was going to ask you eh

2006
03:02:14.520 --> 03:02:18.960
Prosecutors showed this Snapchat conversation and the first thing I want

2007
03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:23.120
Ask you is snapchat what do you usually use it for what what what is used

2008
03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:27.720
Snapchat to basically the bottom used snapchat to

2009
03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:33.399
chat with friends and write with people you know and people you just have ordinary

2010
03:02:33.399 --> 03:02:38.200
contact with and then it may also be that man you have

2011
03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:42.960
Contact with so you sometimes wanted to choose how to set up and have your chats

2012
03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:47.120
And the chat thus snapchat is built for the message to disappear by themselves

2013
03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:51.640
Irself it is so it is called it is obvious therefore so that yes but it is after all

2014
03:02:51.640 --> 03:02:57.000
usually for friends and stuff mm and is it both pictures and eh text or is it

2015
03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:00.960
Most text it is pictures and text you can snapchat Send pictures you can write

2016
03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:05.880
Text etc. I wonder just like the prosecutor because the first means that

2017
03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:11.080
Seems to write here is chill then in the car and then I wondered you have you have eh as

2018
03:03:11.080 --> 03:03:15.680
The prosecutor may be interpreted in my opinion received a video while sitting in the car on someone

2019
03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:18.800
other platform and then I wonder at least if you had got something on snapchat

2020
03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:24.279
some picture or similar from a car yes, so maybe yes I remember maybe

2021
03:03:24.279 --> 03:03:27.920
that I may have received some snap I usually open people who send snaps

2022
03:03:27.920 --> 03:03:31.080
And pictures and videos you open a snap and then you send back and then

2023
03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:35.960
maybe it can turn over to chat with each other etc. and how will

2024
03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:40.080
it was that eh man says something about for me to

2025
03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:42.279
it is you who write what I do not remember now or if you get it to

2026
03:03:42.279 --> 03:03:46.399
I think you write a question about goose question the driver about goose which you say

2027
03:03:46.399 --> 03:03:49.880
Probably to cannabis how will it say you write about cannabis here

2028
03:03:49.880 --> 03:03:52.600
I think it is you who writes it so s so it is probably because

2029
03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:55.920
It was about someone wanting to smoke you were smoking for it and

2030
03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:59.640
Then I said but ask the driver that you have resolved or so it may have been that

2031
03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:03.279
is all about but how do you remember how you knew it because I can't say that

2032
03:04:03.279 --> 03:04:08.120
There is something written about no I can then it I remember so he had it

2033
03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:12.800
The person who writes to me has said that you wanted you wanted to smoke and then

2034
03:04:12.800 --> 03:04:16.640
had I certainly written yes but ask this one who drives the car about it or he who

2035
03:04:16.640 --> 03:04:22.000
will resolve on which if we are talking about signal session fast on which on which

2036
03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.279
Forum has that person in that case written something about Eh Canabis for there is

2037
03:04:26.279 --> 03:04:30.200
after all no messages about it yes no but it is obviously safe on snap that

2038
03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:33.560
I print about it okay so you mean then there are other messages on

2039
03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:37.239
snap that not yes that has not recreated it is normal but that oh when I

2040
03:04:37.239 --> 03:04:40.840
writing something to you and you write something to me about about the chat itself

2041
03:04:40.840 --> 03:04:44.640
Disappear a lot then it is difficult to recreate everything then it becomes one such

2042
03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:48.479
The Message of Space so you don't see the whole chat

2043
03:04:48.479 --> 03:04:56.040
Okay okay but then i'm done there thanks etc. someone else defends should ask questions

2044
03:04:56.040 --> 03:05:05.680
thanks no more questions from they complain no thanks no no then is the company

2045
03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:13.680
completed so f prosecutor ask questions yes thought to hear with you first if you want

2046
03:05:13.680 --> 03:05:17.880

2048
03:05:24.359 --> 03:05:29.760
to convey a car deal in my opinion then mm and reason for that

2049
03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:33.800
is because I am basically the seller as I sell cars both

2050
03:05:33.800 --> 03:05:39.840
privately and at work then and knowledgeable within the car in the council then so I would go there

2051
03:05:39.840 --> 03:05:43.760
help to convey this deal it is not my car I do not own it

2052
03:05:43.760 --> 03:05:49.200
But I'll be there and support as well as a friend wrote to me that there is

2053
03:05:49.200 --> 03:05:52.840
a car there in Kungssängen you can just go and check it out for it has

2054
03:05:52.840 --> 03:05:58.680
Not been able to start I said absolutely I go there so I check and the car go

2055
03:05:58.680 --> 03:06:02.920
Not and start then so I get started it uploads the battery eh tanks it

2056
03:06:02.920 --> 03:06:06.680
and check that all documents and stuff are in the car in the hand compartment for one

2057
03:06:06.680 --> 03:06:11.880
Sales and then my friend writes to me that perfect eh there will a guy

2058
03:06:11.880 --> 03:06:16.080
There who is then responsible for the deal itself should only be there and

2059
03:06:16.080 --> 03:06:20.120
So convey help with the car in case there would be any questions about

2060
03:06:20.120 --> 03:06:25.560
inspection protocols or something that has tubes with the car dealer then eh so this one

2061
03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:30.439
The guy comes in I don't know him and eh we sit in the car and will

2062
03:06:30.439 --> 03:06:33.439
Start ride I know it should be somewhere in southern Stockholm I have

2063
03:06:33.439 --> 03:06:39.080
not received any address or any exact position there and we barely be able to ride in

2064
03:06:39.080 --> 03:06:42.439
A few minutes from Kungssängen We are almost on the rot to the motorway there

2065
03:06:42.439 --> 03:06:45.840
So he says fuck my mobile has died as can I can borrow your phones

2066
03:06:45.840 --> 03:06:51.120
Absolutely no problems and it was then in order to talk to our common friend

2067
03:06:51.120 --> 03:06:55.920
eh so he takes the phone where we little buzz as well as a little I don't feel

2068
03:06:55.920 --> 03:07:00.399
him so we just talk a little about public things eh we go there on the road

2069
03:07:00.399 --> 03:07:03.760
He has my phone all the time he is not sitting and like constant

2070
03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:07.120
the chat but he has access to it so he has it by his side i h

2071
03:07:07.120 --> 03:07:12.640
I don't have my phone during that time eh so he sees turn off here go here go

2072
03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:17.040
there and guides me as well as to the place we are going to eh we come

2073
03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:21.680
up to a parking there are two people where eh we go out I like

2074
03:07:21.680 --> 03:07:26.239
cheering on them hi hi eh so i stand there with this guy then the other two

2075
03:07:26.239 --> 03:07:31.399
the people eh I show the guy that I came with then as well as thought that

2076
03:07:31.399 --> 03:07:33.800
explain this with the key it is a little special because it stood in

2077
03:07:33.800 --> 03:07:38.520
the preliminary investigation where the police have not succeeded in starting the car eh because it

2078
03:07:38.520 --> 03:07:43.160
has been missing any key as well as the key part itself the metal bit there but the car

2079
03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:48.600
can be started even with the key it is thus those from that year model has

2080
03:07:48.600 --> 03:07:52.160
Like a chip in the plastic piece itself that can be read then is not necessary

2081
03:07:52.160 --> 03:07:56.399
metal loop to start the car so I showed him like that

2082
03:07:56.399 --> 03:08:01.160
So I was there maybe Max I think we arrived where we somewhere 2110 and

2083
03:08:01.160 --> 03:08:05.920
I pulled we kind of 2130 there and sometime during that period I also went away

2084
03:08:05.920 --> 03:08:10.080
and smoked a cigarette it was the fimp you found there on site

2085
03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:14.760
ehm so it was like we walked I walked around the car just show him the one I

2086
03:08:14.760 --> 03:08:19.359
didn't talk much about the other two people since then I said that as is

2087
03:08:19.359 --> 03:08:23.520
Obviously I can go you need someone more so do you have

2088
03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:27.960
some more questions as well as how the change of ownership should go to and so

2089
03:08:27.960 --> 03:08:30.960
Furthermore, he said no it is clear as I said perfectly and he had after all

2090
03:08:30.960 --> 03:08:36.080
Still my phone throughout this time ehm so I say perfectly okay

2091
03:08:36.080 --> 03:08:40.000
But then I go like then he said yes but we we book a taxi like this as thanks

2092
03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.640
For the help I guess something I said perfectly my car was left in

2093
03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:44.920
The king's bed you saw that I had paid for a parking there in

2094
03:08:44.920 --> 03:08:49.239
Kungssängen It was my car I parked there eh so he says yes but

2095
03:08:49.239 --> 03:08:52.479
The taxi is on the road so I perfect you should follow along and we will go back

2096
03:08:52.479 --> 03:08:56.279
or, like the deal, should lock what is going to happen

2097
03:08:56.279 --> 03:09:00.960
Eh i so i didn't think so much about how the deal should go to it is

2098
03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:04.439
after all not my car I am not responsible for the purchase price or sell the sum I would

2099
03:09:04.439 --> 03:09:07.520
just be there and help and answer any questions in case that would

2100
03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:11.640
come out something eh so he says no but there will then a car a friend to

2101
03:09:11.640 --> 03:09:15.439
pick me up and now I don't know if that's the car there was information in

2102
03:09:15.439 --> 03:09:18.640
the phen there that it would have come to someone where Nissan to the scene after

2103
03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:22.760
I have left I cannot answer whether it is it or or not as he

2104
03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:25.840
mean but he said he no any friend comes and pick me like that

2105
03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:30.000
the one who is going to sign the change of ownership and then comes so fine okay as well as

2106
03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:34.080
It does not concern me eh he says yes but the taxi comes from this address it

2107
03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:38.800
Located a little further down it is just go there as well so will say okay thanks took

2108
03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:44.760
My phone starts walking back to or to taxi where it should pick up

2109
03:09:44.760 --> 03:09:48.319
me like going a little wrong i don't really find but i found out after all

2110
03:09:48.319 --> 03:09:52.160
In the end, well took me maybe a 10 11 minutes and go that distance to the taxi

2111
03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:56.560
and eh as soon as i get back my phone then i start talking to

2112
03:09:56.560 --> 03:10:00.840
our mutual friend as well and he says yes but swisha lady reach a hundred like it

2113
03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:05.960
With you looked there and then, yes it certainly so the lady is she is so on so on

2114
03:10:05.960 --> 03:10:11.439
Signal like it's a nickname if you say so eh so I swish someone

2115
03:10:11.439 --> 03:10:14.960
hundred assumed yes but it was well for the taxi or something like it was

2116
03:10:14.960 --> 03:10:20.840
For the taxi when eh sets me the taxi goes all the way back to Kungssängen and

2117
03:10:20.840 --> 03:10:25.000
So after I got back the phone so no message will

2118
03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:29.640
is nothing that you have seen so like so far I have not even been able to

2119
03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:33.880
get the least little suspicion that something criminal even should happen this was after all

2120
03:10:33.880 --> 03:10:37.399
Like a completely normal day in my life thus selling a car for me is after all

2121
03:10:37.399 --> 03:10:41.720
Like how to say drinking a glass of water for one for anyone I

2122
03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:44.840
do it constantly i always on with cars and car parts and convey

2123
03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:49.319
business because I am customer in that area as well as so people want me in

2124
03:10:49.319 --> 03:10:53.960
A car shop eh I go back to pick up my car and

2125
03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:57.479
That's all I know about that thing as I have not been there in

2126
03:10:57.479 --> 03:11:03.399
More than 20 minutes so it's the 14th what you know is what you can if it yes

2127
03:11:03.399 --> 03:11:10.680
just about what concerns this then like ok I understand but you were good eh just

2128
03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:17.279
any control question at what you told us now for what what you said told now v

2129
03:11:17.279 --> 03:11:21.399
so that I understood you it was this person who went with you from

2130
03:11:21.399 --> 03:11:25.479
Kungsängen it was he who ordered the taxi for you I don't know if it was he

2131
03:11:25.479 --> 03:11:29.120
who ordered with his name but it was he who arranged so that a taxi comes

2132
03:11:29.120 --> 03:11:36.640
and he who arranged okay then I take eh good eh as you understand so I have

2133
03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:41.880
Pretty many questions to you absolutely a question I think I put it directly

2134
03:11:41.880 --> 03:11:47.640
about it now if it is as you say why have you been silent the whole investigation

2135
03:11:47.640 --> 03:11:51.560
exactly I supposed that question would come and the reason is because it

2136
03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:55.520
is no secret what has happened to others sitting here in this room

2137
03:11:55.520 --> 03:12:01.080
today with their houses or families or similar yes eh you have also read on

2138
03:12:01.080 --> 03:12:04.279
Some when you have been out you hear what happens and

2139
03:12:04.279 --> 03:12:09.520
Eh I simply have, after all, I hoped that during the preliminary investigation

2140
03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:12.479
time that yes but soon it will be up they will be found soon they will

2141
03:12:12.479 --> 03:12:15.720
Investigate they do their job they will soon find this third person to and

2142
03:12:15.720 --> 03:12:20.200
with when a witness has said he has seen three people at the scene there after

2143
03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:23.800
That I have gone in a taxi that you see that I have traveled in, it is not like

2144
03:12:23.800 --> 03:12:28.479
investigated if yes but who was this third person then so i assumed yes but that

2145
03:12:28.479 --> 03:12:31.840
Coming well in the end now it didn't come out now I'm sitting here today so then

2146
03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:35.439
May I talk in a trial where it actually makes any difference but I have

2147
03:12:35.439 --> 03:12:40.239
not wanted to say me or say anything about any person who is not right that can

2148
03:12:40.239 --> 03:12:43.800
expose me or my family proceed you think it is easier perhaps for

2149
03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:48.080
the court to investigate this third person than for the police think you or

2150
03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:52.399
I understand the wrong one for the police told me that they have seen them

2151
03:12:52.399 --> 03:12:56.000
Have had a witness and so on who have said or so and then I assumed yes

2152
03:12:56.000 --> 03:13:00.200
But it comes out well I don't want to talk I don't want to be how should you

2153
03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:03.279
say I don't want to expose myself or my family at risk simply so I

2154
03:13:03.279 --> 03:13:09.520
Thinking that I say nothing then I understand you I think like this

2155
03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:18.439
eh san have you met him no danny i come will choose not to

2156
03:13:18.439 --> 03:13:21.960
pronounce me about any person in this goal of my own security and I

2157
03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:25.640
Feel free to respond to what you think I have done or not done but I will

2158
03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:28.600
not want to comment on whether I feel or do not know or have

2159
03:13:28.600 --> 03:13:32.040
met or has not met any other person but you understand that it

2160
03:13:32.040 --> 03:13:36.279
will have some significance who you have met and which you have had contact

2161
03:13:36.279 --> 03:13:39.200
With I will have to ask the questions it understands you what no

2162
03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:43.640
But that I absolutely understand and I think district court must pull their

2163
03:13:43.640 --> 03:13:47.399
own conclusions of course i have met two people at that place i

2164
03:13:47.399 --> 03:13:50.479
get there with one person and i have met two other people on this one

2165
03:13:50.479 --> 03:13:54.359
the parking who it is how they look or as if I know them or

2166
03:13:54.359 --> 03:13:58.359
Not so I won't answer but I don't know anyone in this goal so so

2167
03:13:58.359 --> 03:14:05.399
a lot I can say okay then I understand who is mixtape since mixtape is as said

2168
03:14:05.399 --> 03:14:08.600
I will not go into name no I understand I will not say who it

2169
03:14:08.600 --> 03:14:13.880
is but it is a friend of me yes and you your defender took up as one of those

2170
03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:17.600
most important parts that I perceive his for I

2171
03:14:17.600 --> 03:14:21.960
may probably misunderstand but eh for your defense it was that you have no

2172
03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:27.239
criminal socializing okay and and you don't have any such connection to anyone

2173
03:14:27.239 --> 03:14:33.120
criminal organization and so on how about mixtape he has it it gets

2174
03:14:33.120 --> 03:14:38.000
So he must stand for that because I should not say that I could not in

2175
03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:41.720
my wildest imagination if I am to be honest imagine that he commits like this

2176
03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:46.439
crime certainly i know this guy he smokes on he can drug he can do

2177
03:14:46.439 --> 03:14:49.319
stupidity but that he would sit and plan murder

2178
03:14:49.319 --> 03:14:52.920
eh and i don't say it is he either I don't know as it depends

2179
03:14:52.920 --> 03:14:56.080
on the investigation but that it comes up that he is involved in such stuff

2180
03:14:56.080 --> 03:15:00.640
is yes it is shocking to me as well as yes he is involved in any gang it can

2181
03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:04.200
I don't answer no you know or do you want no because I don't know that

2182
03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:10.439
Like it he himself stands for then grasps and what about the foxtrot

2183
03:15:10.439 --> 03:15:15.080
The network What do you know if it is a network as a criminal

2184
03:15:15.080 --> 03:15:21.120
Network etc. Have you have any connection to any idea no you have contacts that

2185
03:15:21.120 --> 03:15:25.399
is related to it no and then I also want to add when you mention this

2186
03:15:25.399 --> 03:15:29.319
With that they find signal that there would have been some contacts that

2187
03:15:29.319 --> 03:15:34.880
have, like log of a fox or f or yes fox interest then general and signal

2188
03:15:34.880 --> 03:15:38.760
works in the way that if I have phone numbers in mine in my mobile phone

2189
03:15:38.760 --> 03:15:42.560
So the telephone contacts themselves then and I download for example then but

2190
03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:47.640
WhatsApp or signal and so on about any of these phone numbs in my

2191
03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:51.720
Phone list is coupled then or has an account in WhatsApp or signal so

2192
03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:57.960
Thus, they automatically end up in signal in the contact list itself there so that thus

2193
03:15:57.960 --> 03:16:01.279
I have had the same sim card went like in six we talk 10 years s that

2194
03:16:01.279 --> 03:16:05.000
Here may have been numbers that I had there for friends that I felt for

2195
03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:10.399
ti year S which then has a signal contact number that is then in my signal list so

2196
03:16:10.399 --> 03:16:13.880
All those contacts are not contacts that I have chatted with no but I

2197
03:16:13.880 --> 03:16:19.359
understands but it is, after all, you know what after that there is a

2198
03:16:19.359 --> 03:16:28.120
A number who have just symbol for the FXST Network M in your contact list Yes

2199
03:16:28.120 --> 03:16:32.760
and i wonder again are you involved in some way i'm not involved on

2200
03:16:32.760 --> 03:16:38.800
some way no but also when we agree that this is your phone we have

2201
03:16:38.800 --> 03:16:44.399
looked at yes and that it is you like ÄL Hamilton on signal it is also correct

2202
03:16:44.399 --> 03:16:50.520
va for a limited time of the current date yes etc. during which time when it

2203
03:16:50.520 --> 03:16:57.600
Be well when we left Kungsängen that I have seen now should be around 8 8 pm

2204
03:16:57.600 --> 03:17:02.279
where somewhere if we start going there he prays for my phone then I get back

2205
03:17:02.279 --> 03:17:07.840
The phone when I leave this parking was somewhere 2135 there

2206
03:17:07.840 --> 03:17:13.800
somewhere i would think tell you a little then this person

2207
03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:19.439
that jumps into your car it was a close friend of you or I don't know him

2208
03:17:19.439 --> 03:17:22.680
I haven't met him since before but it was my friend who wrote that one

2209
03:17:22.680 --> 03:17:28.080
guy will accompany you mm and eh yes so it is a friend's friend as you are

2210
03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:33.040
the good trough as well as you remember who it was who said

2211
03:17:33.040 --> 03:17:37.760
that a guy would accompany you it was this al in then al in was it he

2212
03:17:37.760 --> 03:17:42.199
who said it yes that a guy is accompanied by you yes that should be as well as responsible for

2213
03:17:42.199 --> 03:17:46.439
soul thus how should I explain my role in the whole I do not know if he is

2214
03:17:46.439 --> 03:17:50.120
owner of a car or not but he should have as well as contact with the buyers he shall have

2215
03:17:50.120 --> 03:17:54.000
contact with the whole thing he needs just some guidance and as I said I

2216
03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:58.920
Can this and Alin know that I can do this, etc., etc. my most contact with

2217
03:17:58.920 --> 03:18:03.199
these aliases and the kind of cars so the most we I

2218
03:18:03.199 --> 03:18:08.800
engages with mm so that å in tells you that it will accompany you one

2219
03:18:08.800 --> 03:18:12.680
guy from Kungsängen exactly there was also somewhere in the chat that he is

2220
03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:19.399
there if 15 yes i think it does it eh and it's not we don't talk about it

2221
03:18:19.399 --> 03:18:24.160
here the guy who will put the key on the deck then to hand over it to

2222
03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:27.479
you so because it says too with the tatters yes it stood where the key was lying on

2223
03:18:27.479 --> 03:18:31.880
the deck but it wasn't him for as I saw it if I remember right now so

2224
03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:36.760
he wrote that after I have been there already yes why would the key lie

2225
03:18:36.760 --> 03:18:41.560
on the deck if you were to have the owner with you I don't know anyone had well

2226
03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:45.000
CY has well used the car, so as I said, I was not so familiar with themselves

2227
03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:49.680
The car I don't have anyone to the car I will be at the car and help with that deal and

2228
03:18:49.680 --> 03:18:52.840
It was like a yes but see it as a service I have, as they have helped

2229
03:18:52.840 --> 03:18:57.239
me before if i'm not available and so damn there is a car part like me

2230
03:18:57.239 --> 03:19:00.120
need you can go to buy it for me quickly just yes, of course he has

2231
03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:02.880
no one control what it should be used for or what it should be done with it but

2232
03:19:02.880 --> 03:19:06.359
it is a car part like it is none it is nothing suspicious so i get none

2233
03:19:06.359 --> 03:19:09.800
question marks like n when he asks me it's not the first time i help

2234
03:19:09.800 --> 03:19:15.199
to convey a deal no what is it v what is it that is

2235
03:19:15.199 --> 03:19:19.439
Your role I don't really realize I should be totally honest with it so understand

2236
03:19:19.439 --> 03:19:22.199
I also not my role now when I see all this but my role such as I

2237
03:19:22.199 --> 03:19:26.520
perceived then it was that I should help to convey a car I will I will

2238
03:19:26.520 --> 03:19:32.000
drive the car there and now in retrospect so I can see it as that as I said I

2239
03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:35.600
is not a criminal person I have not judged since before I have none so

2240
03:19:35.600 --> 03:19:38.800
called span I have no phone interception I have nothing like that

2241
03:19:38.800 --> 03:19:42.479
That this whole thing may have been a game to access my phone

2242
03:19:42.479 --> 03:19:47.239
to a number that is not how should one say wanted or scouted

2243
03:19:47.239 --> 03:19:51.040
or some kind of connection to any gang m so that it may be that yes but

2244
03:19:51.040 --> 03:19:55.439
Armando has a pure name because he uses him etc. blame on a car shop

2245
03:19:55.439 --> 03:20:00.640
But use the phone number instead it yes so what you mean that this whole thing

2246
03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:04.880
the arrangement it was for you to go up there and hand over your phone to

2247
03:20:04.880 --> 03:20:09.199
this guy probably a part of the whole thing has been that he should have

2248
03:20:09.199 --> 03:20:14.439
Access to my phone yes mm

2249
03:20:14.439 --> 03:20:20.399
and if you now meet a guy you've never met before and you leave

2250
03:20:20.399 --> 03:20:25.160
over a phone why why do you leave it in one and a half

2251
03:20:25.160 --> 03:20:29.479
hour it so there when you say it so I understand how it sounds but

2252
03:20:29.479 --> 03:20:32.160
If one thinks yourself then in the situation as well as a friend writing

2253
03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:35.040
to you yes but you I have a friend where you are going to help and convey a

2254
03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:38.960
car dealer he he accompanies you as well as alright he sits in the car and we

2255
03:20:38.960 --> 03:20:42.439
Like we start to go and he says then damn my nap then I can borrow your

2256
03:20:42.439 --> 03:20:46.600
Mm mm a little scary and say no you may not borrow my you can do it as well

2257
03:20:46.600 --> 03:20:49.560
No where it was a normal thing yes, of course, but it is

2258
03:20:49.560 --> 03:20:54.080
Obviously you do but I think you are also you have been with a few years in

2259
03:20:54.080 --> 03:20:57.640
All cases then when you borrow a phone, you leave it back

2260
03:20:57.640 --> 03:21:02.000
after type three minutes not after an hour and 35 no but it wasn't that

2261
03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:05.279
he like was constantly on the handset it wasn't that he didn't need

2262
03:21:05.279 --> 03:21:09.199
my phone i h on driving a car like what I see that you also see what

2263
03:21:09.199 --> 03:21:13.359
it is called on these telephone mast connectivity stuff thus as you have

2264
03:21:13.359 --> 03:21:16.880
As you have checked from that moment that I give him the phone

2265
03:21:16.880 --> 03:21:20.479
Until I get back it this one and a half hour there is, after all

2266
03:21:20.479 --> 03:21:24.319
no one as well as personal ties to the phone except the phone has

2267
03:21:24.319 --> 03:21:28.319
connected in some places there is no bankid or snapchat or

2268
03:21:28.319 --> 03:21:31.960
similar that only I as well as can have access to and then the second after

2269
03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:36.040
or minutes after i get back the phone then i switch up to bankid

2270
03:21:36.040 --> 03:21:39.640
And to Swish and the like and then you can also ask the question that if

2271
03:21:39.640 --> 03:21:44.120
I had now known what is going to happen what, like what is happening not to happen

2272
03:21:44.120 --> 03:21:48.279
In order to do some professionals on how police officers are investigating and doing things but something you

2273
03:21:48.279 --> 03:21:51.000
Then maybe already know is that yes but they look up well as you have

2274
03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:54.359
connected with BankID and such how smart is it to, as well as connect

2275
03:21:54.359 --> 03:21:59.239
to Swish and BankID minute after in the same place it could be

2276
03:21:59.239 --> 03:22:02.800
so also that you have chosen to be silent during the preliminary investigation and then waiting

2277
03:22:02.800 --> 03:22:07.040
And so reads and finds a story and adapt to the evidence so

2278
03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:11.640
could it be too it is a hypothesis that you have yes yes you we

2279
03:22:11.640 --> 03:22:16.640
continues forward a little eh he gets the phone about when you leave

2280
03:22:16.640 --> 03:22:21.840
Kungsängen M and he has it late when is it when is it you get

2281
03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:30.359
back on 2135 30 reach eh and where was somewhere

2282
03:22:30.359 --> 03:22:36.479
are you then in this parking lot in the parking lot along with whom with it

2283
03:22:36.479 --> 03:22:39.680
the person who accompanied me and two other people we met on the spot

2284
03:22:39.680 --> 03:22:44.080
Yes so we are four in total on site and have you signed under owners

2285
03:22:44.080 --> 03:22:46.960
the evidence and so then or no I explained to him about everything how

2286
03:22:46.960 --> 03:22:50.840
It should go to how it is to be done and everything as well as what he needed help

2287
03:22:50.840 --> 03:22:54.000
with he asked his questions I answered his questions and then I packed and

2288
03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:59.840
pulled like but then when you describe this either so have

2289
03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:03.840
he has driven it too or he is, like almost a little behind if he

2290
03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:09.120
don't know how to make a car dealer yes probably so he is like that

2291
03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:12.800
not everyone knows how a car dealer goes to either then that I have

2292
03:23:12.800 --> 03:23:17.080
done so many are good for the merits then for as helping with and the one who

2293
03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:20.319
would buy the car it was these guys you met at the place it or

2294
03:23:20.319 --> 03:23:25.640
I don't know yes but you have to know you were just there for obvious

2295
03:23:25.640 --> 03:23:29.160
After all, they were involved in the car shop then if they were to stand on the car I don't know

2296
03:23:29.160 --> 03:23:31.920
He said they were waiting for someone to come with some car and that

2297
03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:35.840
were like people who would come people who would go it was I didn't understand

2298
03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:40.040
the whole arrangement my task was to go there as well as explain if it would occur

2299
03:23:40.040 --> 03:23:44.279
some questions answer them eh show him yes but like checking the papers there

2300
03:23:44.279 --> 03:23:51.359
in the car yes perfect mm and the guys are 14 and 16 and I I

2301
03:23:51.359 --> 03:23:55.279
claims that they look like they are 14 and 16 did you think it was a car business

2302
03:23:55.279 --> 03:23:59.439
With a 14 and 16 year old I thought, as I said, they would not stand for themselves

2303
03:23:59.439 --> 03:24:03.239
the car I supposed yes but someone will come he talked about that some car

2304
03:24:03.239 --> 03:24:07.760
would come to the place after I would have gone then and yes it was one

2305
03:24:07.760 --> 03:24:11.439
Cheap manual car It is a perfect example of an exercise choir car so it can

2306
03:24:11.439 --> 03:24:16.359
after all, they are in that direction as well, but I don't stand as well as praying

2307
03:24:16.359 --> 03:24:21.479
id card on so f it would have been my car that I will sell my car then absolutely

2308
03:24:21.479 --> 03:24:24.600
Then I had asked it is you who will stand for the car what is like and so

2309
03:24:24.600 --> 03:24:30.040
further as I said it's not my car I don't know who the buyer is no no so

2310
03:24:30.040 --> 03:24:35.160
that you are being asked by OL in and convey this deal understood it was so I

2311
03:24:35.160 --> 03:24:40.560
understood it right and he tells you that you should go with a person from above

2312
03:24:40.560 --> 03:24:46.720
Kungssängen down that person you lend a phone until you hit were some

2313
03:24:46.720 --> 03:24:50.640
guys you don't know if they are the ones to buy it but then after a while so say

2314
03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:54.439
you still that now is time for me to sit me and go across the whole town

2315
03:24:54.439 --> 03:24:59.680
again how come it up why would you leave there then it has just explained

2316
03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:03.880
It is because I went there shocked up so some questions I answered them

2317
03:25:03.880 --> 03:25:08.319
I explained to him how he does when this one then the buyer would come to

2318
03:25:08.319 --> 03:25:12.199
the place how you do which papers meaning what and the reason for

2319
03:25:12.199 --> 03:25:14.600
So was why I couldn't do it in Kungssängen it was because I

2320
03:25:14.600 --> 03:25:18.720
followed that in case there would arise any more questions if they should have

2321
03:25:18.720 --> 03:25:21.920
some questions at the service book or inspection as I perceived it

2322
03:25:21.920 --> 03:25:25.199
Seems like it wasn't the plan from the beginning then because you don't wait

2323
03:25:25.199 --> 03:25:28.640
on the fact that the buyer comes I mean it was because I have already explained to

2324
03:25:28.640 --> 03:25:34.120
him how everything goes to mm and you couldn't why was it then you didn't

2325
03:25:34.120 --> 03:25:38.399
could do it in Kungsängen sorry you said you explained why you couldn't do

2326
03:25:38.399 --> 03:25:42.960
It was in Kungssängen it was if new questions arise etc. yes but how

2327
03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:46.520
Do you know that there would be no new questions when the buyer well in place

2328
03:25:46.520 --> 03:25:50.680
questions from the one who came with me in the car so if he were to come

2329
03:25:50.680 --> 03:25:53.359
on something and think that yes but just this how do you do this no but

2330
03:25:53.359 --> 03:25:56.560
We go where I follow you and then we fix everything then I will be

2331
03:25:56.560 --> 03:26:00.199
completely honest I don't know as if the guy has a driver's license or not so it can

2332
03:26:00.199 --> 03:26:05.520
been a part there too that I should drive so there is no idea if you thought

2333
03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:10.479
you it was tidy and good looking car or no I wouldn't say condition

2334
03:26:10.479 --> 03:26:15.120
and is sold yes when when that price range absolutely you do not count you buy a

2335
03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:19.199
Rollsroyce as well as would be sold for no clue but there may have been no more

2336
03:26:19.199 --> 03:26:23.479
than five six 7000 bucks I think they are well there somewhere would you

2337
03:26:23.479 --> 03:26:28.239
pick up something elsewhere up in Kungsängs area up in around

2338
03:26:28.239 --> 03:26:31.880
Kungssängen Yes Yes It is good that you mention it this thing that you

2339
03:26:31.880 --> 03:26:36.600
Talked about before that toy would have stood for weapons then all this so

2340
03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:40.439
Here I can definitely understand what it looks like in this context I fully understand

2341
03:26:40.439 --> 03:26:43.199
and held and that he has written toy I get very annoyed by

2342
03:26:43.199 --> 03:26:47.520
Now in retrospect that you dry toy as a weapon but it is not strange in

2343
03:26:47.520 --> 03:26:51.520
the context but that thing I picked up in bro it is a whole other thing that

2344
03:26:51.520 --> 03:26:55.279
We talk if you have nothing with the car itself to make toy it he

2345
03:26:55.279 --> 03:26:59.199
mean by toy we talk about small chip boox that you trim mopeds and

2346
03:26:59.199 --> 03:27:03.720
Motorcycles thus cars and so on toy as well as yes it will be a toy it

2347
03:27:03.720 --> 03:27:07.760
Yes, internal slang words then called between me and him and some to in it

2348
03:27:07.760 --> 03:27:12.840
the circuit I went to Bro to pick up this chipboard

2349
03:27:16.359 --> 03:27:21.560
mm so that I have not brought anything into the car when I have

2350
03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:27.359
gone no i understand eh so this toy stayed up in your car on

2351
03:27:27.359 --> 03:27:34.160
Bergsvägen just then I understand you I just think like this

2352
03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:39.439
Then why don't you go two cars n to Jordbro you should home since why take

2353
03:27:39.439 --> 03:27:45.120
Why don't you go both thn and your car down to

2354
03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:50.279
Jordbro It is one that I would say it is an irrelevant question how to

2355
03:27:50.279 --> 03:27:53.279
Choosing to make a car deal so no I don't think it's an irrelevant

2356
03:27:53.279 --> 03:27:56.160
Ask I put it because I think it's relevant and I ask you to answer

2357
03:27:56.160 --> 03:28:00.120
The question why do you not go two cars because we go there there will be no deal so

2358
03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:03.640
If we go back a car becomes a deal, I take a taxi home so taxi and

2359
03:28:03.640 --> 03:28:06.399
gasoline diesel cost it is like it is the same as it is the same same

2360
03:28:06.399 --> 03:28:11.600
About you think it really yes what can the taxi cost 3,400 bucks

2361
03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:16.399
maybe like it is probably not exactly the same sum but that I usually

2362
03:28:16.399 --> 03:28:19.160
not ride two cars when i sell cars i will choose with you it will be a deal

2363
03:28:19.160 --> 03:28:22.120
So and either I ask the buyer yes but could I accompany you wherever

2364
03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:27.120
Should you or stose a taxi from there as well as that okay

2365
03:28:27.120 --> 03:28:31.680
Well then i understand

2366
03:28:32.800 --> 03:28:41.080
eh would you pick up something in Farstad on the road or no no Älmevägen in Farstad

2367
03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:45.600
no no that address was sent to me or in this group chat when I

2368
03:28:45.600 --> 03:28:49.239
Don't know were not meant to me because I had nothing to do there if I should

2369
03:28:49.239 --> 03:28:52.960
serious i don't know what that address was until then it comes out here that it

2370
03:28:52.960 --> 03:28:57.040
here the person who has written it then mm that he has had at the same time several

2371
03:28:57.040 --> 03:29:01.520
other chats active that I have not been to he has written in the wrong chat it

2372
03:29:01.520 --> 03:29:05.880
V I can't answer but no it's pretty malicious of him to log in as

2373
03:29:05.880 --> 03:29:10.560
you forgive it is quite malicious of him to log in as you and is brought

2374
03:29:10.560 --> 03:29:15.520
Like pretending you last this way he he goes into signal with your

2375
03:29:15.520 --> 03:29:18.560
name the person who accompanied me thus

2376
03:29:18.560 --> 03:29:26.160
Yes you are Jordbro we should see you have said that you do not want to answer the question of

2377
03:29:26.160 --> 03:29:30.760
it is then or danil you meet and danil you meet but

2378
03:29:31.080 --> 03:29:35.960
eh are you talking to them then as you didn't meet very much it was well hello

2379
03:29:35.960 --> 03:29:43.199
hello like mm mm mm what do you talk about, as I said, the cold talk so it was

2380
03:29:43.199 --> 03:29:47.600
no one like yes hi how are you yeah good i talked mostly to him who was

2381
03:29:47.600 --> 03:29:55.960
with me as well as mm and how was it you are at the address pagen 108 then

2382
03:29:55.960 --> 03:30:00.399
Eh why prime you don't take the taxi from there

2383
03:30:00.399 --> 03:30:03.640
It was not me who ordered the one he said it comes from there then I can

2384
03:30:03.640 --> 03:30:07.600
So I should hold on and just cheat just ne but v fuck yes book it book no

2385
03:30:07.600 --> 03:30:10.359
no but I am just trying to explain how I reasoned as well as I became

2386
03:30:10.359 --> 03:30:14.960
Well a little maybe a little like this yeah I'll just walk now too but yes yes

2387
03:30:14.960 --> 03:30:21.080
Sure I understand mm and when you leave

2388
03:30:21.080 --> 03:30:27.880
then what do you find out because then I guess then you get back your phone in

2389
03:30:27.880 --> 03:30:33.640
any case then do you have your phone yes and what do you get for the means land end then

2390
03:30:33.640 --> 03:30:37.359
Nothing it was later in the evening when he wrote this around 23

2391
03:30:37.359 --> 03:30:41.600
kind of like this all all they fucks everything something then I perceive as to

2392
03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:45.319
yeah fuck the car dealer did not go in locked then like the car dealer did not go locked it

2393
03:30:45.319 --> 03:30:51.920
Was that was the way you thought yes because I like I don't have nothing in the whole how to

2394
03:30:51.920 --> 03:30:55.279
one say from start to end all that I have been through I have not even

2395
03:30:55.279 --> 03:31:01.080
has perceived that something suspicious thus happens in my world yes so out as

2396
03:31:01.080 --> 03:31:04.279
Any car dealer I have not been able to perceive something I have not

2397
03:31:04.279 --> 03:31:07.520
seen something strange I have not perceived anything suspicious so that he

2398
03:31:07.520 --> 03:31:11.680
writes that yeah fuck all everything they fuck all the damn ok boring car dealership

2399
03:31:11.680 --> 03:31:17.080
did not lock like it was so you thought yes when did you find out that it

2400
03:31:17.080 --> 03:31:22.760
has happened something it was the day after the morning or in the evening eh on

2401
03:31:22.760 --> 03:31:26.720
the morning but then I did not perceive that there was something has happened to it

2402
03:31:26.720 --> 03:31:29.560
I have done that I have had something to do so under it

2403
03:31:29.560 --> 03:31:32.920
the time period if I don't remember wrong now it was kind of a shooting and

2404
03:31:32.920 --> 03:31:36.080
blasting every other day so it was like that was all you saw on the news

2405
03:31:36.080 --> 03:31:41.080
so that one to shooting has happened it wasn't like this yes shocking yes

2406
03:31:41.080 --> 03:31:46.160
was hard like and then as I said he who I talk to when he likes talk

2407
03:31:46.160 --> 03:31:50.199
If so he, like him, is as he is if you say so he likes to

2408
03:31:50.199 --> 03:31:53.399
Talk about things he likes to discuss I'm not so huge effort like that

2409
03:31:53.399 --> 03:31:58.399
Then he wrote in the morning there that yes something about any shooting as I

2410
03:31:58.399 --> 03:32:02.560
Don't even remember what I answered and that is it pulled out of such a rough context

2411
03:32:02.560 --> 03:32:05.880
When you can only read what message you have received and do not have

2412
03:32:05.880 --> 03:32:10.160
answered so it will be I understand what it looks like absolutely I take it

2413
03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:14.880
The thing as well but it will be you only have one side of the story so go

2414
03:32:14.880 --> 03:32:18.199
you don't put everything together but man I think you can look pretty clearly at

2415
03:32:18.199 --> 03:32:21.840
The answers there because he writes that he writes something about reaching about someone

2416
03:32:21.840 --> 03:32:25.160
Shooting then he writes something about the car then I will be this way to wait what

2417
03:32:25.160 --> 03:32:28.800
Damn now you talk about the car that we sold yesterday while a shooting

2418
03:32:28.800 --> 03:32:31.880
And then I write to him what do you talk about so do you talk about that car and

2419
03:32:31.880 --> 03:32:35.439
Then he answers there are answers where he writes no brother it is honest I will

2420
03:32:35.439 --> 03:32:39.520
Pick it up now so I tokar yes okay fuck f that it is honest it is that it

2421
03:32:39.520 --> 03:32:44.439
stands at a company and you talk about it before it also says there is after all

2422
03:32:44.439 --> 03:32:48.239
earlier in the chat even that it is honest it stands at a company it is after all

2423
03:32:48.239 --> 03:32:51.319
not only that day as said you can't see my answers but I ask after all

2424
03:32:51.319 --> 03:32:55.479
him then to talk about that thing is you have something to do then should

2425
03:32:55.479 --> 03:32:58.479
No it is honest so in this context it does not mean honest that it stands

2426
03:32:58.479 --> 03:33:02.680
at a company without no it is calm as it was nothing I so like

2427
03:33:02.680 --> 03:33:07.040
I then interpreted that I would never go with you on something like that but yes apparently so

2428
03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:10.880
I'm sitting here today yes Mister Locko is the same with with it I can't

2429
03:33:10.880 --> 03:33:15.279
answer why not because i don't want to be the same as mixtape i want

2430
03:33:15.279 --> 03:33:20.880
not respond to someone like someone else who does not concern me for my own security then

2431
03:33:20.880 --> 03:33:24.319
Do I want to go to yes no but then I will come up with a statement that Mr Lock and

2432
03:33:24.319 --> 03:33:29.840
e eh mixtape and so you may have it to stand for me completely

2433
03:33:30.040 --> 03:33:35.319
Simply do you think we have gone through about I should ask you when you go

2434
03:33:35.319 --> 03:33:40.720
back down and h looking for the car yes just the day after then I can start

2435
03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:44.680
At the same time and tell me a little freely just the 15th what happened to eh so that the 15th

2436
03:33:44.680 --> 03:33:48.359
Then so we talk when there are chatting eh we talk about the car and that it

2437
03:33:48.359 --> 03:33:52.680
Like Knas and so you know as I said he talks a lot so I know he

2438
03:33:52.680 --> 03:33:56.040
takes a lot of drugs he like him he likes to vent to me lots he

2439
03:33:56.040 --> 03:33:59.239
usually always write lots of shit to me i am it is like yes, of course i

2440
03:33:59.239 --> 03:34:03.040
Talk to him and what I am so how should I explain I am very

2441
03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:07.120
busy person so my phone is constant as well so that I have chosen to

2442
03:34:07.120 --> 03:34:11.439
my notes on all of these social media instagram snapchat and stuff they are

2443
03:34:11.439 --> 03:34:15.880
suspended and I go in when I have time but my email and yes but for example

2444
03:34:15.880 --> 03:34:19.880
Ordinary SMS that they have on because I always have customers sellers

2445
03:34:19.880 --> 03:34:24.560
Buyer I always talk like I'm a busy person so on the phone etc. so

2446
03:34:24.560 --> 03:34:27.640
I go to social media when I have time when I have time to play then

2447
03:34:27.640 --> 03:34:31.479
I go in there and he writes things sometimes as he writes I go in

2448
03:34:31.479 --> 03:34:36.239
just like i just write yes okay sick yes haa like it is none

2449
03:34:36.239 --> 03:34:40.040
greater reaction so it is but he talks anyway that evening about

2450
03:34:40.040 --> 03:34:44.800
that or that day the 15th that the car is not found and so I perceive

2451
03:34:44.800 --> 03:34:48.920
that like having the fuck the deal did not lock but in no way they have not

2452
03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:52.640
successful someone has probably come from there with the key on it as well and fuck

2453
03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:55.479
anything has happened i have no control over it it is not my business it is not

2454
03:34:55.479 --> 03:34:59.239
Like I am not I don't care much if I am to be honest I am not

2455
03:34:59.239 --> 03:35:02.560
interested in what has happened but he writes at least lots where set

2456
03:35:02.560 --> 03:35:06.040
you the car I explain to him here and there and so they found nothing thought

2457
03:35:06.040 --> 03:35:09.040
me but what the hell a car can not disappear as you are you joking well with

2458
03:35:09.040 --> 03:35:12.239
me i told him yes but know you damn i am nearby i can ride for car

2459
03:35:12.239 --> 03:35:15.080
I check quickly is the one there is the one it is not there so it is well salvaged

2460
03:35:15.080 --> 03:35:18.000
I don't know what has happened to the car as now you get to take care of yours as I

2461
03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:21.040
I have helped as much as I can I have hero with the deal yesterday

2462
03:35:21.040 --> 03:35:25.199
It is not my car like loose it would you get paid for you would

2463
03:35:25.199 --> 03:35:29.199

500 next to like but that's 6500 I have not received for meded one

2476
03:36:28.680 --> 03:36:34.880
car dealers on a car worth that sum like that so it is no but you were

2477
03:36:34.880 --> 03:36:39.319
good you I think we'll do the same way as when we looked with the wound look

2478
03:36:39.319 --> 03:36:45.880
On a few different messages yes then I am now aware of your attitude that

2479
03:36:45.880 --> 03:36:51.199
As I understand you right sometime between 21 and

2480
03:36:51.199 --> 03:36:59.680
10 and 21 and 30 are you Jordbro This is how I perceive you VA 21.10 to 21.30 so

2481
03:36:59.680 --> 03:37:05.560
Are you in Jordbro and 20.00 to 21.35 then you have

2482
03:37:05.560 --> 03:37:12.439
not your phone yes but just so we work out it then is it because i guess that

2483
03:37:12.439 --> 03:37:17.680
You get the phone before you leave Jordbro yes it is clear yes and then I wonder is

2484
03:37:17.680 --> 03:37:24.000
the 21.30 you get the phone or is it 21.35 as you leave

2485
03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:29.439
Jordbro No Earth residents then leaves with the taxi yes but then you leave it

2486
03:37:29.439 --> 03:37:36.600
Here PusShagen when it was 235 21.35 approximately 21.35 mm

2487
03:37:36.600 --> 03:37:40.600
well then we'll

2488
03:37:40.720 --> 03:37:46.279
See yes you have already talked a little about what I just me actually blown pretty quickly

2489
03:37:46.279 --> 03:37:55.319
Past here but you note a number of such Fox believed logos

2490
03:37:55.319 --> 03:38:00.439
Eh i think sorry if i stal just add that none of the alti i

2491
03:38:00.439 --> 03:38:05.199
Talked to during the current day it had that picture as no they have

2492
03:38:05.199 --> 03:38:12.800
not yes so clearly started there have not kill everyone who is it it is a person mm

2493
03:38:12.800 --> 03:38:17.800
I think it might be just me but I think it sounds a bit special

2494
03:38:17.800 --> 03:38:25.479
and call themselves kill all what yes it is it it is absolute and that it is a

2495
03:38:45.439 --> 03:38:51.399
is on the side it was the cat had written up

2496
03:38:51.399 --> 03:38:54.800
that yes i'm going to bring out

2497
03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:04.800
It can

2498
03:39:14.359 --> 03:39:17.359
look

2499
03:39:17.880 --> 03:39:23.520
Is it the one that starts at 325 in proof the day yes between mixtape and Armando yes

2500
03:39:23.520 --> 03:39:30.760
it is it thank you so much mm page 325 it starts on and then it is after all

2501
03:39:30.760 --> 03:39:35.439
mixtape that first writes yes it is only his with that we can see it so is

2502
03:39:35.439 --> 03:39:41.319
that we can't use our usual nor the doubles plays take it

2503
03:39:41.319 --> 03:39:46.800
not personal big problems right now thus double war internal war

2504
03:39:46.800 --> 03:39:49.640
What is he talking about here do you know what I just want to point out that I don't know

2505
03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:52.680
why you have put chats in different time order the first mean was

2506
03:39:52.680 --> 03:39:55.479
the one where he wrote brother take it personally it was the first he wrote

2507
03:39:55.479 --> 03:39:59.359
and it is of great importance to what is below it that when he writes

2508
03:39:59.359 --> 03:40:02.880
where we don't take it personally now we have big problems right now so it was for

2509
03:40:02.880 --> 03:40:07.199
that I he had TFF earlier in the day about lots of shit things like then I became

2510
03:40:07.199 --> 03:40:09.880
mad at she I said what the hell is it with you why do you keep on the chick about

2511
03:40:09.880 --> 03:40:13.359
here unnecessary things like that and then he wrote an hour later he lazy down

2512
03:40:13.359 --> 03:40:17.000
that brother is not taking personally right now we have big problems right now and so on

2513
03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:20.720
further and then I want to add this as I said before he likes to

2514
03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:24.840
vent he drugs a lot he takes a lot of things that it is as I have

2515
03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:29.199
been how to explain as a not safe point but like someone he can

2516
03:40:29.199 --> 03:40:33.279
Talk to ventilate with and then you also look at chats that it is such a shame

2517
03:40:33.279 --> 03:40:35.840
that you do not see what I have written for if you cut down a bit where it stands

2518
03:40:35.840 --> 03:40:40.560
as well as to do mine and then tag it was included in the preliminary investigation

2519
03:40:40.560 --> 03:40:43.359
Also that then I write to him like this yes damn it sounds sad this

2520
03:40:43.359 --> 03:40:47.600
As you write fuck what cries like mm and so I write but have you pondered

2521
03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:50.319
on quitting it doesn't sound so fun to live as you live like then I say yes

2522
03:40:50.319 --> 03:40:53.800
but i'm going to do mine and i'm going to tag as well as i advise him from

2523
03:40:53.800 --> 03:40:58.080
to do reach more too mm then you do not see it so that it gets pulled out

2524
03:40:58.080 --> 03:41:01.960
a rough context too but the double wars and internal wars what is about

2525
03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:06.960
It is probably any war he has etc. We cannot use the usual ones

2526
03:41:06.960 --> 03:41:13.640
double player it is the entire organization that split not bridge what is it for

2527
03:41:13.640 --> 03:41:18.600
organization he is with that has split yes it any organization

2528
03:41:18.600 --> 03:41:22.520
As he is in the JO I understood and therefore I asked which one is this

2529
03:41:22.520 --> 03:41:26.000
is your friend it is a person you have a lot of contact with which one

2530
03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:29.600
organization is what he is in he is well in any organization that has

2531
03:41:29.600 --> 03:41:33.279
split I have no control over which organization he is in no but if I

2532
03:41:33.279 --> 03:41:36.800
says this way as it is quite widely known and I have gone through that goal

2533
03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:42.560
that FXST split and then Seron Natverket went one way and bridge tver to

2534
03:41:42.560 --> 03:41:48.159
the other direction is the foxtrot he is in it, so it must stand for I

2535
03:41:48.159 --> 03:41:51.159
Don't know if he's with yes it is clear that he gets but I wonder you know I

2536
03:41:51.159 --> 03:41:55.600
don't know no so the others are fat active they step

2537
03:41:55.600 --> 03:42:01.239
on everything now after you yeah his mother and this I think is also quite general

2538
03:42:01.239 --> 03:42:07.319
known that it was a phalanx that murdered the so -called strawberry mother etc. is

2539
03:42:07.319 --> 03:42:13.399
that what he writes about here seems like it etc. but that as I said it seems

2540
03:42:13.399 --> 03:42:18.720
that but I can't, like yes, I think then maybe may be

2541
03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:24.359
more interesting because then I think like this but brother Allers it you are long way

2542
03:42:24.359 --> 03:42:28.520
left before your name starts to get interesting but people can try to fish

2543
03:42:28.520 --> 03:42:33.319
you on info where are you on your way you are apparently on your way you have a long way to go

2544
03:42:33.319 --> 03:42:36.199
But you are on your way somewhere are you on the way I don't know what the hell formulates

2545
03:42:36.199 --> 03:42:40.840
Sig that way eh as I said again then wish you could have seen my answers

2546
03:42:40.840 --> 03:42:42.840
what I have written there because he writes all this it is

2547
03:42:42.840 --> 03:42:46.199
very unpleasant things he writes i have read new i am not born yesterday i

2548
03:42:46.199 --> 03:42:49.960
After all, follows what happens and what violence is happening that happens then I write that

2549
03:42:49.960 --> 03:42:54.479
What the hell are you talking about just like it is if it's so deep like d it can

2550
03:42:54.479 --> 03:42:57.439
Almost be dangerous to me to just know you like that I don't want to be

2551
03:42:57.439 --> 03:43:01.520
any part of this shit like me is I have another life to focus on

2552
03:43:01.520 --> 03:43:05.120
Like and then he writes yes but brother it calmly like you your name is not

2553
03:43:05.120 --> 03:43:08.960
interesting since last f he writes you have you you are long way left before your

2554
03:43:08.960 --> 03:43:12.840
Name is starting to be interesting I don't really perceive why he writes it on

2555
03:43:12.840 --> 03:43:16.720
that way but what he means then or as I understood then, as well as worry

2556
03:43:16.720 --> 03:43:19.960
you that it is quiet m you still do not do with that way so you don't have to be

2557
03:43:19.960 --> 03:43:23.399
worried but if people know you are friends with me then they can try to fish you on info

2558
03:43:23.399 --> 03:43:27.840
Like and so you think yes then I understand and then we are then and here

2559
03:43:27.840 --> 03:43:31.920
Do I know you say it's not you like then eh

2560
03:43:31.920 --> 03:43:38.159
have access to this to your phone then mm eh but now we are

2561
03:43:38.159 --> 03:43:42.600
2034 Set it on any street before called Pusshagen

2562
03:43:42.600 --> 03:43:50.960
If you are at the address of 15 it is written in 2045 and two min 2055

2563
03:43:50.960 --> 03:43:59.600
eh if you now when you read it what do you think this is about eh so yes it

2564
03:43:59.600 --> 03:44:02.880
Obviously is about this case that we are sitting for here today but

2565
03:44:02.880 --> 03:44:07.399
I didn't have my phone then so that it is obviously about

2566
03:44:07.399 --> 03:44:12.800
this case as well and acting it I because I interpret this as that it

2567
03:44:12.800 --> 03:44:18.159
is about wondering if you are in place at 9pm and two minutes then

2568
03:44:18.159 --> 03:44:22.279
That would be 2057 roughly that is roughly you agree with me about it

2569
03:44:22.279 --> 03:44:27.319
Interpretation Yes how is it then that you are not there for a 21

2570
03:44:27.319 --> 03:44:34.760
o10 it is I don't know he he can may mean that yes two minat maybe they

2571
03:44:34.760 --> 03:44:38.279
others are there in two in two minutes as we talk yes I don't know

2572
03:44:38.279 --> 03:44:42.920
actually no and here it is also when the best would have been if I solve someone

2573
03:44:42.920 --> 03:44:50.680
who book taxi etc. Take some good place brother etc. But this he writes to

2574
03:44:50.680 --> 03:44:55.239
your buddy exactly and as I interpreted when I thought I can if I can say

2575
03:44:55.239 --> 03:44:58.279
that as I interpreted then that they talk about like this what the hell should we do with

2576
03:44:58.279 --> 03:45:01.680
Armando now, as well as so he should not take any suspicions or yes by someone

2577
03:45:01.680 --> 03:45:04.560
Reason so yes best would have been if I fix someone who book a taxi as well but

2578
03:45:04.560 --> 03:45:09.359
just so we agree that it is mixtape that writes this your friend to my

2579
03:45:09.359 --> 03:45:13.080
buddy no no no to this guy that you don't

2580
03:45:13.080 --> 03:45:18.120
feel so that mix that is your friend writes this to the guy you don't

2581
03:45:18.120 --> 03:45:22.560
feeling mm it would not have been better for mix

2582
03:45:22.560 --> 03:45:29.520
to talk to you but he maybe who with him too yes but so it both feel

2583
03:45:29.520 --> 03:45:34.800
mixtape even though you don't know the product it is so you mean yes okay or i don't know

2584
03:45:34.800 --> 03:45:39.479
What he might be who with him like I don't have control of it but then

2585
03:45:39.479 --> 03:45:43.720
why he writes to him and not to me thus the such questions you get

2586
03:45:43.720 --> 03:45:47.640
the ask him it i i will we will it we will do so

2587
03:45:47.640 --> 03:45:53.600
Eventually just so then you get exactly not today, however, no

2588
03:45:53.600 --> 03:46:00.120
Eh and then we then eh mixtape wrote to Adelle as a

2589
03:46:00.120 --> 03:46:04.520
It is one you know Adell what I know and know I know who she knows

2590
03:46:04.520 --> 03:46:09.159
Who I am yes etc. You have been on some date yes exactly and she has been together

2591
03:46:09.159 --> 03:46:16.040
with mixtape it I don't know no why calls such a lady and gay do you know it she

2592
03:46:16.040 --> 03:46:22.399
is called the frug on signal yes okay it is her name so smck name is so they

2593
03:46:24.479 --> 03:46:31.560
Nam start the car but but git you have time on you eh

2594
03:46:31.560 --> 03:46:36.920
Who is this is it sent to this unknown guy or is it sent

2595
03:46:36.920 --> 03:46:40.680
To you I have no memory of it so you must have been the unknown guy then

2596
03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:46.560
have not got back should start the car eh there on the spot for the mixtape seems like that

2597
03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:52.840
Yes he did it then you know that yes no one in a car dealer so starts

2598
03:46:52.840 --> 03:46:56.040
So the car is shut off several times as well as yes but I think a car dealer has

2599
03:46:56.040 --> 03:47:00.159
You often have a buyer in place, after all, no buyer at the site of price I perceive

2600
03:47:00.159 --> 03:47:03.479
not like any car has started before I went like so so that it

2601
03:47:03.479 --> 03:47:09.199
No, and then it was then Nedergården 202 that is there that you take the dachshund

2602
03:47:09.199 --> 03:47:18.600
Since then we know yes from the eh I think like this eh taxi goes after all

2603
03:47:18.600 --> 03:47:22.040
2149 mm

2604
03:47:23.560 --> 03:47:30.040
and you go from pusshagen up to the taxi mhm it is right on

2605
03:47:30.040 --> 03:47:37.319
The road so you send money why then for the taxi ride when he wrote Swisha reach

2606
03:47:37.319 --> 03:47:41.600
Swisha a few hundred to the lady yes I could figure it out myself yes it is

2607
03:47:41.600 --> 03:47:46.840
certainly for a taxa as well and who he wrote it it it wrote to me it

2608
03:47:46.840 --> 03:47:50.600
he wrote to you etc. so then I had got back the phone

2609
03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:58.000
Mm so that but if I understood you right so it is this guy who thinks you

2610
03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:02.239
is going to ride a taxi this than the guy to it you

2611
03:48:02.239 --> 03:48:06.199
You had intended to take the subway back type or so no I would have solved well

2612
03:48:06.199 --> 03:48:10.120
it in yes otherwise maybe booked a taxi or something like that as well

2613
03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:15.000
that but that but the guy he thought it would be it we fix we fix

2614
03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:20.080
a taxi for you it was so you told me before yes and then you get back your

2615
03:48:20.080 --> 03:48:25.680
phone and then you find out the first one that stands is swisha any hundred to

2616
03:48:25.680 --> 03:48:31.600
The Frugan MM will not be surprised then no

2617
03:48:33.520 --> 03:48:38.600
No i took me the freedom just as a lawyer your lawyer did so I did

2618
03:48:38.600 --> 03:48:45.239
so that I took a search from PusShagen 108 via this GPS coordinate you

2619
03:48:45.239 --> 03:48:53.520
Puts up toys 42 up to the Nedergården then you start here go there

2620
03:48:53.520 --> 03:49:01.120
And this is pretty straightforward, etc. It takes seven minutes to go it feels reasonable

2621
03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:04.560
Do you think it took a little more than seven minutes for me I remember going

2622
03:49:04.560 --> 03:49:08.319
Wrong somewhere I don't I don't have the world's best local knowledge there but took

2623
03:49:08.319 --> 03:49:12.600
well run 10 minutes i guess you went on google maps too no he said he said

2624
03:49:12.600 --> 03:49:15.880
Go straight down just okay he said go straight down you got the address so i went straight

2625
03:49:15.880 --> 03:49:19.120
down then i noticed where fuck i'm late then i went into google maps exactly so

2626
03:49:19.120 --> 03:49:22.399
I went and followed from where I had gone wrong I assumed but it took well yes one

2627
03:49:22.399 --> 03:49:25.840
ten minutes for me to go that distance yes what do you remember where somewhere was

2628
03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:29.520
you what part of what you went lost was this down or was that up

2629
03:49:29.520 --> 03:49:33.399
or no i don't actually remember no for this route where it takes two

2630
03:49:33.399 --> 03:49:39.720
minutes to go also in accordance with Google Maps okay it's so there and that's exactly

2631
03:49:39.720 --> 03:49:44.920
Follow a road just mm so you got there what I think it was because he said go straight

2632
03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:48.600
down so I followed the big road if I now remember right so I went I

2633
03:49:48.600 --> 03:49:52.279
Did not go in left I continued straight ahead at where it stands the grass and

2634
03:49:52.279 --> 03:49:55.120
Then noticed that I went wrong so I had to go in through the residential area as well

2635
03:49:55.120 --> 03:49:59.000
around there somewhere then I understand

2636
03:50:00.199 --> 03:50:07.479
mm then we think go to the group chat KK and I apologize that I have where

2649
03:51:08.439 --> 03:51:11.680
So I can't answer my no I thought case when he borrowed your phone

2650
03:51:11.680 --> 03:51:18.920
mean but that is only car chat that we talked well about okay you

2651
03:51:18.920 --> 03:51:22.080
We look here then

2652
03:51:23.040 --> 03:51:29.359
Eh pick up a package today two salmon plus two salmon what is it to pick it up

2653
03:51:29.359 --> 03:51:32.760
Any package thus that thing is there were several members of this

2654
03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:35.319
The group chat and then it also says that when he has written all this so

2655
03:51:35.319 --> 03:51:40.640
Writing mixtape c yes in Spanish so I perceive that these stuff

2656
03:51:40.640 --> 03:51:43.720
was to mixtape and he writes yes to mixtape then no but then we can release

2657
03:51:43.720 --> 03:51:49.760
it yes no no i want yes but then i take eh after 19 you can pick it through g

2658
03:51:49.760 --> 03:51:54.600
ready at address and pick up the type 1845 it is also to mixtape or no

2659
03:51:54.600 --> 03:51:58.120
That's when I picked up this chip that's when you picked up chip chip the thing

2660
03:51:58.120 --> 03:52:02.359
just brother butterfly trail it was in bridge it was where you were up and

2661
03:52:02.359 --> 03:52:07.880
Picked up etc. mm then you would not have met this other guy without him met

2662
03:52:07.880 --> 03:52:10.760
You later yes

2663
03:52:13.520 --> 03:52:20.439
mm eh then towards Jordbro sees exact address but you can pair then in Essinge MM

2664
03:52:20.439 --> 03:52:24.479
Eh that was where I perceived that the car would thus that we would s it

2665
03:52:24.479 --> 03:52:29.800
somewhere there in the south side as well as mm here writes å in

2666
03:52:29.800 --> 03:52:35.239
1758 change car brother then go to another address brother then to Jordbro late taxi

2667
03:52:35.239 --> 03:52:41.720
To Essinge pick up parab give it 6500 mm it is he who decides or is it you

2668
03:52:41.720 --> 03:52:46.279
who decide how you get in different places I how you go between different

2669
03:52:46.279 --> 03:52:50.279
places it is he who gives you instructions thus what he writes after all

2670
03:52:50.279 --> 03:52:54.600
There, after all, is what he asks m help that I have said I said to help

2671
03:52:54.600 --> 03:52:57.199
him with a service and then he says how this should go to it is like

2672
03:52:57.199 --> 03:53:01.840
That I ask him can you do this but do it on it and that way like

2673
03:53:01.840 --> 03:53:07.640
and depends it is a toy but pick up a bag or something it was this little one

2674
03:53:07.640 --> 03:53:13.120
these things SR box exactly and what would you with a bag to put it in

2675
03:53:13.120 --> 03:53:16.520
Probably and that for him that he needs to tell you it understands

2676
03:53:16.520 --> 03:53:21.239
you not yourself or yes probably yes

2677
03:53:21.479 --> 03:53:26.640
m and he also wants to tell you when you go with your car picked up toy late

2678
03:53:26.640 --> 03:53:33.600
Changes car in Bergsvägen then to another address pick up late Jordbro etc. Why

2679
03:53:33.600 --> 03:53:37.439
does he have to explain this so in detail to you I perceive it as that

2680
03:53:37.439 --> 03:53:41.000
He writes no then with your car can pick up a toy as well as because there is no one

2681
03:53:41.000 --> 03:53:44.560
Idea to go with this Nissan anyway as not even st at the time he scraps

2682
03:53:44.560 --> 03:53:47.439
It didn't even start I would go there and fix it together like so I go

2683
03:53:47.439 --> 03:53:52.600
and fixes the chip boox thing it is finished as well as go back to retrieve the car in

2684
03:53:52.600 --> 03:53:55.239
Bergsvägen then perceived it as I would pick up the other guy on a

2685
03:53:55.239 --> 03:53:59.319
another address and then to Jordbro but he met me there so that it

2686
03:53:59.319 --> 03:54:07.239
After all, the plan went on it we did not get off like the hungry with the keys to the car

2687
03:54:07.239 --> 03:54:11.800
will it be a bit late so park the car br and go to berli buy someone

2688
03:54:11.800 --> 03:54:17.640
Drink Jan Chilla Eh and then now the question comes again that

2689
03:54:17.640 --> 03:54:21.840
If it is now if you are going to meet a guy to do you to do a deal you should

2690
03:54:21.840 --> 03:54:26.479
meet a guy who will accompany you who is the hunga with the keys as late

2691
03:54:26.479 --> 03:54:32.080
will put them on the keys the tire forward there is any person i guess

2692
03:54:32.080 --> 03:54:36.720
don't know no because it sounds like it

2693
03:54:36.720 --> 03:54:40.560
Not at all is that you should meet any person without it sounding on this

2694
03:54:40.560 --> 03:54:46.520
like there will be keys on the front tire to you etc. eh but then it was

2695
03:54:46.520 --> 03:54:50.120
not or the keys were there, after all, when I got there in the car then get

2696
03:54:50.120 --> 03:54:53.640
myself from the beginning the keys lay there assumed yes but someone has tried well

2697
03:54:53.640 --> 03:54:57.159
Start the car before me they have not succeeded as so they lay

2698
03:54:57.159 --> 03:55:00.199
Back put back the keys I go where I will fix the car and he

2699
03:55:00.199 --> 03:55:03.439
knows yes but Armando will fix it like that certainly no big

2700
03:55:03.439 --> 03:55:06.520
problems as well as maybe a battery that is discharged or how will it so that it

2701
03:55:06.520 --> 03:55:10.880
Not anything about any guy you should meet there here it says he

2702
03:55:10.880 --> 03:55:13.680
is there in 15 something like that but then he came late so he wasn't there

2703
03:55:13.680 --> 03:55:18.080
in 15 minutes minter but i had been perceived as thinking about the hung

2704
03:55:18.080 --> 03:55:21.080
with the keys or do you think of someone else who is going there if 15 no I think so

2705
03:55:21.080 --> 03:55:24.640
stood after that that he is there in 15 it lasted you I was on and refueling it

2706
03:55:24.640 --> 03:55:27.479
maybe best that we do this so that it is not that I lose away

2707
03:55:27.479 --> 03:55:31.359
something in between because it may actually be so so i go out

2708
03:55:31.359 --> 03:55:35.640
to and check like this

2709
03:55:36.350 --> 03:55:39.530
[Music]

2710
03:55:43.239 --> 03:55:50.520
When the Hunga is then calm brother against 26 an in

2711
03:55:50.520 --> 03:55:59.279
ajna where tamam tamam five t min will say to them put the keys on the deck

2712
03:55:59.279 --> 03:56:08.319
Fut yes brother Ölmevägen in Farstad Yes Yes brother thus

2713
03:56:08.319 --> 03:56:13.720
Where does this guy come in 15 minutes there is somewhere I know

2714
03:56:13.720 --> 03:56:16.399
not if it is or after but i have read so it is there is i tr it

2715
03:56:16.399 --> 03:56:20.319
maybe after that is after you go down after yes after it was when i was on

2716
03:56:20.319 --> 03:56:27.000
The garage I remember because after it is after 19 then not even an indication

2717
03:56:27.000 --> 03:56:35.319
The engine lamp explains to El Hamilton Why you call Benim here for so

2718
03:56:35.319 --> 03:56:39.600
As I perceive, he had had the car before and then when troubleshooting a car so

2719
03:56:39.600 --> 03:56:43.199
Can't you not just always exist yes it is this thing that is wrong you

2720
03:56:43.199 --> 03:56:47.120
May go on different as well as although it was well that it was soppatorsk no the battery

2721
03:56:47.120 --> 03:56:50.199
was discharged, the battery was discharged too just so I had to put on

2722
03:56:50.199 --> 03:56:52.439
the car first and when I put it off it I noticed damn I can't

2723
03:56:52.439 --> 03:56:55.720
turn off the car now because the generator must be uploaded I turn it off

2724
03:56:55.720 --> 03:56:59.800
So you have to put it back and then I noticed damn there is no soup

2725
03:56:59.800 --> 03:57:02.479
in the car either and then I parked it and went with my car because I don't want to

2726
03:57:02.479 --> 03:57:07.560
have a soup -in with that car on the way to the garage then mm and this explained

2727
03:57:07.560 --> 03:57:12.560
Denim for you how to start the car then mm

2728
03:57:13.159 --> 03:57:17.319
Mm and then there will be a lot of message about if it does not think brother

2729
03:57:17.319 --> 03:57:24.199
Thoughts a brother gives you pair where are you now go there no he is there if

2730
03:57:24.199 --> 03:57:30.560
15 is Ingo in Kungsängen this is where he meets you then no he met me at

2731
03:57:30.560 --> 03:57:34.000
Bergsvägen he met you on Bergsvägen he wrote he is there in 15 but he

2732
03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:37.800
wasn't there in 15 he was there about maybe 30 35 minutes after he wrote

2733
03:57:37.800 --> 03:57:42.760
it mm eh and here it and it just that

2734
03:57:42.760 --> 03:57:47.359
nor put toys in then go with this and tanks it full it is after all

2735
03:57:47.359 --> 03:57:50.279
Nothing strange

2736
03:58:02.080 --> 03:58:08.040
mm still have your phone when you get the Ölmevägen 10 no then you have

2737
03:58:08.040 --> 03:58:15.800
left to from it yes so you have it here somewhere or yes and then

2738
03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:20.159
do you tear from it yes okay and then you have it

2739
03:58:20.159 --> 03:58:29.040
not no for a 21 and something it fits well

2740
03:58:31.960 --> 03:58:39.640
Mm he says something about it that you should wait somewhere on

2741
03:58:39.640 --> 03:58:45.279
the road this guy no not what I remember

2742
03:58:45.279 --> 03:58:48.279
No

2743
03:58:48.840 --> 03:58:53.359
No think we went wrong sometime during the fare that

2744
03:58:53.359 --> 03:58:57.399
but in that case there was nothing we did there or waited or picked up

2745
03:58:57.399 --> 03:59:00.640
up someone or so as I said I went on his instructions so it was

2746
03:59:00.640 --> 03:59:04.720
he who said drive left right here because here says that on the hunga it was another

2747
03:59:04.720 --> 03:59:10.040
Hunge apparently who does not answer may be another address in the worst case it will be

2748
03:59:10.040 --> 03:59:15.000
Another one who goes and leaves at the same address turned a maximum of five minutes etc. did you

2749
03:59:15.000 --> 03:59:19.000
that or yes as I said we went wrong we were waiting for a place I mined what we

2750
03:59:19.000 --> 03:59:21.560
had with the thing to do what I assumed it was but but now remember in

2751
03:59:21.560 --> 03:59:24.120
any case that you were waiting somewhere so it will be sure you would wait

2752
03:59:24.120 --> 03:59:28.000
There then understands

2753
03:59:37.080 --> 03:59:44.040
me and this it is not something that you have had someone any knowledge of

2754
03:59:44.040 --> 03:59:47.880
What it says about the step warn should walk and the other car and so yes

2755
03:59:47.880 --> 03:59:52.359
no no i don't have my phone exactly

2756
03:59:56.760 --> 04:00:06.319
No when are you getting back the phone 2135 where somewhere prime.se

2757
04:00:06.319 --> 04:00:12.319
21138 best take the bag from him and left to the guys what is it it was anton

2758
04:00:12.319 --> 04:00:15.040
the med i got when i had the phone then but i i knew that

2759
04:00:15.040 --> 04:00:19.800
He has had my phone and chatted with these then the people underneath

2760
04:00:19.800 --> 04:00:23.159
the time like me assumed yes it was certainly meant to him because it is in

2761
04:00:23.159 --> 04:00:27.040
no context meant to me I don't know if any bag or anything becomes

2762
04:00:27.040 --> 04:00:31.640
you not a little curious and looked back as you understand that this guy has

2763
04:00:31.640 --> 04:00:36.880
been inside and chatted like me on signal you are not surprised no as I said

2764
04:00:36.880 --> 04:00:42.000
Before first, my notes are suspended for the second I think

2765
04:00:42.000 --> 04:00:45.720
not so much on it it is like it would have been my business yes I had well

2766
04:00:45.720 --> 04:00:48.520
been a little more familiar with what is happening and so but it is not my business I have

2767
04:00:48.520 --> 04:00:52.120
done mine as I am done I have something else to think about it is like it is

2768
04:00:52.120 --> 04:00:57.920
nothing that I put any extra weight on eh and then they know it was not

2769
04:00:57.920 --> 04:01:01.680
me who had the phone that it was the other

2770
04:01:03.239 --> 04:01:08.840
the guy but it wasn't really my question my question where will you not be

2771
04:01:08.840 --> 04:01:14.120
surprised someone that he has been sitting and seems to have used your phone and smiled

2772
04:01:14.120 --> 04:01:19.199
into signal you are not surprised by it no because that was what he asked me

2773
04:01:19.199 --> 04:01:25.000
about getting to do JO stuck not on your signal well ah then mine or his

2774
04:01:25.000 --> 04:01:28.640
signal they know who they are talking to thus which person are they talk to you

2775
04:01:28.640 --> 04:01:31.319
You don't talk to an alios you talk to a person or chat then

2776
04:01:31.319 --> 04:01:36.600
so that they have probably they probably knew who is chatting with

2777
04:01:37.159 --> 04:01:45.159
him okay bran they check the tabs

2778
04:01:45.159 --> 04:01:49.840
What does this mean something about bran and tabs i have no idea as said but

2779
04:01:49.840 --> 04:01:52.479
Notes have been suspended and then you notice that the chat goes over after all

2780
04:01:52.479 --> 04:01:55.720
Immediately after they notice that so shit they don't have to start not

2781
04:01:55.720 --> 04:02:01.199
The cars now what is it not to start any car no delete everything you have written

2782
04:02:01.199 --> 04:02:05.199
So there erase for all what did you think about that someone should erase something but

2783
04:02:05.199 --> 04:02:09.600
As I said I just want to add again that my notes are not on I do not have

2784
04:02:09.600 --> 04:02:12.159
So I haven't read these messages and if I had read them so

2785
04:02:12.159 --> 04:02:15.000
Had I not just understood what it means yes they have been talking about

2786
04:02:15.000 --> 04:02:20.600
something like that okay

2787
04:02:21.600 --> 04:02:28.880
eh the guys you would meet how did they come to the place that I don't know they came with

2788
04:02:28.880 --> 04:02:35.880
Taxi I don't know no apparently so it seems that it yours

2789
04:02:35.880 --> 04:02:40.159
buddy knows then is that what comes taxi yes he has been aware of it

2790
04:02:40.159 --> 04:02:45.640
Mm and here it is not even here it is then with your phone number not with

2791
04:02:45.640 --> 04:02:52.720
your alias but it is yes but it still is that is someone other than you yes

2792
04:03:01.279 --> 04:03:09.439
Yes he writes someone writes here in your name should fix a map for you eh fixed

2793
04:03:09.439 --> 04:03:14.239
that no map do you know it I don't know no he has written has done well

2794
04:03:14.239 --> 04:03:18.880
that but what i don't know about it and mixtape writes the revolver is in the car

2795
04:03:18.880 --> 04:03:24.120
But this you have it is nothing you have seen no no no no no i don't have

2796
04:03:24.120 --> 04:03:28.359
perceived as any weapon should light to the car no and then then it will

2797
04:03:28.359 --> 04:03:32.319
was on fucking mum k fucks and all they fucked but it was that the deal

2798
04:03:32.319 --> 04:03:35.920
Went in the cast yes so you may think he gets excessively angry man has a

2799
04:03:35.920 --> 04:03:41.720
damn temperament so suppose yes fuck the deal did not lock as well as mm

2800
04:03:42.720 --> 04:03:51.040
mm remember what it is that you have asked when he answers no they will not

2801
04:03:51.040 --> 04:03:55.399
talk i don't actually remember no but that i recognize that kind of

2802
04:03:55.399 --> 04:03:59.120
messages it is when he usually talks he likes to make his little own

2803
04:03:59.120 --> 04:04:03.080
Investigation as well as when he reads news and stuff so he he is attacked

2804
04:04:03.080 --> 04:04:06.840
Think it's interesting with such things like that and I usually just answer that yes okay

2805
04:04:06.840 --> 04:04:14.680
like but this is he someone has asked a question since it is a chat

2806
04:04:14.680 --> 04:04:18.600
Between the two of you so I think it is you who asks the question

2807
04:04:18.600 --> 04:04:23.120
Eh no they will not and talk what are you asked why have you asked

2808
04:04:23.120 --> 04:04:26.439
If and what is it that you think will talk i don't know it may have been

2809
04:04:26.439 --> 04:04:30.319
Someone followed the question on something he has asked no idea that it

2810
04:04:30.319 --> 04:04:33.760
It's not such a message that likes me telling me something about

2811
04:04:33.760 --> 04:04:40.199
says so no no and when you get then they had not been 100 they had not shot

2812
04:04:40.199 --> 04:04:43.720
What what do you think about it yes I understand that he is talking about any event that

2813
04:04:43.720 --> 04:04:46.880
have happened so much I absolutely understand but this is not the first time

2814
04:04:46.880 --> 04:04:49.840
he talks to me about any event that has happened so that I have read well

2815
04:04:49.840 --> 04:04:53.920
something on the news and so like he begins to speculate on who has done what

2816
04:04:53.920 --> 04:04:58.000
and what has happened and so on, as well as even though you you can still agree

2817
04:04:58.000 --> 04:05:00.880
If it looks like there is a conversation between two parties here that

2818
04:05:00.880 --> 04:05:05.640
you have written something before yes I have certainly written something in or that is

2819
04:05:05.640 --> 04:05:08.040
not certain that I have actually written he so so is just one

2820
04:05:08.040 --> 04:05:10.920
statement they had not been 100 they had not shot it is none it is nothing

2821
04:05:10.920 --> 04:05:14.600
Answer to my question l to any question that I have asked but I cannot

2822
04:05:14.600 --> 04:05:17.720
Like memorizing exactly what was written but it has been some discussion and

2823
04:05:17.720 --> 04:05:21.560
something that has happened etc. and it was here when he wrote brother the car should apparently

2824
04:05:21.560 --> 04:05:25.040
Stay in the area when he writes it right after he has written that there

2825
04:05:25.040 --> 04:05:28.880
Up then he writes like then he writes a little parked thus etcetera

2826
04:05:28.880 --> 04:05:32.120
etcetera and then I write wait what the hell are you talking about then you talk about

2827
04:05:32.120 --> 04:05:36.199
the car like i have it something with this you talk about to do and then

2828
04:05:36.199 --> 04:05:39.960
he writes further down about them if you are going to scroll down, it says no brother

2829
04:05:39.960 --> 04:05:43.760
it is honest i will pick it up now so he he just confirms to me that no

2830
04:05:43.760 --> 04:05:47.439
What the hell the car has nothing to do with this to do he knows it has it but

2831
04:05:47.439 --> 04:05:50.120
He probably says probably because he doesn't want me to get any

2832
04:05:50.120 --> 04:05:54.800
suspicion of something mm

2833
04:05:55.199 --> 04:06:00.319
and because you leave eh

2834
04:06:00.319 --> 04:06:06.080
before why is it you he hears and check eh what the car says why

2835
04:06:06.080 --> 04:06:11.479
Doesn't he hear from the guy who was apparently left in Jordbro when you go

2836
04:06:11.479 --> 04:06:15.439
Yes maybe he has done that we do not know yes but quite obvious because

2837
04:06:15.439 --> 04:06:19.560
What we have the contacts with you here he asks which phone number you

2838
04:06:19.560 --> 04:06:25.279
put the car on here he is down and looking or someone is down and looking yes

2839
04:06:25.279 --> 04:06:28.760
But I mean he may have written to the other person before as we

2840
04:06:28.760 --> 04:06:31.840
don't know and since he has not remembered or I don't know and then

2841
04:06:31.840 --> 04:06:35.800
written to me then other responsibility I do not know it I understand yes and you

2842
04:06:35.800 --> 04:06:41.080
would get a salmon then he writes they have probably cod depended on the tabs they had

2843
04:06:41.080 --> 04:06:45.640
on it etc. what is it about the same thing as in the morning then as as

2844
04:06:45.640 --> 04:06:49.600
Said he is doing well and speculate as usual and ventilates and talks and

2845
04:06:49.600 --> 04:06:54.479
Like but here you have to understand that there are some who have got stuck for something

2846
04:06:54.479 --> 04:06:57.960
and that they had pistols on yes yes I understood so much I understood but

2847
04:06:57.960 --> 04:07:02.920
then that I would have something co -operation with it it is like it is v nothing like

2848
04:07:02.920 --> 04:07:07.560
arose in my brain so as I said you have to think about that until until

2849
04:07:07.560 --> 04:07:11.319
Now, as so far, still I still haven't even had any opportunity to assume

2850
04:07:11.319 --> 04:07:14.840
That something criminal might have happened in my world is this

2851
04:07:14.840 --> 04:07:18.479
Still a very ordinary car dealership

2852
04:07:19.040 --> 04:07:27.239
Mm and then proceeds with how they tagged and they no call before not

2853
04:07:27.239 --> 04:07:32.080
touched the n st and parked so fast they are not even so bey are you down

2854
04:07:32.080 --> 04:07:36.720
and is it when you are down and look at 18 o'clock exactly when when they write

2855
04:07:36.720 --> 04:07:39.880
around the time there so i'm there as it was when I told him so what

2856
04:07:39.880 --> 04:07:43.040
Damn how hard can it be to find a car like you have placed

2857
04:07:43.040 --> 04:07:46.040
1000 because I am nearby I go down and check out like but no it was

2858
04:07:46.040 --> 04:07:50.760
Not when it then comes three tabs off a car for what seven shots in a door yes

2859
04:07:50.760 --> 04:07:55.439
one kid comes at last he is minor etc what do you think that

2860
04:07:55.439 --> 04:07:59.640
have to do then it starts to get a little uncomfortable I think what the hell so

2861
04:07:59.640 --> 04:08:02.520
This has nothing to do with me to do it has already confirmed that the car has

2862
04:08:02.520 --> 04:08:06.319
nothing to do with this as I am not interested in hearing it

2863
04:08:06.319 --> 04:08:09.640
here and it's like this is pulled out of a chat out one day but this is how you see

2864
04:08:09.640 --> 04:08:12.680
Our other chats it is usually that he like yes but he talks lots of shit only

2865
04:08:12.680 --> 04:08:15.560
And this is how you see that the chat goes out quite shortly thereafter it to

2866
04:08:15.560 --> 04:08:19.159
I tell him like yes ok ok I change the subject like me pallets

2867
04:08:19.159 --> 04:08:23.040
not hear such a snack I don't have, like time for

2868
04:08:23.279 --> 04:08:29.279
You download session the day after yes who is saying to you to do

2869
04:08:29.279 --> 04:08:34.960
that what I think if I remember correctly it was mixtape etc.

2870
04:08:35.439 --> 04:08:40.520
Mm do you remember what time you did

2871
04:08:40.520 --> 04:08:46.640
No if we look here it stands download page 335 download session 10 11

2872
04:08:46.640 --> 04:08:52.319
session 10.28 mm last is when you download the yes number around it

2873
04:08:52.319 --> 04:08:57.399
Time yes then comes a chat 10.29 with Mr. Loco

2874
04:08:57.399 --> 04:09:04.680
Show is that mixtape it may be yes it may well be but is it

2875
04:09:04.680 --> 04:09:09.399
I wonder I don't know

2876
04:09:11.040 --> 04:09:18.359
No I think that since it was clear instruction here 1028 mm and 10.29

2877
04:09:18.359 --> 04:09:22.560
so is the first mean I think like this then

2878
04:09:22.560 --> 04:09:27.800
comes it and now we are two days after the deed 17.25 We have the pressure in Haninge

2879
04:09:27.800 --> 04:09:31.119
The guy will ride an electric kick that needs a good place but the picture on the car

2880
04:09:31.119 --> 04:09:37.040
gets good is there something where you are involved as far as I understand that

2881
04:09:37.040 --> 04:09:40.080
does not concern this anything with the suspicion that I sit for here today so I

2882
04:09:40.080 --> 04:09:43.399
chooses not to comment on anything if any other v does not comment on it no

2883
04:09:43.399 --> 04:09:46.199
Asking it because this is quite clear a criminal character and I

2884
04:09:46.199 --> 04:09:50.119
claims that you have one that you spend time in criminal context that you are not at all

2885
04:09:50.119 --> 04:09:53.640
is alien to that crime and there to question

2886
04:09:53.640 --> 04:09:57.960
I, as I said it is not concerned the case we are sitting for here today so I think

2887
04:09:57.960 --> 04:10:02.600
it okay n gets answer it goes well i have none

2888
04:10:02.600 --> 04:10:09.880
Problems with it and then Mix writes the 17th and

2889
04:10:09.880 --> 04:10:14.600
This has you been up to a bit like this but you are the only one I have home brother

2890
04:10:14.600 --> 04:10:19.680
brother i don't trust any people selling everyone right now every day one two dies it

2891
04:10:19.680 --> 04:10:24.520
Kna's disaster and everything included in yeps before it was only paired brother now

2892
04:10:24.520 --> 04:10:30.760
is it jao m mm do you share the analysis of what it looks like the situation it I

2893
04:10:30.760 --> 04:10:34.359
What I understand from this that you can see pretty clearly that he is feeling shit

2894
04:10:34.359 --> 04:10:37.920
So if you say so, so he is feeling really bad and as I said before

2895
04:10:37.920 --> 04:10:42.199
that I know he takes a lot of drugs he is very much and when taking

2896
04:10:42.199 --> 04:10:45.880
drugs in the way you ventilate a lot and especially so you turn

2897
04:10:45.880 --> 04:10:50.600
to people who may be yes but as he knows may be able to comfort one on a better

2898
04:10:50.600 --> 04:10:54.680
ways, like what we can we can we have we have we can sometimes have very in -depth

2899
04:10:54.680 --> 04:10:59.600
conversations also about yes but like yes, so general snack thus he he

2900
04:10:59.600 --> 04:11:02.000
want to vent he want to say how it is

2901
04:11:02.000 --> 04:11:08.680
Like good thanks so much mm Thank you so much Frida Vallin would you like

2902
04:11:08.680 --> 04:11:14.920
questions no thanks i no questions no no questions anton sundberg yes

2903
04:11:14.920 --> 04:11:20.159
Thanks so I got answers to most so I only have a few short you you

2904
04:11:20.159 --> 04:11:25.640
Have been sitting here in yes a little over than an hour a little more than an hour and a quarter

2905
04:11:25.640 --> 04:11:29.960
eh and you have to say if you would need a break or anything

2906
04:11:29.960 --> 04:11:34.680
But I think this should not take too long eh yes it has been

2907
04:11:34.680 --> 04:11:38.399
A lot of questions about this with the network environment and that claim as well as

2908
04:11:38.399 --> 04:11:41.960
I know that you eh I noticed that you moved to a little under prosecution

2909
04:11:41.960 --> 04:11:45.680
case request when it was mentioned that you were active in the network environment and on the way

2910
04:11:45.680 --> 04:11:51.119
upward in the degrees you just want to comment on the delight that I think

2911
04:11:51.119 --> 04:11:54.800
it a statement only that has no reason really I haven't judged late

2912
04:11:54.800 --> 04:11:59.560
before like me i have no criminal connections but some network no okay you

2913
04:11:59.560 --> 04:12:04.439
are not in something any network no okay and then so I thought we can start with

2914
04:12:04.439 --> 04:12:08.800
any clear and clear question at this time did you know that it would

2915
04:12:08.800 --> 04:12:14.199
take place a shooting then no no eh like suspect you thought either

2916
04:12:14.199 --> 04:12:18.080
Before or below this that there would be a shooting no I had no one

2917
04:12:18.080 --> 04:12:22.319
opportunity to even be able to get a suspicion it was like all all was completely in its

2918
04:12:22.319 --> 04:12:26.840
order etc. Okay but it is still said that you should be like a yes you are a

2919
04:12:26.840 --> 04:12:30.399
the fellow in this is the claim how do you think about it that

2920
04:12:30.399 --> 04:12:34.800
is a pity that they have not been able to investigate forward and find even when witnessing

2921
04:12:34.800 --> 04:12:37.920
have said that there has been a third person on site there after I went

2922
04:12:37.920 --> 04:12:42.000
just like they have not put any important it but yes you sit here today then you get

2923
04:12:42.000 --> 04:12:46.119
say as it is just and so we have talked a lot about what you thought would

2924
04:12:46.119 --> 04:12:49.680
happen this day and as I understand it and this you get right

2925
04:12:49.680 --> 04:12:53.600
me if i'm wrong eh then your view is that you would help

2926
04:12:53.600 --> 04:12:56.760
To convey in this deal It wasn't you who would sell the car

2927
04:12:56.760 --> 04:13:01.399
correctly just just yeah okay and I mentioned the matter Visis here and

2928
04:13:01.399 --> 04:13:04.720
You were also in it a little earlier at the beginning of your interrogation here to

2929
04:13:04.720 --> 04:13:10.640
You work with cars yes what you can say that I work both at work

2930
04:13:10.640 --> 04:13:13.920
So at the hbis company and also at my leisure as well as it is my interest that

2931
04:13:13.920 --> 04:13:17.119
is what i am doing it is all i do from morning to evening almost okay

2932
04:13:17.119 --> 04:13:23.000
and and just so we understand what like and when you say it says so that

2933
04:13:23.000 --> 04:13:26.439
thats all you keep on what are you doing on a daily basis or

2934
04:13:26.439 --> 04:13:31.000
Weekly or how to see very broadly, so everything that has to have cars to

2935
04:13:31.000 --> 04:13:34.640
For example, do the same day n here you pick up that ECR box or that yes but

2936
04:13:34.640 --> 04:13:38.880
something reach some deck to be bought or sold something to be polished something to be washed

2937
04:13:38.880 --> 04:13:42.040
Like the all that concerns with cars really partly because it is a

2938
04:13:42.040 --> 04:13:44.960
interest partly because I know the industry I am as well as good at buying

2939
04:13:44.960 --> 04:13:49.680
maybe cars that for a cheap money or they f a little more expensive etc. so can

2940
04:13:49.680 --> 04:13:56.399
you things about cars yes yes eh is it is something that is like generally known

2941
04:13:56.399 --> 04:14:00.680
or as people know about or is this something like you do in it

2942
04:14:00.680 --> 04:14:05.399
hidden no what most people know about it, so it is usually almost

2943
04:14:05.399 --> 04:14:08.479
all my friends who have any problem with car or should sell a car or and

2944
04:14:08.479 --> 04:14:11.640
so on when they contact me because they know that yes but Armando is in control of

2945
04:14:11.640 --> 04:14:16.880
Most of the industry as well as etc. Okay eh so that so if you need help with

2946
04:14:16.880 --> 04:14:20.600
something with any car then you may be one of the people you call it is one

2947
04:14:20.600 --> 04:14:26.319
Correct view yes okay eh and then so this goal is a lot about

2948
04:14:26.319 --> 04:14:29.600
encrypted chats and so this is no secret etc. eh and you have after all

2949
04:14:29.600 --> 04:14:35.960
told you that you have used El Hamilton Eh during periods eh and only as not

2950
04:14:35.960 --> 04:14:39.920
raw any doubt about this because you might get an incorrect view here

2951
04:14:39.920 --> 04:14:45.239
with signal what is it to you that one in the amount of communication apps like me

2952
04:14:45.239 --> 04:14:49.399
had been laid down on my phone when the police took it it is like so

2953
04:14:49.399 --> 04:14:52.159
As I am interested in cars so I am also interested in yes but different

2954
04:14:52.159 --> 04:14:56.279
Programs Some certain chats or some chat thus applications they can

2955
04:14:56.279 --> 04:15:00.199
Send larger files download larger files it certain benefits certain disadvantages

2956
04:15:00.199 --> 04:15:02.880
You like to try around all that was why I didn't put an extra either

2957
04:15:02.880 --> 04:15:06.359
Ask like when he said down session yes what fun it is new app we can

2958
04:15:06.359 --> 04:15:11.920
test like mm okay so that so just so that I don't know maybe anybody

2959
04:15:11.920 --> 04:15:15.720
who believe it but only we are apparent signals it is something that is only used for

2960
04:15:15.720 --> 04:15:21.479
crime no okay without you use it to what extent used so friends

2961
04:15:21.479 --> 04:15:28.040
all like it's ok m good eh

2962
04:15:28.040 --> 04:15:32.399
and i was thinking like this for this i also know that it was something like you

2963
04:15:32.399 --> 04:15:37.159
reacted to so thought to give you the chance to comment on the eh and the prosecutor showed

2964
04:15:37.159 --> 04:15:41.720
after all a timeline here when they kept their case over different eh as well as when

2965
04:15:41.720 --> 04:15:44.960
chats started by the ended and so there you have some reflections after having

2966
04:15:44.960 --> 04:15:49.760
Like seen the big picture yes actually it I have when you if you

2967
04:15:49.760 --> 04:15:53.640
Look at the chat and read the content and what stands and so on so

2968
04:15:53.640 --> 04:15:57.199
It is quite clear at least from my perspective then that all chats

2969
04:15:57.199 --> 04:16:01.960
that is written or as well as in any way created or closed and so on they are

2970
04:16:01.960 --> 04:16:05.199
almost made in a way so that I should not be able to get any suspicion

2971
04:16:05.199 --> 04:16:09.199
For example, as soon as I get back the phone etc. they create a new

2972
04:16:09.199 --> 04:16:13.279
group chat and do they write this continued about this event that is now going to

2973
04:16:13.279 --> 04:16:16.840
happen like then one could have thought that but if Armando knew what would

2974
04:16:16.840 --> 04:16:21.119
happen what was the meaning of creating a new chat without him then to continue

2975
04:16:21.119 --> 04:16:23.479
discuss

2976
04:16:24.040 --> 04:16:27.960
crime scene to hide this from me you mean these other group chats late

2977
04:16:27.960 --> 04:16:31.119
that you are not in is that are the ones you mean just so we are clear ex yes exactly

2978
04:16:31.119 --> 04:16:34.279
and then the only group chat that I was in was called car which is yes is true

2979
04:16:34.279 --> 04:16:38.920
Agree with what to do where car I will sell a car as well as okay eh

2980
04:16:38.920 --> 04:16:42.920
And but you have told us here you have picked up a car and you have transported

2981
04:16:42.920 --> 04:16:45.840
that a Jordbro started it and refueled it and everything like that where it is

2982
04:16:45.840 --> 04:16:51.000
the as we do, like us, somehow question no eh and you have read

2983
04:16:51.000 --> 04:16:54.319
The tatters and you have, like taken part of the investigation, heard what everyone says here has

2984
04:16:54.319 --> 04:16:57.560
you any thought about why one chooses that you should be the one who drives there

2985
04:16:57.560 --> 04:17:04.080
the car yes eh partly because eh so this would have been a car deal then quite

2986
04:17:04.080 --> 04:17:07.840
Clearly but now they apparently knew that it would not be a deal m eh and

2987
04:17:07.840 --> 04:17:10.760
The only reason I can think about it is that they know I am not judged late

2988
04:17:10.760 --> 04:17:13.760
Before I have no suspicions on crime I have no so -called SPN or anyone

2989
04:17:13.760 --> 04:17:18.199
cops after me or like something that arouses attention they might be thinking

2990
04:17:18.199 --> 04:17:22.239
that so at its height that yes but if the car were to be pungent as is so

2991
04:17:22.239 --> 04:17:26.279
It calm it is a so -called white driver as well as there is nothing on the register and so

2992
04:17:26.279 --> 04:17:29.840
further so that yes it is a rather sensible reason why they have chosen to

2993
04:17:29.840 --> 04:17:33.319
use me etc. but I thought you got some questions here from Åkl but I

2994
04:17:33.319 --> 04:17:37.920
don't really know as I perceived the answer but why this person

2995
04:17:37.920 --> 04:17:43.840
as you pick up then eh why not why not he can just drive the car

2996
04:17:43.840 --> 04:17:47.479
Yes yes when we went down we talked a little because we were buzzing I told you that

2997
04:17:47.479 --> 04:17:51.720
I had dropped my driver's license this summer eh and then he just talked you fuck me but

2998
04:17:51.720 --> 04:17:55.000
I am a driver's license now as well as so it is a pretty big reason for

2999
04:17:55.000 --> 04:17:58.560
he can't drive the car eh but then i think there was something behind it

3000
04:17:58.560 --> 04:18:02.520
also that he wanted to access my phone but a large part of it all is

3001
04:18:02.520 --> 04:18:05.600
After all, he can't drive a car legally on the road as well and that is yes if you

3002
04:18:05.600 --> 04:18:08.800
should do such a thing so it is too much risk just because you you mentioned after all

3003
04:18:08.800 --> 04:18:11.520
anything about that you didn't know if he had a driver's license or not is that you

3004
04:18:11.520 --> 04:18:14.439
then mean that you have not done any driver's license check on him no I have after all

3005
04:18:14.439 --> 04:18:17.239
not put him like but as I perceived it he did not explain

3006
04:18:17.239 --> 04:18:23.279
had a driver's license okay eh and I think of this place for as well as you talk then

3007
04:18:23.279 --> 04:18:28.319
You the people who are there you ever talk about crime when you are in

3008
04:18:28.319 --> 04:18:32.960
The proximity no absolutely not it was pure car talk if you say so like and then

3009
04:18:32.960 --> 04:18:37.080
they had when I smoked m I went away a little man so on there Siggan

3010
04:18:37.080 --> 04:18:39.720
found I went away l so they stood and talked then last they talked about

3011
04:18:39.720 --> 04:18:44.000
I have no idea, but no, so no suspicion or question marks

3012
04:18:44.000 --> 04:18:49.439
Like okay and eh you've got some questions around around when you came to

3013
04:18:49.439 --> 04:18:53.239
the place but your view is that you got somewhere we 210 roughly yes to

3014
04:18:53.239 --> 04:18:59.800
This parking then yes okay and and just to be clear about

3015
04:18:59.800 --> 04:19:04.119
Do you leave on foot you said something around 2135 somewhere there right there

3016
04:19:04.119 --> 04:19:10.399
somewhere yeah ok eh exactly and then you mentioned you went

3017
04:19:10.399 --> 04:19:16.760
through how you got there what you made it eh and but a question only eh when you

3018
04:19:16.760 --> 04:19:20.840
have gone thus the taxi stands there waiting for you when you arrive or

3019
04:19:20.840 --> 04:19:24.880
As for prosecutors, now this showed a picture when he has produced how long

3020
04:19:24.880 --> 04:19:29.159
Time it takes to go etc. Like you jumped straight into the taxi when you arrived it stood

3021
04:19:29.159 --> 04:19:33.159
where or how what happened there as I arrived, I probably waited one two three

3022
04:19:33.159 --> 04:19:37.199
minutes on the taxi would use okay i can believe because i think if i remember

3023
04:19:37.199 --> 04:19:41.680
It was in 2149 so the journey begins so I must have been there sometime 21146

3024
04:19:41.680 --> 04:19:45.760
where somewhere something you remember you waited or something you yes I remember

3025
04:19:45.760 --> 04:19:48.439
After all, I was waiting for the taxi as well as okay so it was a few minutes

3026
04:19:48.439 --> 04:19:55.720
to that too yeah okay good eh and then so this question i think

3027
04:19:55.720 --> 04:19:59.080
Not you actually got so I will set it so as you know existed

3028
04:19:59.080 --> 04:20:03.720
there any weapon in this car that you went there no not as I perceived

3029
04:20:03.720 --> 04:20:08.000
picked up nothing with me to the car he who got into the car that went with me

3030
04:20:08.000 --> 04:20:12.199
he had nothing with him like no no so this box we've seen is

3031
04:20:12.199 --> 04:20:16.080
something that you have like you have I have had no knowledge of it

3032
04:20:16.080 --> 04:20:19.000
then as it seems like i read for the tatters then so it says it

3033
04:20:19.000 --> 04:20:23.399
lies below the driver's seat and yes it is probably the last place you are looking at

3034
04:20:23.399 --> 04:20:27.040
like if you are going to drive the car since you have so I think it was after all

3035
04:20:27.040 --> 04:20:30.319
microfiber cloth that they talk about with reach of weapon oil and box and so on

3036
04:20:30.319 --> 04:20:34.880
that if I had now touched this microfiber cloth eh as I know in all

3037
04:20:34.880 --> 04:20:37.840
Fall from car wash and such microfiber cloth it picks up absolutely

3038
04:20:37.840 --> 04:20:41.840
everything it picks up everything like that and where i can not s they have found

3039
04:20:41.840 --> 04:20:45.279
something it reach or fingerprints or something that is connected to me on something

3040
04:20:45.279 --> 04:20:48.520
criminal at all like so no ok so you haven't seen any weapon

3041
04:20:48.520 --> 04:20:53.560
at all no you have not have you handled any weapon eh as well as either

3042
04:20:53.560 --> 04:20:57.359
shortly before this or in connection with this no you have handled any weapon

3043
04:20:57.359 --> 04:21:03.279
After this no okay eh and it is talked about this one you were

3044
04:21:03.279 --> 04:21:08.960
Also on it about this black Nissan you were left in the parking lot we yes

3045
04:21:08.960 --> 04:21:13.040
When it should then have come where I did not see it no but he talks about that

3046
04:21:13.040 --> 04:21:16.680
some car would come so i guess that is that car then so it is like

3047
04:21:16.680 --> 04:21:20.080
a yes qualified guess on your part that it could be the one that

3048
04:21:20.080 --> 04:21:28.680
he then talked about most likely yes okay eh mm and then I guess but only for

3049
04:21:28.680 --> 04:21:32.040
clear then you have not received any weapon from that car absolutely not

3050
04:21:32.040 --> 04:21:38.399
no no eh mm and in this it includes that

3051
04:21:38.399 --> 04:21:42.680
eh the assertion is that you should instruct these people on site

3052
04:21:42.680 --> 04:21:46.199
about how to commit crimes and how to escape from there what do you have to say about

3053
04:21:46.199 --> 04:21:51.080
that no that I have not done I have had extremely limited conversation

3054
04:21:51.080 --> 04:21:57.880
with them it was like hi hey yes how is the situation like okay eh yes so if we should

3055
04:21:57.880 --> 04:22:01.439
summarize your story so you have you picked up this car the thought it and

3056
04:22:01.439 --> 04:22:05.359
driven in to the parking lot it is correct mm eh and you have picked up one to person

3057
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:10.040
during the trip you've been leaning from in your phone exactly you are at

3058
04:22:10.040 --> 04:22:15.520
the parking for about 20 25 minutes something that way mm and eh and you

3059
04:22:15.520 --> 04:22:18.760
have not throughout that time you have not discussed crime with anyone

3060
04:22:18.760 --> 04:22:23.199
is right right just fine thanks then i have not reach more questions are someone

3061
04:22:23.199 --> 04:22:28.080
Another should have questions more from the prosecutor a question only I became

3062
04:22:28.080 --> 04:22:32.840
a little that there are details now i should say so that

3063
04:22:32.840 --> 04:22:37.760
But how what was the car snack you had with the guys you said it was just

3064
04:22:37.760 --> 04:22:41.119

3065
04:22:41.119 --> 04:22:45.960
Followed with me You stood talking to the one who came with you yes ok they stood

3066
04:22:45.960 --> 04:22:49.040

04:23:50.479 --> 04:23:54.600
Like but they did not look like the picture found in the preliminary investigation I know

Not if you've seen it but it didn't look like that when I left the car in all

3082
04:23:57.840 --> 04:24:02.920
case no but how did it be out then it was may have been that I put it in

04:28:43.600 --> 04:28:49.479
left and toward right they go to the right yes they go toward right price okay you see

3138
04:28:49.479 --> 04:28:57.119
where they take the road then then no no okay you see how they look

3139
04:28:57.119 --> 04:29:03.880

looked that

3143
04:29:22.159 --> 04:29:28.279
be no but i told i think the young ones

3144
04:29:28.279 --> 04:29:35.319
So you look at bodies they don't have they are not as adults as you see it I

3145
04:29:35.319 --> 04:29:39.680
so at least think I don't know if I'm right or wrong but it was

3146
04:29:39.680 --> 04:29:45.399
maybe young because it was their bodies like the body not as marked

3147
04:29:45.399 --> 04:29:52.479
They are not adults yes sorry can take the last they looked young yes why did you

3168
04:31:54.000 --> 04:31:59.479
By at this parking lot that the motorhome stood on yes eh then I thought you

3170
04:32:04.080 --> 04:32:09.159
And so maybe I ask some questions after that yes I had a little trouble to

3171
04:32:09.159 --> 04:32:13.319
Fall asleep so we were this Thursday evening I was

3172
04:32:13.319 --> 04:32:19.359
want to remember so I fell asleep t over and then I woke up right after then that I

3173
04:32:19.359 --> 04:32:24.600
heard bangs they were sharper than

3174
04:32:32.800 --> 04:32:39.159
fireworks I up and look and then I pulled up and look out and so yeah

3175
04:32:39.159 --> 04:32:43.840
Then I saw two people moving in the garden

3176
04:32:46.479 --> 04:32:54.920
Who disappeared went right fast and shortly after that, the police came

3177
04:32:54.920 --> 04:32:59.040
try to recount here the police but then I thought they were in the wrong place against

3178
04:32:59.040 --> 04:33:02.600
What I heard the bangs from for direction so then I called them and

3179
04:33:02.600 --> 04:33:08.320
Tips I think that down there is something has happened and then came a police officer

3180
04:33:08.320 --> 04:33:13.760
And then we went around and look so I could point out where they had touched

3181
04:33:13.760 --> 04:33:18.000
sig and then we find some weapons under my car

3182
04:33:18.000 --> 04:33:22.119
Also mm so it was all the whole thing mm

3183
04:33:22.119 --> 04:33:27.199
eh and how long after you hear these bangs did you see these people

3184
04:33:27.199 --> 04:33:33.760
about three four minutes maybe mm okay and then you saw the first time yes

3185
04:33:33.760 --> 04:33:37.959
After all, it was three going through the window yes and where in the garden they were then up then

3186
04:33:37.959 --> 04:33:41.959
at the trees and for us who have not been there you can describe what is here

3187
04:33:41.959 --> 04:33:46.320
The trees somewhere they lie out with the blockstone road etc. Okay so that it is

3188
04:33:46.320 --> 04:33:52.320
Like a spruce hedge etc. Okay and do you see what they do in the garden no it was dark

3189
04:33:52.320 --> 04:33:57.359
and hidden they were well -clad so that it was hard to see mm okay and what

3190
04:33:57.359 --> 04:34:03.320
How far from about would you say 30 40 m okay eh but you don't see what they

3191
04:34:03.320 --> 04:34:07.680
do there at eh at the trees then as you described yes they took well through

3192
04:34:07.680 --> 04:34:14.680
The bushes just ran on I think okay ehm and saw you you said it was

3193
04:34:14.680 --> 04:34:19.760
dark and that they were dark -clad you saw how they looked otherwise no the only thing I

3194
04:34:19.760 --> 04:34:25.279
could read out really it was probably colorful shawl that they had around one

3195
04:34:25.279 --> 04:34:32.400
had around the face etc. what was it for shawl then s a type rastafari color okay red

3196
04:34:32.400 --> 04:34:38.080
green yellow what did you say a red -green yellow okay but was it like a what was it for eh

3197
04:34:38.080 --> 04:34:46.719
garment a type of scarf scarf that was wrapped around yes around the head okay but

3198
04:34:46.719 --> 04:34:52.279
nothing else that you saw eh did you perceive any age at

3199
04:34:52.279 --> 04:34:57.400
them no but i thought they looked younger anyway mm and why did you do it

3200
04:34:57.400 --> 04:35:01.520
the assessments it is the movement pattern okay but when you say younger what is

3201
04:35:01.520 --> 04:35:07.680
for the type of age then younger than 20 okay but not we can't say more than so no that

3202
04:35:07.680 --> 04:35:12.799
is very difficult to say mm eh you have received some questions about this in police interrogation

3203
04:35:12.799 --> 04:35:18.879
Do you remember what you have said then yes it is a long time so yes I understand it but it

3204
04:35:18.879 --> 04:35:24.039
is nothing you can remember eh what you said i can only read it

3205
04:35:24.039 --> 04:35:30.561
then fast ehm it is a hearing then held eh on November 14

3206
04:35:30.561 --> 04:35:36.199
eh and then it is on page 428 EH and then the police ask then you would be able to

3207
04:35:36.199 --> 04:35:40.639
Appreciate the age of the guys and so you say no younger than 13 to 14

3208
04:35:40.639 --> 04:35:44.480
Eh after 16 so you start to get a little more determined in the movement pattern and so say

3209
04:35:44.480 --> 04:35:50.279
you would guess they were at the age of 14,15 of years yes it is about so you mins it

3210
04:35:50.279 --> 04:35:52.439
Okay

3211

3237
04:38:29.600 --> 04:38:36.520
movement or people in the car yes and then we took our bags with

3289
04:44:04.160 --> 04:44:09.480
in the phone and smoke and that was when you came back from Ika maxi mm mm

3290
04:44:09.480 --> 04:44:16.878

3291
04:44:16.878 --> 04:44:22.560

you saw him stand on the phone and smoke talk on the phone and smoke yes but exactly

3294
04:44:35.638 --> 04:44:42.000
Mm and if I just so I understand it right it was the trip to the max it took

3295
04:44:42.000 --> 04:44:49.718
about 20 30 minutes type mm you remember when it was you went out and saw

3296
04:44:49.718 --> 04:44:53.200
the guys first what time was

3297
04:44:53.400 --> 04:45:02.040
then could be nine nine yes so somewhere at half past ten where somewhere i would

3298
04:45:02.040 --> 04:45:07.000
Tip yes then I understand

3299
04:45:07.400 --> 04:45:16.040
Eh just that and then you went and scouted a bit you said yes and then

3300
04:45:16.040 --> 04:45:21.080
Did you perceive that you saw the guys it was when you saw the guys by the car

3301
04:45:21.080 --> 04:45:25.958
or was it after the shooting you saw the guys we the car after the shooting

3302
04:45:25.958 --> 04:45:30.440
After yes after we heard the bangs m excuse it was me who concluded

3303
04:45:30.440 --> 04:45:35.680
the shooting but I think it may be that for it yes etc. eh and then you saw

3304
04:45:35.680 --> 04:45:41.920
The guys away in the car just did you see if they were two or three

3305
04:45:41.920 --> 04:45:47.798
I can't say I don't remember no if it was two or three no

3306
04:45:47.798 --> 04:45:54.718
no it quite far from our house to where the car was parked etc. so that you

3307
04:45:54.718 --> 04:46:01.040
barely saw but if i summarize as i understood you you go

3308
04:46:01.040 --> 04:46:05.840
out at nine o'clock with your daughter we will go and shop then you see

3309
04:46:05.840 --> 04:46:12.000
Two young guys that you perceived that they are nervous etc. eh you go away and go and

3310
04:46:12.000 --> 04:46:19.440
Shop you are gone 20 30 minutes when you come back then you see a little older

3311
04:46:19.440 --> 04:46:25.520
guy standing in about the same place where you saw the young guys before exactly

3312
04:46:25.520 --> 04:46:30.840
Although he stands and smokes and talks on the phone etc. and then you go in and then so

3313
04:46:30.840 --> 04:46:36.480
If you look out a little then you take a cup of coffee on the balcony yes on the back yes on

3314
04:46:36.480 --> 04:46:42.480
The back yes excuse yes and then it slams mm and then you go and look

3315
04:46:42.480 --> 04:46:49.120
and zooms in towards the car and then you see that there are people in the car in the car

3316
04:46:49.120 --> 04:46:54.000
Yes just then we were also doubtful whether we would call or not to the police

3317
04:46:54.000 --> 04:46:59.000
and tell us all the but that

3318
04:47:00.840 --> 04:47:06.400
Did you stay there thank you so much is reaching another who wants to ask questions yes

3319
04:47:06.400 --> 04:47:11.440
Thank you yes, goodbye Ronnie Hello It will be a bit strange to sit like this but Anton

3320
04:47:11.440 --> 04:47:14.200
named my named at least i am one of the defenders in this goal i have

3321
04:47:14.200 --> 04:47:18.878
some some control questions just so we get things right and properly understand

3322
04:47:18.878 --> 04:47:21.440
Is it something you don't understand or don't understand my questions then it's just that

3323
04:47:21.440 --> 04:47:26.400
Saying is the most important thing that it will be right and real jo eh like me

3324
04:47:26.400 --> 04:47:32.638
perceived it now when you got questions from the prosecutor so did you think that you

3325
04:47:32.638 --> 04:47:41.958
Went to Ica Maxi at about eh nine o'clock it is true yes and

3326
04:47:41.958 --> 04:47:48.798
eh remember you remember what you've said in i

3327
04:47:48.798 --> 04:47:53.480
Police interrogation about what time eh like this could be no no and then

3328
04:47:53.480 --> 04:47:57.520
shall come with the permission of the court we where the page

3329
04:47:57.520 --> 04:48:01.840
438 It is then a hearing held with you then the 15th so there and I know that

3330
04:48:01.840 --> 04:48:06.320
is a long time so that's why we read up and then you tell you here in the third

3331
04:48:06.320 --> 04:48:09.760
Cuts that Ronnie would ride and panta cans at Ika Maxi with her daughter then is

3332
04:48:09.760 --> 04:48:13.718
at about 21 they talked about that they would really

3333
04:48:13.718 --> 04:48:19.878
ride may be that it was maybe 2110 then rather than nine yes yes yes

3334
04:48:19.878 --> 04:48:26.040
okay eh and then you told you now that you met this man eh that stood and

3335
04:48:26.040 --> 04:48:32.440
smoked and talked phone eh when you came back from Ika Maxi MM

3336
04:48:32.440 --> 04:48:38.240
is that how I perceived, do you remember what you said in police interrogation the day after then about

3337
04:48:38.240 --> 04:48:42.600
when you met this man no remember no and then again with

3338
04:48:42.600 --> 04:48:47.760
the right of the court so the same interrogation in then it eh

3339
04:48:47.760 --> 04:48:54.160
eh eh fourth paragraph on the same page yes eh and then you tell you that when Ronnie and

3340
04:48:54.160 --> 04:48:59.240
His daughter Eh goes out and will take the car and drive towards Maxi so he meets a man in

3341
04:48:59.240 --> 04:49:02.200
about 20 2 years of age thus the difference there

3342
04:49:02.200 --> 04:49:08.440
in from it may be that it was yes then if I said it then then it was a lot

3343
04:49:08.440 --> 04:49:12.718
The fresh then eh I understand I understand yes but that is why we ask questions yes it

3344
04:49:12.718 --> 04:49:18.120
is light and no just no exact eh

3345
04:49:18.520 --> 04:49:26.920
And then you got the question here eh and then got

3346
04:49:26.920 --> 04:49:30.840
me i don't really remember what you said what time what time did you think it was when you

3347
04:49:30.840 --> 04:49:36.040
come back to when you came back then after shopping at Ika Maxi it can

3348
04:49:36.040 --> 04:49:43.718
It be 30 minutes after yes eh prosecuting I think said said 2130 to you eh time

3349
04:49:43.718 --> 04:49:50.320
Are you sure at that time or how no you do not take forgive n you will

3350
04:49:50.320 --> 04:49:54.040
back when to shop no I don't know it it didn't take that long in all

3351
04:49:54.040 --> 04:49:58.638
case was when we got back then yes exactly

3352
04:49:58.638 --> 04:50:04.520
Eh but yes and then it is again on a deviation then it is on the next page san

3353
04:50:04.520 --> 04:50:13.160
439 in the second paragraph where mm eh last sentence in and paragraph there when Ronnie

3354
04:50:13.160 --> 04:50:17.958
Coming home again or I read the whole for the context when Ronnie comes home again

3355
04:50:17.958 --> 04:50:22.760
so he hits headlights straight into the gray car and then all three sit in

3356
04:50:22.760 --> 04:50:26.958
the car with hoods over your head and some kind of half -stock buff up toward the nose

3357
04:50:26.958 --> 04:50:32.558
It was a little before 22.00 mm it may have been so that it was closer to 22 there

3358
04:50:32.558 --> 04:50:39.958
then yes it can be yes yes eh and then we and only for the context then

3359
04:50:39.958 --> 04:50:45.480
So we at the time of the hearing that was then held with you on the 14th then just before midnight

3360
04:50:45.480 --> 04:50:50.480
There you mentioned the time 2150 could be somewhere between 2150 and

3361
04:50:50.480 --> 04:50:56.400
2200 made this observation then when you come back okay you remember you

3362
04:50:56.400 --> 04:51:04.080
have said that you have said so yeah okay good eh and in this paragraph I read

3363
04:51:04.080 --> 04:51:07.280
up here too for this I got to ask from the prosecutor and there you were after all

3364
04:51:07.280 --> 04:51:10.718
A little uncertain so you mentioned what I read up there that there were three pieces

3365
04:51:10.718 --> 04:51:15.080
that then sat in the car there somewhere with 2150 and 2200 it may be that it

3366
04:51:15.080 --> 04:51:20.040
were three people sitting in the car then yes and this is an eh as I understood it

3367
04:51:20.040 --> 04:51:22.958
right on the prosecutor's question so it was this observed you have done after I have

3368

3370
04:51:32.798 --> 04:51:38.200

3382
04:52:37.240 --> 04:52:42.718
And I thought I will start by asking you to tell you a little what you remember v what

3383
04:52:42.718 --> 04:52:46.840
did you get for entrance values and what did you do for action etc. I will

3384
04:52:46.840 --> 04:52:50.680
Certainly ask some questions yes it goes great yes but current passport so

3385
04:52:50.680 --> 04:52:55.480
I served as an external commander in the police area in Stockholm south etc. and then

3386
04:52:55.480 --> 04:53:01.000
were alerted out bangs in Jordbro I think it was the depth mile or

3387
04:53:01.000 --> 04:53:06.600
something similar to the address eh was called eh and was pretty quickly appointed by

3388
04:53:06.600 --> 04:53:13.878
on -duty commander to police operations manager EH and within the framework of the operation we received

3389
04:53:13.878 --> 04:53:20.360
to a lot of resources etc. that were applied to the effort and my initial

3390
04:53:20.360 --> 04:53:25.120
directive was to locate the crime scene ensure no one is

3391
04:53:25.120 --> 04:53:31.240
physically damaged eh and thereafter begin life -saving action care if it should

3392
04:53:31.240 --> 04:53:34.558
needed eh and then then secure

3393
04:53:34.558 --> 04:53:40.480
the preliminary investigation etc. parallel to this so I chose

3394
04:53:40.480 --> 04:53:44.120
that the patrols that would be closest would handle the crime scene and then

3395
04:53:44.120 --> 04:53:48.520
Supply resource would set up in strategically good places in order to

3396
04:53:48.520 --> 04:53:54.320
start hunting for perpetrators and so I appointed a

3397
04:53:54.320 --> 04:53:59.120
Police colleague to site manager eh crime scene but fairly quickly so

3398
04:53:59.120 --> 04:54:03.320
landed one or more resources at the crime scene and then got feedback

3399
04:54:03.320 --> 04:54:09.360
that there was eh most of the sleeves outside the home and you could see bullet holes into

3400
04:54:09.360 --> 04:54:16.240
The dwelling eh then I don't really remember was in the facade bullet holes were like

3401
04:54:16.240 --> 04:54:21.080
But then immediately after that was where was my directive to step into the home

3402
04:54:21.080 --> 04:54:25.280
ensure no one is physically injured it is always most important eh fairly quickly

3403
04:54:25.280 --> 04:54:30.600
Then I got from my colleagues that they had contact with two plaintiffs about

3404
04:54:30.600 --> 04:54:34.360
I remember correctly and they were physically

3405
04:54:34.798 --> 04:54:41.040
unharmed then i felt yes but good crime scene we have control of eh

3406
04:54:41.040 --> 04:54:45.558
The colleague who was the eh site manager for the crime scene is superb in that

3407
04:54:45.558 --> 04:54:50.840
Detail that work then we started hunting for perpetrators the majority

3408
04:54:50.840 --> 04:54:55.958
resources dog drivers if I min's right we had helicopter in

3409
04:54:55.958 --> 04:55:02.520
The air yes and at some point I do not remember exactly how far behind but during the stake

3410
04:55:02.520 --> 04:55:08.320
so two individuals eh young guys were checked relative when the crime scene I

3411
04:55:08.320 --> 04:55:14.160
do not remember exactly how far from but but relatively close for eh eh and then assessed

3412
04:55:14.160 --> 04:55:18.878
I those who are quite interesting in the context of the effort when controlled so were

3413
04:55:18.878 --> 04:55:24.798
they don't together but eh yes they have bit apart but not too far my

3414
04:55:24.798 --> 04:55:29.280
Directive then was to obtain personal data on the individuals EH Secure

3415
04:55:29.280 --> 04:55:34.680
their phones and strive to get into those cartridges worked on

3416
04:55:34.680 --> 04:55:38.600
That pretty quickly I got personal information and if I remember correctly like that

3417
04:55:38.600 --> 04:55:44.718
was a 14 years one was 16 and I think both were resident at Lidingö late

3418
04:55:44.718 --> 04:55:48.920
Could any of them or the two not really recount what they were doing in

3419
04:55:48.920 --> 04:55:52.958
Jordbro I did not judge it as a huge tree anyway which did

3420
04:55:52.958 --> 04:55:57.840
that they became even more interesting in this one you got into either a phone

3421
04:55:57.840 --> 04:56:02.718
or both phones eh in any of the phones so had any of these

3422
04:56:02.718 --> 04:56:07.240
The guys entered the address at the crime scene itself if I remember correct

3423
04:56:07.240 --> 04:56:11.958
it some kind of map app you had written eh it on and either in the same

3424
04:56:11.958 --> 04:56:15.120
phone or in the other phone there was a picture of these two

3425
04:56:15.120 --> 04:56:18.718
the individuals together it then made me could tie them to each other

3426
04:56:18.718 --> 04:56:22.480
and to the crime scene and then I decided on

3427
04:56:22.480 --> 04:56:26.840
that the 16-year-old would be arrested and the 14-year-old would be brought for interrogation

3428
04:56:26.840 --> 04:56:32.760
or picked up for interrogation eh shortly thereafter where my directive to be both

3429
04:56:32.760 --> 04:56:39.000
hands would be coated with cardboard bags in order to secure gunpowder if they had eh

3430
04:56:39.000 --> 04:56:43.440
had to do with the shooting but they were handled by

3431
04:56:43.440 --> 04:56:49.440
patrol sometime during the effort so a bag is found I think it is a

3432
04:56:49.440 --> 04:56:54.200
dog driver who searched it eh and then it is looking for

3433
04:56:54.200 --> 04:57:00.840
Humanity bag Eh found I think there were clothes in that bag and I

3434
04:57:00.840 --> 04:57:06.280
could not put out that eh it was the perpetrators if one had been able to change

3435
04:57:06.280 --> 04:57:10.600
If so I decided that it would be taken in seizure in order to hna for

3436
04:57:10.600 --> 04:57:16.480
Technical examination eh in parallel with this so we got

3437
04:57:16.480 --> 04:57:20.400
from a witness who calls in and says that two young guys had been found

3438
04:57:20.400 --> 04:57:26.558
on his eh garden if I min's right we sent a patrol there if I miss right

3439
04:57:26.558 --> 04:57:30.958
so he lived relatively close to the crime scene anyway eh and the patrol task was

3440
04:57:30.958 --> 04:57:34.798
to hold interrogation with him and demonstrate one last position on them so that our

3441
04:57:34.798 --> 04:57:39.120
Dog driver could start searching man checked in the garden

3442
04:57:39.120 --> 04:57:45.638
eh that witness had a caravan or camper parked h to it so were found

3443
04:57:45.638 --> 04:57:51.480
the two eh gun -like objects and then I decided that it would be blocked

3444
04:57:51.480 --> 04:57:56.958
of where eh in order for our forensic technicians to

3445
04:57:56.958 --> 04:58:01.680
deal with the weapons afterwards

3446
04:58:01.680 --> 04:58:05.360
yes eh then it was another witness that

3447
04:58:05.360 --> 04:58:10.760
had any video surveillance from its front door out towards a walkway I remember

3448
04:58:10.760 --> 04:58:14.638
and there you could see two young guys either go toward the crime scene or

3449
04:58:14.638 --> 04:58:19.958
From the crime scene I don't really remember and if I remember just right now

3450
04:58:19.958 --> 04:58:24.320
did the clothes they wore in that video with the clothes that we

3451
04:58:24.320 --> 04:58:30.680
found in in the pine I think it was as I remember correctly and parallel to

3452
04:58:30.680 --> 04:58:36.320
This is so the work at the crime scene it was yes but sleeves you held interrogation

3453
04:58:36.320 --> 04:58:41.920
With witnesses eh man started Dörk Knacking we activated of course

3454
04:58:41.920 --> 04:58:48.000
Poä cameras in the immediate area occupied them with resource so that they began to check

3455
04:58:48.000 --> 04:58:53.558
Ehm yes so in summary we managed to control two individuals who were for

3456
04:58:53.558 --> 04:58:58.240
us who were interesting within the framework of the preliminary investigation we found a bag with

3457
04:58:58.240 --> 04:59:03.920
clothing that I judged were interesting two weapons lots of sleeves outside

3458
04:59:03.920 --> 04:59:08.440
the crime scene we got a crime scene

3459
04:59:10.160 --> 04:59:15.878
Even a gun dog for searching more sleeves to it

3460
04:59:15.878 --> 04:59:21.040
Here after all this, the effort went down in intensity eh both of these

3461
04:59:21.040 --> 04:59:25.120
the guys were in transported to Flemmingsberg one to the arrest the other

3462
04:59:25.120 --> 04:59:32.400
to any interrogation room Man started eh reporting into Flemmingsberg eh

3463
04:59:32.400 --> 04:59:37.280
Remaining on site so we had our EH blocked off areas pending techniques

3464
04:59:37.280 --> 04:59:42.120
And sometime in that vban I went to Flem for the purpose of yes but help

3465
04:59:42.120 --> 04:59:46.760
with the documentation and sew the bag together in there

3466
04:59:47.000 --> 04:59:53.400
ehm what I remember too quickly we got eh during the effort

3467
04:59:53.400 --> 04:59:58.000
that the crime scene that it was the parents of

3468
04:59:58.000 --> 05:00:04.760
An individual who was abroad but was interesting in about for Foxtrot

3469
05:00:04.760 --> 05:00:08.718
the conflict that we understood that he was the target in some way it was

3470
05:00:08.718 --> 05:00:11.958
the hypothesis we worked on

3471
05:00:12.320 --> 05:00:16.120
Yes but in short it is kind of what I remember I can say it was not like that

3472
05:00:16.120 --> 05:00:21.958
short moves it was extremely extensive and well reported eh i was thinking now was you

3473
05:00:21.958 --> 05:00:27.280
Inside that at the end eh I have noted in events the report

3474
05:00:27.280 --> 05:00:34.400
that it is noted from EH RLC then that S Frank address exactly what does it mean

3475
05:00:34.400 --> 05:00:38.760
For us who are not police officers it means that it is an address that is interesting

3476
05:00:38.760 --> 05:00:43.680
within the framework of our EH conflicts and above all then this wave of violence that

3477
05:00:43.680 --> 05:00:49.120
who shielded us in Stockholm linked to primarily the Foot conflicts and that is

3478
05:00:49.120 --> 05:00:55.798
usually an address on which one has either eh solid surveillance on or supervision of as far as

3479
05:00:55.798 --> 05:01:00.600
of time or good for us to know if there is jobs going out there then can

3480
05:01:00.600 --> 05:01:06.760
be of dignity so within the framework of the conflicts so it is interesting

3481
05:01:08.240 --> 05:01:12.520
Thank you great here is someone else who wants to ask questions

3482
05:01:12.520 --> 05:01:16.840

05:33:34.360 --> 05:33:39.200
the idea that he would pour gasoline eh with the help of towels

3797
05:33:39.200 --> 05:33:45.240
or rags through the mailbox and light on eh and then pour this whole

3798
05:33:45.240 --> 05:33:50.160
the way out to the gate then as they described it

3799
05:33:50.160 --> 05:33:56.160
Eh but they succeeded then eh stop him and then they had taken

3800
05:33:56.160 --> 05:34:00.400
Though him and abused him and threatened him that he would not come

3801
05:34:00.400 --> 05:34:07.400

3806
05:34:30.480 --> 05:34:38.280
handduka they said ehm and then it was that he would pour on these rags

3807
05:34:38.280 --> 05:34:42.320
or towels or whatever it was and throw it into the mailbox and light on so

3808
05:34:42.320 --> 05:34:48.400
that like it was lit like that and then he would pour eh petrol then all the way off

3809
05:34:48.400 --> 05:34:54.000
the front door down to the cards so that, like everything would burn

3810
05:34:54.000 --> 05:35:02.480
up okay how did you react to it eh we were, of course, of course, etc. they said

3812
05:35:07.920 --> 05:35:12.798
managed to stop him because he had received eh this mission out of someone

05:35:12.798 --> 05:35:17.280
older eh and then they managed to stop him and abuse him but they know as well

3814
05:35:17.280 --> 05:35:20.200

05:37:30.520 --> 05:37:38.080
Eh how did your life work you could go to school and could take care of jobs and eh eh

3838
05:37:38.080 --> 05:37:42.878
I didn't go to work the two days after I think it was just for

3839
05:37:42.878 --> 05:37:46.920
that one did not want to be in the area and did not want to move as in the same

3840
05:37:46.920 --> 05:37:50.798
movement patterns because I have very square life so I take the same bus

3841
05:37:50.798 --> 05:37:57.200
every morning the same bus home and then you were afraid that they may have I know

3842
05:37:57.200 --> 05:38:01.240
Not as well as followed this in any way so that you were afraid and like that

3843
05:38:01.240 --> 05:38:07.080
You might be persecuted or people knew where you lived and a little so eh but

3844
05:38:07.080 --> 05:38:10.558
Then we didn't live at home and then it was that I could then I went to

3845
05:38:10.558 --> 05:38:14.480
The job as usual that I did not move in the same area

3846
05:38:14.480 --> 05:38:20.638
mm you have told you a little about being scared there was something more in it

3847
05:38:20.638 --> 05:38:26.440
the experience around yes both this gas tube and that

3848
05:38:26.440 --> 05:38:32.160
that stood in the stairs but also to be identified as a target for this

3849
05:38:32.160 --> 05:38:40.798
through these boys eh you become very paranoid etc. eh you are a little

3850
05:38:40.798 --> 05:38:46.958
more cautious a little more vigilant over as well as their surroundings and also to yes

3851
05:38:46.958 --> 05:38:53.840
am a little questioning to every young guy you see outdoors as well as so that

3852
05:38:53.840 --> 05:38:58.400
yes then it was that it was

3853
05:38:58.520 --> 05:39:03.558
Eh there were conflicts within the family as well to

3854
05:39:03.558 --> 05:39:09.200
that yes you stood against each other and someone did not speak the truth and a little so

3855
05:39:09.200 --> 05:39:15.558
as yes it destroyed pretty much ok affecting that relationships

3856
05:39:15.558 --> 05:39:22.798
yes say something more about it eh for this was aimed at my little brother ehm but

3857
05:39:22.798 --> 05:39:28.400
He claimed that he did not or still claim that he does not know anything

3858
05:39:28.400 --> 05:39:32.120
If the whole situation or thus he does not know why it could happen against

3859
05:39:32.120 --> 05:39:36.240
him just and then it becomes that we others become very questioning that he

3860
05:39:36.240 --> 05:39:41.958
is the only guy in the family and eh the whole wave of violence has been against guys

3861
05:39:41.958 --> 05:39:47.280
In principle, so that then you do not believe in him though it may be that he

3862
05:39:47.280 --> 05:39:52.120
Speaks truth etc. Okay

3863
05:39:52.638 --> 05:40:02.120
Thanks etc. Some questions no questions t no questions no then we finish prime crime

3864
05:40:02.120 --> 05:40:07.558
DSE is recording started this is something you want to start by saying yes yes

3865
05:40:07.558 --> 05:40:11.240
Tell us about all this eh should I tell yourself yes you can tell yourself

3866
05:40:11.240 --> 05:40:15.958
do it first mm eh i was at i b on hb home and family homes almost all my

3867
05:40:15.958 --> 05:40:20.558
life and i sat on my hvb home and we talked pretty much about making money

3868
05:40:20.558 --> 05:40:24.600
and crime and stuff where there were some others there who are doing such

3869
05:40:24.600 --> 05:40:30.840
eh since i have a friend on my hvb home eh police have seized his phone so

3870
05:40:30.840 --> 05:40:34.600
he uses my phone instead of n he wins on someone

3871
05:40:34.600 --> 05:40:38.080
signal gray he told me from nowhere just fixed job to you

3872
05:40:38.080 --> 05:40:41.958
since he showed me his naps he had or my nap he had written like this yes

3873
05:40:41.958 --> 05:40:45.400
And then since I didn't think much about it I didn't even know what it was about

3874
05:40:45.400 --> 05:40:50.440
them and i thought okay it's sure i didn't even get myself eh since i

3875
05:40:50.440 --> 05:40:54.680
Received this phone I checked It said I would burn burn stuff

3876
05:40:54.680 --> 05:40:58.280
so I just ok so I don't even want to do it myself really I think

3877
05:40:58.280 --> 05:41:02.320
eh but I was still trying to persuade myself so it felt like I wanted to

3878
05:41:02.320 --> 05:41:09.320
do it eh since i took a bus to kronfors eh and i took a earlier

3879
05:41:09.320 --> 05:41:14.040
the took from Kramf because I was pretty stressed eh so instead of having it

3880
05:41:14.040 --> 05:41:18.798
real took as i one was going to take so i took an earlier eh since when i came

3881
05:41:18.798 --> 05:41:22.440
Until Sundsval eh I was very stressed I didn't really know what I

3882
05:41:22.440 --> 05:41:26.840
would do but thought so I still tried to persuade myself since I

3883
05:41:26.840 --> 05:41:31.320
comes up to Stockholm eh since I meet this girl who is on it

3884
05:41:31.320 --> 05:41:35.920
car what is it called picturel or what it is called eh since when i already understood then

3885
05:41:35.920 --> 05:41:40.240
Self that I didn't want to do this I can't do this eh

3886
05:41:40.240 --> 05:41:44.200
and when I was pretty stressed and I was just trying to come up with some way and

3887
05:41:44.200 --> 05:41:48.920
wrapping me out of eh i will come up to this apartment eh i see that it

3888
05:41:48.920 --> 05:41:52.600
lies a gun where eh I don't know if the gun is real or fake but I

3889
05:41:52.600 --> 05:41:55.760
guess it is FT because there is something that stands out in the barrel so I

3890
05:41:55.760 --> 05:41:59.718
Thinking it is certainly any airsoft or something so I what the name is I pull

3891
05:41:59.718 --> 05:42:04.080
this one what is the mantle of this thing backwards so I happen to access someone

3892
05:42:04.080 --> 05:42:08.160
button since it stuck eh somehow since i'm filming with my phone

3893
05:42:08.160 --> 05:42:11.840
eh think like this yes what I thought I don't know what I thought I had nothing

3894
05:42:11.840 --> 05:42:15.000
better for me really but I think it was cool or something and

3895
05:42:15.000 --> 05:42:17.920
I didn't even know for sure even when I saw that it was a bullet I knew

3896
05:42:17.920 --> 05:42:21.320
not even certainly if they were genuine eh because I have seen on tiktok that it

3897
05:42:21.320 --> 05:42:26.200
there are such guns with so close to it looks like the cartridge but it is plastic eh

3898
05:42:26.200 --> 05:42:30.718
Since I filmed I pulled back I pressed this button again since it

3899
05:42:30.718 --> 05:42:35.958
Went back eh since I thought yes since I was done with the video since I was thinking

3900
05:42:35.958 --> 05:42:39.920
I didn't think so much about it since I checked I pulled the b mantle again late

3901
05:42:39.920 --> 05:42:45.240
I saw that there was some bullet that was stuck eh in what is the name so I

3902
05:42:45.240 --> 05:42:49.478
Thought oh it might not be so good and I was quite terrified now thought

3903
05:42:49.478 --> 05:42:54.520
maybe someone will kill me eh so i called him who wrote to me

3904
05:42:54.520 --> 05:42:59.000
on signal I don't remember what his name is eh I wrote to he I thought it is

3905
05:42:59.000 --> 05:43:02.520
calmly did something he told me it's quiet and then i have bv pretty

3906
05:43:02.520 --> 05:43:08.520
what is it out what is it called yes or what the hell what is it called

3907
05:43:08.520 --> 05:43:14.320
I was not a happy shitty sounded huh

3908
05:43:14.320 --> 05:43:17.520
relieved yes exactly exactly it got pretty relieved so i put back this

3909
05:43:17.520 --> 05:43:22.478
the gun where it lay and i never redded it again because i didn't dare eh

3910
05:43:22.478 --> 05:43:26.160
Then they told me it was time so I was very tense and I knew

3911
05:43:26.160 --> 05:43:29.478
not and before they asked me when it was time they asked me too

3912
05:43:29.478 --> 05:43:33.400
wanted tramadol eh i told them you didn't want tramadol i told you

3913
05:43:33.400 --> 05:43:36.160
them because it was to have not taken tramadol before and I didn't know about

3914
05:43:36.160 --> 05:43:39.160
she was going to be paranoid but really it was because if I

3915
05:43:39.160 --> 05:43:42.958
Took tramadol I might actually light fire and I didn't want to light fire

3916
05:43:42.958 --> 05:43:47.638
eh so I went to this place in Visätra I walked around I pondered

3917
05:43:47.638 --> 05:43:52.840
didn't know what to do eh it ended with me walking around maybe 30

3918
05:43:52.840 --> 05:43:57.718
40 50 minutes I don't even remember myself eh since the end only arrived at

3919
05:43:57.718 --> 05:44:01.000
that if I just leave the stuff and run then they might be looking up

3920
05:44:01.000 --> 05:44:05.718
me so instead i just took the pot i walked up i walked around a bit

3921
05:44:05.718 --> 05:44:09.558
the pot I don't even seal the stuff I just put them somewhere so it would

3922
05:44:09.558 --> 05:44:14.840
Look like I've been trying since I just went from there eh I walked around wise

3923
05:44:14.840 --> 05:44:19.400
maybe 15 minutes about since there will be some guys to me they asked me what

3924
05:44:19.400 --> 05:44:24.920
I do why I am masked eh since they should be questioning stuff as I am

3925
05:44:24.920 --> 05:44:28.080
afraid it is those who have given me the job that has come here to yes they

3926
05:44:28.080 --> 05:44:32.160
angry at me eh so i told him what to do since they got angry at me

3927
05:44:32.160 --> 05:44:37.280
Eh and they took me to the forest they interrogated me lots of stuff drove for too

3928
05:44:37.280 --> 05:44:41.440
drove for you I didn't even know myself eh since h began to knife in my thighs

3929
05:44:41.440 --> 05:44:46.320
Eh my legs and everywhere and beat me they took my phone too

3930
05:44:46.320 --> 05:44:51.558
eh then a police car drove past so they ran from there eh and then I could escape

3931
05:44:51.558 --> 05:44:56.600
So I limped myself from there to what is it to Flempan I think so

3932
05:44:56.600 --> 05:45:00.958
called i can not stockholm so good eh since i asked this esmeralda i

3933
05:45:00.958 --> 05:45:04.878
asked her if I could borrow her phone eh she said it went well I

3934
05:45:04.878 --> 05:45:08.760
tried to call people on snap check if they could pick me up eh i told you

3935
05:45:08.760 --> 05:45:12.680
some on snap about what I would do eh and I said it in a different way than what

3936
05:45:12.680 --> 05:45:16.478
I am now telling eh because I wanted people to think I'd do it

3937
05:45:16.478 --> 05:45:20.360
Do you understand I said the same thing to Esmeralda too because I thought maybe

3938
05:45:20.360 --> 05:45:23.600
Police maybe take if I want him to think I have made it that I have

3939
05:45:23.600 --> 05:45:28.240
tried eh late in the end so i call one to two because i think it won't

3940
05:45:28.240 --> 05:45:32.400
no one can pick me up i call one to two eh police have interrogation with me and

3941
05:45:32.400 --> 05:45:40.718
I acknowledge what I have done to the police eh and yes it is the story

3942
05:45:41.920 --> 05:45:47.360
Mm yes good then from the clock ask questions etc. Thanks Sebastian

3943
05:45:47.360 --> 05:45:53.240
Eh i will jump back a little neighbor eh and there have been a number of interrogations

3944
05:45:53.240 --> 05:45:58.000
With you yes eh and I know in the last hearing so you set you

3945
05:45:58.000 --> 05:46:02.440
against the fact that you have left very much different tasks in different parts eh so it

3946
05:46:02.440 --> 05:46:07.440
may be going to be a lot of traggling so you are on it okay mm eh but if

3947
05:46:07.440 --> 05:46:12.920
I understood it right then EH HVB home in northern Sweden I say a little sloppy eh

3948
05:46:12.920 --> 05:46:17.920
it is true that you yes it is true it was quite far up yes eh but if i

3949
05:46:17.920 --> 05:46:21.240
understood it right then you describe as it is any friend to you then as

3950
05:46:21.240 --> 05:46:25.440
takes your phone and enters reaching grup no i lend out the one i lend it you

3951
05:46:25.440 --> 05:46:30.718
lends it out yes eh since yes okay so it is not so that you have this yourself

3952
05:46:30.718 --> 05:46:35.320
the phone and is invited to any group chat without it is any friend who

3953
05:46:35.320 --> 05:46:39.680
log in then and take this job for you exactly

3954
05:46:39.680 --> 05:46:44.000
Eh but there was nothing you wanted to do really did you say no not

3955
05:46:44.000 --> 05:46:48.840
Actually but I wanted to play tough in front of them and I talked like

3956
05:46:48.840 --> 05:46:52.718
that I tried like make them think I was a criminal or something

3957
05:46:52.718 --> 05:46:57.878
I don't know no eh so that's why this situation at all

3958
05:46:57.878 --> 05:47:03.680
arose okay but i just think like this what is it that makes you go

3959
05:47:03.680 --> 05:47:08.280
from there then that you leave this home eh that I was pretty scared eh I saw

3960
05:47:08.280 --> 05:47:14.520
that he had thanked me and they have my name considering that my

3961
05:47:15.798 --> 05:47:20.600
Signal button it to Swish so I thought I don't want to say now that don't want to do

3962
05:47:20.600 --> 05:47:24.360
it eh and i didn't think so much about the consequences I didn't even understand

3963
05:47:24.360 --> 05:47:26.920
really even what it was I was going to do at all I knew bore that it

3964
05:47:26.920 --> 05:47:31.760
would burn something okay they were not entirely clear either in signal I know

3965
05:47:31.760 --> 05:47:36.958
not if it occurs anywhere but only he wrote that he as they

3966
05:47:36.958 --> 05:47:41.840
I thanked then just stated that I would just burn equipment eh and

3967
05:47:41.840 --> 05:47:48.080
then sowing yes and then so out what is it called then they changed f all the time

3968
05:47:48.080 --> 05:47:52.080
until it ended up in the end it became an apartment okay and when did you find out

3969
05:47:52.080 --> 05:47:56.200
That it was an apartment then eh it was when I was on my way to Stockholm okay

3970
05:47:56.200 --> 05:48:01.360
eh and did you find out some details about where this apartment was located

3971
05:48:01.360 --> 05:48:07.400
somewhere in Stockholm or why exactly the current apartment the only thing I

3972
05:48:07.400 --> 05:48:13.080
got to know why it was a little later when I was in this apartment and I

3973
05:48:13.080 --> 05:48:19.760
asked them eh when they said there is someone driving for us and driving for someone else

3974
05:48:19.760 --> 05:48:25.080
now something like that mhm that's all i've been told okay

3975
05:48:25.080 --> 05:48:31.600
Mm But but what but what was the very purpose as well as from the friend's side as well as to

3976
05:48:31.600 --> 05:48:35.520
add it to this one i don't actually know maybe it was maybe he wanted to

3977
05:48:35.520 --> 05:48:39.638
playing from maybe he wanted to show that yes I can I can solve so you can

3978
05:48:39.638 --> 05:48:46.360
Get money maybe I don't know for yourself no eh you may ask him okay

3979
05:48:46.360 --> 05:48:51.760
Mm This task you come up with here today around that there is some buddy

3980
05:48:51.760 --> 05:48:57.000
that adds you in reaching in any group and that you don't really want to do it

3981
05:48:57.000 --> 05:49:00.360
right from the start there is any task that you have left in interrogation before eh

3982
05:49:00.360 --> 05:49:04.120
I actually don't remember but I think that no I can say that there is not

3983
05:49:04.120 --> 05:49:08.200
any such task in any of these interrogations that hold you

3984
05:49:08.200 --> 05:49:14.718
eh if I check in the first hearing for example starting on page 468 which is

3985
05:49:14.718 --> 05:49:20.958
A hearing held with you already on October 6 What did you say on Silk 468 Starts

3986
05:49:20.958 --> 05:49:28.000
the interrogation yes mm eh and almost at the top of page 470 so you get a question who has

3987
05:49:28.000 --> 05:49:33.600
given in the job i don't know what his name is standing recorded how did you get the job someone

3988
05:49:33.600 --> 05:49:37.240
wrote to me on signal it was a group that I was in where it out with

3989
05:49:37.240 --> 05:49:42.240
For example, job someone who is eager to burn I thought yes they booked

3990
05:49:42.240 --> 05:49:47.360
ticket to me in Stockholm and it was kind of that I said so that eh it was for

3991
05:49:47.360 --> 05:49:50.600
that I didn't want anyone else to get shit eh I thought they could

3992
05:49:50.600 --> 05:49:54.958
Simply connect who it is who has said yes and I was thinking about maybe he

3993
05:49:54.958 --> 05:49:59.000
would he who added me this group he might get some kind

3994
05:49:59.000 --> 05:50:04.160
shit because of it if i told you it but in case you want what is it called

3995
05:50:04.160 --> 05:50:09.000
Confirmation or whatever it is called that what I say is right so you can from, etc.

3996
05:50:09.000 --> 05:50:13.840
man you choose to answer that okay but i asked you spontaneously so you said yes

3997
05:50:13.840 --> 05:50:17.200
You think you have said so but you have not mentioned anyone else there but there

3998
05:50:17.200 --> 05:50:21.520
Do you rather write like it was you who was in any group and it goes out

3999
05:50:21.520 --> 05:50:25.920
a job and you thank you yes it sue you get a ticket the details that

4000
05:50:25.920 --> 05:50:31.638
I gave they stated not to match no okay and the reason then they don't

4001
05:50:31.638 --> 05:50:34.400
is it true was simply that you don't want someone else to get shit

4002
05:50:34.400 --> 05:50:38.638
I understand that right then exactly okay

4003
05:50:44.840 --> 05:50:51.520
eh and as I said you say nothing about it to go on to something else

4004
05:50:51.520 --> 05:50:56.600
put in any of these other interrogations that agree with you either

4005
05:50:56.600 --> 05:51:00.680
Okay but that's the same reason for it then that you don't want someone else

4006
05:51:00.680 --> 05:51:04.558
would get shit i'll understand that so

4007
05:51:04.558 --> 05:51:11.320
Mm eh eh you then sit on the bus and then you go down by the train then down to

4008
05:51:11.320 --> 05:51:16.600
to Stockholm and then you tell you that you meet up by any girl yes

4009
05:51:16.600 --> 05:51:22.080
yes that task then that you meet up by a girl she is in that picture that

4010
05:51:22.080 --> 05:51:29.798
You have yes okay and how do you take where do you go then then eh we take any bus

4011

4012
05:51:34.080 --> 05:51:37.120
bus or subway i remember i was sitting in a vehicle

4013
05:51:37.120 --> 05:51:42.040
Yes i think it was a subway but since we also took a bus

4014
05:51:42.040 --> 05:51:49.200
Okay you know where you ended up in the end eh yes we ended up at this

4015

4016
05:51:53.600 --> 05:51:58.320
Bandhagen I couldn't the address of it that was why I was googling on

4017
05:51:58.320 --> 05:52:02.280
my phone because I tried to get back to the apartment eh because I

4018
05:52:02.280 --> 05:52:06.040
didn't know what else i would go anywhere mm eh so i didn't know

4019
05:52:06.040 --> 05:52:10.520
the address etc. I think we will come to it a little further ahead but I it you

4020
05:52:10.520 --> 05:52:13.760
Talked about now it is then when you have met on this Esmeralda then after

4021
05:52:13.760 --> 05:52:17.680
this abuse that you borrow her phone etc.

4022
05:52:17.680 --> 05:52:22.638
eh you know about when you arrived at this apartment after you go then

4023
05:52:22.638 --> 05:52:30.200
from the top northern sweden eh in stockholm etc. eh so i I know can't it was

4024
05:52:30.200 --> 05:52:35.000
that I think I arrived at type one mm eh I met this one

4025
05:52:35.000 --> 05:52:40.638
the girl a little after 12 if i mins correct mm

4026
05:52:40.638 --> 05:52:48.680
Eh I showed some surveillance pictures and stuff like that around 0140 or 038 there so

4027
05:52:48.680 --> 05:52:53.280
Was there any bus that you should get off in Brandberg Centrum it can be true yes

4028
05:52:53.280 --> 05:52:59.000
It can sue etc eh just this with how you get to

4029
05:52:59.000 --> 05:53:03.040
This apartment has you provided other information about

4030
05:53:03.040 --> 05:53:08.160
What I don't know I just said lots of those stuff on my interrogations because I was

4031
05:53:08.160 --> 05:53:15.200
pretty nervous eh i was tense eh i i was a little what is it

4032
05:53:15.200 --> 05:53:19.160
Confused I don't know I have a hard time with it when I was in custody I I

4033
05:53:19.160 --> 05:53:24.440
don't know that detention center it was just a difficult period

4034
05:53:24.440 --> 05:53:27.760
mm okay

4035
05:53:28.320 --> 05:53:36.000
eh if i say this way when you have described in the first three interrogations yes

4036
05:53:36.000 --> 05:53:40.040
that you are being picked up by a man who comes with a car at the Central and drive

4037
05:53:40.040 --> 05:53:43.600
you to this apartment no what did you say that is true

4038
05:53:43.600 --> 05:53:48.320
not yes ex and in this third hearing then so

4039
05:53:48.320 --> 05:53:51.798
Do you then show up these surveillance pictures then that you meet

4040
05:53:51.798 --> 05:53:55.600
This girl and that you see that you go down in public transport and after

4041
05:53:55.600 --> 05:54:02.440
You then change your information yes it is correct yes that moment etc. and then

4042
05:54:02.440 --> 05:54:07.440
I wonder why do you tell you this first as you did

4043
05:54:07.440 --> 05:54:12.680
eh because I didn't know you had pictures of this girl and I wanted to

4044
05:54:12.680 --> 05:54:17.360
not say anything that could lead to someone else I just wanted to tell you

4045
05:54:17.360 --> 05:54:21.400
I myself had done and not what anyone else had done no eh because I know that

4046
05:54:21.400 --> 05:54:25.360
There are many young guys who are killed because of such

4047
05:54:25.360 --> 05:54:30.680
eh so i don't want to tell you anything else

4048
05:54:31.080 --> 05:54:38.958
Mm ok so simply not to pull in someone else is so i will understand it

4049
05:54:39.400 --> 05:54:45.160
yes would you eh how would you say that your yours

4050
05:54:45.160 --> 05:54:49.798
story about this person that is, the one you had in these first three

4051
05:54:49.798 --> 05:54:56.440
interrogations how would you say it was i don't remember

4052
05:55:01.120 --> 05:55:07.878
No if we go to this first hearing

4053
05:55:07.878 --> 05:55:13.200
then page 487 and what I want to demonstrate is that I mean that you have left

4054
05:55:13.200 --> 05:55:18.920
very much detail about then a person then that is completely invented

4055
05:55:18.920 --> 05:55:25.360
Yes and it is still then on we shall see

4056
05:55:35.240 --> 05:55:38.240
here

4057
05:55:39.850 --> 05:55:43.040
[Applause]

4058
05:56:00.700 --> 05:56:06.320
[Applause] Here we'll see about where in the wrong interrogation first

4059
05:56:06.320 --> 05:56:08.558
and

4060
05:56:14.160 --> 05:56:21.360
looked the eh on page 470 approximately in the middle of it

4061
05:56:21.360 --> 05:56:26.000
page eh so you get a question from

4062
05:56:26.000 --> 05:56:30.718
The interrogator you went to Stockholm Central what happens there and there describes

4063
05:56:30.718 --> 05:56:34.958
you like this i wait for three hours at the station a guy comes and took me

4064
05:56:34.958 --> 05:56:39.320
to the apartment how did you know it was the person who would pick you up

4065
05:56:39.320 --> 05:56:42.120
I didn't know who it was but that it would be a guy with black

4066
05:56:42.120 --> 05:56:48.600
Adidas pants and armani hoodie how does he look other 30 years you will remember

4067
05:56:48.600 --> 05:56:54.878
If he was tall or short quite tall as you 0 yes what color on the hair brown

4068
05:56:54.878 --> 05:56:59.718
mustache and bearded he said what his name is no it said nothing they said just came it was

4069
05:56:59.718 --> 05:57:05.080
A person yes where did you go when we sat in a car it was a black Volvo who

4070
05:57:05.080 --> 05:57:09.600
The police have and then he drives you to an apartment how long did you drive maybe 20

4071
05:57:09.600 --> 05:57:13.680
minutes remember where you went somewhere no you recognize something at

4072
05:57:13.680 --> 05:57:18.920
the road no actually and then you describe a little neighbor in this one

4073
05:57:18.920 --> 05:57:23.878
The apartment I mean that here you have then provided information about

4074
05:57:23.878 --> 05:57:29.440
estimate of age and length color of the hair mustache and beard even then

4075
05:57:29.440 --> 05:57:35.440
The car they asked for a person then as I perceive then is completely invented

4076
05:57:35.440 --> 05:57:42.400
yeah yeah what why do you leave so much details i don't know so if i

4077
05:57:42.400 --> 05:57:45.680
understood it correctly it was because they asked me and then I just said

4078
05:57:45.680 --> 05:57:51.840
something okay but all this was just found on yes

4079
05:57:59.280 --> 05:58:06.878
Mm when you can then finally ask in this third

4080
05:58:06.878 --> 05:58:12.280
the interview when you are set against this about why are you so different do you remember what

4081
05:58:12.280 --> 05:58:18.240
You then replied why what did you say why you said have said differently about how you took

4082
05:58:18.240 --> 05:58:25.920
you to this place that is, after you have seen these eh

4083
05:58:26.240 --> 05:58:31.320
Videos or pictures from central Stockholm that you are visible with this girl

4084
05:58:31.320 --> 05:58:36.200
What did you say from the hearing or because you say here today that it was because you

4085
05:58:36.200 --> 05:58:41.958
wanted to pull other yes mm in that interview then as starting at

4086
05:58:41.958 --> 05:58:44.280
side

4087
05:58:55.958 --> 05:59:00.520
493 ne sorry it was another task that you actually got no one

4088
05:59:00.520 --> 05:59:04.360
Ask about should I be clear with or something but that I will say

4089
05:59:04.360 --> 05:59:11.760
Initially in the hearing so you were asked to describe this person again

4090
05:59:11.760 --> 05:59:15.000
that came picking up you sorry just so i

4091
05:59:15.000 --> 05:59:20.478
know what interrogation are we at now now we are the third hearing he never got anyone

4092
05:59:20.478 --> 05:59:25.040
Ask about it was another question that I had read so

4093
05:59:25.040 --> 05:59:31.760
that but then it will be again before you get to see these pictures then and that you become

4094
05:59:31.760 --> 05:59:35.000
aware that one has seen with this girl asked to describe

4095
05:59:35.000 --> 05:59:39.520
this person eh and then it is recorded like this on

4096
05:59:39.520 --> 05:59:45.000
Page 495 You said he said it was a male who picked up you yes in what way was

4097
05:59:45.000 --> 05:59:48.440
masked he had one of these balaklava and black clothes you remember some

4098
05:59:48.440 --> 05:59:52.520
Details of the clothes no not so I thought he had this like this Jordan f Red

4099
05:59:52.520 --> 05:59:56.040
Founder on but I don't remember what is it for the red

4100
05:59:56.040 --> 06:00:04.878
Jordan's Jordan 4 Yes it is shoes prime.se yes so you have not just described ÖVG

4101
06:00:04.878 --> 06:00:08.878
signal element also then what kind of shoes in this then the person who is completely

4102
06:00:08.878 --> 06:00:14.638
invented should wear yes yes

4103
06:00:14.840 --> 06:00:20.958
Okay I thought if there was any reason to leave so much

4104
06:00:20.958 --> 06:00:26.440
Details eh then you scored when H asked me this I had I had

4105
06:00:26.440 --> 06:00:32.440
forgot that what I had said in for in the last company so I just said something

4106
06:00:32.440 --> 06:00:37.920
Random again okay

4107
06:00:38.440 --> 06:00:43.320
Then I understood it as you arrive at this apartment

4108
06:00:43.320 --> 06:00:49.680
eh and you tell you pretty immediately about a gun

4109
06:00:49.680 --> 06:00:55.200
Yes is that is something that you note directly you enter this apartment

4110
06:00:55.200 --> 06:01:00.280
or how should I understand that eh where somewhere when you come to

4111

time sometime just before two around midnight there eh yes what what is it like what

4113
06:01:13.040 --> 06:01:18.320

06:02:20.440 --> 06:02:23.840
gna play with it a little late when I pulled behind the one I saw that a bullet was sitting

4126
06:02:23.840 --> 06:02:28.638
Though I called him as I said eh then I just put back the gun on

Did it know that it was eh such a print apartment so that was what I got

4144
06:04:00.040 --> 06:04:04.798

4146
06:04:12.558 --> 06:04:17.878
a pressed eh for a few days or a day before this thing you should

4147
06:04:17.878 --> 06:04:23.360
do okay you remember if there was any name on

4148
06:04:23.360 --> 06:04:34.638

4149
06:04:34.638 --> 06:04:37.638
Okay

4150
06:04:40.680 --> 06:04:45.520
What happened then then maybe we should pause here if you can do this with

4151
06:04:45.520 --> 06:04:49.558
The weapon I thought we could take a break and continue

4152
06:04:50.760 --> 06:04:56.440
The interview continues the hearing with you you move a little closer again so we see

4153
06:04:56.440 --> 06:04:59.520
you well on recording sets a little further ahead

4154
06:04:59.520 --> 06:05:04.638
Great so then we start then the complaint may continue etc. Thank you

4155
06:05:04.638 --> 06:05:07.520
eh you i was going to jump back to it

4156
06:05:07.520 --> 06:05:11.920
here as I asked you or as you told us about this one

4157
06:05:11.920 --> 06:05:16.958
signal gray who or how you ended up in it and this with the mission yes eh and I

4158
06:05:16.958 --> 06:05:23.120
sets you against a task that you have left in interrogation around it from one of

4159
06:05:23.120 --> 06:05:28.000
The interrogation but I find another task in in another hearing as well there

4160
06:05:28.000 --> 06:05:32.440
you have described this and I mean that you describe differently to what

4161
06:05:32.440 --> 06:05:37.440
you do it today and it is in interrogation the other

4162
06:05:37.440 --> 06:05:43.080
the hearing with you that starts on page 485 that held on 16

4163
06:05:43.080 --> 06:05:48.440
October so there is a task on the page

4164
06:05:48.440 --> 06:05:54.280
EH and question from interrogator then is that Sebastian gets asked why

4165
06:05:54.280 --> 06:05:58.440
he refused to crime considering he describes how everything has gone to and then

4166
06:05:58.440 --> 06:06:01.760
stands on the sign so iebastian has not prepared anything he does not know

4167
06:06:01.760 --> 06:06:05.718
Who did what he has not met the person he has been in contact with

4168
06:06:05.718 --> 06:06:10.558
Two people the first one was on Tuesday or Monday at Signal It was a group

4169
06:06:10.558 --> 06:06:17.440
where one on his hvbhem added him the group's name is an emoji one

4170
06:06:18.760 --> 06:06:21.760
Chocolate gruffs

4171
06:06:23.798 --> 06:06:30.240
to him in the group friend did not know if the job he would do in

4172
06:06:31.040 --> 06:06:35.240
Stockholm so it describes that this friend adds it to the group

4173
06:06:35.240 --> 06:06:39.160
But since it is you self -writing in this group that your friend

4174
06:06:39.160 --> 06:06:43.718
not at all knows about anything about this job it is of course to protect

4175
06:06:43.718 --> 06:06:47.718
him but I don't even remember that much for

4176
06:06:47.718 --> 06:06:53.760
my interrogations because as I said I was pretty nervous I was confused eh so I mins

4177
06:06:53.760 --> 06:06:58.798
not even myself what I have said but so it looks like it seems like

4178
06:06:58.798 --> 06:07:02.600
that I said so because for the same reason as mine I do not want to

4179
06:07:02.600 --> 06:07:06.520
someone else would get shit to be there etc. eh i want him to go on someone

4180
06:07:06.520 --> 06:07:12.320
assist in preparation or something like that mm okay and on reason

4181
06:07:12.320 --> 06:07:18.040
then that he added to a group or yes I don't know how it works but I

4182
06:07:18.040 --> 06:07:22.440
well assuming that if he helps me get into put me in the group so

4183
06:07:22.440 --> 06:07:27.120
maybe he also goes on aid assistance for

4184
06:07:27.280 --> 06:07:33.200
something okay but why do you tell you about it now

4185
06:07:33.200 --> 06:07:41.160
Eh to now I definitely say the truth eh yes that's why

4186
06:07:41.160 --> 06:07:45.160
Okay but you mean he doesn't risk being drawn into something

4187
06:07:45.160 --> 06:07:53.240
Or maybe he does I don't know but eh yes okay but now you simply have

4188
06:07:53.240 --> 06:07:57.798
decided to tell you the truth yes

4189
06:07:58.478 --> 06:08:06.200
Mm eh i also have a question and it is in

4190
06:08:06.200 --> 06:08:12.478
This first hearing so you were set against that there is

4191
06:08:12.478 --> 06:08:17.160
eh on snapchat then when you went through when you were logged in to this

4192
06:08:17.160 --> 06:08:22.440
The phone so there were some snapchat conversations and such

4193
06:08:22.440 --> 06:08:25.878
Snapchat conversation that showed you in connection with this first

4194
06:08:25.878 --> 06:08:31.200
The hearing that you agreed with you, you remember it it was a while ago

4195
06:08:31.200 --> 06:08:34.440
I barely remember anything from mine for but

4196
06:08:34.440 --> 06:08:44.080
eh no it's a conversation with some ross yes it is one of my friends yes

4197
06:08:44.080 --> 06:08:51.440
from linero yes okay and do you remember that conversation eh yes yes eh he said to

4198
06:08:51.440 --> 06:08:57.040
me eh that I should come to Linero and work for him instead okay eh and

4199
06:08:57.040 --> 06:09:00.958
that he will make me make a lot of money yes and do you remember what you wrote in

4200
06:09:00.958 --> 06:09:05.040
That conversation yes I said I would only do a few jobs in Stockholm

4201
06:09:05.040 --> 06:09:11.240
and that I will be there since I think I said so but I don't remember okay and I

4202
06:09:11.240 --> 06:09:14.360
thought I haven't relied it before because the setting has

4203
06:09:14.360 --> 06:09:19.478
been a bit different since before but I would call it and it is on the side

4204
06:09:19.478 --> 06:09:25.000
400 shall we see I just want to say I had no plans to go back to

4205
06:09:25.000 --> 06:09:33.240
Linero after this thing no eh just so you know it is on page 484 in it

4206
06:09:33.240 --> 06:09:37.160
Here the preliminary investigation protocol

4207
06:09:37.160 --> 06:09:44.360
eh 48 84 yeah and i can pick it up on the screen otherwise i can just read what

4208
06:09:44.360 --> 06:09:47.400
that stands here i know

4209
06:09:48.000 --> 06:09:53.040
not it stands anyway like this one

4210
06:09:53.040 --> 06:09:57.400
Since maybe we should look at it so mentions may look at it as well you want to show it

4211
06:09:57.400 --> 06:10:03.160
Or should we show the one I can show the one I have mm prime.se

4212
06:10:34.240 --> 06:10:40.558
ah i take a while before these warms up it seems so

4213
06:10:42.520 --> 06:10:46.558
Mm now it starts

4214
06:10:50.878 --> 06:10:57.000
So that is then a snapchat conversation that the police then found when

4215
06:10:57.000 --> 06:11:00.878
man eh checked in Esmeralda's phone where you would then have logged in to your

4216
06:11:00.878 --> 06:11:06.920
Snapchat and then it is some ross it is good kei how is it good o all eh

4217
06:11:06.920 --> 06:11:12.320
Should become yeps in Stockholm you should come to Linero yes after a while should only

4218
06:11:12.320 --> 06:11:17.958
Make money first a little type 30 salmon on burns and stuff shoot at house and

4219
06:11:17.958 --> 06:11:22.840
So on when I have 30 to 70 salmon I ask about holidays for a week in Lund I

4220
06:11:22.840 --> 06:11:29.440
brother come to us i have jobs for you will get you and poop money yes when happens

4221
06:11:29.440 --> 06:11:35.280
this conversation eh no idea but maybe I happened

4222
06:11:35.280 --> 06:11:39.600
Remember it was in the apartment when I wrote there yes okay I vs not what day

4223
06:11:39.600 --> 06:11:46.478
No ok there you write like you should earn 30 salmon on burns and stuff and

4224
06:11:46.478 --> 06:11:50.320
shoot at house eh yes i don't even know myself what i babblad them but i

4225
06:11:50.320 --> 06:11:56.400
tried to sound cool in front of my friends okay eh there was something like that yeps

4226
06:11:56.400 --> 06:12:01.558
What does it mean to be a hose target Langod for murderers etc. but it is

4227
06:12:01.558 --> 06:12:06.558
Nothing I was thinking about being no okay it tells myself that

4228
06:12:06.558 --> 06:12:10.440
does not stand anything about it to kill someone it says what is closest to death reach

4229
06:12:10.440 --> 06:12:13.360
standing and shooting at houses so I don't even know why I wrote

4230
06:12:13.360 --> 06:12:18.718
Yeps I don't remember no okay you remember what you've told the police then when you get

4231
06:12:18.718 --> 06:12:22.520
Ask about this conversation in the hearing that one agreed with you as I said

4232
06:12:22.520 --> 06:12:27.040
I hardly remember any of my interrogations it was too long and I was nervous

4233
06:12:27.040 --> 06:12:32.718
and confused yes and this is the very first to hear it on October 6

4234
06:12:32.718 --> 06:12:40.360
which starts on F Page 468 EH and you then get questions about this conversation

4235
06:12:40.360 --> 06:12:47.558
then as I just showed up eh on page 477 and at the bottom then is recorded

4236
06:12:47.558 --> 06:12:52.680
interrogated LAN shows a picture of the yeps conversation who is ross and you answer

4237
06:12:52.680 --> 06:12:56.798
So as you have answered here today a friend and what is he called in reality ross what

4238
06:12:56.798 --> 06:13:02.440
is meant by japp killer as you say here today it is called yeah yes

4239
06:13:02.440 --> 06:13:07.680
Do you usually use that word not so much what is this about do not know

4240
06:13:07.680 --> 06:13:12.520
Did you get the 30,000 no I haven't done anything but you said after all

4241
06:13:12.520 --> 06:13:17.320
15,000 Then the record is that I would do several jobs I would do a job

4242
06:13:17.320 --> 06:13:22.638
For 15,000 and the next day 15,000 it says I will shoot at the house but

4243
06:13:22.638 --> 06:13:26.760
nothing that is determined they asked what I am prepared to do I see everything except

4244
06:13:26.760 --> 06:13:32.840
to kill it is the conversation on signals and brought up to shoot they

4245
06:13:32.840 --> 06:13:37.600
called me and said it was coarser stuff when it rang on the phone that

4246
06:13:37.600 --> 06:13:42.600
called on signal when they called the rough stuff once on hvb home and one

4247
06:13:42.600 --> 06:13:47.240
time in Stockholm in the apartment they asked me what I am ready for they said you can

4248
06:13:47.240 --> 06:13:53.920
get more work to shoot at house i said okay yes eh this about this job it

4249
06:13:53.920 --> 06:13:57.680
is true they have asked me eh or asked me and asked me it was

4250
06:13:57.680 --> 06:14:01.638
really not even a question it was more that they told me there are such

4251
06:14:01.638 --> 06:14:05.638
here work as well etc. and then I replied that there are such jobs not to

4252
06:14:05.638 --> 06:14:09.958
would make it that there are such jobs and then I said okay as okay then I know

4253
06:14:09.958 --> 06:14:15.680
But I don't know what I babbled about in this interrogation eh yes as I said I was

4254
06:14:15.680 --> 06:14:20.440
Pretty confused eh and when I said those rough about the rough stuff etc. eh so

4255
06:14:20.440 --> 06:14:24.000
I thought he meant that with lit electricity on the house

4256
06:14:24.000 --> 06:14:30.040
Mhm okay eh because here i get the perception as

4257
06:14:30.040 --> 06:14:33.040
that it says that you should say, among other things, they asked what I prepared

4258
06:14:33.040 --> 06:14:37.320
to do i said everything except to kill like that you still have discussed then

4259
06:14:37.320 --> 06:14:41.080
about what assignments you can imagine to perform yes they asked me too

4260
06:14:41.080 --> 06:14:44.878
told me these who you told you if you turn on this house late

4261
06:14:44.878 --> 06:14:49.080
He also said there are other jobs then I told them okay then they said what are you

4262
06:14:49.080 --> 06:14:52.798
prepared to do as it stands here and then I told everything for all the tens for out they

4263
06:14:52.798 --> 06:14:59.840
were dead m and as you have understood and what I told you before eh so I said

4264
06:14:59.840 --> 06:15:04.478
just things and i maybe i don't want to kill anyone then if i had wanted

4265
06:15:04.478 --> 06:15:09.520
Kill someone so I had lit at this eh door and I had taken Ramad

4266
06:15:09.520 --> 06:15:14.360
also mm eh but nuur should i understand it as you have it it is true that you have

4267
06:15:14.360 --> 06:15:17.798
had conversation about doing other jobs but there was never anything

4268
06:15:17.798 --> 06:15:22.600
As you were going to perform exactly but you still told about it to the police I

4269
06:15:22.600 --> 06:15:26.798
want it to look like I had plans to do it and I don't want to

4270
06:15:26.798 --> 06:15:30.520
that it should look like I didn't want it to look like I didn't want to do

4271
06:15:30.520 --> 06:15:34.080
any of that that was why I said so okay and because I was confused

4272
06:15:34.080 --> 06:15:37.840
But for whose sake you mean it should look like you had intended to do

4273
06:15:37.840 --> 06:15:42.958
stuff when they read my preliminary investigation so they see it it was ok so you mean

4274
06:15:42.958 --> 06:15:47.520
that you think, as in that step further, then that these then the people then as

4275
06:15:47.520 --> 06:15:52.280
have hired you or what to say that they should get the perception and believe that

4276
06:15:52.280 --> 06:15:57.320
you had thought to do this yes okay i i get the rather people n as man

4277
06:15:57.320 --> 06:16:01.798
Then, at least, thought I would rather get people to think I wanted to do it and

4278
06:16:01.798 --> 06:16:08.080
I am sitting inside maybe a year at SIS etc. Ann that I will be on something free or

4279
06:16:08.080 --> 06:16:13.520
gets less punishment and then gets killed it it is pretty obvious okay you thought

4280
06:16:13.520 --> 06:16:18.440
that you had no choice but to say yes is that so I will understand it yes

4281
06:16:18.440 --> 06:16:20.718
Okay

4282
06:16:21.320 --> 06:16:26.478
eh if I just jump then after this supplement then it stands it never got off

4283
06:16:26.478 --> 06:16:31.680
is left lance then question then it is noted that it would be off but did not become

4284
06:16:31.680 --> 06:16:36.240
because I sit here I know is also then just because it

4285
06:16:36.240 --> 06:16:40.878
should look no there if that is where I don't even know

4286
06:16:40.878 --> 06:16:45.280
So that it didn't get it was not because the police took me it was

4287
06:16:45.280 --> 06:16:50.080
after all because I myself chose not to make it okay so and that because it was

4288
06:16:50.080 --> 06:16:54.520
The police took me the police they took me like I can't so much time but

4289
06:16:54.520 --> 06:16:59.320
maybe one or two hours after I chose not to do it so I don't know

4290
06:16:59.320 --> 06:17:05.360
even why i said so that i it's not even relevant no eh yeah okay

4291
06:17:05.360 --> 06:17:10.080
It is not that you here today then try to tone down your intentions and your

4292
06:17:10.080 --> 06:17:15.160
intent and what you thought to do or not do eh what do you mean by tone down

4293
06:17:15.160 --> 06:17:18.478
Yes but that you simply try to make it appear like you never had

4294
06:17:18.478 --> 06:17:23.320
thought to do something just because that is what you should go free it is because I

4295
06:17:23.320 --> 06:17:27.360
is going to be free or for me to be free I tell the truth etc. I ask

4296
06:17:27.360 --> 06:17:33.160
you yes it is like how what tasks should we believe in the ones I tell you now you you

4297
06:17:33.160 --> 06:17:37.680
Tells now okay and then I think this way you don't think

4298
06:17:37.680 --> 06:17:42.878
that these then who hired you then find out what you say here today eh jo

4299
06:17:42.878 --> 06:17:49.440
But I have made a choice and eh that so it is yes I do not know

4300
06:17:49.440 --> 06:17:54.240
what to do so no okay

4301
06:17:54.240 --> 06:17:59.400
eh I think before the break there I was on and would ask you then what

4302
06:17:59.400 --> 06:18:04.280
is what happens since the day here on this Thursday the fifth it wants

4303
06:18:04.280 --> 06:18:08.798
say you have arrived there late at night what do you do daytime there then were

4304
06:18:08.798 --> 06:18:16.160
are you in the apartment i check tiktok check youtube mm chill okay

4305
06:18:16.160 --> 06:18:19.360
is not so much g is it anywhere else

4306
06:18:19.360 --> 06:18:28.000
Eh no yes i go out on one occasion eh to open the pot to the two

4307
06:18:28.000 --> 06:18:36.200
the guys who sat in the apartment etc. that's all okay and when will they then approximately

4308
06:18:36.200 --> 06:18:40.558
It has no idea but it was it wasn't night anyway it was no between

4309
06:18:40.558 --> 06:18:45.160
the night and morning what could it be maybe at 12 o'clock maybe at one o'clock yes

4310
06:18:45.160 --> 06:18:51.478
yes type lunchtime then yes something like that mm and how did you know you would open for them

4311
06:18:51.478 --> 06:18:56.840
Here eh because you wrote to me that I would open where you wrote to you

4312
06:18:56.840 --> 06:19:02.240
eh on signal etc. and then I understand that you

4313
06:19:02.240 --> 06:19:06.440
is then in this apartment quite or long time alone you thought

4314
06:19:06.440 --> 06:19:10.958
never on leaving this apartment to ask you anywhere else because you

4315
06:19:10.958 --> 06:19:16.240
never thought to do this deed or people are killed for small stuff now

4316
06:19:16.240 --> 06:19:20.840
for the time yes eh they have my name they have my email and that they have my email it

4317
06:19:20.840 --> 06:19:27.040
is a bit my fault but they have my name so if I try to go from there it will be

4318
06:19:27.040 --> 06:19:31.920
probably consequences I was pretty scared mhm okay you thought about taking

4319
06:19:31.920 --> 06:19:39.440
contact with police at some point no no why not eh because it is

4320
06:19:39.440 --> 06:19:47.320
The same reason I just told you it's almost even worse okay

4321
06:19:49.718 --> 06:19:57.080
eh these two guys then or if I ask the question like this

4322
06:19:57.080 --> 06:20:02.600
eh earlier then during the preliminary investigation in interrogation you have told you that it was

4323
06:20:02.600 --> 06:20:08.760
other people in this apartment then eh earlier yes in my latest for mm so

4324
06:20:08.760 --> 06:20:16.320
did i tell mm but in the three earlier then eh no no that i told it that

4325
06:20:16.320 --> 06:20:20.440
was because I had a hearing I don't know if it says but I don't know

4326
06:20:20.440 --> 06:20:25.840
When was I the detention had a hearing and then they asked me like this eh were you yourself

4327
06:20:25.840 --> 06:20:30.920
in the apartment then i said yes since they said sounds land or John not as you come

4328
06:20:30.920 --> 06:20:36.240
remember mm eh yes i remember it but i told them no mm eh and then so said

4329
06:20:36.240 --> 06:20:40.200
they yes but it was scary because these two people have mentioned someone

4330
06:20:40.200 --> 06:20:44.040
that looks like you or described someone who looks like you that I already knew

4331
06:20:44.040 --> 06:20:46.638
that they had told me about me so I thought I might as well tell you

4332
06:20:46.638 --> 06:20:53.040
it g no harm mm okay yes but for as you mention yourself so in the first three

4333
06:20:53.040 --> 06:20:57.680
The interrogation you get clear questions then in all of them if you have been alone in this one

4334
06:20:57.680 --> 06:21:01.120
apartment or if you have been there someone else there and in all these three interrogations

4335
06:21:01.120 --> 06:21:04.558
Have you replied that you have been alone and that there was no one else there yes

4336
06:21:04.558 --> 06:21:09.160
At any time for one you then in this fourth hearing as you are inside

4337
06:21:09.160 --> 06:21:16.120
on then mentions that they must have been there for a certain time yes and what is the reason

4338
06:21:16.120 --> 06:21:23.280
that you mention it first then eh to eh I told my former

4339
06:21:23.280 --> 06:21:27.240
lawyer eh and my lawyer she didn't think it might be so good that I

4340
06:21:27.240 --> 06:21:31.920
told it m eh i don't really know why but i guess yeah i know

4341
06:21:31.920 --> 06:21:36.798
not even by yourself but there is certainly something behind it mm eh so I chose

4342
06:21:36.798 --> 06:21:40.840
self not to tell you because of that yoke so you mean it was like on

4343
06:21:40.840 --> 06:21:47.040
the advice of your lawyer then as it said so that way

4344
06:21:47.040 --> 06:21:53.120
eh if we rewind a little then on the toile these guys came around lunchtime what happened

4345
06:21:53.120 --> 06:22:02.280
Then when we sat we talked we smoked some themselves etc. eh looked at all sat and

4346
06:22:02.280 --> 06:22:07.280
chilled with his phone in we talked a little mm I didn't know what we were talking

4347
06:22:07.280 --> 06:22:13.920
If specific but yes it was kind of it mm okay

4348
06:22:13.920 --> 06:22:21.000
Eh yes what happens then you are left there in the apartment all day all evening eh

4349
06:22:21.000 --> 06:22:25.558
no eh that day when they come to the apartment it is the same evening as me

4350
06:22:25.558 --> 06:22:31.040
Going on this assignment etc. so I go from there I do not miss what time eh but

4351
06:22:31.040 --> 06:22:37.440
I think I ate from there at type maybe 10 o'clock maybe half electricity 10 no not

4352
06:22:37.440 --> 06:22:45.280
Half electricity yes I don't even know myself at half past nine eight somewhere where eh so

4353
06:22:45.280 --> 06:22:50.040
I went from the apartment to Vära I thought was at type at half past

4354
06:22:50.040 --> 06:22:57.600
nine something like that okay and do you have something with you then eh when

4355
06:22:57.600 --> 06:23:07.400
You go there yes a gasoline tube mm a can with gasoline mm eh dk flush liquid eh

4356
06:23:07.400 --> 06:23:14.718
papersticks and a lighter eh i just believed it that mm and what has

4357
06:23:14.718 --> 06:23:20.160
you got these things from eh i i got them when i was in

4358
06:23:20.160 --> 06:23:26.040
the apartment okay can you describe how it went to eh I'd rather not tell

4359
06:23:26.040 --> 06:23:30.920
I have mentioned a person in my interrogation M but I would rather not tell him how he

4360
06:23:30.920 --> 06:23:35.280
What I said until it's just something random that I have said eh that's right

4361
06:23:35.280 --> 06:23:39.440
Not when I described the person who gave me the stuff and I'd rather not

4362
06:23:39.440 --> 06:23:46.120
Tell me who it was that gave me the stuff because of my own security okay can

4363
06:23:46.120 --> 06:23:52.478
you tell me when and how it went then yes I can tell you it was when know

4364
06:23:52.478 --> 06:23:57.558
I don't I don't remember but it was on during the day not during the evening it was

4365
06:23:57.558 --> 06:24:04.920
not dark outside no eh i went out from the poort i received eh bags eh two

4366
06:24:04.920 --> 06:24:10.000
pieces of bags with stuff in or if it was one I don't remember since I went into

4367
06:24:10.000 --> 06:24:12.760
in the apartment

4368
06:24:12.920 --> 06:24:17.000
again mm

4369
06:24:22.120 --> 06:24:27.718
ok but you don't want to describe this person no

4370
06:24:27.718 --> 06:24:33.320
No did you want to say something whether it was a guy or a

4371
06:24:33.320 --> 06:24:37.878
Girl eh no

4372
06:24:37.878 --> 06:24:42.760
no okay it wasn't that wasn't my target call

4373
06:24:42.760 --> 06:24:48.400
that left the stuff no as you claimed

4374
06:24:49.400 --> 06:24:55.680
Okay and what is the reason why you don't want to leave someone further

4375
06:24:55.680 --> 06:25:00.478
Description about that person then eh because I don't want that person to

4376
06:25:00.478 --> 06:25:03.760
go on something and I feel that it is not very important that I

4377
06:25:03.760 --> 06:25:09.160
told it no eh it makes no difference if i tell or if not

4378
06:25:13.840 --> 06:25:19.958
tells you had contact with someone before you get these things

4379
06:25:19.958 --> 06:25:27.718
eh on yes on signal she wrote to me eh that a person meets up

4380
06:25:28.440 --> 06:25:35.360
you okay so that was when you went out so yes mm

4381
06:25:35.360 --> 06:25:40.600
And what did you do with these things when I went into the apartment and put them on

4382
06:25:40.600 --> 06:25:47.440
the floor of the living room etc. you understand what it was

4383
06:25:47.440 --> 06:25:55.520
Eh yes mm did you understand what it would be used for m

4384
06:25:56.478 --> 06:26:02.120
yes answered a little slowly there yes it is clear I if one understood what it was for

4385
06:26:02.120 --> 06:26:05.280
Things I well realized it was for me because they wanted me

4386
06:26:05.280 --> 06:26:09.520
would do this thing so I assumed that was what I would have

4387
06:26:09.520 --> 06:26:16.200
helped with okay or what it would be used for and what did you do with those

4388
06:26:16.200 --> 06:26:22.320
here the things then eh Visätra or the apartment yes in in it

4389
06:26:22.320 --> 06:26:26.440
Here the apartment as I said I just put on the floor since I sat down on the couch and

4390
06:26:26.440 --> 06:26:32.120
chilled with my phone okay and then the journey to Visätra

4391
06:26:32.120 --> 06:26:39.360
So how does it go to eh taxi by taxi is the usual taxi company or that

4392
06:26:39.360 --> 06:26:44.160
was a car with when I got into the car so I saw that there was some screen

4393
06:26:44.160 --> 06:26:50.680
somewhere where there was taxi mm okay and how did you find out that it

4394
06:26:50.680 --> 06:26:55.558
Taxi would take you there eh they wrote to me that your taxi is here eh I will

4395
06:26:55.558 --> 06:26:58.638
not remember what kind of name I would use but they told me to

4396
06:26:58.638 --> 06:27:02.638
say some name I don't remind what it was if it was Isaac or Magnus or

4397
06:27:02.638 --> 06:27:07.920
what it was but it was annot name that has said i was called okay and was it

4398
06:27:07.920 --> 06:27:15.160
also through the signal here then the group you received that information yes okay and they

4399
06:27:15.160 --> 06:27:19.718
Here the things that you have received earlier in these bags you will take with you

4400
06:27:19.718 --> 06:27:23.558
them or do you leave them in the apartment no i bring them yes yes

4401
06:27:23.558 --> 06:27:27.958
Everything all of you

4402
06:27:28.440 --> 06:27:33.120
Mm It is a bit shady if you leave with stuff n and

4403
06:27:33.120 --> 06:27:39.000
Going and you got to reach information about where you

4404
06:27:39.000 --> 06:27:43.638
would somewhere which address or similar no I my I knew

4405
06:27:43.638 --> 06:27:46.798
not even myself that I would not even know that it was Visätra no I

4406
06:27:46.798 --> 06:27:51.320
Remember that I went since the taxi stopped since they told me I will drive

4407
06:27:51.320 --> 06:27:54.040
up it all the way to the pot and I said yes

4408
06:27:54.040 --> 06:27:59.638
Mm okay so you didn't know V where you would then do this job

4409
06:27:59.638 --> 06:28:03.520
somewhere no I only knew it would be 25 on the pot and that it

4410
06:28:03.520 --> 06:28:10.120
would stand and k on the door okay and how would you have received in that information through

4411
06:28:10.120 --> 06:28:16.680
signal via signal etc. Okay but you didn't know further then as what what yourself

4412
06:28:16.680 --> 06:28:20.600
The street itself was called without 25 at the gate and it was the taxi that drove it all the way

4413
06:28:20.600 --> 06:28:28.478
front yes the street I found out in after the police okay yes okay so you had only

4414
06:28:28.478 --> 06:28:32.160
the number itself then and the name of the door

4415
06:28:33.040 --> 06:28:38.360
Yes eh and what happens then when you arrive

4416
06:28:38.360 --> 06:28:41.798
I understood it right then that you think it might be

4417
06:28:41.798 --> 06:28:47.958
around eight nine in the evening so it is yes

4418
06:28:50.040 --> 06:28:55.400
Yes what happens then when you arrive where that taxi stays there at this

4419
06:28:55.400 --> 06:28:59.120
The gate you describe the first thing I do is that I take these stuff I

4420
06:28:59.120 --> 06:29:04.638
Put them in a bush etc. since I walk around thinking about how to go

4421
06:29:04.638 --> 06:29:07.840
access to get d to get away

4422
06:29:07.840 --> 06:29:13.200
eh because even at all to do it it was completely excluded it was not

4423
06:29:13.200 --> 06:29:18.520
even an alternative ehm i just walked around eh late in the end

4424
06:29:18.520 --> 06:29:22.920
I came to the conclusion that I just break the pot eh I just put the stuff

4425
06:29:22.920 --> 06:29:27.240
Like in the stairwell so it looks like I was trying to do it m eh late

4426
06:29:27.240 --> 06:29:32.520
I just went from there ok since I know I thought I might

4427
06:29:32.520 --> 06:29:36.280
could come up with any story that someone came out and someone came out in

4428
06:29:36.280 --> 06:29:41.000
the door and screamed at me or something or something like that mm yes for how did you

4429
06:29:41.000 --> 06:29:47.718
intended to take you from the site eh taxi taxi and in what way would that taxi

4430
06:29:47.718 --> 06:29:53.280
So how would you book a taxi just before I went into the pot so I called

4431
06:29:53.280 --> 06:29:57.440
or called i wrote to he who goes with the job that i did now since he

4432
06:29:57.440 --> 06:30:01.718
wrote to me ok I sent the taxi etc. Okay and he had sent to me

4433
06:30:01.718 --> 06:30:05.558
the address that the taxi would come on m but I do not remember the address but I laid

4434
06:30:05.558 --> 06:30:09.478
in it in Google Maps or what is it Apple Maps or something so I could only

4435
06:30:09.478 --> 06:30:16.240
see a blue dot so I knew what to go such a green blue road etc.

4436
06:30:16.240 --> 06:30:22.680
the phone okay and then you thought that if you get it look like you have

4437
06:30:22.680 --> 06:30:26.520
attempted but then had been to try to find any story then that they would

4438
06:30:26.520 --> 06:30:30.440
as well as release it eh or how

4439
06:30:30.440 --> 06:30:34.600
travel I don't really know how I thought no but eh

4440
06:30:34.600 --> 06:30:38.958
I thought it is better to go back in the apartment than to try to escape

4441
06:30:38.958 --> 06:30:43.160
tan that the white name maybe if I escape maybe my family and rilla out

4442
06:30:43.160 --> 06:30:49.160
eh so for the reason I chose I to go back to the apartment and

4443
06:30:49.160 --> 06:30:54.000
come up with any vott explanation and see what happens so you had thought of trying

4444
06:30:54.000 --> 06:31:00.920
Get back to this g attack the apartment then on the shooter's street okay and

4445
06:31:00.920 --> 06:31:03.680
did you think anything about if there was any risk that you might be allowed

4446
06:31:03.680 --> 06:31:08.320
reach another assignment then because you have not completed this I did not think so

4447
06:31:08.320 --> 06:31:14.440
a lot i was pretty stressed i i don't really know that my brain it was

4448
06:31:14.440 --> 06:31:20.280
good closed mm okay eh if i start with this with

4449
06:31:20.280 --> 06:31:25.240
time and you now say if I feet you around Åta nine in the evening you have

4450
06:31:25.240 --> 06:31:31.958
said quite a lot of later times in the various hearings if you look at

4451
06:31:31.958 --> 06:31:37.320
connections also from your phone so it is also only later in the evening that

4452
06:31:37.320 --> 06:31:42.798
You are at this address yes as I said I don't know what time was no it is

4453
06:31:42.798 --> 06:31:48.600
Nothing I think about but if you could tell us what time it was so if you

4454
06:31:48.600 --> 06:31:53.920
Do I want to know because I don't know myself no and I was if you say so

4455
06:31:53.920 --> 06:32:00.760
Here I was not there but in the second hearing then on the side

4456
06:32:01.600 --> 06:32:05.440
487 I think it was a bit when in time and I understand that it might be difficult

4457
06:32:05.440 --> 06:32:09.040
that in retrospect might speculate on what time

4458
06:32:09.040 --> 06:32:16.240
where so stands in the middle of that side of 487 itself the question is finished

4459
06:32:16.240 --> 06:32:21.440
To the crime scene and before Sebastian crushes the Sebastian box to 2330 to

4460
06:32:21.440 --> 06:32:25.840
Visätra and so he was thinking he was there for maybe one to two hours

4461
06:32:25.840 --> 06:32:34.240
Before he crushed the box to the gate eh yes it is true that is the right

4462
06:32:34.240 --> 06:32:39.840
should sue okay unless time perception was wrong but it felt anyway as

4463
06:32:39.840 --> 06:32:43.240
one to two hours

4464
06:32:43.638 --> 06:32:47.920
Mm and then I have to ask you a little bit

4465
06:32:47.920 --> 06:32:53.240
around for now here today so perceive it as you get where you put the things

4466
06:32:53.240 --> 06:32:58.040
In a bush you go and think about how to get your story and go together you

4467
06:32:58.040 --> 06:33:03.200
crushes this gate takes in some things and then you go out and become then

4468
06:33:03.200 --> 06:33:07.718
to catch by these people yes it is actually quite a long time before these

4469
06:33:07.718 --> 06:33:13.718
the people even come yes eh because as to said but that with the taxi eh I was

4470
06:33:13.718 --> 06:33:16.958
I went around I didn't even know if I would go back to the taxi I went

4471
06:33:16.958 --> 06:33:22.680
Around and wondered if you would walk around the taxi for maybe type 15 minutes eh

4472
06:33:22.680 --> 06:33:27.080
and I didn't even know if I had missed the taxi or what eh since I

4473
06:33:27.080 --> 06:33:31.478
came to the conclusion that I would take the taxi eventually eh so I started walking toward the taxi

4474
06:33:31.478 --> 06:33:38.160
and it was then that these guys came about a quarter after

4475
06:33:38.398 --> 06:33:43.280
ok before I go into it and some information that I mean you have left in

4476
06:33:43.280 --> 06:33:46.520
interrogation during this preliminary investigation into what is happening in this place

4477
06:33:46.520 --> 06:33:53.680
eh things you didn't mention now eh so I thought about asking you about you have

4478
06:33:53.680 --> 06:33:57.760
also in interrogation told me that you should be like in another apartment at something

4479
06:33:57.760 --> 06:34:03.000
occasion it is not true i don't know why i said it but that's not true

4480
06:34:03.000 --> 06:34:05.718
No

4481
06:34:08.760 --> 06:34:16.638
Okay and what was it you told about that apartment when I remember

4482
06:34:17.558 --> 06:34:22.398
not what was it that would be in that apartment and you remind it

4483
06:34:22.398 --> 06:34:25.398
No

4484
06:34:26.680 --> 06:34:34.040
Okay in the first hearing then you leave information at Sä it

4485
06:34:34.040 --> 06:34:38.558
-—-—-

4486
06:34:38.558 --> 06:34:41.958
went to another apartment before you go to this crime scene and that you then

4487
06:34:41.958 --> 06:34:46.558
Like this assignment is given as explained to you by these people

4488
06:34:46.558 --> 06:34:50.040
What are you going to do there and that you half threaten you around that you have to

4489
06:34:50.040 --> 06:34:58.790
do this yes I don't remember I have said so but yes I might say so

4490
06:34:58.790 --> 06:35:01.900
[Applause]

4491
06:35:02.638 --> 06:35:05.638
okay

4492
06:35:16.398 --> 06:35:21.009
Shall we see here [Music]

4493
06:35:32.638 --> 06:35:35.638
eh

4494
06:35:56.040 --> 06:35:59.958
I read a little neighbor from this first hearing I really want to access

4495
06:35:59.958 --> 06:36:05.398
information in the second hearing late but on page 473 almost at the bottom because then has

4496
06:36:05.398 --> 06:36:14.398
After all, told you that you meet then eh three guys who

4497
06:36:14.398 --> 06:36:19.840
eh yes but there we'll see now there is a little high up on page 473 what happens

4498
06:36:19.840 --> 06:36:23.638
Since I locked the door and softly they write that the taxi here I brought with me

4499
06:36:23.638 --> 06:36:28.760
All the taxi came around at 2122 I went out in the taxi put the stuff luggage they

4500
06:36:28.760 --> 06:36:32.360

4502
06:36:35.920 --> 06:36:40.000
away and hide me and then then describes that it came to the criminals and saw and

4503
06:36:40.000 --> 06:36:44.600
were in the forest and then you are at this crime scene

4504
06:36:44.600 --> 06:36:49.680
eh a little further down so you ask about these then three guys what do they say they

4505
06:36:49.680 --> 06:36:53.920

4507
06:36:57.638 --> 06:37:04.320
In the second time, you then get follow -up questions about this then

4508
06:37:04.320 --> 06:37:10.638
The apartment you mentioned here and your task on page 487

4509
06:37:10.638 --> 06:37:15.080
eh and I asked you why you are leaving this task and then you stand

4510
06:37:15.080 --> 06:37:20.520
recorded on question from the interrogator then when asked to tell about this

4511
06:37:20.520 --> 06:37:23.760
apartment that you have mentioned that it is not true but it was just something he

4512
06:37:23.760 --> 06:37:27.840
said he has only been in an apartment he mentioned the other to confuse so

4513
06:37:27.840 --> 06:37:32.440
no apartment would be stormed the three people are only

Eh There are information that you have provided in interrogation about a soft airgun pistol it

4523

4530
06:39:02.360 --> 06:39:06.638

4531
06:39:06.638 --> 06:39:10.558

4532
06:39:10.558 --> 06:39:16.558

4534
06:39:23.478 --> 06:39:28.558
in the apartment I don't know but I told you anything about that I had received

4535
06:39:28.558 --> 06:39:32.840
it anyway and that I didn't dare say no eh because then maybe they would

4536
06:39:32.840 --> 06:39:35.558
Shoot me etc.

4537
06:39:35.558 --> 06:39:41.440
eh and it was just something I said about this s gun I don't even know reasons

4538
06:39:41.440 --> 06:39:45.280
was because i said it with ants well it was because i don't even know myself just

4539
06:39:45.280 --> 06:39:52.080
threw me out something okay in in your first hearing like that

4540
06:39:52.080 --> 06:39:57.080
Have you described it as when you come to this place and this then stands

4541
06:39:57.080 --> 06:40:04.040
On page 473 in this paragraph is the longer paragraph that I just read then eh that

4542
06:40:04.040 --> 06:40:07.878
noted that when you come to the scene that it is a police car that drives

4543
06:40:07.878 --> 06:40:12.398
past and you need to hide then the criminals came and saw they asked me

4544
06:40:12.398 --> 06:40:16.798
what i did i had a soft ergan as i showed and they went from there and

4545
06:40:16.798 --> 06:40:20.558
then describes like you were in the forest for three hours went to the apartment and took

4546
06:40:20.558 --> 06:40:26.638
break this box and then then these criminals came back then and took

4547
06:40:26.638 --> 06:40:30.558
you and this abuse took place so there have you described it as you should

4548
06:40:30.558 --> 06:40:34.760
directed this soft gun at any person on the spot also eh I said that

4549
06:40:34.760 --> 06:40:38.360
I did not show it that I directed it but it still does not true I do not have

4550
06:40:38.360 --> 06:40:44.200
even had me on a sedve evening okay but why do you pull with that roller me

4551
06:40:44.200 --> 06:40:48.558
don't know no i actually don't know at all

4552
06:40:48.558 --> 06:40:51.200
why me

4553
06:40:51.680 --> 06:40:56.878
is standing in the second interrogation

4554
06:40:58.320 --> 06:41:01.320
then

4555
06:41:02.240 --> 06:41:05.240
Eh

4556
06:41:06.320 --> 06:41:11.000
so you describe it a bit similar and it's in the middle of the page

4557
06:41:11.000 --> 06:41:15.878
487 and it was then that I read around the very time then that

4558
06:41:15.878 --> 06:41:19.798
Sebastian goes 2330 to the hydrogen was there for maybe one to two hours before he

4559
06:41:19.798 --> 06:41:23.718
crushed the box to the away it again describes that you should put a police car and

4560
06:41:23.718 --> 06:41:27.718
hidden you in the woods and that people wondered what he did there then it took hold inan

4561
06:41:27.718 --> 06:41:32.040
he found back too he hid all things in bush at the gate that you

4562
06:41:32.040 --> 06:41:35.240
waited and bite

4563
06:41:36.520 --> 06:41:40.320
he thinks they called their guys for people stood ready since when Sebastian had

4564
06:41:40.320 --> 06:41:45.200
taken the gate door so you also describe it as you encounter people who

4565
06:41:45.200 --> 06:41:50.360
Wonder what you do there and that you then crush this gate and then then become

4566
06:41:50.360 --> 06:41:54.360
to the captive eh yes i don't know why i have

4567
06:41:54.360 --> 06:41:59.600
told about this gun at all no eh but this with

4568
06:41:59.600 --> 06:42:05.320
that they were standing out outside and waited but not either I guess they woke up

4569
06:42:05.320 --> 06:42:09.200
because they held this bang probably or not woke it up

4570
06:42:09.200 --> 06:42:13.120
maybe was out and maybe heard it so n might go around trying to find out

4571
06:42:13.120 --> 06:42:16.000
what it was that happened and then they found me after a quarter I guess it

4572
06:42:16.000 --> 06:42:21.200
was so and that I said so where I don't know what I might want to

4573
06:42:21.200 --> 06:42:28.398
wanted to get it and sound eh more like they stopped me eh in this one with lit fire

4574
06:42:28.398 --> 06:42:31.360
so that it would look even more like I would light

4575
06:42:31.360 --> 06:42:36.040
fire because v would otherwise stop me directly from nowhere if not

4576
06:42:36.040 --> 06:42:39.300
was there any reason for that

4577
06:42:39.300 --> 06:42:44.680
[Music] mm

4578
06:42:50.798 --> 06:42:56.120
Okay and it was then held a fourth interrogation

4579
06:42:56.120 --> 06:42:59.760
with you relatively recently to say now may have

4580
06:42:59.760 --> 06:43:06.878
gone another period of but February 18 with you and there you tell you

4581
06:43:06.878 --> 06:43:11.320
a lot also then about this soft air Gunnen and you were a bit into it that

4582
06:43:11.320 --> 06:43:16.120
what you said then that is not true it was just something like you

4583
06:43:16.120 --> 06:43:21.040
said and what what are you thinking about then what are the tasks that you have

4584
06:43:21.040 --> 06:43:26.360
left as you now want to back off you said for something what is it for

4585
06:43:26.360 --> 06:43:30.160
details that you mean you have left as you now no longer want to stand by

4586
06:43:30.160 --> 06:43:35.600
But before that I am not really

4587
06:43:35.600 --> 06:43:40.280
eh you have described in all previous interrogations as you have a softgun on

4588
06:43:40.280 --> 06:43:47.638
you eh okay yes and it does even in this fourth hearing it is first now

4589
06:43:47.638 --> 06:43:53.840
here today as you say you have never had any softgun on you etc. and then

4590
06:43:53.840 --> 06:43:58.440
I wonder what why have you left the information that you would have had one

4591
06:43:58.440 --> 06:44:04.718
Softgun on you probably like me don't even miss why because it was like that

4592
06:44:04.718 --> 06:44:09.600
a long time and I was tense but I guess it was because if I said I

4593
06:44:09.600 --> 06:44:13.638
had a soft on me that I showed it to someone so it would indicate that it

4594
06:44:13.638 --> 06:44:17.920
was a reason for them to try to stop me from lighting on this

4595
06:44:17.920 --> 06:44:22.840
the apartment that they would then follow me and be ready you understand

4596
06:44:22.840 --> 06:44:30.160
eh because if not had directed a gun or shown the soft to them they would

4597
06:44:30.160 --> 06:44:33.558
may not be present at all

4598
06:44:33.558 --> 06:44:38.718
or near this pot so I certainly wanted to make it sound like it

4599
06:44:38.718 --> 06:44:42.280
was why they wanted to stop me because that's why they foal after me you

4600
06:44:42.280 --> 06:44:47.040
understand what i mean no i actually don't really think

4601
06:44:47.040 --> 06:44:53.398
that I understand how you mean but I can explain better than you etc eh I think that

4602
06:44:53.398 --> 06:44:57.440
that I told you about that air soft it was because they were if I showed one

4603
06:44:57.440 --> 06:45:01.760
airsof for them so maybe they would call their friends and maybe look for me

4604
06:45:01.760 --> 06:45:05.920
And maybe it was there for so he stopped me before I would do it

4605
06:45:05.920 --> 06:45:09.798
here the thing it was sure I wanted to make it sound like it was so to

4606
06:45:09.798 --> 06:45:14.718
If I don't if we say I hadn't said that that I showed airsoft m

4607
06:45:14.718 --> 06:45:19.398
Then maybe those who read M preliminary investigation had thought yes but how did they know then

4608
06:45:19.398 --> 06:45:23.558
that you were even there and how did you know how did they know where is the pot why

4609
06:45:23.558 --> 06:45:28.638
they stopped you directly you understand but you describe yourself then as that as you

4610
06:45:28.638 --> 06:45:32.200
think because it has never happened that you have been standing on someone before you

4611
06:45:32.200 --> 06:45:36.280
have not had any of dargan you crush this box that it is something that

4612
06:45:36.280 --> 06:45:40.600
you hear and wake up by eh you think it doesn't sound reasonable then I

4613
06:45:40.600 --> 06:45:43.958
should understand it and therefore you have drawn to all this other because you

4614
06:45:43.958 --> 06:45:47.478
thinks it sounds much more reasonable no it locks it sounds reasonable but in case

4615
06:45:47.478 --> 06:45:52.718
I would wake up by you they would not be able to go out of their house and then walk around

4616
06:45:52.718 --> 06:45:59.680
In some way there no but that's what you mean here today yes yes it but

4617
06:45:59.680 --> 06:46:03.558
I don't even know myself but I think that's what I meant

4618
06:46:03.558 --> 06:46:09.120
If I were to get okay guess

4619
06:46:09.878 --> 06:46:14.398
Mm eh

4620
06:46:14.398 --> 06:46:19.878
What it has also come up in this fourth hearing brand new information

4621
06:46:19.878 --> 06:46:24.398
and also information that you don't seem to be stuck to today if you understand what I

4622
06:46:24.398 --> 06:46:30.040
then mean eh yes that we were two pers and stuff yes yes no we weren't two pers were

4623
06:46:30.040 --> 06:46:33.840
self because that was a task too

4624
06:46:33.840 --> 06:46:37.240
As you came here in the very last hearing that you would have been with

4625
06:46:37.240 --> 06:46:42.638
you any possible fellow jaid yes but that was what I reacted to

4626
06:46:42.638 --> 06:46:46.638
You didn't tell us about this today now no because it is not true that I said so

4627
06:46:46.638 --> 06:46:50.120
was because it was another at Siss's home that you sit with he said to

4628
06:46:50.120 --> 06:46:53.958
me that you can say it because it sounds better then then you might just get

4629
06:46:53.958 --> 06:46:58.120
Assisting for preparation That was why I said so mhm okay so you mean

4630
06:46:58.120 --> 06:47:01.958
that you got a advice from someone else at the Sish home to about leaving it

4631
06:47:01.958 --> 06:47:06.040
the task in interrogation yes

4632
06:47:08.360 --> 06:47:15.958
Okay you understand that it will be quite difficult to eh to know what information you

4633
06:47:15.958 --> 06:47:19.558
mean should be real or not because you have changed your mind very many

4634
06:47:19.558 --> 06:47:24.680
times in these different hearings it understands 100 % yes but

4635
06:47:24.680 --> 06:47:31.840
eh as I said I tell you the truth now you then you will believe what you want

4636
06:47:31.840 --> 06:47:36.638
But then at the site anyway what you do

4637
06:47:36.638 --> 06:47:41.120
you you crush without and you go in but this is only one as well as planted for

4638
06:47:41.120 --> 06:47:45.040
that it should look like you have tried to implement this and then should you

4639
06:47:45.040 --> 06:47:48.798
blame that you have come up is that I will understand you as well as that

4640
06:47:48.798 --> 06:47:51.638
that which happens and happens

4641
06:47:52.080 --> 06:47:55.080
where

4642
06:47:55.798 --> 06:48:04.718
Eh I wasn't going to talk so much about about what

4643
06:48:04.718 --> 06:48:10.718
late but eh about how long would you describe

4644
06:48:10.718 --> 06:48:15.840
that you are being beaten and robbed by these people who then as man

4645
06:48:15.840 --> 06:48:19.958
Meeting you It is difficult to mention time perception in such a hot situation

4646
06:48:19.958 --> 06:48:25.878
Yes but eh it felt all the case like 20 minutes yes since i don't know if it was

4647
06:48:25.878 --> 06:48:29.840
less no it may as well have been five minutes but it felt like 20

4648
06:48:29.840 --> 06:48:36.080
minutes okay eh and what to say how to be interrupted

4649
06:48:36.080 --> 06:48:40.680
the whole eh police want to drive past

4650
06:48:40.680 --> 06:48:47.760
okay and then what happens then eh when they run away with my phone

4651
06:48:47.760 --> 06:48:54.600
Okay and what do you do then eh I lie I am wondering if I should

4652
06:48:54.600 --> 06:48:58.000
stop and wait to get back my phone eh i might put there two

4653
06:48:58.000 --> 06:49:01.718
minutes since i think i sky the same since i stand up i limp i go

4654
06:49:01.718 --> 06:49:06.000
to eh gasp

4655
06:49:07.440 --> 06:49:13.760
mm and I have mentioned when this witness a lot but is it then you

4656
06:49:13.760 --> 06:49:20.798
hits on her yes about how long does it go from the time you 10 minutes yes

4657
06:49:20.798 --> 06:49:25.798
Okay so it's pretty short while after eh

4658
06:49:25.798 --> 06:49:32.360
yes and what do you say to her when I say I could borrow your

4659
06:49:32.360 --> 06:49:37.440
Telef mm eh because I have been robbed I need to call my

4660
06:49:37.440 --> 06:49:44.718
friend do you get it yes and what do you do when I call some friends check if they can

4661
06:49:44.718 --> 06:49:50.600
pick me up mm no one can pick me up so i try to somehow get back in

4662
06:49:50.600 --> 06:49:55.240
The apartment but I can't find any address eh so in the end I

4663
06:49:55.240 --> 06:50:00.558
decides to call a t because i got it pretty much prime.se okay

4664
06:50:00.558 --> 06:50:06.718
Is it you who call 1 t yes I who call tv on her phone etc. where are you then

4665
06:50:06.718 --> 06:50:12.240
somewhere in her apartment okay so you have gone there I am

4666
06:50:12.240 --> 06:50:16.920
Yes and this when you call your friends and

4667
06:50:16.920 --> 06:50:22.160
So there you are still outdoors then or are you in her apartment I call

4668
06:50:22.160 --> 06:50:25.840
I call a friend so we are outdoors but i don't think i called he then i think

4669
06:50:25.840 --> 06:50:31.840
M wrote to him and snapped with him for some what has happened to eh though

4670
06:50:31.840 --> 06:50:36.920
I don't remember no but I remember that I called two in the apartment etc. and

4671
06:50:36.920 --> 06:50:43.440
that I called someone too in the apartment okay and what is your thought

4672
06:50:43.440 --> 06:50:49.920
around to call 112 then eh yes why do you call 1 t because I

4673
06:50:49.920 --> 06:50:55.120
bleeding pretty much and i need help m

4674
06:50:56.398 --> 06:51:00.240
Mm and what happens then there will be some ambulance

4675
06:51:00.240 --> 06:51:08.798
Yes, the police will also yes what do you say to the police eh I say hello then then

4676
06:51:08.798 --> 06:51:15.920
around what has happened to eh they take me to the car to hear me etc. eh they

4677
06:51:15.920 --> 06:51:20.240
Asking the same question several times first tells them that I rt for my HVB

4678
06:51:20.240 --> 06:51:25.520
home i boros a friend then start asking more questions eh and i would rather not

4679
06:51:25.520 --> 06:51:30.920
reply to them eh late in the end i got so stressed because i want to the hospital

4680
06:51:30.920 --> 06:51:34.478
and i couldn't go a hospital so i just told you about what I would

4681
06:51:34.478 --> 06:51:39.478
do in Stockholm and what are you telling then eh that it would be part of

4682
06:51:39.478 --> 06:51:46.478
a door and the door lay on eh a pot named 25 or as it stands 25 on and

4683
06:51:46.478 --> 06:51:50.798
that it should stand kimumba on the door

4684
06:51:51.478 --> 06:51:57.478
Okay you say anything else before you say

4685
06:51:58.958 --> 06:52:03.798
It must think

4686
06:52:03.798 --> 06:52:08.240
No i don't think so no i surely i said anything but i ms

4687
06:52:08.240 --> 06:52:12.840
Not nothing important I have gone through events

4688
06:52:12.840 --> 06:52:15.798
Report, among other things, and then there are sometimes information that you should have said

4689
06:52:15.798 --> 06:52:19.440
then that it should have something to do with any drug sale or

4690
06:52:19.440 --> 06:52:25.000
similar who had gone wrong yes quite frankly I actually don't remember that I

4691
06:52:25.000 --> 06:52:28.478
have said that no

4692
06:52:31.440 --> 06:52:39.080
okay and yes how do you go about when you try to get back to

4693
06:52:39.080 --> 06:52:45.398
the apartment then eh I google on g attack etc. and but

4694
06:52:45.398 --> 06:52:49.558
I find nothing I go to find.se trying to find but I find no one

4695
06:52:49.558 --> 06:52:55.040
Apartment tied to it or any address I mean no eh so in the end so

4696
06:52:55.040 --> 06:53:01.440
i call bare tv okay so that search happened before you call 1 to tv yes

4697
06:53:01.440 --> 06:53:04.440
mm

4698
06:53:08.638 --> 06:53:14.000
Do you get any questions from the police around that apartment yes they asked me what how

4699
06:53:14.000 --> 06:53:19.638
it looks in there yes eh but it is not at this point what I mins

4700
06:53:19.638 --> 06:53:23.558
I believe this on my first interrogation etc. after they have searched through

4701
06:53:23.558 --> 06:53:29.240
apartment eh and then i tell me i was in the apartment i see someone

4702
06:53:29.240 --> 06:53:35.478
plastic gear s that looks like V done to keep Ven eh and I see a gun

4703
06:53:35.478 --> 06:53:40.478
on the ny table eh and I tell you a little how it

4704
06:53:40.478 --> 06:53:46.638
the apartment looks sofa what the sofa is what the bed is and a bit like that

4705
06:53:46.638 --> 06:53:51.760
Mm okay i thought there was also a task in these events the report about

4706
06:53:51.760 --> 06:53:55.478
Like you tried to confuse the cops around where this apartment or where

4707
06:53:55.478 --> 06:54:01.360
This print the apartment was somewhere what yes it is true

4708
06:54:01.360 --> 06:54:04.360
okay

4709
06:54:15.000 --> 06:54:19.718
I leave this part a little neighbor and jump back to this gun

4710
06:54:19.718 --> 06:54:22.638
And the weapon

4711
06:54:22.798 --> 06:54:29.558
eh and did you see something more weapons related in this one

4712
06:54:29.558 --> 06:54:38.718
the apartment v there bullets in this plastic thing in the plastic stuff yes plastic box

4713
06:54:38.718 --> 06:54:44.240
What was the box it was a box that looked like I don't know but when one

4714
06:54:44.240 --> 06:54:50.160
opened the box so you saw that it was like this what is it not called cotton type

4715
06:54:50.160 --> 06:54:56.000
frigolite type that was adapted for guns because i saw pistol pressure

4716
06:54:56.000 --> 06:55:01.360
impressions there if you remember from still images of this movie I showed you saw

4717
06:55:01.360 --> 06:55:05.478
something black that lay on like the living room table that I call a

4718
06:55:05.478 --> 06:55:10.718
gun bag is the one you describe that low bag yes or a weapon box then

4719
06:55:10.718 --> 06:55:15.240
perhaps rather based on your description etc. it is the one you mean that was black

4720
06:55:15.240 --> 06:55:17.920
Okay

4721
06:55:18.680 --> 06:55:24.680
eh I perceived you as you said you didn't think this one was real

4722
06:55:24.680 --> 06:55:30.360
that you assume it is fake yes and why did you assume it eh because it was

4723
06:55:30.360 --> 06:55:35.200
Something that stings out in the pipe and I didn't think real guns look

4724
06:55:35.200 --> 06:55:41.080
so eh but i have seen airsof guns that look so mm eh so I ant

4725
06:55:41.080 --> 06:55:46.520
was fake okay eh would you say you have good

4726
06:55:46.520 --> 06:55:52.478
Knowledge and check weapons no you have any special weapon interest not one

4727
06:55:52.478 --> 06:55:56.760
Interest I have shot with a weapon on a shooting range once yes eh with

4728
06:55:56.760 --> 06:56:03.200
my family home's son it's just that otherwise yes I have

4729
06:56:03.200 --> 06:56:07.638
Also some videos in my snap with such airs' guns as I am me jokes a little

4730
06:56:07.638 --> 06:56:13.200
with so mm it is not a crime related it is just an ordinary image that man

4731
06:56:13.200 --> 06:56:19.680
Sent to my regular friend okay you think it's cool with weapons eh I

4732
06:56:19.680 --> 06:56:25.558
thought it then but now i don't think so okay

4733
06:56:27.398 --> 06:56:32.878
eh do you know anything around

4734
06:56:32.878 --> 06:56:38.638
After all, you have been asked about what kind of gun in interrogation was remembered

4735
06:56:38.638 --> 06:56:43.080
you have been able to answer about what it was Glock 25 on it so I assumed it was

4736
06:56:43.080 --> 06:56:48.200
A GLOCK 25 mm It is also what you have said in interrogation should I say

4737
06:56:48.200 --> 06:56:54.638
eh and as we went through then based on NFC when they have gone through this phone

4738
06:56:54.638 --> 06:56:57.600
or the phone this weapon so it was cut off and so it was

4739
06:56:57.600 --> 06:57:02.878
Tagged as Glock 25 on this fittings package

4740
06:57:02.878 --> 06:57:08.798
No but you read there on the yes that you played with then as you have described played

4741
06:57:08.798 --> 06:57:16.760
and played yes yes that you kept in and mantled at some point it is true

4742
06:57:17.160 --> 06:57:20.160
yes

4743
06:57:21.798 --> 06:57:26.478
eh and exactly how would you describe what is

4744
06:57:26.478 --> 06:57:32.320
what you do in your handling with this weapon I already told me I I

4745
06:57:32.320 --> 06:57:37.760
I draw mantles the mm eh I take a picture eh I press this button

4746
06:57:37.760 --> 06:57:45.160
so that it goes back again mm eh yes then a few minutes later so i would

4747
06:57:45.160 --> 06:57:48.200
Take it up again because I had nothing better for me since I saw it was

4748
06:57:48.200 --> 06:57:54.680
Though a bullet in the barrel that was completely fucked mm eh and then I thought I r away

4749
06:57:54.680 --> 06:57:58.398
me and i got terrified and thought someone would kill me so i called eh

4750
06:57:58.398 --> 06:58:03.160
my client and told him he said it was LUGT okay

4751
06:58:03.160 --> 06:58:06.958
But now I mean then like that it we have an opportunity as you you mantle it

4752
06:58:06.958 --> 06:58:10.160
But you pick it up again and then you see like this ball is stuck

4753
06:58:10.160 --> 06:58:13.520
Yes, okay

4754
06:58:13.600 --> 06:58:19.200
eh you have told you that you should have done a little more with this weapon in

4755
06:58:19.200 --> 06:58:24.120
interrogation also eh what did i say you have told you that you

4756
06:58:24.120 --> 06:58:29.240
have done a little more with this weapon than just what you have described now in

4757
06:58:29.240 --> 06:58:35.000
interrogation yes it is not true what did you say it is not true that is exactly what I

4758
06:58:35.000 --> 06:58:41.478
have done with it okay then maybe I perceive you wrong then but then I would

4759
06:58:41.478 --> 06:58:47.120
want to read because I mean that it deviates and that in the first hearing so is

4760
06:58:47.120 --> 06:58:51.958
it a task in the middle of the page

4761
06:58:52.280 --> 06:58:58.958
eh and it is you yourself then that makes an addition to reading and in others

4762
06:58:58.958 --> 06:59:03.760
the piece there it says another thing at the beginning v that I played with the gun I

4763
06:59:03.760 --> 06:59:07.798
brought it up loading it twice took a video that was what I did

4764
06:59:07.798 --> 06:59:12.160
called and said a bullet was stuck and he said it was quiet so that

4765
06:59:12.160 --> 06:59:15.478
do you describe that what we twice you load the n I loaded it so that

4766
06:59:15.478 --> 06:59:19.920
I loaded it twice eh when I meant I loaded it once when

4767
06:59:19.920 --> 06:59:24.920
I filmed etc. and when I would charge the time after that was when I noticed

4768
06:59:24.920 --> 06:59:29.160
that it was a bullet that was stuck I

4769
06:59:29.160 --> 06:59:35.080
again okay eh in the same one because otherwise I didn't have

4770
06:59:35.080 --> 06:59:39.000
been able to notice that a bullet was stuck unless Dr. Back it again

4771
06:59:39.000 --> 06:59:46.760
Okay it is through your handling that like this bullet stuck eh yes okay it

4772
06:59:46.760 --> 06:59:52.398
Didn't get stuck before but there was something that happened when you were doing

4773
06:59:52.398 --> 06:59:54.718
the

4774
06:59:57.520 --> 07:00:04.360
Yes eh in the second interrogation on the page

4775
07:00:04.760 --> 07:00:13.600
486 Prime Crime DSE NEXT EH The piece North at the bottom eh so is a drawn like this

4776
07:00:13.600 --> 07:00:17.240
Sebastian saw a weapon he doesn't really remember but think it was a Glock 20 he

4777
07:00:17.240 --> 07:00:21.240
touched only one weapon there were several weapons but it came since Sebastian touched the weapon

4778
07:00:21.240 --> 07:00:25.680
Pretty directly he played with what he took out the magazine took in the magazine loaded and

4779
07:00:25.680 --> 07:00:30.280
Took some pictures as well as video he held the handle and mantled and you write

4780
07:00:30.280 --> 07:00:34.558
It as if the weapon was lying at the balcony door there was a table it was completely open and

4781
07:00:34.558 --> 07:00:39.520
It wasn't charged He never loaded with bullets but maybe someone

4782
07:00:40.638 --> 07:00:45.478
walking mm so it is described as you have done a little more than that you

4783
07:00:45.478 --> 07:00:49.840
describes yourself with this weapon that's exactly what I said now

4784
07:00:49.840 --> 07:00:53.760
As I have done with nothing else

4785
07:01:00.920 --> 07:01:03.920
Okay

4786
07:01:21.798 --> 07:01:26.718
I was thinking in the first company the hearing so also gets a question about what you were thinking

4787
07:01:26.718 --> 07:01:34.240
around this weapon if it looked genuine and in the middle when on page 471 is

4788
07:01:34.240 --> 07:01:40.680
that task eh and then it is noted that you should answer

4789
07:01:40.840 --> 07:01:46.160
yes eh yes i don't know why i said that

4790
07:01:46.160 --> 07:01:50.680
but looked marry I looked genuine so I didn't even know for myself if they were genuine

4791
07:01:50.680 --> 07:01:55.920
or not no ok i'm pretty sure i

4792
07:01:55.920 --> 07:02:00.840
have said another hearing too eh

4793
07:02:00.840 --> 07:02:06.680
yes yes they also asked me if they if I think it was genuine and then I said that

4794
07:02:06.680 --> 07:02:11.398
We don't use it so I don't know then it looked real and I said yes it saw

4795
07:02:11.398 --> 07:02:17.000
After all, it looked obviously genuine but I didn't know if it was genuine airsoft

4796
07:02:17.000 --> 07:02:22.080
Pistols also look autumn okay but why do you assume here today that it was

4797
07:02:22.080 --> 07:02:29.320
fake to assume and guess I don't even know if it was fake I know now I

4798
07:02:29.320 --> 07:02:33.280
Know now I know it was real considering you tested them yes but

4799
07:02:33.280 --> 07:02:38.080
I thought what did you think there and then there and then I didn't know I assumed

4800
07:02:38.080 --> 07:02:42.200
assumed it was that it was fake but the first n right when I saw the one I

4801
07:02:42.200 --> 07:02:45.398
saw that there was something that stuck

4802
07:02:45.520 --> 07:02:53.120
Out that what I know of my knowledge so don't usually stand out anything in weapons

4803
07:02:53.120 --> 07:02:56.120
No

4804
07:02:57.440 --> 07:03:03.760
Okay maybe come back to it

4805
07:03:04.398 --> 07:03:06.718
late

4806
07:03:12.680 --> 07:03:20.160
eh if you can only explain this when and how are it you regret that you

4807
07:03:20.160 --> 07:03:23.520
is going to do the job m I regret immediately when I met this girl on

4808
07:03:23.520 --> 07:03:28.638
Central station okay

4809
07:03:28.638 --> 07:03:34.680
eh so it was not right there at home then when the friend as you say then

4810
07:03:34.680 --> 07:03:40.638
have taken this and your behalf no, so they tried to hype me that

4811
07:03:40.638 --> 07:03:43.840
first saw burning equipment when I thought I might yes maybe burn

4812
07:03:43.840 --> 07:03:46.958
Someone's clothes that I may have used in any crime I know I don't know

4813
07:03:46.958 --> 07:03:50.680
Not what I was thinking MHM I didn't even know I would do this

4814
07:03:50.680 --> 07:03:57.798
I don't know why I would regret it on some clothes for 15,000 that is not

4815
07:03:57.798 --> 07:04:02.760
even a crime no okay but when got you mean that you found out what it

4816
07:04:02.760 --> 07:04:07.760
where exactly you would do then mm it was so it was on the way to Stockholm when

4817
07:04:07.760 --> 07:04:12.798
I was in Sundsval on my way to Stockholm Yes then I found out that would lit

4818
07:04:12.798 --> 07:04:19.320
on an apartment okay but then they said someone would open eh pot to me so they

4819
07:04:19.320 --> 07:04:23.558
all the time changed what it would be what it would not be

4820
07:04:23.558 --> 07:04:29.040
try to make me want to do that

4821
07:04:29.398 --> 07:04:35.478
Okay so this as I read then around in previous interrogation that you have told you

4822
07:04:35.478 --> 07:04:39.398
like you or work goes out into this group and you take in spirit then

4823
07:04:39.398 --> 07:04:43.760
it was quite detailed what it was to do but you mean that

4824
07:04:43.760 --> 07:04:47.760
that it wasn't without you just thought it was something else to be fired

4825
07:04:47.760 --> 07:04:52.080
At InIS so I think I didn't even know when they immediately when I got there in the bu

4826
07:04:52.080 --> 07:04:57.638
my friend wrote that you wanted to do what they said so and so would burn

4827
07:04:57.638 --> 07:05:03.638
Equipment etc. Okay

4828
07:05:03.680 --> 07:05:10.958
eh and what is it that does feel that you like continuing or what to say

4829
07:05:10.958 --> 07:05:16.558
that you are in this apartment you receive these things I have seen eh v

4830
07:05:16.558 --> 07:05:21.200
What happens to people eh I haven't seen but I know what happens to people

4831
07:05:21.200 --> 07:05:26.320
14-year-olds through 14-year-old has died for such little stuff or small stuff

4832
07:05:26.320 --> 07:05:29.958
I don't know what they have died for but they have died etc. you I think and I

4833
07:05:29.958 --> 07:05:33.878
with even older I sit here so they have my name they have my last name they

4834
07:05:33.878 --> 07:05:37.718
even have my third surname n they look up a bit careful where mm you can

4835
07:05:37.718 --> 07:05:42.440
they can find out what my family then came to peace at

4836
07:05:44.120 --> 07:05:50.440
everything but what do you think when you tell you the way you do here

4837
07:05:50.440 --> 07:05:54.000
today i mean then it comes out of everything now that you never intended to do

4838
07:05:54.000 --> 07:05:57.398
this and you don't think it will be even worse then that you had intended to

4839
07:05:57.398 --> 07:06:02.320
try to deceive them eh shall i let the thing

4840
07:06:02.320 --> 07:06:08.320
done yes but I was thinking of holding on to this then the version as you have

4841
07:06:08.320 --> 07:06:12.718
left earlier the same it is the true version yes but I think like that

4842
07:06:12.718 --> 07:06:17.160
Here you choose to tell the truth now you say but I think then the risks

4843
07:06:17.160 --> 07:06:20.718
behind telling the truth that is what has made you choose not to

4844
07:06:20.718 --> 07:06:24.878
tell the truth earlier just sit inside sis and

4845
07:06:24.878 --> 07:06:29.920
Hkt what did you say then when I was thinking like this I didn't know how it was

4846
07:06:29.920 --> 07:06:34.320
Inside Siss or sit inside the detention or seated in custody I knew but that

4847
07:06:34.320 --> 07:06:38.840
sitting for a long time now it feels like i don't know the world is gray i can

4848
07:06:38.840 --> 07:06:42.718
Not even I can't even call my friends etc. yes I would rather call mine

4849
07:06:42.718 --> 07:06:49.760
friends and obtain a protected identity than to sit inside than to sit inside yes where

4850
07:06:49.760 --> 07:06:54.000
Do you mean you would sit inside somewhere yes I don't know in the last in one

4851
07:06:54.000 --> 07:06:59.398
years yes i came i might get a year i don't know but no matter what it is

4852
07:06:59.398 --> 07:07:02.638
As well tell me I can only get protect you identity if it is so that

4853
07:07:02.638 --> 07:07:08.760
It is needed but I have not mentioned any names eh so it should not even be needed

4854
07:07:08.760 --> 07:07:13.718
Actually but you think you you won't have to be on SIS anymore jo

4855
07:07:13.718 --> 07:07:18.958
Of course if you tell me I have LVU so what will be the difference then if I come

4856
07:07:18.958 --> 07:07:24.320
Out no if you go there for a year sitting on sis or that you have lvu and

4857
07:07:24.320 --> 07:07:29.040
sitting on sis what will be the difference in practice i don't know but if i get

4858
07:07:29.040 --> 07:07:33.558
11v it gets the shorter one and if i fus maybe i'm sitting on a little more

4859
07:07:33.558 --> 07:07:40.360
opener sis yes okay i thought then versus this risk that you have been sustained when I

4860
07:07:40.360 --> 07:07:44.638
don't really understand as well as why you tell the truth today do you say i

4861
07:07:44.638 --> 07:07:48.440
not i have not mentioned any names no i have not mentioned any real

4862
07:07:48.440 --> 07:07:54.240
people no eh so i tell you this story or truth if you

4863
07:07:54.240 --> 07:07:57.360
understands what i mean the story the same thing then

4864
07:07:57.360 --> 07:08:02.000
So I have no one not so many risks really except that I did not have

4865
07:08:02.000 --> 07:08:06.000
thought gö it from the beginning no but i was thinking the risks to you

4866
07:08:06.000 --> 07:08:11.440
self yes i get l take them then i'll see okay

4867
07:08:11.440 --> 07:08:16.240
that and that's what I wonder why are you prepared to change your mind now

4868
07:08:16.240 --> 07:08:20.200
I don't know which question now so it doesn't get confusing for no but about the risks

4869
07:08:20.200 --> 07:08:24.280
Because that was why you like I understood you didn't want to say that you were not

4870
07:08:24.280 --> 07:08:28.320
wanted to do this all the time it was because you were scared and you know what

4871
07:08:28.320 --> 07:08:32.680
happens and you you say no or refuse assignments

4872
07:08:32.680 --> 07:08:35.680
For now it becomes clear based on your story that you have never thought that

4873
07:08:35.680 --> 07:08:40.280
do this at all you just thought to have it look like it yes I

4874
07:08:40.280 --> 07:08:45.360
Don't know what to say so it is the truth why I tell you that I

4875
07:08:45.360 --> 07:08:52.718
don't know no okay you are prepared to take that risk now i'll understand it so yeah

4876
07:08:54.398 --> 07:09:01.958
Mm eh i stay there right now thanks mm we'll see now because we'll change

4877
07:09:01.958 --> 07:09:07.280
16.30 EH are there many questions you want to ask some questions maybe yes I have

4878
07:09:07.280 --> 07:09:11.718
just some question i have any question since the defender wants to ask some questions that

4879
07:09:11.718 --> 07:09:15.920
maybe we'll take tomorrow instead dinan questions or it won't take that long

4880
07:09:15.920 --> 07:09:19.638
Time that we will go over time no yes we start with your questions so we'll see

4881
07:09:19.638 --> 07:09:23.478
How far we get off, etc. No I thought about

4882
07:09:23.478 --> 07:09:29.958
eh how was it with this with weapons and ammunition and so what what do you know

4883
07:09:29.958 --> 07:09:36.680
If it eh then I don't know that much about ammunition and stuff but I

4884
07:09:36.680 --> 07:09:42.280
Remember from this box eh what fun I remember because they said

4885
07:09:42.280 --> 07:09:48.478
it quite a few times because we talked about it eh when they said like this 38 years nine years

4886
07:09:48.478 --> 07:09:52.638
Kotta and stuff like that just because here it looks like it is you that they ask

4887
07:09:52.638 --> 07:09:58.638
you what was it in the box and then you say 32 short nine and

4888
07:09:58.638 --> 07:10:05.920
38 Yes It wasn't 32 two Kotta Nior and I don't even know 32 there what

4889
07:10:05.920 --> 07:10:12.040
it stands for something then it says where you have read somewhere page 471 pretty

4890
07:10:12.040 --> 07:10:14.920
far down

4891
07:10:16.360 --> 07:10:23.120
Mm yes how do you know eh that it was that kind of of ammunition say these i

4892
07:10:23.120 --> 07:10:28.920
had eh i had nothing to do so i checked everything how many 9 mm was

4893
07:10:28.920 --> 07:10:37.920
Type four type three 32 and TV 38 and then there was another ammunition yes and how

4894
07:10:37.920 --> 07:10:42.920
looked the carton yes when you buy a gun so you probably get one that sounds

4895
07:10:42.920 --> 07:10:48.160
Like you have a very good squeeze on this with ammunition anyway I have

4896
07:10:48.160 --> 07:10:53.558
not so well pinched on ammunition but I don't know how I might have

4897
07:10:53.558 --> 07:11:00.280
Good squeeze on ammunition if you I do not know but as

4898
07:11:00.280 --> 07:11:04.240
said I checked through because I still had nothing to do and I know that

4899
07:11:04.240 --> 07:11:07.760
You get such a box when you buy guns because I have seen this on

4900
07:11:07.760 --> 07:11:13.320
Youtube memes or whatever the hell it is called okay how come you can

4901
07:11:13.320 --> 07:11:17.558
answer so detailed on these questions i don't know since it was detailed i

4902
07:11:17.558 --> 07:11:22.680
don't even think it was so many or them but maybe it was i don't know but

4903
07:11:22.680 --> 07:11:29.360
It was about so okay thank you I have no more questions no ok ok eh drill bro

07:11:43.360 --> 07:11:48.440

also do you accept eh thus I accepted d accepted eh thus

4908
07:11:54.440 --> 07:11:57.558
Actually in itin I don't want to do it but I suppressed it so it felt

4909
07:11:57.558 --> 07:12:03.478
Like I wanted to do it and as I said told me equipment so I knew

4910
07:12:03.478 --> 07:12:07.040
not even that was any rise I would do okay what did you think or

4911
07:12:07.040 --> 07:12:11.680
You mentioned earlier could be clothing such as burning clothes or

4912
07:12:11.680 --> 07:12:16.320
How yes the one who wrote to you we like this

4913

The client in what way he or she wrote he wrote like this

4914
07:12:20.440 --> 07:12:24.840
He tried to hype me so he tried to make me really want to do

4915
07:12:24.840 --> 07:12:31.320
It said like this yes 15,000 since he stepped up eh like what I would do eh late

4916
07:12:31.320 --> 07:12:36.280
he told me yeah that's good you I don't make but h tried to hype me like

4917
07:12:36.280 --> 07:12:39.280
Mm

4918
07:12:39.638 --> 07:12:47.840
okay you have someone or if we say you as a person are you easy and convince

4919
07:12:47.840 --> 07:12:53.520
or yeah actually one should be completely honest m there is there is some reason

4920
07:12:53.520 --> 07:12:58.120
to why it is that way it might be because i have adhd mm

4921
07:12:58.120 --> 07:13:03.798
eh maybe i don't know adhd it i haven't got my medication for a good while

4922
07:13:03.798 --> 07:13:07.478
because e okay but what about adhd is something that affects

4923
07:13:07.478 --> 07:13:12.440
Just how you make decisions for example yes it yes it affects after all

4924
07:13:12.440 --> 07:13:19.080
concentration and of course it affects quite a lot of impulsivity yes how are you

4925
07:13:19.080 --> 07:13:24.520
with that you are impulsive yes yes, actually etc. and how was it with medicines then eh I

4926
07:13:24.520 --> 07:13:31.120
have not received medicine in a long time for eh i use cannabis on my hb home eh

4927
07:13:31.120 --> 07:13:36.638
so they chose to remove my od hair medicine so I have not received it later

4928
07:13:49.398 --> 07:13:56.240
D If we talk a little about about Stockholm you come to Stockholm you

4929
07:13:56.240 --> 07:14:03.040
TAKING FOR SA you you took previous train or what did you say yes I took

4930
07:14:03.040 --> 07:14:07.240
A yes I took a previous train because I

4931
07:14:07.240 --> 07:14:10.120
Was pretty stressed and I just took the first train to go to Stockholm

4932
07:14:10.120 --> 07:14:14.520
or Sundsval and you had received tickets through

4933
07:14:14.520 --> 07:14:21.120
email to an address where your name appears or how yes but you did not take

4934
07:14:21.120 --> 07:14:25.878
that train or bus like the ticket why eh without you took it earlier as

4935
07:14:25.878 --> 07:14:30.320
said I was stressed I didn't know I I don't know I was pretty tense

4936
07:14:30.320 --> 07:14:34.280
I just took the first train I saw as much in the moment's case I saw that it

4937
07:14:34.280 --> 07:14:39.000
comes earlier so i didn't think i just took it eh even though my ticket

4938
07:14:39.000 --> 07:14:42.558
probably didn't work on that train but they controlled never had you

4939
07:14:42.558 --> 07:14:48.520
been in Stockholm earlier reach eh no is the first trip so

4940
07:14:55.558 --> 07:15:01.958
Yes in that case I stay there thank you so much and none no matter are no questions I

4941
07:15:01.958 --> 07:15:06.680
have a supplement if I yes, thank you so I thought about this it

4942
07:15:06.680 --> 07:15:13.360
Here the gasoline tube that you had with you yes you have in this picture you see that

4943
07:15:13.360 --> 07:15:19.040
It stands quite high up in the stairwell yes after the first ledge

4944
07:15:19.040 --> 07:15:24.120
Eh how come you you carried that one if you hadn't thought to

4945
07:15:24.120 --> 07:15:28.680
implement this that it would look even more like I would implement

4946
07:15:28.680 --> 07:15:34.600
That is why I bate it okay what makes it a difference if you wear

4947
07:15:34.600 --> 07:15:41.920
up closer to the door sorry you are the closer the door okay and eh there was

4948
07:15:41.920 --> 07:15:48.080
other things up there too no what I

4949
07:15:48.160 --> 07:15:54.440
Miss how did your thoughts go by the way as well as when you shoes under the box and take

4950
07:15:54.440 --> 07:15:59.080
you in where I was pretty stressed I was thinking about all sorts different

4951
07:15:59.080 --> 07:16:01.798
consequences thought perhaps the police will come

4952
07:16:01.798 --> 07:16:06.680
maybe i don't know everything possible everything i was thinking about and i tried

4953
07:16:06.680 --> 07:16:10.920
come on reaching something I would do that would not pose any danger to

4954
07:16:10.920 --> 07:16:16.000
any eh and no danger to myself either

4955
07:16:16.000 --> 07:16:23.280
mm When you stand there you know where you are going then you remember this name that you have

4956
07:16:23.280 --> 07:16:28.000
got eh yes i remember it was kumba or kimumba or something like that

4957
07:16:28.000 --> 07:16:32.840
Mm and you will find that name no

4958
07:16:33.120 --> 07:16:38.080
How come then that you could not find the name so I am not

4959
07:16:38.080 --> 07:16:41.760
afterwards when I get into the stairwell so I see that not so name

4960
07:16:41.760 --> 07:16:47.040
on the doors so even though I had been looking for VIK UMBA so I did not have

4961
07:16:47.040 --> 07:16:52.320
found it unless I had been less stressed and actually Viljat do it so

4962
07:16:52.320 --> 07:16:56.160
Had I might have looked at any note or something or googled or

4963
07:16:56.160 --> 07:17:02.478
something you would have been less stressed if you had wanted to make it no I think

4964
07:17:02.478 --> 07:17:07.398
not that okay i think n i had been more

4965
07:17:07.398 --> 07:17:10.840
stressed if I had wanted to do

4966
07:17:12.440 --> 07:17:20.200
it and you walk around where you do not find the name of the doors you will see you

4967
07:17:20.200 --> 07:17:26.558
should be up the tube to the door I actually don't know I just assumed it is

4968
07:17:26.558 --> 07:17:32.280
greater chance that his door is further up the stairwell at the bottom with TKA on

4969
07:17:32.280 --> 07:17:34.798
that there are several

4970
07:17:35.160 --> 07:17:39.160
floors okay

4971
07:17:39.160 --> 07:17:45.040
eh how would it make any difference how would you imagine it

4972
07:17:45.040 --> 07:17:49.160
that will then know that you have had this one

4973
07:17:49.160 --> 07:17:53.080
the intention I don't know the day after you wake you might see that there is one

4974
07:17:53.080 --> 07:17:57.718
Gasol type where you call the police the police may play the area they put in

4975
07:17:57.718 --> 07:18:04.718
that in some kind of preliminary investigation eh then sees it lay there okay it was

4976
07:18:04.718 --> 07:18:10.478
you saw in front of you eh that they would do it

4977
07:18:10.478 --> 07:18:15.760
Yeah ok thanks fl questions

4978
07:18:15.760 --> 07:18:20.040
Mm I have any supplementary

4979
07:18:24.478 --> 07:18:30.760
Eh i was thinking about just this with that you told me when you find out

4980
07:18:30.760 --> 07:18:35.240
on this job or not I read a little neighbor from from this first

4981
07:18:35.240 --> 07:18:40.638
the interrogation eh but there is also a task in this other

4982
07:18:40.638 --> 07:18:46.120
the interrogation and eh which is October 16 thus starting on the page

4983
07:18:46.120 --> 07:18:55.840
485 A task that is on page 488 and the second last eh paragraph there

4984
07:18:55.840 --> 07:19:01.680
Back back to before all for heard lance note note that Sebastian

4985
07:19:01.680 --> 07:19:08.200
find out the job on Tuesday the same week they said he would do already in

4986
07:19:13.600 --> 07:19:18.520
beginning yes they have not done anyway they said i would burn equipment

4987
07:19:18.520 --> 07:19:23.958
What did you say they said it would burn equipment okay so you are stuck to it

4988
07:19:23.958 --> 07:19:29.638
That it was what you found out before you go to Stockholm then yes

4989
07:19:29.638 --> 07:19:34.280
mm Then I have nothing further thank you no there is reaching fl

4990
07:19:34.280 --> 07:19:38.360
Asking then we finish

4991
07:19:40.240 --> 07:19:45.040
The hearing Yes Questions Complain Starts by asking questions or do you want to tell

4992
07:19:45.040 --> 07:19:49.520
myself by the way yes I can very much do make it perfect eh then

4993
07:19:49.520 --> 07:19:54.638
I think I account because I experienced then these deeds

4994
07:19:54.638 --> 07:19:59.360
then as claims I have done then and eh all the things I can start with

4995
07:19:59.360 --> 07:20:03.600
to say that all the things I have bought and purchased and so on

4996
07:20:03.600 --> 07:20:08.760
and handed over it I have done it is nothing that I deny eh but the purpose

4997
07:20:08.760 --> 07:20:13.280
by buying and purchasing all these things eh is as I understood it then

4998
07:20:13.280 --> 07:20:18.478
would be used for a workshop that we had talked about for about a month's time

4999
07:20:18.478 --> 07:20:23.600
Before I bought all these things then and it was me and my friend who right

5000
07:20:23.600 --> 07:20:27.920
Maybe already know, I work with cars eh both on as well as the work itself

5001
07:20:27.920 --> 07:20:31.840
where I get salary for it and at leisure time where I am in the process of cars

5002
07:20:31.840 --> 07:20:36.280
and i mecca on cars and it's like it's my hobby

5003
07:20:36.280 --> 07:20:41.478
that if you say so that it is my life circulating around as well as we had

5004
07:20:41.478 --> 07:20:45.398
after all, talked for a long time me and my friend that should we not take and fix one as well

5005
07:20:45.398 --> 07:20:50.160
garage space like yes but we can be there and mecca on our cars when we bought

5006
07:20:50.160 --> 07:20:54.280
some car and we can sit there and polish and yes but keep on by cars you

5007
07:20:54.280 --> 07:20:58.040
know take it easy in the evenings grill during the summers as well as as a small

5008
07:20:58.040 --> 07:21:03.478
Hobby workshop where we can be at So no one here's no business

5009
07:21:03.478 --> 07:21:08.558
Like where we should sit and have customers and so on but to our own for our own

5010
07:21:08.558 --> 07:21:12.600
Interest then so he sounds great but we we should control it and so

5011
07:21:12.600 --> 07:21:16.160
Had we talked for a month's time he had resolved any workshop eh I had

5012
07:21:16.160 --> 07:21:19.520
not had the opportunity or time to go to this place and see it yourself

5013
07:21:19.520 --> 07:21:23.320
But I had been informed that yes but as it is clear we have got hold

5014
07:21:23.320 --> 07:21:27.080
In a workshop now we can start to equip it so that it is ready in a few months

5015
07:21:27.080 --> 07:21:31.080
So we can start moving in and keep up with our things in there

5016
07:21:31.080 --> 07:21:34.840
and the current day when I mined exactly what day it was when I bought

5017
07:21:34.840 --> 07:21:38.398
all these things I have for me that it was the fourth or fifth there

5018
07:21:38.398 --> 07:21:44.240
somewhere eh those those days I was on all cameras as well and I

5019
07:21:44.240 --> 07:21:51.398
Was at work then around 13 40 45 the time I would end at 16.30 eh so wrote

5020
07:21:51.398 --> 07:21:54.920
me to my friend eh then as I had talked to the workshop if I told you

5021
07:21:54.920 --> 07:21:58.280
he you I am free after work today i have no plans eh shall i go and

5022
07:21:58.280 --> 07:22:02.040
buy these as we talked about these gloves and and further things

5023
07:22:02.040 --> 07:22:06.600
Then for the workshop he said yes really well but you can buy a flush liquid and so

5024
07:22:06.600 --> 07:22:09.520
Furthermore, you can also buy this and this then s me but you send a

5025
07:22:09.520 --> 07:22:12.638
shopping list just so it becomes easier so there will be no mistakes like so send

5026
07:22:12.638 --> 07:22:16.478
A shopping list on what you think we need so I supplement with

5027
07:22:16.478 --> 07:22:19.920
something in case I feel we need it as well as I expire

5028
07:22:19.920 --> 07:22:24.760
from buying the things you ask me to buy when he said perfectly so he send it

5029
07:22:24.760 --> 07:22:30.000
here the shopping list and we talk a little about those things just eh then after work I

5030
07:22:30.000 --> 07:22:35.360
I end up going it would be there at Södra somewhere south Stockholm at

5031
07:22:35.360 --> 07:22:39.920
Haninge held eh so I go and yes but I go to the car theme you see you have after all

5032
07:22:39.920 --> 07:22:44.080
Everything like prosecutors has produced everything at the case there so I

5033
07:22:44.080 --> 07:22:49.318
go around I buy all these things and then I get an address he

5034
07:22:49.318 --> 07:22:53.040
Says yes but goes this address then like then I guess the garage

5035
07:22:53.040 --> 07:22:57.440
Lying there nearby somewhere eh I go where the plan was that I would

5036
07:22:57.440 --> 07:23:02.478
Go there and like check out the garage and yes but be left there for a while and

5037
07:23:02.478 --> 07:23:07.120
see like yes but this is our new place we should be on eh but some things

5038
07:23:07.120 --> 07:23:10.680
had taken a little longer and shopping some things had taken a little more

5039
07:23:10.680 --> 07:23:16.558
Time than counted and I would meet my girl right afterwards so that I go

5040
07:23:16.558 --> 07:23:19.878
to this address then there is a girl eh she came and met me she stood

5041
07:23:19.878 --> 07:23:23.958
at the turning zone and met me where she had such buildings or not building clothes

5042
07:23:23.958 --> 07:23:27.878
But such workshop clothes on with pockets and on the pants and so on eh

5043
07:23:27.878 --> 07:23:30.718
So she was standing where she had been informed that I will come my gray

5044
07:23:30.718 --> 07:23:34.958
Bmw so i get where i greet hi hi as well as is you who will have the things to

5045
07:23:34.958 --> 07:23:38.920
the workshop she says yes but just eh said yes but what fun like that is where it lies

5046
07:23:38.920 --> 07:23:41.958
Here the workshop and then she points a little towards the apartment complex where she

5047
07:23:41.958 --> 07:23:44.840
says yes but it is over there somewhere so yeah it is not like

5048
07:23:44.840 --> 07:23:51.638
exactly where she said no it is type two three thus reach some bit of walk so okay but

5049
07:23:51.638 --> 07:23:56.040
But you I probably won't be able to accompany you and like to see the things so that

5050
07:23:56.040 --> 07:23:59.920
You may take things now so you will surely meet me there within the days

5051
07:23:59.920 --> 07:24:02.318
Like I will surely come to the workshop I will be a blame I will be there

5052
07:24:02.318 --> 07:24:06.958
a while too eh but i won't be able to today so i gave her things and so

5053
07:24:06.958 --> 07:24:11.878
did I go and meet my girl at McDonald's afterwards and so I want to

5054
07:24:11.878 --> 07:24:17.638
also add that because I looked at the prosecutor's case present that that eh

5055
07:24:17.638 --> 07:24:21.200
There was information that I would have been near that location of one

5056
07:24:21.200 --> 07:24:25.718
unclear reason it stood the day after eh but i just want to add that there was

5057
07:24:25.718 --> 07:24:30.160
a PM from the police there and that had the police written that I had been at

5058
07:24:30.160 --> 07:24:35.760
my girl's address the day after and i'm about four to five times per week

5059
07:24:35.760 --> 07:24:39.240
So that was a pretty clear reason why I was near that place

5060
07:24:39.240 --> 07:24:42.798
And I wouldn't say it was nearby it's a pretty good bit

5061
07:24:42.798 --> 07:24:47.160
From where I was like but yes what I just want to say that I was there

5062
07:24:47.160 --> 07:24:51.920
The day after has nothing with this then so -called print the apartment or

5063
07:24:51.920 --> 07:24:56.958
something like that I have not known that there has even been any apartment like someone

5064
07:24:56.958 --> 07:25:00.280
of my friends have had access to or something like that I knew it was

5065
07:25:00.280 --> 07:25:04.760
This would have been your garage and that's what I have known about the whole

5066
07:25:04.760 --> 07:25:10.280
Here's so thanks mm great gets the flag

5067
07:25:10.280 --> 07:25:15.798
Ask questions etc. I just thought for formal sake this phone as

5068
07:25:15.798 --> 07:25:20.718
You have seized from you It is your phone exactly and it is you who

5069
07:25:20.718 --> 07:25:24.798
used it between the FDE and October 6 exactly

5070
07:25:24.798 --> 07:25:29.638
eh signal found you installed on this phone yes you can say

5071
07:25:29.638 --> 07:25:33.360
something about that application why have you had it it is one one in

5072
07:25:33.360 --> 07:25:36.600
the amount of communication apps that I use to chat with friends and

5073
07:25:36.600 --> 07:25:40.600
similar yes you know it is encrypted it is nothing I have laid

5074
07:25:40.600 --> 07:25:45.080
any extra thought of i i have over 30 communication apps i have whatsapp

5075
07:25:45.080 --> 07:25:49.440
Snapchat Instagram Signal as well as everything possible so it is one in the crowd only

5076
07:25:49.440 --> 07:25:52.360
Okay so there has been no such reason behind that you have just that

5077
07:25:52.360 --> 07:25:58.680
Application no absolutely not no no eh is it alias l hamilton do you know

5078
07:25:58.680 --> 07:26:03.478
to it yes it is my mm why just that name sorry why just that name

5079
07:26:03.478 --> 07:26:08.040
Hamilton or Hamilton it's one that is a formula 1 driver yes and I am

5080
07:26:08.040 --> 07:26:11.440
Giant enthusiast as said by cars and driving a car and so on so it yes but

5081
07:26:11.440 --> 07:26:14.840
some kind of idol you can say okay but why have you not used your own name

5082
07:26:14.840 --> 07:26:17.798
I thought no it's pretty funny as when playing video games that's pretty

5083
07:26:17.798 --> 07:26:22.240
Sad to choose your own name as you are a little inventive so m okay

5084
07:26:22.240 --> 07:26:25.638
I still thought you had such a means of communication you explain as was

5085
07:26:25.638 --> 07:26:29.478
Therefore I wondered why you choose a different name than your own name then for

5086
07:26:29.478 --> 07:26:34.040
That usually comes you with friends yes and they know who you are

5087
07:26:34.040 --> 07:26:39.680
Like okay so it's a funny thing just there's no extra important it

5088
07:26:39.680 --> 07:26:47.840
Eh you found some then signal chats m in this phone eh

5089
07:26:47.840 --> 07:26:52.160
And you can't see anything what you have written, but I mean that this

5090
07:26:52.160 --> 07:26:56.680
is incoming message to you is true yes is this message

5091
07:26:56.680 --> 07:27:01.718
as you have received yes yes eh eh and there are then among other things

5092
07:27:01.718 --> 07:27:07.398
an alias kill all mm can you tell us about it it is an acquaintance to me yes it is

5093
07:27:07.398 --> 07:27:11.200
An acquaintance to you yes who is it that I do not want to go into now in that

5094
07:27:11.200 --> 07:27:16.240
We are sitting here today and there are such serious suspicions so I do not want to yes but

5095
07:27:16.240 --> 07:27:19.958
risk my own security and or my own

5096
07:27:19.958 --> 07:27:23.478
family bed about myself and I will not mention any other names or answer

5097
07:27:23.478 --> 07:27:30.360
on something if any other person nahä ok but is this the same person as you

5098
07:27:30.360 --> 07:27:34.280
describes as is this friend that you have talked about this garage and or

5099
07:27:34.280 --> 07:27:38.558
This workshop yes but just okay so it was you two who communicated around

5100
07:27:38.558 --> 07:27:44.040
that yes so this shopping list then as you describe that this friend sends

5101
07:27:44.040 --> 07:27:49.360
it is the shopping list that we have seen then that you had everyone then sends to your

5102
07:27:49.360 --> 07:27:58.718
signal just mm okay eh and you then describe that you should

5103
07:27:58.718 --> 07:28:04.080
make these different purchases for it to go to this workshop etc. what what

5104
07:28:04.080 --> 07:28:09.280
Do you think about these different things it is both as well as gasoline

5105
07:28:09.280 --> 07:28:13.520
flushes the liquid and gasoltub so what should it be used for yes but the fine I

5106
07:28:13.520 --> 07:28:16.958
thinks there are pretty good explanations eh gasoltub a partly we had talked

5107
07:28:16.958 --> 07:28:20.160
Fl days before when we talked about the actual construction of the workshop we had

5108
07:28:20.160 --> 07:28:23.520
Talked about but damn what a nice it had been and like fixing a grill there

5109
07:28:23.520 --> 07:28:27.440
And just like yes but soft in summers on summer evenings as well as take it easy and

5110
07:28:27.440 --> 07:28:30.958
so that all the things I bought gloves we use when we work on

5111
07:28:30.958 --> 07:28:34.478
cars eh mask it has that when you are to solder or weld something

5112
07:28:34.478 --> 07:28:39.478
There are normal things that are found in any workshop to spora fluid uses

5113
07:28:39.478 --> 07:28:45.080
we wipe off greasy surfaces etc. there are like no weirdness with it no

5114
07:28:45.080 --> 07:28:48.080
Okay

5115
07:28:48.440 --> 07:28:54.280
eh you have received a lot of questions during the preliminary investigation of police etc. what

5116
07:28:54.280 --> 07:28:57.878
Have you answered when I have said no comments on all mine for mm how

5117
07:28:57.878 --> 07:29:02.798
Will it see no I simply don't want to sit to speculate or talk about

5118
07:29:02.798 --> 07:29:06.200
some other people when I don't know what has happened I know what I have I

5119
07:29:06.200 --> 07:29:10.120
know what I have done and I know what I have said and I do not deny either

5120
07:29:10.120 --> 07:29:13.680
Something the police have, like shown this, but I have chosen to see

5121
07:29:13.680 --> 07:29:17.638
no comments and bring this up on a trial where it actually makes someone

5122
07:29:17.638 --> 07:29:21.318
Difference yes but why could you not have said this then as you tell

5123
07:29:21.318 --> 07:29:26.280
Now that said I would not have wanted to talk at the interrogation eh it's no secret eh

5124
07:29:26.280 --> 07:29:30.878
What time we are living in right now and eh you have heard still not told about

5125
07:29:30.878 --> 07:29:35.280
someone else in any way he might be able to answer clearly to the question thank you eh as

5126
07:29:35.280 --> 07:29:39.680
said I don't want to sit and speculate or talk in interrogation you have heard what

5127
07:29:39.680 --> 07:29:44.040
that has happened to other people it can be misinterpreted as I say that one one

5128
07:29:44.040 --> 07:29:48.440
person has written to me and so on and yes but that it comes out that

5129
07:29:48.440 --> 07:29:51.280
that it gets wrong in some way so I have chosen to keep it on

5130
07:29:51.280 --> 07:29:55.080
secure the page only and see no comments but I am giantly gotten to

5131
07:29:55.080 --> 07:30:00.000
All your questions here etc. Okay It's not that you customize your details

5132
07:30:00.000 --> 07:30:04.558
based on the preliminary investigation that has emerged it is a hypothesis that you have

5133
07:30:04.558 --> 07:30:09.240
But that is a question no but that it is not that is not true no that is true

5134
07:30:09.240 --> 07:30:15.958
not no no okay eh this car then this bmw car yes

5135
07:30:15.958 --> 07:30:20.280
eh is that your car it is my car yes yes okay is someone else who usually

5136
07:30:20.280 --> 07:30:27.360
Using it No No Okay eh you talked anything about you

5137
07:30:27.360 --> 07:30:32.200
confirmed as you would come with any gray BMV MM when you told you

5138
07:30:32.200 --> 07:30:37.080
where to whom are it you confirmed it do you mean how do you mean now sorry yes but

5139
07:30:37.080 --> 07:30:40.760
When you said that you would go to this place that you thought was then it

5140
07:30:40.760 --> 07:30:44.120
Here's the place of this workshop when you made your purchases so you said you

5141
07:30:44.120 --> 07:30:49.680
Confirm that I am coming with a gray BMW no I said the girl knew I

5142
07:30:49.680 --> 07:30:53.120
would come in a gray bmw my friend knows what car I have so he has

5143
07:30:53.120 --> 07:30:58.240
probably said that one that yes but there will be someone in a gray bmw okay

5144
07:30:58.240 --> 07:31:04.160
Mm you i t then thought about your attitude i have relied on

5145
07:31:04.160 --> 07:31:09.558
Some of these chats yes eh from signal it also has in a hearing like

5146
07:31:09.558 --> 07:31:15.600
been held with you shown when an image appendix on what to say some

5147
07:31:15.600 --> 07:31:20.200
more chats that extend then still over the fourth then but that

5148
07:31:20.200 --> 07:31:25.680
is a little longer text back I thought if we would look at them absolute eh for

5149
07:31:25.680 --> 07:31:31.718
After all, you write in these, then certain things then, then, then, then, that you

5150
07:31:31.718 --> 07:31:34.920
Should fire in

5151
07:31:34.920 --> 07:31:41.478
The mailbox just those cats I saw they have they have a tism here

5152
07:31:41.478 --> 07:31:44.840
If they are in Chat, we may be able to look if there are several you should go through or

5153
07:31:44.840 --> 07:31:48.760
Should you show off them I was going to show up because it's a little longer side than

5154
07:31:48.760 --> 07:31:53.840
what has been invoked since before so I thought I can connect and

5155
07:31:58.840 --> 07:32:01.840
show

5156
07:32:07.398 --> 07:32:16.760
76 and is then on page 576 so 576 to 580 is also invoked then

5157
07:32:16.760 --> 07:32:21.318
And it is partly then the same signal chats that I have looked at before

5158
07:32:21.318 --> 07:32:25.520
But there are some

5159
07:32:28.840 --> 07:32:31.840
More

5160
07:33:00.160 --> 07:33:05.240
Here, for example, is then the fourth at the top, there is some Dark Wader who

5161
07:33:05.240 --> 07:33:12.160
then writes to your signal what is Dark Wader Eh as far as I know so have it

5162
07:33:12.160 --> 07:33:15.240
Here these chatting nothing with my criminal suspicion that I sit here for

5163
07:33:15.240 --> 07:33:19.200
today yes do so i don't choose comment

5164
07:33:19.200 --> 07:33:24.718
them okay you mean this has nothing with this today to do so

5165
07:33:24.718 --> 07:33:31.120
That is your view yes okay but what do you touch then

5166
07:33:31.120 --> 07:33:35.878
otherwise yes otherwise other criminal or no other that does not have this

5167
07:33:35.878 --> 07:33:39.840
The suspicion of doing okay

5168
07:33:41.600 --> 07:33:46.080
Eh you sometimes talk that Dark V writes sometimes that it is fat with Aina

5169
07:33:46.080 --> 07:33:50.798
in JB in the evening where the fourth

5170
07:33:50.798 --> 07:33:54.398
Yes but that has nothing with anything criminal to do

5171
07:33:54.398 --> 07:33:58.080
at all do you mean no it is a statement from his

5172
07:33:58.080 --> 07:34:03.840
side ok but i thought like this v what did you think about what he wrote then he

5173
07:34:03.840 --> 07:34:08.280
have well informed me that there are police officers in Jordbro but like okay I

5174
07:34:08.280 --> 07:34:12.878
cannot find that there is something no no I do not know what to say about it

5175
07:34:12.878 --> 07:34:17.638
It does not concern any criminal or any suspicion so as well as okay if we check

5176
07:34:17.638 --> 07:34:21.398
here then it is this one then kill everyone then this friend that you describe as

5177
07:34:21.398 --> 07:34:25.798
then writes at 13 o'clock where the fifth can buy gasoline food and one

5178
07:34:25.798 --> 07:34:33.600
Map Tradd Brother etc. What is Trad it is Tramadol Yes okay what would it too

5179
07:34:33.600 --> 07:34:37.478
to this workshop or no as I said eh I have admitted a

5180
07:34:37.478 --> 07:34:41.360
drug offenses in another case so I think I don't have to go in so

5181
07:34:41.360 --> 07:34:46.200
a lot in it but although I think this has the current as well as dates when we

5182
07:34:46.200 --> 07:34:50.000
Talking here etc. and there has been information anyway that it should have been found

5183
07:34:50.000 --> 07:34:55.240
Tramadol then perhaps then as the performer would use mm no it is

5184
07:34:55.240 --> 07:34:59.000
Nothing such a tramadol it was found home with me so it was tramadol then

5185
07:34:59.000 --> 07:35:02.920
petrol it it was the same day so it may have been a part of this one

5186
07:35:02.920 --> 07:35:08.398
the shopping list then okay yes but thread what is it an abbreviation for tramadol it is

5187
07:35:08.398 --> 07:35:14.080
Tramadol etc. Then it is written a minute later or shit in the thread bar food soda

5188
07:35:14.080 --> 07:35:21.240
and gasoline and a fifth sutt etc. what is Sut Sutt is hash etc.

5189
07:35:21.240 --> 07:35:27.920
Okay so what does this concern then I can yes so I I have nothing

5190
07:35:27.920 --> 07:35:33.760
memory of what it means eh he talks well about buying any m hash

5191
07:35:33.760 --> 07:35:38.318
or tramadol similar okay so it is like no i can't i can't

5192
07:35:38.318 --> 07:35:42.958
remember but there are a lot of people who just sit at home and like to smoke on

5193
07:35:42.958 --> 07:35:46.120
and take tablets like so I don't know what it is about actually no

5194
07:35:46.120 --> 07:35:51.478
Okay then you answer something we don't really know what but the response will be haha

5195
07:35:51.478 --> 07:35:58.558
But brother guy takes you Talle Hah Talle what is it then mm

5196
07:35:58.558 --> 07:36:03.280
Okay have you answered then back something about tramadol because he responds to

5197
07:36:03.280 --> 07:36:06.760
that way or what and what guy do you talk about no i probably don't

5198
07:36:06.760 --> 07:36:09.798
answered you can see that he has not said anything after I have written it

5199
07:36:09.798 --> 07:36:13.638
So that I have interpreted it as a joke in that he writes Haa but think

5200
07:36:13.638 --> 07:36:18.080
The guy thus what they write a lot as I said I was at work there too

5201
07:36:18.080 --> 07:36:23.040
the time period I ended in 1630 that day and when I'm at work I have

5202
07:36:23.040 --> 07:36:27.280
So on t minutes I have two to three customers and I focus much more on

5203
07:36:27.280 --> 07:36:30.398
The job than I focus on the phone so I have on the phone letter m n i

5204
07:36:30.398 --> 07:36:33.718
working letters in the office customers arrive at me i can ever go in

5205
07:36:33.718 --> 07:36:37.958
and yes but send some funny picture or laugh and haha like talk a little

5206
07:36:37.958 --> 07:36:41.958
generally only but I can't link it to any specific thus specifically

5207
07:36:41.958 --> 07:36:45.718
occasion or something that he specifically means at the time you have been

5208
07:36:45.718 --> 07:36:48.520
something internal joke possibly or something and that is what I want to come

5209
07:36:48.520 --> 07:36:51.360
up to there when you go down and scroll when it says this about

5210
07:36:51.360 --> 07:36:56.080
the apartment and so on eh no I get where I think I take it

5211
07:36:56.080 --> 07:37:00.958
I ask the questions so yes eh so that you mean that it is not always

5212
07:37:00.958 --> 07:37:04.240
so that you have answered in this thread it is so I should understand it in some cases

5213
07:37:04.240 --> 07:37:08.000
maybe you have answered but in many cases so you have not answered at all because you

5214
07:37:08.000 --> 07:37:11.840
working while m etc. then I also think it will be pulled out

5215
07:37:11.840 --> 07:37:16.718
quite rough context when you only see one side of a conversation so that

5216
07:37:16.718 --> 07:37:21.160
Man man I buy what it looks like I absolutely understand what it looks like eh

5217
07:37:21.160 --> 07:37:25.958
that if you read only one page then I understand I understand what it looks like

5218
07:37:25.958 --> 07:37:30.318
Had you been able to see my answers, you could have understood much more thoroughly V what

5219
07:37:30.318 --> 07:37:33.200
What why you have the opportunity to explain your weak yes but exactly I want to carry

5220
07:37:33.200 --> 07:37:36.120
just want to present it so that you know about it but after it in the chat so

5221
07:37:36.120 --> 07:37:42.160
Have I not answered no no okay eh since at 1324 there so the friend writes dead

5222
07:37:42.160 --> 07:37:46.478
Everyone knows something that burns a lot mm and the chats are coherent with

5223
07:37:46.478 --> 07:37:51.478
Several other chats just below D and it's about answering that question

5224
07:37:51.478 --> 07:37:55.760
yes I will come to it eh as I said the chats that are there and I

5225
07:37:55.760 --> 07:37:59.680
think three or four chats downwards too then he writes that this ahaha I

5226
07:37:59.680 --> 07:38:02.958
Should I have come in so I had shot I will burn through the mailbox

5227
07:38:02.958 --> 07:38:07.638
And lots of stuff it was also we had talked about three four days before

5228
07:38:07.638 --> 07:38:11.520
what he was abroad we at that time mm and he had complained about

5229
07:38:11.520 --> 07:38:14.798
his neighbors who were the ones he had rented any apartment at something

5230
07:38:14.798 --> 07:38:19.080
apartment complex or similar as well and he had complained day in and day out

5231
07:38:19.080 --> 07:38:22.440
to me that this damn i i would come down here on vacation and so

5232
07:38:22.440 --> 07:38:26.040
And so I have neighbors partying all day and all evening and the ones they do

5233
07:38:26.040 --> 07:38:29.120
Lots of noise and I can't cope I get I get so damn angry and so on so

5234
07:38:29.120 --> 07:38:32.478
So should we laugh like what I said damn what a hard holiday you got

5235
07:38:32.478 --> 07:38:36.440
Like and so he writes where you also see down that he writes that this is how

5236
07:38:36.440 --> 07:38:40.520
eh that but I would have shot if I come in haha I will burn through

5237
07:38:40.520 --> 07:38:44.760
the mailbox and so this was an internal joke that he has some sort of

5238
07:38:44.760 --> 07:38:48.360
rough ad hd so that when he becomes excited or wants to joke something like that

5239
07:38:48.360 --> 07:38:51.558
does he go in just like him drive all in now now want to make a great fun

5240
07:38:51.558 --> 07:38:55.600
jokes like so he is about that when he asks you know something that burns

5241
07:38:55.600 --> 07:38:58.600
A lot of it is not a serious question, so any person knows after all

5242
07:38:58.600 --> 07:39:01.878
that gasoline burns is good it is not that I have given him an answer like him

5243
07:39:01.878 --> 07:39:05.558
have not known when you say you know something that is burning a lot it is like

5244
07:39:05.558 --> 07:39:09.280
an ironic question a rhetorical question to yes but fuck use gasoline if you are to

5245
07:39:09.280 --> 07:39:13.000
burn on this apartment there where he was abroad as well as if you want

5246
07:39:13.000 --> 07:39:16.318
disturb the neighbors like that so it was a joke it is not that he does not know

5247
07:39:16.318 --> 07:39:20.360
what is burning a lot mm but he is no longer abroad you said it was

5248
07:39:20.360 --> 07:39:23.920
When he was abroad he was abroad he was abroad current time I have

5249
07:39:23.920 --> 07:39:26.920
been detained for six months so I don't know where he's okay

5250
07:39:26.920 --> 07:39:33.000
Eh but then my question then you answer that message yes yes and what do you answer

5251
07:39:33.000 --> 07:39:39.360
Then gasoline is okay because then the next will burn well yes etc. but you mean to

5252
07:39:39.360 --> 07:39:42.280
it still this fun context then that he is abroad and disturbs

5253
07:39:42.280 --> 07:39:46.638
these neighbors who, like that yes, the rough joke between thus

5254
07:39:46.638 --> 07:39:49.878
Thus which person who then if if someone asks you know something that burns

5255
07:39:49.878 --> 07:39:54.240
A lot you see gasoline and then you say it burns well as it can

5256
07:39:54.240 --> 07:39:58.920
after all not being anything but jokes who doesn't know that gasoline burns well as well as mm it

5257
07:39:58.920 --> 07:40:04.000
is so i okay and then comes next then lighter fluid with bees do you think it

5258
07:40:04.000 --> 07:40:08.000
Works etc. and you are part that he wants he wants to draw the joke anymore he

5259
07:40:08.000 --> 07:40:11.718
He likes as well as exaggeration you see the tatters below also as coming

5260
07:40:11.718 --> 07:40:15.040
like you will surely come to them but the tatters that are there under it

5261
07:40:15.040 --> 07:40:19.240
is just an extension of the joke so that he likes to take in when he

5262
07:40:19.240 --> 07:40:23.798
he jokes he is he he gets excitedly simply as we can talk about a good

5263
07:40:23.798 --> 07:40:27.478
dish he starts like and yes but he should pull out what he will pull it out so

5264
07:40:27.478 --> 07:40:31.240
long and that's how he is it is his personality as well and then comes then

5265
07:40:31.240 --> 07:40:35.920
Next with that apartment you've written something in between I think

5266
07:40:35.920 --> 07:40:39.958
Yes i have weak memories that i wrote that like this but v where was it you lived

5267
07:40:39.958 --> 07:40:43.360
Like it is townhouses or villa in apartment, he replied and apartment so

5268
07:40:43.360 --> 07:40:45.878
Then I realized that yes but they are wall to wall with these hard neighbors

5269
07:40:45.878 --> 07:40:50.718
Like mm and then we get a little closer to what you have mentioned yourself

5270
07:40:50.718 --> 07:40:54.558
then there at 1336, then die all no if it was so I could go into

5271
07:40:54.558 --> 07:41:01.040
the apartment I had shot hah etc. exactly and then I took

5272
07:41:01.040 --> 07:41:05.080
already understood that this was about our internal joke as well but there you can

5273
07:41:05.080 --> 07:41:09.600
also see then that he writes hahaha as well as yes but I had shot about

5274
07:41:09.600 --> 07:41:13.240
I could have come in but damn they certainly have so like me to fuck

5275
07:41:13.240 --> 07:41:17.798
Burn so and then also that he writes to fire through the mailbox and so

5276
07:41:17.798 --> 07:41:21.360
As I have understood it then on the very suspected crime address then

5277
07:41:21.360 --> 07:41:24.680
There were no mailboxes so it will be quite difficult to burn through a

5278
07:41:24.680 --> 07:41:29.600
mailbox that does not exist mm but did you know about it then sorry you knew about it

5279
07:41:29.600 --> 07:41:34.080
Then I can't answer yes, so I still can't know about

5280
07:41:34.080 --> 07:41:38.920
These things I bought if they were primarily meant for use

5281
07:41:38.920 --> 07:41:43.520
To this horrible deed as well as I can't know it I can't answer

5282
07:41:43.520 --> 07:41:47.638
on I can't answer if this alias then afterwards after I

5283
07:41:47.638 --> 07:41:52.120
left these things and they have come to the garage that something has happened

5284
07:41:52.120 --> 07:41:54.680
and he feels yes but I need those things to something else that

5285
07:41:54.680 --> 07:41:57.920
I have no power to control over I have no part in it but it I

5286
07:41:57.920 --> 07:42:02.638
know that I have bought the items for workshop etc. Have you written something oops

5287
07:42:02.638 --> 07:42:06.680
now i don't know why it disappeared eh anything there before

5288
07:42:06.680 --> 07:42:11.680
then about shooting because that's how he likes to write there that no if it was

5289
07:42:11.680 --> 07:42:16.200
So that I could go into the apartment so I had shot no no I think that

5290
07:42:16.200 --> 07:42:19.200
Because where he asked all like this you know something that is burning well and so on and

5291
07:42:19.200 --> 07:42:22.958
so on so it may have been so I have said kind of this no but what the hell go

5292
07:42:22.958 --> 07:42:27.840
into the apartment and like eh pour gasoline everywhere or it may have been

5293
07:42:27.840 --> 07:42:30.718
some draw to the joke and he said yes but I will not get into positions

5294
07:42:30.718 --> 07:42:37.120
So like so okay and then then this will fire through the mailbox

5295
07:42:37.120 --> 07:42:44.798
Mm What do you answer to it then or do you answer I don't remember v it all that

5296
07:42:44.798 --> 07:42:48.760
this in a joke context so i don't remember exactly what i have joked in with

5297
07:42:48.760 --> 07:42:53.440
Like what words I have chosen but there has probably been something in the style of

5298
07:42:53.440 --> 07:42:58.718
Yeah haa like okay g do your thing as well as mm and i understand he jokes

5299
07:42:58.718 --> 07:43:02.520
he would not be at a fire to burn an apartment abroad it is, after all

5300
07:43:02.520 --> 07:43:05.600
So as I interpreted anyway this is a raw joke only

5301
07:43:05.600 --> 07:43:11.878
Like how do you usually say dark humor etc. since we 13338 where yes because I want

5302
07:43:11.878 --> 07:43:17.000
something that continues to burn etc. It's just continuing on you to

5303
07:43:17.000 --> 07:43:20.000
This rough joke that all it is the same time you see it is, after all

5304
07:43:20.000 --> 07:43:23.638
just a 30 -second difference or whatever it is like that, so it so it

5305
07:43:23.638 --> 07:43:29.798
It is the context as well as then comes a mining where between 13338 and 1345 on

5306
07:43:29.798 --> 07:43:33.638
What is seven minutes seven eight minutes and when he writes it yes why I

5307
07:43:33.638 --> 07:43:37.478
were h who continues to burn eh either I have not answered or so I have

5308
07:43:37.478 --> 07:43:40.520
just written hahaha okay reach similar like but then have that conversation

5309
07:43:40.520 --> 07:43:44.398
died out and as I said I was at work during the time I customers occasionally they

5310
07:43:44.398 --> 07:43:49.398
Coming in every now and then so I have been able to have a two customers as well as and

5311
07:43:49.398 --> 07:43:53.360
Then when he writes A you can fix such brother that is the answer to one of my

5312
07:43:53.360 --> 07:43:57.318
Questions and then I write to him around 1345 when I write to him just

5313
07:43:57.318 --> 07:44:00.398
it heard i am free today after work and then i start talking about it

5314
07:44:00.398 --> 07:44:03.120
here the workshop so should I go shopping these things we were talking about

5315
07:44:03.120 --> 07:44:06.318
To the workshop I thought I might go and buy gloves and like

5316
07:44:06.318 --> 07:44:10.080
Yes but worms and stuff in when we are going to solder and the like and then he writes yes

5317
07:44:10.080 --> 07:44:14.200
can you fix such brother buy flush bag and gasolo tube too and i know after all

5318
07:44:14.200 --> 07:44:18.240
We had talked about this grill a few days before too so that yes it is

5319
07:44:18.240 --> 07:44:22.440
Absolutely I fixed like MM had you why did you buy no grill sorry

5320
07:44:22.440 --> 07:44:25.600
Why didn't you buy any grill but the grill was rode that one like I had understood

5321
07:44:25.600 --> 07:44:30.040
That but he was abroad how had it come there when he has been blushed around

5322
07:44:30.040 --> 07:44:33.040
It seems like he had the girl who received the goods so that it

5323
07:44:33.040 --> 07:44:37.558
Isn't that he he doesn't have people he knows here in Sweden eh since at

5324
07:44:37.558 --> 07:44:43.558
141 where bridge takes out from ATM etc. What what are you going to take out from ATM

5325
07:44:43.558 --> 07:44:48.360
No idea I have not taken any money from reaching ATM so that he

5326
07:44:48.360 --> 07:44:54.600
maybe had some chat while and because it is completely out of context it stands

5327
07:44:54.600 --> 07:44:58.280
only 141 there are no medlands the one who in the vicinity before or after that has any

5328
07:44:58.280 --> 07:45:02.360
connection to it that possible he has written it yes but in the wrong chat

5329
07:45:02.360 --> 07:45:05.958
possibly or or the like and, as I said, still should be deleted that

5330
07:45:05.958 --> 07:45:10.600
I was at work and I'm not like the screen and checking out I get notes

5331
07:45:10.600 --> 07:45:14.200
Constant and so plus I have signal so I have signal snapchat Instagram

5332
07:45:14.200 --> 07:45:18.318
All these notes are suspended with me I don't have notes on I have only

5333
07:45:18.318 --> 07:45:23.080
Notes on on, for example, ordinary SMS or May or yes but things that concern

5334
07:45:23.080 --> 07:45:26.638
the job then then social media I go in when I have time I go in and read

5335
07:45:26.638 --> 07:45:30.840
means when I have time it may have been that I haven't read the message okay

5336
07:45:30.840 --> 07:45:34.558
these purchases when I understand it as you go on, after all, that you have done all

5337
07:45:34.558 --> 07:45:40.520
these purchases that I say that is to say both then at Biltema Eh that it

5338
07:45:40.520 --> 07:45:46.120
is the IA MAX purchase then of these pizzas among other things that it is also this one

5339
07:45:46.120 --> 07:45:55.000
Refueling on Ingo EH and then eh of this gas tube etc. Many of those purchases

5340
07:45:55.000 --> 07:46:00.600
Implementing in cash yes how will it no I usually have contact cash

5341
07:46:00.600 --> 07:46:05.000
It is like there are no major sums as I said I am doing cars

5342
07:46:05.000 --> 07:46:09.040
I do a lot of car deals sometimes pay the buyers in Swish sometimes they pay

5343
07:46:09.040 --> 07:46:13.600
cash and i usually have cash on me okay so this message then that

5344
07:46:13.600 --> 07:46:17.000
You should then encourage the stout from ATMs it has nothing to do with these

5345
07:46:17.000 --> 07:46:21.200
upcoming purchases then that will be in cash no but I have not pulled out anything from

5346
07:46:21.200 --> 07:46:24.000
ATM I have not done what you see on my card purchases that I do not have

5347
07:46:24.000 --> 07:46:30.000
pulled out something so i have i have i already have cash on me mm eh

5348
07:46:30.000 --> 07:46:35.878
then at 1523 where I give your address then take you back what you laid out for plus

5349
07:46:35.878 --> 07:46:44.280

5350
07:46:44.280 --> 07:46:50.280

5351
07:46:50.280 --> 07:46:56.638
life circulates around to do yes so a completely normal day I can write

5352
07:46:56.638 --> 07:46:59.680
To my friend you I can't go here you can go and buy exhaust pipes for me

5353
07:46:59.680 --> 07:47:01.840
or can you go and buy this battery for me or would you be able to

5354
07:47:01.840 --> 07:47:05.398
go and solve these things to me or so can he ask me you I need to go

5355
07:47:05.398 --> 07:47:08.160
and buy this these these rims you could go and pick

5356
07:47:08.160 --> 07:47:11.478
up them to me and just leave them here like and yes but when we do such

5357
07:47:11.478 --> 07:47:14.878
Business it might be that yes but I post these 5000 to you so k

5358
07:47:14.878 --> 07:47:17.958
back as late and so on it is no massive sums it is not so

5359
07:47:17.958 --> 07:47:22.798
that I have lent out SEK 100,000 it is like that so 5k it is 5000 it

5360
07:47:22.798 --> 07:47:26.558
is 5000 exactly and that it is so we usually hold on about d that in the days

5361
07:47:26.558 --> 07:47:29.878
Like when I have free when I have the time we are doing business here right

5362
07:47:29.878 --> 07:47:34.040
left like mm okay then some addresses come and then it stands 17 k it

5363
07:47:34.040 --> 07:47:37.798

5364
07:47:37.798 --> 07:47:40.920
The address I picked up that money no ok but it's still small money

5365
07:47:40.920 --> 07:47:45.958
according to you 17,000 is a little more than small money it it is half a monthly salary

5366
07:47:45.958 --> 07:47:49.000
Like but I I have no memory of having been there or picked up

5367
07:47:49.000 --> 07:47:52.798
some money no or that you put out somehow 17,000 for someone else or

5368
07:47:52.798 --> 07:47:55.680
that someone else made no 17,000 i have not laid out 5000 i have posted fr

5369
07:47:55.680 --> 07:48:00.000
the chat that we go up there as well but for the one this 17 came brother it is also

5370
07:48:00.000 --> 07:48:06.000
written completely without messages before or after in the near future so that eh and late

5371
07:48:06.000 --> 07:48:10.398
it seems that this one dead all the alig seen then from what I have understood in

5372
07:48:10.398 --> 07:48:12.798
all cases from the preliminary investigation and the like and chatting that exists and so

5373
07:48:12.798 --> 07:48:18.520
Furthermore, he has several active chats at the same time eh since yes, ie den by that

5374
07:48:18.520 --> 07:48:21.160
he goes into the wrong chat and writes is quite large but i can't answer

5375
07:48:21.160 --> 07:48:24.718
What I haven't been where I haven't picked up SEK 17,000 No Okay I think after all

5376
07:48:24.718 --> 07:48:28.280
for itself the message before it is only half an hour before but then writes

5377
07:48:28.280 --> 07:48:31.840
I, after all, that person to give you an address and that you will then get back

5378
07:48:31.840 --> 07:48:36.798
that you have laid out and plus then for any rush that I mean stands for as well as a

5379
07:48:36.798 --> 07:48:42.080
assignment EH and then plus 5000 that you should have posted no as I interpreted so where

5380
07:48:42.080 --> 07:48:46.200
that address that address Skytten's street where I left the items to the garage

5381
07:48:46.200 --> 07:48:51.360
Yeah okay so that was where you mean then that is the one who comes this one has like

5382
07:48:51.360 --> 07:48:54.240
nothing to do with it as it can another send to the wrong chat should I

5383
07:48:54.240 --> 07:48:58.240
understand it so yes because if if I had sv so I cannot say that it

5384
07:48:58.240 --> 07:49:02.000
are there any answers from him on my answer or then if you understand what I

5385
07:49:02.000 --> 07:49:04.760
mean it it it is completely out of context there is not what I have written and

5386
07:49:04.760 --> 07:49:08.398
that is what is so so boring also that one cannot see my answers as said

5387
07:49:08.398 --> 07:49:11.398
It gets drawn so rough context it may have been so that I don't remember this

5388
07:49:11.398 --> 07:49:13.958
But it may have been so that I have written to him when he wrote it

5389
07:49:13.958 --> 07:49:20.398
Here was what is talking about or or similar like but yes eh we 1608 there take

5390
07:49:20.398 --> 07:49:24.000
with a half map Talle yes it is tramadol

5391
07:49:24.000 --> 07:49:30.000
Yeah do you know anything about it no he wants me to go with a slipping tramadol yes

5392
07:49:30.000 --> 07:49:33.920
Ok but you don't know where you would have it somewhere probably to

5393
07:49:33.920 --> 07:49:37.600
the garage spot but i didn't do it so that it may have been that I to that

5394
07:49:37.600 --> 07:49:42.718
I may have answered I will not be able to or similar etc. Okay eh and here will

5395
07:49:42.718 --> 07:49:46.878
the then this shopping list that we were talked a little bit about and then it is after all

5396
07:49:46.878 --> 07:49:52.398
gloves bandanas then what would it use yes it when you solder when you

5397
07:49:52.398 --> 07:49:55.080
Welds sometimes we go moped in the evenings it can be nice to have a

5398
07:49:55.080 --> 07:49:59.760
Bandana on them like so we usually have it when we keep on and mecca and

5399
07:49:59.760 --> 07:50:06.120
rides mopeds and so and similar prim eh freezer then and cola and and sigg and

5400
07:50:06.120 --> 07:50:11.840
snuff exactly and that is what I think confirms that I have not been

5401
07:50:11.840 --> 07:50:15.318
part or understood that it would have been to any crime scene not in my

5402
07:50:15.318 --> 07:50:18.520
wildest imagination I might think pizzas are used for a burn

5403
07:50:18.520 --> 07:50:22.160
or that one would use cola for a burn and then also there are none

5404
07:50:22.160 --> 07:50:26.600
Small quantities it is like six big pizzas there are three large cows it is

5405
07:50:26.600 --> 07:50:32.000
Six liters of cola etc. Who drinks six liters of cola on an evening as well as before they go out

5406
07:50:32.000 --> 07:50:34.478
If I would now know what would happen if you understand how I

5407
07:50:34.478 --> 07:50:38.280
mean this is like this is the amount of stock that you put in

5408
07:50:38.280 --> 07:50:41.638
the workshop so we have pizzas and we have coal that when we are not to

5409
07:50:41.638 --> 07:50:45.318
Using the grill for example but then we have freezer pizzas we have cola we have as well

5410
07:50:45.318 --> 07:50:49.600
we have snus we have sigg it should be just like it should be a happy place on

5411
07:50:49.600 --> 07:50:51.920
The workshop it should be like a place you can go there and you can take

5412
07:50:51.920 --> 07:50:56.040
it calmly and chew good food and be with friends mecca on cars as well as you know about

5413
07:50:56.040 --> 07:50:59.520
you replied to this message shopping list

5414
07:50:59.520 --> 07:51:03.798
I don't know I may have written off perfectly as well as yes because when I read late

5415
07:51:03.798 --> 07:51:09.040
then the next remedy then from dead everyone so brother thinks of the guy he has in food brother haha

5416
07:51:09.040 --> 07:51:12.318
Then it is like you question this exactly with the pizzas around that it

5417
07:51:12.318 --> 07:51:15.958
should be purchased exactly and I think it may have been so that I have answered

5418
07:51:15.958 --> 07:51:19.478
him there that like this that we have talked about someone who has been to the workshop as

5419
07:51:19.478 --> 07:51:25.080
keeping on and advising around there and like clean similar eh I know we had

5420
07:51:25.080 --> 07:51:29.600
A couple of phone calls as well around these times I remember saying what time it was

5421
07:51:29.600 --> 07:51:33.440
But we had probably received the information that there was someone there as would

5422
07:51:33.440 --> 07:51:37.520
have food or similar but hardly he would eat all six pizzas on a

5423
07:51:37.520 --> 07:51:41.318
walking okay so it's not like Sebastian sitting in this one

5424
07:51:41.318 --> 07:51:45.958
the apartment that you shop for these pizzas that you think about

5425
07:51:45.958 --> 07:51:50.878
have food no and now that you still mention my target camera I say I never have

5426
07:51:50.878 --> 07:51:54.280
had any contact with him anyway i have never seen that guy

5427
07:51:54.280 --> 07:51:58.558
Before I have no connection with him no I I don't know who I have

5428
07:51:58.558 --> 07:52:03.398
never had any information from him until I read for the survey okay

5429
07:52:03.398 --> 07:52:08.878
eh if we jump down when eh comes a job -related message there and then so

5430
07:52:08.878 --> 07:52:14.120
will there be one to message then from dead everyone around there at 1705 brother buy

5431
07:52:14.120 --> 07:52:20.280
KVIK Fixed price 145 as well mm what should it be can to the guy who holds

5432
07:52:20.280 --> 07:52:23.080
on and RDA around the garage where it is Samsung also charges as we should in

5433
07:52:23.080 --> 07:52:27.478
the garage but what is it for guy who prevail around in the garage I can't s

5434
07:52:27.478 --> 07:52:30.120
me i know i don't in that guy but it is someone who is on and

5435
07:52:30.120 --> 07:52:35.040
Clean there who need a peek fixed price as it is not, after all, some

5436
07:52:35.040 --> 07:52:38.878
year s they changed that peek solid price cannot be linked to it as well as that one does not

5437
07:52:38.878 --> 07:52:43.600
can thus that it must be linked to BankID and the like as well as so that I

5438
07:52:43.600 --> 07:52:48.360
Can't see it should like someone how to say any strange connection

5439
07:52:48.360 --> 07:52:51.840
or or the like like he needs we got broom price i'll anyway go around

5440
07:52:51.840 --> 07:52:54.920
and buy all these stuff it is not that I would then if he were to

5441
07:52:54.920 --> 07:52:58.638
write yes but can you buy a biscuit chocolate too it is not that i would

5442
07:52:58.638 --> 07:53:03.120
answer why do you need a biscuit chocolate too no it is like yes i will end

5443
07:53:03.120 --> 07:53:06.798
Go around and buy I also buy it fine what was his role there then was

5444
07:53:06.798 --> 07:53:09.718
he employed by you all and clean I don't really understand no no no it was

5445
07:53:09.718 --> 07:53:12.840
Surely his friend or similar okay it's the same as I because I

5446
07:53:12.840 --> 07:53:16.440
was detained type five days after all this so that unless I had been

5447
07:53:16.440 --> 07:53:19.958
So I had gone there too some day and maybe yes but scrubbed or

5448
07:53:19.958 --> 07:53:23.680
Cleaned tools or yes but similarly blushed around in the garage it was not

5449
07:53:23.680 --> 07:53:26.920
only me and he according to plan that would have access to this garage

5450
07:53:26.920 --> 07:53:31.638
and who is he then you mean kill everyone no but i meant

5451
07:53:31.638 --> 07:53:36.200
this one you describe then that would have this comic subscription where yes it

5452
07:53:36.200 --> 07:53:39.520
don't know who it is you have no idea who it is no as I said I have mine

5453
07:53:39.520 --> 07:53:43.520
friends he has his friends We have mutual friends if I would about

5454
07:53:43.520 --> 07:53:47.718
I would write to dead all for example yes but you my friend is going to go there

5455
07:53:47.718 --> 07:53:57.360
he doesn't know him okay okay like yes eh new samsung charger too

5456
07:53:57.360 --> 07:54:00.718
Mm it is it too to this one

5457
07:54:00.718 --> 07:54:05.360
the person or what is it for now should we be in the workshop

5458
07:54:05.360 --> 07:54:11.080
Okay eh and then so this person asked to kill everyone then how far have you

5459
07:54:11.080 --> 07:54:14.798
arrived at 1745

5460
07:54:15.280 --> 07:54:19.600
Yes I thought it was you who took the initiative that you were a little free after

5461
07:54:19.600 --> 07:54:24.160
the job and would buy it like why he asks how far you have

5462
07:54:24.160 --> 07:54:28.878
come it is probably the girl waiting for me similar to he question how far I have

5463
07:54:28.878 --> 07:54:32.360
come no but i don't understand why did you wait this girl on you why

5464
07:54:32.360 --> 07:54:35.478
Could you not just go to this garage yourself I don't know she was

5465
07:54:35.478 --> 07:54:38.000
Well where the plan was that I would go there you serrer when he writes how far

5466
07:54:38.000 --> 07:54:40.878
Have you come the plan was that I would go there and bring my things with me

5467
07:54:40.878 --> 07:54:44.080
to the garage I would be there for a while as well and take yes but were there

5468
07:54:44.080 --> 07:54:47.318
Like and hang on for a half hour or similar but I didn't get me

5469
07:54:47.318 --> 07:54:50.558
he just hand over things and aka to my girl after because I had after all

5470
07:54:50.558 --> 07:54:54.440
promised her that we would meet etc. so he has written how far have you

5471
07:54:54.440 --> 07:54:57.360
Come there is probably someone who wonders when I arrive at the garage as well as okay

5472
07:54:57.360 --> 07:54:59.878
I haven't kept key to Garet so someone is there and waiting for me with

5473
07:54:59.878 --> 07:55:03.680
the keys or corpses thus access to the garage okay

5474
07:55:03.680 --> 07:55:07.600
But I don't really understand this when it starts to be tough about time or what you

5475
07:55:07.600 --> 07:55:13.878
should say it can't answer it when it gets tough about time as I have gone

5476
07:55:13.878 --> 07:55:17.760
I have bought the stuff it has taken too long simply okay the whole thing

5477
07:55:17.760 --> 07:55:23.040
have taken too long okay for long queue at ica or similar so as it

5478
07:55:23.040 --> 07:55:28.398
is time it is traffic maybe it is 1745 if you go from Arlanda to Södra it

5479
07:55:28.398 --> 07:55:32.240
E4an there is traffic at that time as well but have you been in contact

5480
07:55:32.240 --> 07:55:36.200
then with your friend kill everyone and conveyed this and that is why

5481
07:55:36.200 --> 07:55:40.440
This girl is connected and will receive these things no no I think that

5482
07:55:40.440 --> 07:55:44.280
The plan from the beginning was that she was she was already there and that I would go

5483
07:55:44.280 --> 07:55:46.920
there and I would be with her and the other guy when we would be there

5484
07:55:46.920 --> 07:55:51.398
like and advised around but i he simply not mm

5485
07:55:51.398 --> 07:55:59.080
eh and then there at 181 brother check something only you can cover the face

5486
07:55:59.080 --> 07:56:04.878
mm and and it is for what purpose then you just saw that I bought

5487
07:56:04.878 --> 07:56:08.638
He had written Bandanas, but I bought this Konam worms instead

5488
07:56:08.638 --> 07:56:11.398
Then I told him when I was at Bilt I find no bandanas as I know

5489
07:56:11.398 --> 07:56:14.040
Not what should I even buy something like this is how we might be able to buy

5490
07:56:14.040 --> 07:56:17.520
Then like when we go on the mopeds or or similar and then he said no

5491
07:56:17.520 --> 07:56:20.200
But check just if you can cover the face as well as it will be nice when you

5492
07:56:20.200 --> 07:56:25.080
go like cover the face wore okay fine yes because i thought like this what what

5493
07:56:25.080 --> 07:56:28.878
is it too priority to buy in you haven't even been in this workshop

5494
07:56:28.878 --> 07:56:32.520
It has nothing to do with the workshop to do it is when or thus it should

5495
07:56:32.520 --> 07:56:36.240
Like being to the workshop It is not the stress of the world but when I am anyway

5496
07:56:36.240 --> 07:56:39.120
In Biltema so I write to him I find no bandanas unfortunately then I say

5497
07:56:39.120 --> 07:56:42.718
Yes but just check you can cover the face It is not that, like us, when

5498
07:56:42.718 --> 07:56:45.718
You weld it, it is not just enough with a bandana you have to have like that

5499
07:56:45.718 --> 07:56:49.920
Here real with gas and so on but when you, like yes but do otherwise at

5500
07:56:49.920 --> 07:56:53.718
The car when you go like yes but some bags smell bad then you have as well as

5501
07:56:53.718 --> 07:56:57.200
Great for the face when you go and it's cold outside on mopeds

5502
07:56:57.200 --> 07:57:00.798
or motorcycles then you have something for the face so he said yes but buy something

5503
07:57:00.798 --> 07:57:06.878
just so we can have it there and as I said before he gets so excited by some

5504
07:57:06.878 --> 07:57:09.760
Things that he wants like yes but we will solve it now now he is really stressed

5505
07:57:09.760 --> 07:57:12.520
person and sometimes you have to tell him yes but calm we solve it later but

5506
07:57:12.520 --> 07:57:17.478
Now you are still in Biltema as I had I H I was I who had offered

5507
07:57:17.478 --> 07:57:20.520
myself and said you are free after work today for a few hours I can fix

5508
07:57:20.520 --> 07:57:23.478
This then I think yes but I buy it too I fix it then I bought

5509
07:57:23.478 --> 07:57:28.878
Crown masks instead of bandanas then mm okay and then it comes then as we have

5510
07:57:28.878 --> 07:57:35.600
been inside a little neighbor on this then the address Sagittarius road 542 eh eh yes as

5511
07:57:35.600 --> 07:57:41.280
Well then the shooter's street 540 then ends exactly and you mean that then that

5512
07:57:41.280 --> 07:57:45.360
This is where you get information that this is where this workshop simply should

5513
07:57:45.360 --> 07:57:48.798
lie so you should then leave these things m in close to and that area

5514
07:57:48.798 --> 07:57:53.638
exactly eh and so you describe that like this late

5515
07:57:53.638 --> 07:57:58.600
Do you go to the gate yes not for if you check in 1821

5516
07:57:58.600 --> 07:58:02.920
Stands in Sagittarius Road 542 where he writes the address of me as I should, as well

5517
07:58:02.920 --> 07:58:06.240
But then that I have the address like so that I know where to go late

5518
07:58:06.240 --> 07:58:10.600

5525
07:58:40.318 --> 07:58:44.120
he has written what I do not know why he has written it but I have not

5526

5531
07:59:02.120 --> 07:59:05.440
So on I arrive where she stands there with her building pants she knows

5536
07:59:20.280 --> 07:59:23.718
Garage or similar S yes but there is a bit around where you get to drive around

5537
07:59:23.718 --> 07:59:27.760

5539
07:59:30.398 --> 07:59:34.798

5540
07:59:34.798 --> 07:59:39.080
And then you see that he writes D She helps you wear then a little further down

5541
07:59:39.080 --> 07:59:43.200

5542
07:59:43.200 --> 07:59:47.760
I gave her the matter and so I went mm okay

5543

07:59:58.638 --> 08:00:03.318
talked about when it was money we talked about what I know may not have been any

5546
08:00:03.318 --> 08:00:07.840
expose some kind of expenses or purchasing goods I do not know if he on he at

5547
08:00:07.840 --> 08:00:12.280
any way yes I don't really know that is money yes but it has not with it

5548
08:00:12.280 --> 08:00:16.000
Here to do you mean it has enough purchases to do that certainly

5549
08:00:16.000 --> 08:00:20.680
It is not with reach it is not as well as that payment for any service or

5550
08:00:20.680 --> 08:00:27.280
Similar no no okay eh but then you go to McDonalds

5551
08:00:27.280 --> 08:00:32.920
then your yes just meet yes eh how long are you there then do not remember how long I am

5552
08:00:32.920 --> 08:00:36.398
where I am well there half an hour I met her and her friend we stood

5553
08:00:36.398 --> 08:00:40.120
there took a sigg and bought someone frappe and the like then I went home after

5554
08:00:40.120 --> 08:00:45.478
The okay I thought so it was the meeting as it was so in a hurry like

5555
08:00:45.478 --> 08:00:49.318
This half -hour meeting you know how girls are you should have promised about

5556
08:00:49.318 --> 08:00:54.040
Something so you go there and you are in time okay yes but because I just wonder

5557
08:00:54.040 --> 08:00:58.920
If you continue to read in this conversation etc. eh then it seems

5558
08:00:58.920 --> 08:01:04.120
be like you have some other conversations there too around 20 o'clock

5559
08:01:04.120 --> 08:01:09.478
exactly eh and then you talk about any address, among other things in Sollentuna etc. I

5560
08:01:09.478 --> 08:01:13.120
Went there after my girl it was I go from the south I come by

5561
08:01:13.120 --> 08:01:17.080
Sollentuna and so t one -city my house is okay so you didn't go home without you

5562
08:01:17.080 --> 08:01:21.440
Went to Sollentuna I went to Sollentuna after yes okay and that is shopping

5563
08:01:21.440 --> 08:01:26.840
after all if yes any kind of tramadol and I have admitted drug offenses there then etc.

5564
08:01:26.840 --> 08:01:29.840
okay

5565
08:01:29.958 --> 08:01:36.558
Eh you've heard what I've read about or read about this

5566
08:01:36.558 --> 08:01:41.600
the survey that you have done by this alias kill all yes I have

5567
08:01:41.600 --> 08:01:47.318
read yes what do you think about it it is deeply alarming that I have had

5568
08:01:47.318 --> 08:01:51.760
contact with such a person but that I have not had any knowledge that he

5569
08:01:51.760 --> 08:01:56.840
Bear so deeds and that is partly also why I do not want to comment on

5570
08:01:56.840 --> 08:02:03.760
something no ok but now that you understand you have after all

5571
08:02:03.760 --> 08:02:08.360
understood that these things then as you buy they end up in the end

5572
08:02:08.360 --> 08:02:11.878
Here the crime scene they have your finger of pressure on you several of these cans

5573
08:02:11.878 --> 08:02:16.000
What do you think about what said it is deeply alarming

5574
08:02:16.000 --> 08:02:20.440
I, as I said, I still don't think that when I bought them

5575
08:02:20.440 --> 08:02:24.000
here things from the beginning that it was the plan they would be used for i

5576
08:02:24.000 --> 08:02:29.920
Serg still that he has needed as well as take from those things or how

5577
08:02:29.920 --> 08:02:32.280
one should say it or how to formulate it that he has had to take them

5578
08:02:32.280 --> 08:02:38.240
things to perform this rough crime gang then as well as mm but eh I I

5579
08:02:38.240 --> 08:02:42.638
I can't see that he would like to pull me in in something similar in something

5580
08:02:42.638 --> 08:02:46.638
criminal or similar he knows I have jobs I have

5581
08:02:46.638 --> 08:02:53.120
Like I have my fixed as I have a plan I don't have pain blood to

5582
08:02:53.120 --> 08:02:56.040
someone i know the works i don't know the plaintiff i don't know their

5583
08:02:56.040 --> 08:03:00.318
son I think that they have gone through it is terrible I as I want

5584
08:03:00.318 --> 08:03:03.920
not be part of any kind of crime gang but now it is so and I had hoped

5585
08:03:03.920 --> 08:03:08.600
that during the preliminary investigation it had been cleared up now you have not done so

5586
08:03:08.600 --> 08:03:11.840
Now I sit here and then we may say as it is I was going to say about what way

5587
08:03:11.840 --> 08:03:16.000
would it have been cleared up then that one had somehow listed that one

5588
08:03:16.000 --> 08:03:18.798
had seen maybe chatting i don't know how i how i really thought

5589
08:03:18.798 --> 08:03:22.840
Like but eh so you think that if we had seen your answers then on these

5590
08:03:22.840 --> 08:03:25.520
messages it had been to your advantage it had not been to your

5591
08:03:25.520 --> 08:03:32.360
disadvantage yes mm okay and this one then d all would then you would

5592
08:03:32.360 --> 08:03:36.520
say that it is like a close friend to you no it is an acquaintance it is a friend

5593
08:03:36.520 --> 08:03:41.040
It is not my best friend it is not my worst friend the one a human

5594
08:03:41.040 --> 08:03:47.520
Feel that person has, like put in the shit if you were to tuck so yes

5595
08:03:47.520 --> 08:03:51.920
so that I know if I will be at you g all these purchases and t them to this one

5596
08:03:51.920 --> 08:03:55.040
the place and then they should then be used in it

5597
08:03:55.040 --> 08:03:59.240
here etc. so I think like what what do your thoughts go about it

5598
08:03:59.240 --> 08:04:04.920
the person I said before if I have understood this

5599
08:04:04.920 --> 08:04:09.680
right so that when I bought things etc. the plan still wasn't that they

5600
08:04:09.680 --> 08:04:12.840
would be used for this crime gang without it has come in a later stage

5601
08:04:12.840 --> 08:04:15.600
Then I cannot answer whether it is true or not what he has thought if he has

5602
08:04:15.600 --> 08:04:20.840
thought he'll fool me like or similar so eh i am as I said i

5603
08:04:20.840 --> 08:04:24.280
i'm undead since before i have no connections to anything like this network

5604
08:04:24.280 --> 08:04:28.520
or similar and then you can discuss on whether he has wanted to use

5605
08:04:28.520 --> 08:04:32.760
themselves out of me because I just have been judged since before and would not have any

5606
08:04:32.760 --> 08:04:38.280
kind of span or similar but then yes he has done it he

5607
08:04:38.280 --> 08:04:43.040
have done he can stand for it as then then can't so much more i have

5608
08:04:43.040 --> 08:04:46.398
Did what I have done too so I have bought these things in good faith

5609
08:04:46.398 --> 08:04:49.360
Like okay

5610
08:04:50.000 --> 08:04:56.840
eh I think it was if it was on the phone if it was in the analysis of

5611
08:04:56.840 --> 08:05:00.798
the phone so there was something initial reaching

5612
08:05:00.798 --> 08:05:06.520
initial summary where I read up as any police had written

5613
08:05:06.520 --> 08:05:12.558
Eh there was something like you should have had the role of some fixer and

5614
08:05:12.558 --> 08:05:19.040
as well as that in such types of deeds it is a statement drawn out of no one

5615
08:05:19.040 --> 08:05:24.718
context I like if if you buy a gasoline and gas are counted

5616
08:05:24.718 --> 08:05:29.120
As a fixer then I am well fixer but it is not reaching Kell in anything criminal

5617
08:05:29.120 --> 08:05:34.760
context no ok but you are also charged for another

5618
08:05:34.760 --> 08:05:40.840
DO NOT HERE THE FULL COURT NO NO BUT it also has connection to what should

5619
08:05:40.840 --> 08:05:46.120
You say this conflict etc. but I do not think that you are dragging

5620
08:05:46.120 --> 08:05:50.200
up it in this case that case is by itself it may be cleared up by it

5621
08:05:50.200 --> 08:05:53.558
Thus, they think they are closed to the saw, we must leave to the court think

5622
08:05:53.558 --> 08:05:58.200
i mm eh but yes i stand charged but i'm not convicted no not judged before

5623
08:05:58.200 --> 08:06:02.680
either no no but okay but then it is like a coincidence that you are in two cases then

5624
08:06:02.680 --> 08:06:05.120
has been drawn into it or how should I first it it is a completely different

5625
08:06:05.120 --> 08:06:09.440
case if you say so it has a completely different interpretation that case

5626
08:06:09.440 --> 08:06:13.840
That case has I have become how you say I have been put in the shit as well as

5627
08:06:13.840 --> 08:06:17.638
without my knowledge but that I don't think there is no point in taking

5628
08:06:17.638 --> 08:06:20.440
up this I am not convicted of it yet so that it or I I do not know if I

5629
08:06:20.440 --> 08:06:25.080
will be convicted of it like that no that it is not relevant no but

5630
08:06:25.080 --> 08:06:29.680
You have no connection whatsoever to any kind of criminal network or

5631
08:06:29.680 --> 08:06:34.240
gross organized crime in any way no no I just thought it

5632
08:06:34.240 --> 08:06:39.558
Will be right what I said mentioned about what you have written when it is this

5633
08:06:39.558 --> 08:06:43.600
the review of telephone emptying starting on the page

5634
08:06:43.600 --> 08:06:48.680
360 Then it was under the result of the review on the page

5635
08:06:48.680 --> 08:06:55.000
364 as the one who has done this then writes that signed the one who goes

5636
08:06:55.000 --> 08:06:58.638
Through the Marm Manos phone phone is emptied that case and so you mention a

5637
08:06:58.638 --> 08:07:02.760
Kummer and has a certain fittings number what emerges is that Armanda has

5638
08:07:02.760 --> 08:07:05.680
The role I would describe as fixer he is the one who buys and

5639
08:07:05.680 --> 08:07:08.360
transporting crime tools and food and so

5640
08:07:08.360 --> 08:07:13.760
Furthermore, but you mean it is like a glossy statement from thus that

5641
08:07:13.760 --> 08:07:18.240
claim that there has been crime tools and food when I have bought the things so have

5642
08:07:18.240 --> 08:07:21.920
I did not have intent that this would be used or that it would be a

5643
08:07:21.920 --> 08:07:25.120
Crime tool it is not that I have bought something illegal or that I

5644
08:07:25.120 --> 08:07:30.520
have, like no but sorry I might be unclear it what he says it is to

5645
08:07:30.520 --> 08:07:34.318
That is what he describes as well as in general as he goes through your phone and

5646
08:07:34.318 --> 08:07:38.398
Then he writes he is the one who buys and the transit below I will

5647
08:07:38.398 --> 08:07:41.878
Document they are there, after all, consider importance to our investigation found in

5648
08:07:41.878 --> 08:07:46.878
The phone so then focuses on it so generally he says there are others

5649
08:07:46.878 --> 08:07:51.478
things in this phone to indicate that you should be some kind of fixer

5650
08:07:51.478 --> 08:07:55.360
thus generally and generally I have already explained that when I did not

5651
08:07:55.360 --> 08:07:58.680
am at work or that when i am when i have free time like i don't know what

5652
08:07:58.680 --> 08:08:02.558
he interprets as a fixer about buying tires and rim it like any criminal

5653
08:08:02.558 --> 08:08:06.958
deed no okay but yes i go around i'm on the block a lot i buy and

5654
08:08:06.958 --> 08:08:10.280
Selling things that's what I do I like it's my hobby so you earn a

5655
08:08:10.280 --> 08:08:16.478
extra crack on it too mm okay but you understand when you look at them

5656
08:08:16.478 --> 08:08:20.478
Here you chat when you see, among other things, you write about it being poured into

5657
08:08:20.478 --> 08:08:23.638
mailbox that there is any guy who needs food

5658
08:08:23.638 --> 08:08:29.878
eh these purchases do since you have talked then in relation to a fire what

5659
08:08:29.878 --> 08:08:34.280
burns well and that it is then left in when connection to this press

5660
08:08:34.280 --> 08:08:37.760
the apartment what it looks like mm no i real i drive on it absolute i i

5661
08:08:37.760 --> 08:08:41.318
don't tell it it it looks good if you say so I understand how it

5662
08:08:41.318 --> 08:08:44.558
looks and I understand why I am sitting here today because of that suspicion but

5663
08:08:44.558 --> 08:08:48.200
Still you don't see what I have written you still don't see what I

5664
08:08:48.200 --> 08:08:52.760
have responded to all the chats and therefore it is pulled out of such a rough context etc.

5665
08:08:52.760 --> 08:08:55.878
Had you been able to read what I say or what I write then you could have

5666
08:08:55.878 --> 08:09:00.280
understand got a bigger picture of the whole mm and that I buy a cane gasoline

5667
08:09:00.280 --> 08:09:06.360
Or then as if if someone writes to me buy coal and pizzas

5668
08:09:06.360 --> 08:09:11.398
I don't think of anything criminal no okay

5669
08:09:11.398 --> 08:09:16.318
Eh i understand your attitude and explanation for these details

5670
08:09:16.318 --> 08:09:20.720
I have no more questions for you thank you g k would you like to ask questions

5671
08:09:20.720 --> 08:09:27.760
[Music] mm first a question like this one usually has

5672
08:09:27.760 --> 08:09:32.680
a barbecue at a workshop that said it was not just a workshop it would be

5673
08:09:32.680 --> 08:09:36.318
Like a Safe Place a Happy Place It was probably a garage I haven't been there as

5674
08:09:36.318 --> 08:09:40.120
said I haven't seen the place yet but as I understood it out of the explanation like that

5675
08:09:40.120 --> 08:09:43.360
would it be yes but there would be any place outside we have a grill there

5676
08:09:43.360 --> 08:09:47.398
We have some sofas in the workshop We take it easy We have music at Mecca on cars

5677
08:09:47.398 --> 08:09:54.200
and jaw good food with friends etc. Then I think about this situation

5678
08:09:54.200 --> 08:09:58.440
When to hand over these things that you have hand

5679
08:09:58.440 --> 08:10:02.878
eh she then says that this workshop should be type two blocks away or

5680
08:10:02.878 --> 08:10:07.080
Like just a little bit away mm was not strange then that you did not drove there

5681
08:10:07.080 --> 08:10:12.440
And leaves them then, after all, the gasoline tube weighs 8 kg and the can 5 kg

5682
08:10:12.440 --> 08:10:17.120
And then flush fluid and all the tangle no as I understood it so did not lay

5683
08:10:17.120 --> 08:10:20.360
Two quarters away without me asking when I arrived at where is the garage lies

5684
08:10:20.360 --> 08:10:23.958
and said h yes but you you should drive around with the car was a bit like there to the garage

5685
08:10:23.958 --> 08:10:28.318
so yeah so that it is like, for example, at home with me then about if only

5686
08:10:28.318 --> 08:10:33.280
to give you an example then that if you are going to park the car in the garage then it is

5687
08:10:33.280 --> 08:10:36.718
better to go to the garage but if you just have to leave anything in the garage and

5688
08:10:36.718 --> 08:10:39.920
go away from there then it is easier to just stay on the main road so

5689
08:10:39.920 --> 08:10:43.798
don't you have to go around the whole place to get to the garage so that was the way I

5690
08:10:43.798 --> 08:10:47.160
she understood then she came by car or came she walked no she came walking or

5691
08:10:47.160 --> 08:10:50.318
she was standing there on the turning zone so she probably came k not that it was a little

5692
08:10:50.318 --> 08:10:55.878
weird to hand over things out to her the just such things no ni i

5693
08:10:55.878 --> 08:11:01.600
Know it should be used in a garage you knew it is obvious that

5694
08:11:01.600 --> 08:11:08.360
I knew it would be to the garage okay eh then it said eh big

5695
08:11:08.360 --> 08:11:12.718
parts or part of this chat that it is

5696
08:11:13.080 --> 08:11:18.200
ehm era as well as internal conversation and that

5697
08:11:18.200 --> 08:11:24.080
It is humor in the MM can you understand that it is difficult to see this humor it

5698
08:11:24.080 --> 08:11:30.160
depends on who you ask when I read hahaha so it's humor for me

5699
08:11:30.160 --> 08:11:37.760
Okay so when he says eh he says something he would have

5700
08:11:37.760 --> 08:11:43.638
shot in that case no if it was so I could go into the apartment I had

5701
08:11:43.638 --> 08:11:48.440
shot haaha mm so the thing is that if you could have seen the cats from I

5702
08:11:48.440 --> 08:11:51.718
Don't know exactly what day it was but we had talked as I said for a while that

5703
08:11:51.718 --> 08:11:56.360
His his neighbors are so disturbing so in that context so it's not strange we

5704
08:11:56.360 --> 08:11:59.440
Have talked about that yeah damn what hard neighbors I have like me can't

5705
08:11:59.440 --> 08:12:02.840
I was on vacation so that in that context it is no wonder I know

5706
08:12:02.840 --> 08:12:08.680
After all, what he what he likes to mean okay you ever think about it

5707
08:12:08.680 --> 08:12:14.600
could be an apartment near where you were no absolutely not I had under

5708
08:12:14.600 --> 08:12:19.570
This whole moment not a slight suspicion of something criminal

5709
08:12:19.570 --> 08:12:22.630
[Music]

5710
08:12:26.120 --> 08:12:31.920
no then it was another thing too eh you said there was someone who would come

5711
08:12:31.920 --> 08:12:37.360
and clean up and stuff mm eh but you had no idea who it

5712
08:12:37.360 --> 08:12:42.000
This person was no as I said this garage it wasn't just me and that

5713
08:12:42.000 --> 08:12:44.798
this is then that had access to this would be a garage like we

5714
08:12:44.798 --> 08:12:47.600
can rob out to friends we can be there together or we can be there ourselves

5715
08:12:47.600 --> 08:12:51.360
with our other friends and that there are people there like people people there and advise

5716
08:12:51.360 --> 08:12:56.440
around and clean up together and like fixing the place to make it nice

5717
08:12:56.440 --> 08:13:01.958
mm you call it a safe space what do you mean by how do you call it safe

5718
08:13:01.958 --> 08:13:06.520
The seas about if you say so in English as well as a one place where we can be at

5719
08:13:06.520 --> 08:13:10.398
evenings hang with friends listen to music mecca on cars that is we

5720
08:13:10.398 --> 08:13:14.680
likes to do as we have we have mcked on cars and like held it

5721
08:13:14.680 --> 08:13:17.318
that is a nice place to be on it is our hobby it what we like so

5722
08:13:17.318 --> 08:13:20.478
As some like to play Padder or Tennis in the free time we like and Mecca

5723
08:13:20.478 --> 08:13:24.120
on cars in your spare time okay so I would but so

5724
08:13:24.120 --> 08:13:26.760
that I I just want to be clear and mean that Safe Place would not be

5725
08:13:26.760 --> 08:13:29.440
any connection to any pressure ice apartment or similar or green quarter

5726
08:13:29.440 --> 08:13:33.440
as prosecutors then explained that is not what I mean without safe space

5727
08:13:33.440 --> 08:13:36.638
would be a place where we are there and we like to take it easy with friends and have

5728
08:13:36.638 --> 08:13:43.160
the fun etc. based on the context we look at now it sounds pretty similar

5729
08:13:43.160 --> 08:13:49.958
a pressure ice or bunker cola and pizza and so there something sounds

5730
08:13:49.958 --> 08:13:54.200
similar it can not answer but it is not like that

5731
08:13:54.200 --> 08:14:01.360
Mm okay thanks thank you so much anton sundberg yes thank you yes I was going to start there

5732
08:14:01.360 --> 08:14:06.398
target tree ended eh it can be sometimes hard to find the right words can i

5733
08:14:06.398 --> 08:14:10.558
imagine but safe space do you say if i say gathering place is a correct

5734
08:14:10.558 --> 08:14:14.160
designation for what this could be that it is a perfect term yes

5735
08:14:14.160 --> 08:14:18.920
yes eh and as I interpret you, this is a place where one could

5736
08:14:18.920 --> 08:14:24.638
Be able to hang it is true yes yes sees like a youth yard is yes as is this

5737
08:14:24.638 --> 08:14:28.958
any professional activity where you will, as well as conduct some kind, thus

5738
08:14:28.958 --> 08:14:33.000
professional car repair shop like Mekonomen or similar no absolutely not that it is

5739
08:14:33.000 --> 08:14:36.478
No place that we should, as well as receive customers and the like, but we shall MEA

5740
08:14:36.478 --> 08:14:39.558
on our cars maybe someone go help any parents car and similar as well

5741
08:14:39.558 --> 08:14:44.398
Mm okay so it is it you at the same time as we hang there and jaw

5742
08:14:44.398 --> 08:14:49.878
food and like similar and so exactly eh and i was going to snap up on some things

5743
08:14:49.878 --> 08:14:53.280
Of what you have told about it, I have answered most of the time on the prosecutor's

5744
08:14:53.280 --> 08:14:57.718
Questions eh but eh if we start with this one for that i know you yourself reputation

5745
08:14:57.718 --> 08:15:01.120
to and you were careful to point this out too but this one that you connect

5746
08:15:01.120 --> 08:15:05.600
up the day after eh that it mentioned as it would be unclear what you

5747
08:15:05.600 --> 08:15:10.558
did there m can you just explain some sdare what what was it that happened there

5748
08:15:10.558 --> 08:15:13.760
or why did you connect this day after as the prosecutor claims yes

5749
08:15:13.760 --> 08:15:17.958
exactly I think that an unclear reason is, like it it is

5750
08:15:17.958 --> 08:15:21.200
Not an unclear reason it was in the memorandum that the police established there

5751
08:15:21.200 --> 08:15:25.600
that I was at home with my girl that night and that yes it depends on v what

5752
08:15:25.600 --> 08:15:29.600
one interprets as proximity but I do not think that distance is a closeness to

5753
08:15:29.600 --> 08:15:33.958
Like it is in Haninge yes but there are two completely different places so I I

5754
08:15:33.958 --> 08:15:36.000
have not had any connection to the address then as no maybe I get

5755
08:15:36.000 --> 08:15:40.558
reason to show it since we get to see okay eh and so were you on it as well

5756
08:15:40.558 --> 08:15:43.638
The plaintiff has been sitting here everyone is not sitting here but you have received

5757
08:15:43.638 --> 08:15:48.000
read the names and heard what they have told us and so there you feel the plaintiffs no

5758
08:15:48.000 --> 08:15:51.238
I don't know the plaintiff when I read the fup so it was first song I

5759
08:15:51.238 --> 08:15:55.478
read their name I have no connection to theirs as I interpreted it then that

5760
08:15:55.478 --> 08:15:58.600
it is that this would be something real to their sons or similar

5761
08:15:58.600 --> 08:16:01.440
I have no one I do not know the son I have not heard his name late

5762
08:16:01.440 --> 08:16:06.600
before no and yes I don't know the corpse you have something you have any bad blood against someone in

5763
08:16:06.600 --> 08:16:13.558
The family where no no no eh and are you like you are part of any conflict

5764
08:16:13.558 --> 08:16:17.840
where someone in the family could possibly be on the other side no I

5765
08:16:17.840 --> 08:16:25.478
is not with any conflict at all no okay eh eh but you have eh it has you

5766
08:16:25.478 --> 08:16:29.600
yourself told you that you are going with with with a person who according to the police in

5767
08:16:29.600 --> 08:16:34.920
All cases are is is a criminal etc. So how do you look at it

5768
08:16:34.920 --> 08:16:39.238
The situation thus the thing is like this that I have not received any suspicion that

5769
08:16:39.238 --> 08:16:42.680
This person should be a criminal then that he can smoke hash at some point

5770
08:16:42.680 --> 08:16:46.398
like and so if it is considered criminal yes then he must be well

5771
08:16:46.398 --> 08:16:51.440
criminal in that term yes but that he would like to figure in such gross

5772
08:16:51.440 --> 08:16:57.478
suspicions that I have read like so that it is nothing that I perceived

5773
08:16:57.478 --> 08:17:00.520
There is nothing that I have seen out of him as well as most of the time I have had

5774
08:17:00.520 --> 08:17:05.120
with him it is it that revolves around cars and the like as well as it that it

5775
08:17:05.120 --> 08:17:08.440
is deeply alarming indeed but it is as it is where is you upbringing

5776
08:17:08.440 --> 08:17:13.680
somewhere I grew up in small little ones there are people there maybe people who

5777
08:17:13.680 --> 08:17:18.160
you have eh childhood friends and the like that may have gone wrong wrong path in life

5778
08:17:18.160 --> 08:17:22.200
It is very likely if you are going if you are going if you are to start from statistics and

5779
08:17:22.200 --> 08:17:26.200
similar then like i can i can not raw because i have friends or

5780
08:17:26.200 --> 08:17:29.238
I have friends that I have been hanging out with me when I was a kid who unfortunately has chosen a

5781
08:17:29.238 --> 08:17:32.280
criminal path when there are still people

5782
08:17:32.280 --> 08:17:37.000
as is not just like criminals at

5783
08:17:37.000 --> 08:17:40.280
whole about if you say so criminal full -time as well as it is friends like me

5784
08:17:40.280 --> 08:17:43.000
can go out and jaw with them I can go out and a hamburger with them as it is

5785
08:17:43.000 --> 08:17:46.360
still friends to me since they commit criminal acts it is

5786
08:17:46.360 --> 08:17:48.600
really boring but there is nothing that I can raw because there is nothing I can stand

5787
08:17:48.600 --> 08:17:55.000
for and like yes but eh according to what you you didn't know that then this alig

5788
08:17:55.000 --> 08:17:58.558
seen killing everyone that that person was involved in something like this

5789
08:17:58.558 --> 08:18:03.238
So we'll understand you no no no ok ok eh and this workshop then it has

5790
08:18:03.238 --> 08:18:07.120
been up there is no secret that we have had a few days before here eh and then

5791
08:18:07.120 --> 08:18:10.558
Has this got your engine interest has had some significance I thought

5792
08:18:10.558 --> 08:18:13.840
We should be clear there as well

5793
08:18:13.840 --> 08:18:18.760
eh can you describe what it is you work with i work with biro rental on

5794
08:18:18.760 --> 08:18:22.280
Arlanda Airport and I can also add then only a little quick to three

5795
08:18:22.280 --> 08:18:24.920
days before I was arrested so I had been promoted to manager there too

5796
08:18:24.920 --> 08:18:28.398
that it is not that I work there and just like ah as well as lace around

5797
08:18:28.398 --> 08:18:32.840
without it it is my goal in life as well as mm okay and on in your spare time you have

5798
08:18:32.840 --> 08:18:36.840
after all, been on that you have a big as well as car interest what looks like

5799
08:18:36.840 --> 08:18:41.520
Like the weeks out as well as with cars private and vehicles at all

5800
08:18:41.520 --> 08:18:45.520
The thing is I have then so far behind I can remember then childhood as well as so

5801
08:18:45.520 --> 08:18:49.000
That it is like if the dad should go and change winter tires then I get so extra me

5802
08:18:49.000 --> 08:18:52.160
want to follow along like so that what I like cars I am all I do

5803
08:18:52.160 --> 08:18:55.798
Like it's Youtube that's all possible and it buys and sells cars

5804
08:18:55.798 --> 08:18:59.718
In their spare time, people help with cars help friends with cars so it like

5805
08:18:59.718 --> 08:19:02.318
my friends know if there is something they have any question about a car or they

5806
08:19:02.318 --> 08:19:04.878
need help with something it is Armando you write to as well as so that

5807
08:19:04.878 --> 08:19:10.080
that yeah okay and this with open a garage you can you can just describe so we

5808
08:19:10.080 --> 08:19:15.958
So understand how the discussions have gone, etc. mm etc. thus the thing is as

5809
08:19:15.958 --> 08:19:20.398
said as you said then that this is not as to the Mekonomer or

5810
08:19:20.398 --> 08:19:24.878
Car mechanics Workshop We will open but we have yes for several years before for several years

5811
08:19:24.878 --> 08:19:28.440
we have, like yes but maybe sowing in a place or in a parking lot

5812
08:19:28.440 --> 08:19:32.680
Like and kept on mecca cars or you have gone to OKQ8 on these wash

5813
08:19:32.680 --> 08:19:36.520
Self -Thyr has stood there and mucked and so we said that like but then about

5814
08:19:36.520 --> 08:19:40.120
We still do so much with cars we should not, as well as rent into

5815
08:19:40.120 --> 08:19:44.798
reach some kind of garage or similar and yes but make it to ours as well as yes but

5816
08:19:44.798 --> 08:19:48.920
where we can soft and take it easy and so it was a great idea it we drive

5817
08:19:48.920 --> 08:19:53.558
Like we get a grill we sit down there speakers as we have fun it is

5818
08:19:53.558 --> 08:19:59.440
what we do etc. okay and when for as i understand you so be this

5819
08:19:59.440 --> 08:20:03.200
That, like this garage, was something new now that you had to take this

5820
08:20:03.200 --> 08:20:06.360
Can you describe how went how went that discussion to the thing is that I have

5821
08:20:06.360 --> 08:20:09.080
not where I have not seen the place but the discussion went to that

5822
08:20:09.080 --> 08:20:13.280
here kill everyone when we had talked a month before or in reach month's time and

5823
08:20:13.280 --> 08:20:16.558
He says then that we had talked about this idea then he said you I have

5824
08:20:16.558 --> 08:20:20.760
found a place as well as we should run on it as well as the like so yes but then

5825
08:20:20.760 --> 08:20:24.920
are you sure it runs on it like eh we we don't like talk

5826
08:20:24.920 --> 08:20:29.638
about rent and stuff like said it when we talk about 4 3000 2000 here and there

5827
08:20:29.638 --> 08:20:33.360
Like it is the kind of thing we are doing as well as V tires here and there so

5828
08:20:33.360 --> 08:20:36.200
that what we talked yes but fine as well as you have access to what the garage is running on

5829
08:20:36.200 --> 08:20:39.760
it take it if you think it's good eh i i go there when i have time since we

5830
08:20:39.760 --> 08:20:45.160
Rusting up the place itself as well as we drive etc. Did you want to open a garage yes yes

5831
08:20:45.160 --> 08:20:48.080
I wanted to be part of the part of the plan I wanted to be with and like

5832
08:20:48.080 --> 08:20:52.600
Access to a garage etc. Okay

5833
08:20:54.440 --> 08:21:01.798
ehm mm and what did you know about this garage so did I know and knew we

5834
08:21:01.798 --> 08:21:04.760
I didn't have this the world's information about this garage I

5835
08:21:04.760 --> 08:21:07.840
knew it was about if we say so here you knew where it was there somewhere it

5836
08:21:07.840 --> 08:21:11.440
Low in south but I don't know exactly V now I have the address so nearby

5837
08:21:11.440 --> 08:21:15.798
somewhere i yeah okay it was so you perceived yes yes yes of course and and and

5838
08:21:15.798 --> 08:21:20.318
Then you have described there that there was someone there and and kept on and cleared and

5839
08:21:20.318 --> 08:21:26.160
like that as you understood it mm before and why was it why was that person

5840
08:21:26.160 --> 08:21:29.120
There, as I said, he was there and he also had access to here

5841
08:21:29.120 --> 08:21:34.200
the garage probably via then my friend then and eh thus when moving into a

5842
08:21:34.200 --> 08:21:38.238
garage when to move in where I assumed it was completely empty as well

5843
08:21:38.238 --> 08:21:40.920
There was nothing there or so there was lots of shit there from the last owners

5844
08:21:40.920 --> 08:21:45.718
Or similar and yes but to clean around as you go where you might be removed

5845
08:21:45.718 --> 08:21:49.318
Old oil stains or as well as raises old furniture or setting any freezer

5846
08:21:49.318 --> 08:21:53.878
Or similar to the garage this was this was during winter time so that or

5847
08:21:53.878 --> 08:21:58.120
Winter autumn then, like the plan, was perhaps to be finished then until

5848
08:21:58.120 --> 08:22:01.878
Yes but our slopes there somewhere as well and like so we get started for real

5849
08:22:01.878 --> 08:22:04.318
mm okay

5850
08:22:05.360 --> 08:22:10.238
eh and and this is something like you

5851
08:22:10.238 --> 08:22:16.478
have discussed as i understand you and kill all yes yes okay and era

5852
08:22:16.478 --> 08:22:21.520
Discussions have you had you told you that you have had conversations thus we

5853
08:22:21.520 --> 08:22:25.238
Either through then signal's call what do I know or and and message

5854
08:22:25.238 --> 08:22:28.958
Communication apps just different apps as well and similar yes yes

5855
08:22:28.958 --> 08:22:36.318
And both conversation and with okay ehm etc. and the prosecutor has gone through

5856
08:22:36.318 --> 08:22:39.920
message so i'm not going to take them up again and ask them to explain it what

5857
08:22:39.920 --> 08:22:43.160
is there anything you want to add where you have come up with just in question

5858
08:22:43.160 --> 08:22:47.398
If with no I do not want to add them except to prove that one does not see my

5859
08:22:47.398 --> 08:22:50.798
Answer as well as that no yes I understand and I note that it does not

5860
08:22:50.798 --> 08:22:54.798
is evidently evident about this particular apartment that we are talking about these two

5861
08:22:54.798 --> 08:22:59.920
the days eh or the plaintiff in that conversation has it has either

5862
08:22:59.920 --> 08:23:03.478
as well as the place like this really happens or the plaintiff's name or

5863
08:23:03.478 --> 08:23:08.558
something about they arose in a different way than through through

5864
08:23:08.558 --> 08:23:12.160
Conversations I have not received neither this so -called security apartment

5865
08:23:12.160 --> 08:23:16.958
or the plaintiff or goal shot to do I have not received

5866
08:23:16.958 --> 08:23:20.798
any information at all about something someone

5867
08:23:26.520 --> 08:23:32.000
this joke mm mm eh and like how is the jargon between you two how would you

5868
08:23:32.000 --> 08:23:35.558
So describe it the way I buy what it looks like I absolutely do when you

5869
08:23:35.558 --> 08:23:38.878
puts it in the way I understand what it looks like and then some may think

5870
08:23:38.878 --> 08:23:45.238
that what kind of humor is like m but yes to have a dark humor with

5871
08:23:45.238 --> 08:23:49.798
Like friends it's fun as it is fun it is so we joke and then

5872
08:23:49.798 --> 08:23:53.680
He, as I said he is, like I was at work then and I know how he is he is

5873
08:23:53.680 --> 08:23:57.040
He becomes like a he becomes like a child when he jokes he wants to like yes

5874
08:23:57.040 --> 08:23:59.840
he wants to go out on the whole joke and like holding on for a long time and then you get

5875
08:23:59.840 --> 08:24:04.840
after all, he gives him a little like a little ah hah yes exactly ha as but that he

5876
08:24:04.840 --> 08:24:09.440
asking me what burns well mm all people know what is burning well it is

5877
08:24:09.440 --> 08:24:13.840
no serious question like gasoline is burning well it knows well but when you get it

5878
08:24:13.840 --> 08:24:17.520
where first what to say the first notice of those where prosecutors have

5879
08:24:17.520 --> 08:24:23.080
shown like m eh and there is something about what is burning or something to

5880
08:24:23.080 --> 08:24:27.558
that way eh like there is something in you

5881
08:24:27.558 --> 08:24:31.280
background that you can, as well as refer it to yes yes yes, absolutely as we said we

5882
08:24:31.280 --> 08:24:35.878
Had talked not for several days but for a couple of days then before that he was

5883
08:24:35.878 --> 08:24:40.160
abroad and he had like the hell what apartment I ended up in all of

5884
08:24:40.160 --> 08:24:42.798
places so I ended up staying in a fasting youth gang as I had

5885
08:24:42.798 --> 08:24:46.040
Talked on I think it might be snap or phones or similar some

5886
08:24:46.040 --> 08:24:49.638
days before and he just had like this but then you drive I can't cope

5887
08:24:49.638 --> 08:24:52.558
with this like so I understand immediately because he had talked since before

5888
08:24:52.558 --> 08:24:55.878
Just like this damn i'm going to fucking fucking burst up that place but

5889
08:24:55.878 --> 08:24:59.440
as well as in a joking way I had I didn't think he was going to real

5890
08:24:59.440 --> 08:25:02.958
blast up the place but were on a joke so i can do the fuck no more

5891
08:25:02.958 --> 08:25:05.798
Like and then when he writes like that, I take him he is joking

5892
08:25:05.798 --> 08:25:09.478
again as well as mm so when he writes it then you understand at one time then

5893
08:25:09.478 --> 08:25:13.000
or do you need to think about what it is he is referring to no I don't have to think

5894
08:25:13.000 --> 08:25:16.440
after because I understand what he is referring to directly because we have talked about

5895
08:25:16.440 --> 08:25:22.638
that before like okay eh and just that might be a stupid

5896
08:25:22.638 --> 08:25:25.638
Ask but to be obvious as we have seen you shop these

5897
08:25:25.638 --> 08:25:31.238
The products and some things are as Åkl for the displayed so there is nothing

5898
08:25:31.238 --> 08:25:35.958
ehm nothing like a receipt or similar that just or camera that you just

5899
08:25:35.958 --> 08:25:40.558
have traded these but we these occasions when you have traded this

5900
08:25:40.558 --> 08:25:44.718
that you have agreed to as well as at some point there thought that something of

5901
08:25:44.718 --> 08:25:47.478
This is to be used for something illegal absolutely not it was after all

5902
08:25:47.478 --> 08:25:51.318
The shopping list I followed it and I had read the shopping list as before thus

5903
08:25:51.318 --> 08:25:54.600
When I got it I saw but this is the stuff that we use in a workshop

5904
08:25:54.600 --> 08:25:59.120
It's no wonder as well as exactly and then so if we go over to it

5905
08:25:59.120 --> 08:26:03.520
here when you hand over things eh if we go over to that part then eh so

5906
08:26:03.520 --> 08:26:07.958
do you describe that you met a girl m and then you have you mentioned several times

5907
08:26:07.958 --> 08:26:12.000
that she was wearing a building pants or something that why v it

5908
08:26:12.000 --> 08:26:16.080
something that you I noticed you with that it is not usually man

5909
08:26:16.080 --> 08:26:21.840
Meeting on people outside who wearing yes builds like work pants then

5910
08:26:21.840 --> 08:26:25.760
Like and that is something I have put in mind as I sit now here

5911
08:26:25.760 --> 08:26:30.238
today d like thought of what has happened as well and the like and then I came on

5912
08:26:30.238 --> 08:26:33.040
That but she had Byggab's pants on it so it means that she has

5913
08:26:33.040 --> 08:26:36.840
been in this workshop when the number worked or similar like v was

5914
08:26:36.840 --> 08:26:41.200
the interpretation you made yes it was that interpretation yes yes okay

5915
08:26:41.200 --> 08:26:46.360
ehm and can you describe a little just so we are as clear as possible because it went

5916
08:26:46.360 --> 08:26:50.440
a little faster I thought in the interview but as we are as clear as possible from

5917
08:26:50.440 --> 08:26:55.200
when you then when you then stop the car when you go from there how to go

5918
08:26:55.200 --> 08:26:59.958
conversation and so much you remember are things friend are the things you don't remember

5919
08:26:59.958 --> 08:27:04.160
so do you say that but so much you can remember i understand it t no but i i

5920
08:27:04.160 --> 08:27:06.920
Remember I went there as I arrived at the turning zone where I see it stands

5921
08:27:06.920 --> 08:27:10.318
a girl there like me going out in the car hi hi eh was it you who had talked

5922
08:27:10.318 --> 08:27:13.558
with our friend then like to have things yes it was me like yes what fun have you

5923
08:27:13.558 --> 08:27:17.398
been in the garage yes you are there and we a little cold talk as well as about the garage and

5924
08:27:17.398 --> 08:27:21.200
similar they are on and clean up and the like so okay here are the stuff blah blah

5925
08:27:21.200 --> 08:27:24.360
Bla like me gave her bags and so she said yes but shouldn't you follow in

5926
08:27:24.360 --> 08:27:28.160
Like and the like like this seemed a bit heavy maybe but I said no fuck

5927
08:27:28.160 --> 08:27:30.760
I don't have time, she said yes but I must carry them herself like she took

5928
08:27:30.760 --> 08:27:35.200
the stuff and she went like and we we he didn't talk as much it was well

5929
08:27:35.200 --> 08:27:37.718
just a little cold talk i don't feel i haven't met it since before

5930
08:27:37.718 --> 08:27:41.760
After all, someone had access to the garage that yes my friend feels then that

5931
08:27:41.760 --> 08:27:46.958
That's what we talked about I gave her the stuff and I went off okay eh and

5932
08:27:46.958 --> 08:27:50.760
As I understand it, she confirms so she says that it to

5933
08:27:50.760 --> 08:27:54.238
The garage yes yes yes we talked about the garage it was really

5934
08:27:54.238 --> 08:27:57.318
The only connection we had with each other so that was it naturally

5935
08:27:57.318 --> 08:28:01.040
to talk about that thing yes and then you got some questions here from the target bit the tree about

5936
08:28:01.040 --> 08:28:03.558
that it would be strange that you left at the turning area and not in

5937
08:28:03.558 --> 08:28:08.398
the garage eh and then I was just going to ask one question was you who decided were you

5938
08:28:08.398 --> 08:28:11.600
would be seen somewhere no i had got an address and i went there just so

5939
08:28:11.600 --> 08:28:15.200
You went there so you might as well have been in the garage yes yes so I assumed

5940
08:28:15.200 --> 08:28:19.280
So I assumed that the address there that the garage would be there but so

5941
08:28:19.280 --> 08:28:22.760
As I understood her, it wasn't far from there but it was just about

5942
08:28:22.760 --> 08:28:26.520
You would drive in there with a vehicle so you would have to go around

5943
08:28:26.520 --> 08:28:29.798
the place and it is like a slightly longer detour but if one should leave something on

5944
08:28:29.798 --> 08:28:32.558
the place just so it is easier to just stay on the main road and like dropping

5945
08:28:32.558 --> 08:28:35.600
off and go from there but this was not something it was not

5946
08:28:35.600 --> 08:28:39.080
You who decided if I no no no so I just went there as well as the stuff

5947
08:28:39.080 --> 08:28:43.840
Oke okay eh did you experience something strange with

5948
08:28:43.840 --> 08:28:47.798
with this girl at the time at the meeting that it was that she was nervous or

5949
08:28:47.798 --> 08:28:51.920
something that got it and f suspicions no no no

5950
08:28:51.920 --> 08:28:56.360
nothing thus a normal girl a normal conversation as well as yes and mentioned

5951
08:28:56.360 --> 08:29:02.000
she something about fire or burn or no no something that way no no

5952
08:29:02.000 --> 08:29:05.000
and

5953
08:29:08.160 --> 08:29:15.318
eh and i think you did something to hide that you handed over these

5954
08:29:15.318 --> 08:29:19.000
things this was something that happened as well as around a corner or thus

5955
08:29:19.000 --> 08:29:23.200
somewhere when all or absolutely not so you can say this way for

5956
08:29:23.200 --> 08:29:26.958
The first, after all, they leave on a turning zone among the positions complex and as well as

5957
08:29:26.958 --> 08:29:30.440
After all, anyone can read it like so it's nothing I hid late

5958
08:29:30.440 --> 08:29:33.318
Also I have traveled with my car I have stood as in front of the cash registers I have

5959
08:29:33.318 --> 08:29:38.160
gort the things i have like i have not been so i am no professional on

5960
08:29:38.160 --> 08:29:42.000
Police work if you say so or professionals on something similar but so if you now

5961
08:29:42.000 --> 08:29:44.840
would have planned something criminal so that where one was not standing as in front of a

5962
08:29:44.840 --> 08:29:47.798
camera and bought things about if you understand what I mean and like touched and laid

5963
08:29:47.798 --> 08:29:50.638
DNA Finger Imprint on Everything But I don't have miss this would be used

5964
08:29:50.638 --> 08:29:54.920
to any crime end okay

5965
08:29:54.958 --> 08:29:59.840
Mm and how like you got you may have answered a little bit to this but I

5966
08:29:59.840 --> 08:30:03.558
shall see if you have anything to say but how do you think now that all this

5967
08:30:03.558 --> 08:30:06.878
that it was found at one at a crime scene for it we do not question

5968
08:30:06.878 --> 08:30:12.600
No, it is, as I said, it is deeply alarming, thus it the defendant

5969
08:30:12.600 --> 08:30:17.600
have gone through that I do not wish anyone goes through really it is clear

5970
08:30:17.600 --> 08:30:21.878
it is cutting as well and then that I am suspected has been involved in

5971
08:30:21.878 --> 08:30:25.238
This deed It is also cutting for me as well as because I know what

5972
08:30:25.238 --> 08:30:27.920

or things in police interrogation what said it is no secret what time we

5980
08:31:02.558 --> 08:31:09.798
live in right now and you have read you have seen you have heard as well as it is

5981
08:31:09.798 --> 08:31:13.000
Actually out of fear as well as I have just chosen not to talk

5982
08:31:13.000 --> 08:31:15.558
something and hope that it can clear up not, I take it on

5983
08:31:15.558 --> 08:31:20.398
Dishes the time as well as ok well thank you then I have no more questions etc. F Mag

5984
08:31:20.398 --> 08:31:27.000
series or query no questioning thanks eh Robin Hedman Johansson etc. is it is

5985
08:31:27.000 --> 08:31:31.718
Someone you know it is an acquaintance okay you can develop in what way it is one

5986
08:31:31.718 --> 08:31:38.318
friend yeah okay and what does he do today i have no idea if i sutta arrested in

5987
08:31:38.318 --> 08:31:44.360
six months okay if i say he's sitting arrested right now then okay he

5988
08:31:44.360 --> 08:31:48.878
have been found abroad but recently came back to Sweden and

5989
08:31:48.878 --> 08:31:53.520
arrested that he is then arrested on suspicion of when a murder linked

5990
08:31:53.520 --> 08:31:59.958
also to this ftr believed the conflict okay what do you think about it he he

5991
08:31:59.958 --> 08:32:06.238
is well suspicious okay have you somehow been in contact with him around the

5992
08:32:06.238 --> 08:32:12.440
Here the days I have very possible been yes yes okay in what way pray

5993
08:32:12.440 --> 08:32:17.958
This is the general talk like nothing that concerns the suspicion no okay but it has

5994
08:32:17.958 --> 08:32:22.638
also been a friend of you it has been a friend yes so it is then dead

5995
08:32:22.638 --> 08:32:27.360
all then that one has come up with has had a very large involvement in several of

5996
08:32:27.360 --> 08:32:32.478
these different then gang -related cases within this folkrot conflict and the

5997
08:32:32.478 --> 08:32:36.000
Here Robin Hedmar Johansson it's just a coincidence that there are two acquaintances to you

5998
08:32:36.000 --> 08:32:40.360
but you have no srö any time with fox trot to do as i said i have grown

5999
08:32:40.360 --> 08:32:46.558
up in an area where several pieces have or perhaps become criminal etc. but

6000
08:32:46.558 --> 08:32:50.920
that they are there and that I can take a hamburger with them at some point it is

6001
08:32:50.920 --> 08:32:55.958
nothing like it does not make me a criminal no okay then as I have

6002
08:32:55.958 --> 08:32:59.200
understood it anyway so they are just suspects

6003
08:32:59.200 --> 08:33:04.080
Okay but it is not true that he has been light then because he has not

6004
08:33:04.080 --> 08:33:08.958
set up for any prison sentence during the time it may stand for okay

6005
08:33:08.958 --> 08:33:11.520
But there is nothing that you have had any thoughts

6006
08:33:11.520 --> 08:33:16.520
around how should I know he is bright okay no yes but I t not say you said

6007
08:33:16.520 --> 08:33:20.040
that it was just suspicion he is not convicted he then he is convicted of something

6008
08:33:20.040 --> 08:33:24.238
If yes it had no knowledge of it but then he has failed a

6009
08:33:24.238 --> 08:33:28.080
imprisonment that is nothing like no it he must stand for no okay

6010
08:33:28.080 --> 08:33:32.558
eh i have not invoked it before but there is one like first draft

6011
08:33:32.558 --> 08:33:38.318
to this telephone emptying pm that starts on page 352 and it is then the same

6012
08:33:38.318 --> 08:33:42.280
then Daniel Strömbäck who has written what was a bit of this that I wrote about

6013
08:33:42.280 --> 08:33:46.558
who wrote this about that you would have had the role of a fixer and it ends at

6014
08:33:46.558 --> 08:33:50.760
Page 355 I can take it up because I think

6015
08:33:50.760 --> 08:33:54.958
also that and Kelisa what defends a little was into the fact that eh there he has

6016
08:33:54.958 --> 08:33:59.520
then made clear then that it is then at your girlfriend's address you connect the evening

6017
08:33:59.520 --> 08:34:02.160
where the day after, so it is not at the shooter's street so that it is

6018
08:34:02.160 --> 08:34:07.318
Significantly yes eh for that task appeared there so it was perhaps where man

6019
08:34:07.318 --> 08:34:09.760
had read

6020
08:34:12.080 --> 08:34:17.840
that but I thought I would show then on page 355 for in general so there is

6021
08:34:17.840 --> 08:34:23.080
all this included in it in the memorandum that you then established but one has not

6022
08:34:23.080 --> 08:34:27.000
brought this task for some reason you thought of this one as we

6023
08:34:27.000 --> 08:34:35.360
talked about just yes exactly eh and partly here then as mentioned now we shall see what mine

6024
08:34:35.360 --> 08:34:40.120
there eh 1828 there then

6025
08:34:40.120 --> 08:34:46.520
so you point to then that there should be some kind of transfer then to this

6026
08:34:46.520 --> 08:34:51.958
Robin etc. What is it for the transfer it is

6027
08:34:51.958 --> 08:34:57.840
a money transfer have you made it yeah okay why then it has not

6028
08:34:57.840 --> 08:35:01.160
The suspicion of doing I have sent money to a friend no okay

6029
08:35:01.160 --> 08:35:05.600
eh and has it been like to help him for him as well as

6030
08:35:05.600 --> 08:35:09.600
able to keep staying away abroad somehow absolutely not no

6031
08:35:09.600 --> 08:35:15.000
no okay eh it should apparently be then SEK 6400

6032
08:35:15.000 --> 08:35:17.840
Like you

6033
08:35:17.958 --> 08:35:25.160
In addition okay yes what what does it concern it is money that I sent over to one

6034
08:35:25.160 --> 08:35:30.398
friend okay and then then at 1855 then so

6035
08:35:30.398 --> 08:35:36.040
Should you then have sent through Snapchat then as a receipt on this transaction

6036
08:35:36.040 --> 08:35:39.440
Yes it is so that he should be able to take out the money he needs a

6037
08:35:39.440 --> 08:35:42.760
confirmation number to withdraw the money yes okay so it still is to him

6038
08:35:42.760 --> 08:35:46.238
It is not like to show to someone else that you have sent over

6039
08:35:46.238 --> 08:35:51.920
money to Robin without no okay it is still then to him as you

6040
08:35:51.920 --> 08:35:57.120
writes it yes okay but you have nothing whatsoever

6041
08:35:57.120 --> 08:36:03.440
Consulting you claim with this network at all absolutely no no

6042
08:36:03.440 --> 08:36:06.440

6045
08:36:18.520 --> 08:36:23.958

6061
08:37:36.558 --> 08:37:43.718
You are oop to be heard as a observation around October 56, 2023 the night there tell

6062
08:37:43.718 --> 08:37:52.958
what do you remember from that days yes eh i mens that we were awakened in the night

6063
08:37:52.958 --> 08:37:59.120
Therefore the dogs we poured the two -storey apartment so they sleep the dogs

6064
08:37:59.120 --> 08:38:06.200
sleeping down in front of the window so they saw someone in front and started pouring a lot

6065
08:38:06.200 --> 08:38:14.520
It is not unusual they pour so hard and so I was spent right away and just said

6066
08:38:14.520 --> 08:38:19.958
Name to the dogs they should calm down sometimes something else but they ft seat

6067
08:38:19.958 --> 08:38:26.360
a lot and my husband went started walking on stairs down and I opened curtain eh

6068
08:38:26.360 --> 08:38:33.398
biner that they should see what is what is in front of the window they see and I saw

6069
08:38:33.398 --> 08:38:42.200
Direct eh We have patio Lit patio and the bushes are in front of the fence so I

6070
08:38:42.200 --> 08:38:49.440
immediately saw a group of people in front of the h eh bush

6071
08:38:49.440 --> 08:38:57.920
the bushes they stand the group so I s right with a man that he g dont go in front of

6072
08:38:57.920 --> 08:39:04.080
the window because we have quite we have close small kitchens and we usually leave

6073
08:39:04.080 --> 08:39:13.160
up a verin in the kitchen so it shines lamp in front of the street we once yes it

6074
08:39:13.160 --> 08:39:16.360
stands a lamp it shines it is pretty good

6075
08:39:16.360 --> 08:39:20.160
illuminated the corner we here like looking in good

6076
08:39:20.160 --> 08:39:26.160
From the outside so I have told him yes a little careful not to go here the window there

6077
08:39:26.160 --> 08:39:31.360
because I see something in front of the window you stand he but he didn't hear that

6078
08:39:31.360 --> 08:39:36.840
he went in front and therefore the dogs poured a lot he tried to calm them down

6079
08:39:36.840 --> 08:39:42.718
And I think the people who were in this group saw the first dogs

6080
08:39:42.718 --> 08:39:48.958
heard the dogs pouring and someone who was also in the other side of the bushes saw

6081
08:39:48.958 --> 08:39:56.000
My husband so he went back at the back eh baked a bit in the house in the kitchen

6082
08:39:56.000 --> 08:40:01.638
that he doesn't see him anymore but I think they noticed each other that he

6083
08:40:01.638 --> 08:40:08.558
told and I look from the second floor up the floor I mean

6084
08:40:08.760 --> 08:40:16.478
one these three or yes I think there were three or four people were in

6085
08:40:16.478 --> 08:40:23.760
the group and one was in the middle so it was a grip and they have something like that eh

6086
08:40:23.760 --> 08:40:34.160
the noise yes one was arrested in the hands mm eh one stands forward I think it was two

6087
08:40:34.160 --> 08:40:41.280
Behind him it is about everything from outside the other side of the bushes so it was

6088
08:40:41.280 --> 08:40:50.120
so there but i from exercises i see them in the groups etc so they have some kind

6089
08:40:50.120 --> 08:40:55.638

6127
08:45:00.238 --> 08:45:06.558
yes they exactly what we looked at the window later also yes we were a bit close and we

6128
08:45:06.558 --> 08:45:10.398
calmed the kids too they just awakened by the dogs

6129
08:45:10.398 --> 08:45:18.238
eh later also saw one i think two people passed by like this with mask etc.

6130
08:45:18.238 --> 08:45:23.920
So after type half hour maybe or quarter

6131
08:45:23.920 --> 08:45:33.200
mm mm just the two just passed by we had an eh point in front of our house middle

6132
08:45:33.200 --> 08:45:40.160
Two with are one point so they came from this point up in the hill Ängen mean

6133
08:45:40.160 --> 08:45:49.080
i kind of gray just grass etc. since they got from there just up the hill and walked toward

6134
08:45:49.080 --> 08:45:56.160
Gatus side also just calm and no noise like that etc. Okay where it was

6135
08:45:56.160 --> 08:46:02.478
the same, like people who had been there before it is hard to say but believe

6136
08:46:02.478 --> 08:46:09.238
that no no it may be reaching the same bunch maybe but no it is ok different

6137
08:46:09.238 --> 08:46:15.680
people eh and you said you called the police directly eh and then I thought

6138
08:46:15.680 --> 08:46:20.478
just ask you about this by time I understand that it is difficult

6139
08:46:20.478 --> 08:46:25.120
To estimate approximately when do these observations you said at two now when

6140
08:46:25.120 --> 08:46:30.318
I asked you about mm eh I thought in in interrogation that is held

6141
08:46:30.318 --> 08:46:35.280
With you starting on page 211 mm so you have been asked and this hearing

6142
08:46:35.280 --> 08:46:40.478

6143
08:46:40.478 --> 08:46:48.360
just comut eh and then the very last question in this for on page 212 when is

6144
08:46:48.360 --> 08:46:51.318
What you call the police I think it was

6145
08:46:51.318 --> 08:46:59.398
0050 okay yeah right in at one o'clock it could be a two it handed yes okay but

Do you think you remember better yes there and then around what time this was

6147
08:47:03.080 --> 08:47:08.558

We well leave the word to the prosecutor please, etc. Thanks Hello Sanna you shall after all

6187
08:51:43.398 --> 08:51:49.200
heard about observation the night between October 5 and 6th what do you remember

6188
08:51:49.200 --> 08:51:55.360
Eh I remember that I was either that I tried to sleep or that

6189
08:51:55.360 --> 08:51:58.478
I sat and looked at the cellphone something during the night

6190
08:51:58.478 --> 08:52:05.718
eh and then eh it is very responsive from the stairwell so i heard lots of sounds

6191
08:52:05.718 --> 08:52:11.120
eh like there was someone who ran like in the stairwell up and down m eh

6192
08:52:11.120 --> 08:52:16.238
pretty much okay at about what time was this

6193
08:52:16.638 --> 08:52:22.200
eh didn't really remember but I might think it was maybe a two

6194
08:52:22.200 --> 08:52:30.160
something mm okay and if you describe this then the sound or what are you hear

6195
08:52:30.160 --> 08:52:33.238
Like you can be able to explain in any way

6196
08:52:33.238 --> 08:52:42.920
Ehm yes or so I heard sounds like someone hit in like eh metal railing in

6197
08:52:42.920 --> 08:52:49.840
the stairwell mm ehm for it hears very very high eh in the apartment

6198
08:52:49.840 --> 08:52:57.040
eh so I had a lot of things so lots of times eh eh so then

6199
08:52:57.040 --> 08:53:00.718
yes i thought about it

6200
08:53:00.920 --> 08:53:05.718
Eh and perhaps hard as well but what

6201
08:53:05.718 --> 08:53:08.718
did you think about this

6202
08:53:08.760 --> 08:53:14.558
Eh yes so I didn't think very much because it still happens

6203
08:53:14.558 --> 08:53:20.280
relatively often that I hear things eh because it is so heard eh but I

6204
08:53:20.280 --> 08:53:24.680
Still thought it was a bit strange because it was eh it was a

6205
08:53:24.680 --> 08:53:31.440
Thursday eh and thus a Thursday at night does not usually happen

6206
08:53:31.440 --> 08:53:35.600
eh so i thought it was a bit strange so then

6207
08:53:35.600 --> 08:53:41.878
Eh so like this yes but i kept like listening eh if there comes more sound

6208
08:53:41.878 --> 08:53:49.840
Mm and so okay and how long it went on as eh has no idea no okay can you

6209
08:53:49.840 --> 08:53:53.360
appreciate [music]

6210
08:53:53.360 --> 08:53:59.680
ehm not really no no okay and now have you described it like what you hear sound

6211
08:53:59.680 --> 08:54:05.200
from it is like from the stairwell and the railing exactly have you have you perceived

6212
08:54:05.200 --> 08:54:12.360
Like sounding can come from something else anywhere else eh no no

6213
08:54:12.680 --> 08:54:17.000
Eh then I would like to read a little from a hearing that held with you will

6214
08:54:17.000 --> 08:54:20.160
Remember that you heard you yes 6th October

6215
08:54:20.160 --> 08:54:24.920
Eh, that is, there in the morning at 1048 mm

6216
08:54:24.920 --> 08:54:30.680
and it starts on page 215 Eh and it is recorded then a little different you have

6217
08:54:30.680 --> 08:54:34.920
partly then described this as you have sound in the stairs but you also have

6218
08:54:34.920 --> 08:54:37.760
described a different sound and I then thought for the guilt of clarity and read it

6219
08:54:37.760 --> 08:54:42.160
also and the first question then it was heard or seen I heard when I

6220
08:54:42.160 --> 08:54:45.318
would sleep so it hears that someone ran up and down the stairs and dragged

6221
08:54:45.318 --> 08:54:48.840
up on something I heard something that knocked out of the top type on the floor maybe

6222
08:54:48.840 --> 08:54:56.718
Neighbor above us yes eh i don't remember it but m my possible

6223
08:54:56.718 --> 08:55:02.680
eh and so what it sounded like they stamped etc. and I interpret that as to

6224
08:55:02.680 --> 08:55:06.840
Then you kind of tell you as if the neighbor that is what you have heard just above then

6225
08:55:06.840 --> 08:55:13.160
Yes eh but is it something you remember now when i eh don't remember no for late

6226
08:55:13.160 --> 08:55:15.798
So if you continue, it was in conjunction with someone running in

6227
08:55:15.798 --> 08:55:19.718
The stairwell the stairwell was a minute after so you still describe that

6228
08:55:19.718 --> 08:55:24.280
You have heard a sound in the stairwell in this company that you describe here today

6229
08:55:24.280 --> 08:55:28.080
But this with the neighbor you don't remember that you harju from there no that

6230
08:55:28.080 --> 08:55:33.318
happens so often that mm eh then perceived you here today then as

6231
08:55:33.318 --> 08:55:39.600
that so that you might be at a two -time mm and in this company so stands

6232
08:55:39.600 --> 08:55:44.120
he signed when you get to ask then about what time was this

6233
08:55:44.120 --> 08:55:50.000
between 24 o'clock and 0030 okay yes eh there is also a lot

6234
08:55:50.000 --> 08:55:56.040
possible as I said I just appreciated the time but do you think you were better

6235
08:55:56.040 --> 08:56:02.520
Appreciate the time there then October 6 than you are here today

6236
08:56:05.040 --> 08:56:12.000
Eh i also asked about how long you heard this eh and then on

6237
08:56:12.000 --> 08:56:17.200
last page then in this hearing 2016 so there is something to add everything

6238
08:56:17.200 --> 08:56:23.398
happens in a short time maybe 15 minutes and then it was quiet mm it can

6239
08:56:23.398 --> 08:56:30.280
tuning yes very possible yes okay then i have no more questions to

6240
08:56:30.280 --> 08:56:36.360
you thanks it is someone else who wants to ask questions yes the sound in the stairwell that

6241
08:56:36.360 --> 08:56:39.520
that ran up and down sounded like one or

6242
08:56:39.520 --> 08:56:47.478
several i can't answer that no for in the same interrogation as the prosecutor read up

6243
08:56:47.478 --> 08:56:54.160
UR so you asked you sounded like it was one or more who ran and

6244
08:56:54.160 --> 08:57:03.160
And then you have answered it sounded like a mm can be right yes okay

6245
08:57:04.318 --> 08:57:11.878
t mm questions no no question thanks then is brought with you completed

6246
08:57:12.398 --> 08:57:18.398
Thank you correctly the prosecutor thanks hi esm all hello you you should not feel that

6247
08:57:18.398 --> 08:57:22.040
there is some homework interview and that you have to answer and remember everything without where

6248
08:57:22.040 --> 08:57:25.600
clear if there is something you do not remember or if it is uncertain about and is

6249
08:57:25.600 --> 08:57:28.520
that something I think is very important that you have told you

6250
08:57:28.520 --> 08:57:32.760
any interrogation in any context that you do not mention or that deviates on something

6251
08:57:32.760 --> 08:57:38.558
Put so I will read from the interrogations and then you may respond to it etc.

6252
08:57:38.558 --> 08:57:43.440
Eh but this is an event at night between the 5th and October 6 that

6253
08:57:43.440 --> 08:57:49.238
I want to hear you a little about yes a little different observations can you tell us what

6254
08:57:49.238 --> 08:57:57.238

08:57:57.238 --> 08:58:03.920
I have been in town eh met friends

08:58:03.920 --> 08:58:10.878
from the education that I go and it has been a very nice evening eh

6257
08:58:10.878 --> 08:58:16.600
The last commuter train home has gone so I take the bus instead

6258
08:58:16.600 --> 08:58:24.160
eh it is also a pretty eh cold evening earlier so autumn has been very eh

6259
08:58:24.160 --> 08:58:27.638
gentle and warm eh but this is a really cold evening and i l a little clothes

6260
08:58:27.638 --> 08:58:33.558
on me so that I decide to take a shortcut home and

6261
08:58:33.558 --> 08:58:39.120
eh eh on the road there so

6262
08:58:39.120 --> 08:58:44.318
Eh i go fast i listen to a pod eh just want to come home as fast as

6263
08:58:44.318 --> 08:58:51.878
possible eh and so is an eh person approaching and i think i

6264
08:58:51.878 --> 08:58:59.120
Should eh just ignore and go by because it feels a bit shady so late at night

6265
08:58:59.120 --> 08:59:04.638
But this person stands up and continues to talk to me eh and I have

6266
08:59:04.638 --> 08:59:10.360
after all not because I have headphones so that eh I take off my headphones eh and hear

6267
08:59:10.360 --> 08:59:15.600
what the person says eh and then I see that it is a one

6268
08:59:15.600 --> 08:59:23.000
very young person who is beaten eh he is dirty in the face he has

6269
08:59:23.000 --> 08:59:28.718
swollen and cracked a lip and jacket is broken so that it likes out

6270
08:59:28.718 --> 08:59:35.558
padding out of the jacket eh and he tells me he has been robbed

6271
08:59:35.558 --> 08:59:41.798
eh and eh got rid of their mobile phone wonder if he can borrow my mobile phone

6272
08:59:41.798 --> 08:59:48.000
And call a friend eh and so he also tells him he has been knife cut

6273
08:59:48.000 --> 08:59:55.000
and showing up eh his hand which is completely red and bloody eh and

6274
08:59:55.000 --> 09:00:01.280
Then I ask about eh eh we really should call a friend should

6275
09:00:01.280 --> 09:00:05.718
we don't call the ambulance instead prime.se eh I would like to call a

6276
09:00:05.718 --> 09:00:12.280
ambulance eh but eh then he tells me that eh he

6277
09:00:12.280 --> 09:00:16.040
does not want to call an ambulance because he has escaped from an HVB home

6278
09:00:16.040 --> 09:00:24.360
ehm and quite early in the conversation there he says he has made eh bad

6279

Choice in life eh and eh are trouble and need help eh eh and that he

6280
09:00:33.878 --> 09:00:40.120
need to call a friend for and get help getting away from the place

6281
09:00:40.280 --> 09:00:45.520
eh and I understand that there is something pretty

6282
09:00:45.520 --> 09:00:53.080
scary with this situation but eh i really see an eh young

6283
09:00:53.080 --> 09:00:57.718
guy who needs help eh so he can borrow my phone and he gets too

6284
09:00:57.718 --> 09:01:02.840
Lov to download Snapchat on the phone

6285
09:01:02.840 --> 09:01:11.160
eh and he does and he calls his eh mate i sit a little bit away from that

6286
09:01:11.160 --> 09:01:16.318
Is there such a blue box when you have sand

6287
09:01:23.958 --> 09:01:28.360
in a chat group eh and try to get hold of someone who can help

6288
09:01:28.360 --> 09:01:31.798
eh and

6289
09:01:32.600 --> 09:01:38.200
Eh i think eh that i have been told already in the first call when i am carried

6290
09:01:38.200 --> 09:01:43.120
talk to him that eh that he has taken on to light a fire on a mailbox

6291
09:01:43.120 --> 09:01:48.478
or it sounds pretty innocent eh but in

6292
09:01:48.478 --> 09:01:52.840
eh conversation with the friend so it appears that

6293
09:01:52.840 --> 09:02:00.878
eh he eh shall light fire on an eh stairwell and

6294
09:02:00.878 --> 09:02:07.760
ehm eh that he eh when he was there eh he

6295
09:02:07.760 --> 09:02:12.760
had been given the task of pouring gasoline into a mailbox and turns on but when he

6296
09:02:12.760 --> 09:02:18.718
is in the stairwell so eh there are no letterboxes on

6297
09:02:18.718 --> 09:02:24.718
the doors eh and then he doesn't really know what to do and get eh stressed

6298
09:02:24.718 --> 09:02:29.360
and get from there eh he has also been discovered on

6299
09:02:29.360 --> 09:02:35.478
The road to this stairwell EH and EH has been beaten

6300
09:02:35.478 --> 09:02:44.000
ehm and eh managed to scare away eh those who

6301
09:02:44.000 --> 09:02:48.520
attacked him eh and then

6302
09:02:48.520 --> 09:02:56.520
eh when he decides not to light fire eh and is on his way away from

6303
09:02:56.520 --> 09:03:03.280
the stairwell he gets hounded again and eh extracted in the forest

6304
09:03:03.280 --> 09:03:14.478
ehm and for me it sounds like eh a real torture scene where he gets

6305
09:03:14.478 --> 09:03:21.520
eh beaten and carved with knife eh and he tells

6306
09:03:21.520 --> 09:03:26.878
eh his friend that he lies in a fetal position on the ground eh and that they

6307
09:03:26.878 --> 09:03:34.318
chop him eh and at the same time so is like tough and brave and should joke about

6308
09:03:34.318 --> 09:03:41.080
that he was chopped in the ham and that his attacker was so damn bad for

6309
09:03:41.080 --> 09:03:47.318
that they had such a bad knife eh that he is not getting more injured

6310
09:03:47.520 --> 09:03:53.958
eh but also that eh only reason for the other

6311
09:03:53.958 --> 09:04:00.000
The abuse is interrupted in the fact that eh aina nearby so that there is one one

6312
09:04:00.000 --> 09:04:06.638
Police car that happens to be there and then eh becomes his

6313
09:04:06.638 --> 09:04:11.000
attackers rescue and get out of there

6314
09:04:11.160 --> 09:04:20.440
eh in in this call so eh asks the friend v what happens to everyone

6315
09:04:20.440 --> 09:04:24.718
stuff eh and eh then Sebastian replies that he

6316
09:04:24.718 --> 09:04:29.080
He left everything on the scene

6317
09:04:29.120 --> 09:04:34.000
ehm and the friend asking again this way what happens to the tab

6318
09:04:34.000 --> 09:04:39.478
eh and eh sebastian save a little avoidance but but that he has not with

6319
09:04:39.478 --> 09:04:45.478
themselves something eh and so they talk about who can

6320
09:04:45.478 --> 09:04:51.760
eh come and help and give reach Skjuss away from eh if they are to order

6321
09:04:51.760 --> 09:04:57.360
a taxi or how to do and it is eh very clear that Sebastian not

6322
09:04:57.360 --> 09:05:03.840
know where he is somewhere eh so the friend suggests he should share

6323
09:05:03.840 --> 09:05:11.920
its position in this chat eh and just to have heard this is after all

6324
09:05:11.920 --> 09:05:17.878
Pretty dumb for me but but also knows that there are armed

6325
09:05:17.878 --> 09:05:20.600
people nearby who might be looking for

6326
09:05:20.600 --> 09:05:29.280
him and eh that may have taken over his eh gun and eh we stand

6327
09:05:29.280 --> 09:05:37.040
very exposed it is a clearly illuminated place next to a road and I

6328
09:05:37.040 --> 09:05:40.878
think we are very vulnerable where we stand

6329
09:05:40.878 --> 09:05:48.200
eh so i say eh i have to go home eh i feel i can't be left

6330
09:05:48.200 --> 09:05:54.520
in that place eh and I offer him to accompany eh because I feel that

6331
09:05:54.520 --> 09:06:01.760
he is eh really is in danger and that he has had incredible turn as eh has

6332
09:06:01.760 --> 09:06:06.200
survived this situation he has been in

6333
09:06:06.280 --> 09:06:12.360
eh and eh i also ask if it feels okay

6334
09:06:12.360 --> 09:06:15.200
that we take this shortcut up through the forest

6335
09:06:15.200 --> 09:06:20.438
eh considering that he has just been beaten in a forest so feel it feels

6336
09:06:20.438 --> 09:06:24.520
ok to go here it's a little dark eh but it's okay

6337
09:06:24.520 --> 09:06:30.520
and ehm during that walk so he tells

6338
09:06:30.520 --> 09:06:35.122
a little more for me because he understands that I have heard so he fills in eh and

6339
09:06:35.122 --> 09:06:40.238
tells me that eh this gun they talked about that it is a soft ergan it

6340
09:06:40.238 --> 09:06:45.160
is not a real gun ehm and that he

6341
09:06:45.160 --> 09:06:52.520
EH would receive 15,000 for eh this assignment to light electricity on the stairwell

6342
09:06:52.520 --> 09:06:57.320
and i say it was terribly dt

6343
09:06:57.320 --> 09:07:02.520
done and eh eh also comment on something that

6344
09:07:02.520 --> 09:07:06.278
It was quite a bit of money for such a mission

6345
09:07:06.278 --> 09:07:11.040
ehm we we go up for this rather steep hill and

6346
09:07:11.040 --> 09:07:17.320
eh i notice he is in pain he has quite hard to go

6347
09:07:17.320 --> 09:07:22.438
eh but eh we get home to me

6348
09:07:22.438 --> 09:07:30.480
eh and there eh ehm so he sits in an armchair

6349
09:07:30.480 --> 09:07:36.960
eh and eh i live in a pretty small apartment

6350
09:07:36.960 --> 09:07:42.438
eh with like a single room only with kitchenette in the room so I stand

6351
09:07:42.438 --> 09:07:46.840
and dishes eh for having something to do and

6352
09:07:46.840 --> 09:07:52.960
standing with his back to him eh while eh he continues to

6353
09:07:52.960 --> 09:07:59.200
Talk to his buddy and eh buddy seems pretty lethargic does not give

6354
09:07:59.200 --> 09:08:02.480
so much response or do not know

6355
09:08:02.480 --> 09:08:06.878
really what he is going to do eh and

6356
09:08:06.878 --> 09:08:11.438
eh Sebastian becomes more and more frustrated over

6357
09:08:11.438 --> 09:08:17.238
eh that he does not get any help and that it is like not answering

6358
09:08:17.238 --> 09:08:25.558
eh he says this is all spaming everyone in the group eh and even then eh spamma

6359
09:08:25.558 --> 09:08:32.680
any person called eh kill all the spamma spamma spamma spamma kill all

6360
09:08:32.680 --> 09:08:37.078
so spammy eh and they

6361
09:08:37.078 --> 09:08:40.918
eh reason about where he can go

6362
09:08:40.918 --> 09:08:46.398
and you can find somewhere eh eh where he can

6363
09:08:46.398 --> 09:08:57.640
go eh and after a while so eh can be interrupted by the call and Sebastian is allowed to borrow mine

6364
09:08:57.640 --> 09:09:04.918
first aid box eh go into the bathroom and eh flim about eh and

6365
09:09:04.918 --> 09:09:10.960
After a while he also asks for help and eh eh and I get to come in and

6366
09:09:10.960 --> 09:09:15.122
help and eh wash wounds and change them

6367
09:09:15.122 --> 09:09:22.680
eh and and it is then as I ask him what he eh if he wants to say what

6368
09:09:22.680 --> 09:09:27.040
His name is in the first name man eh say his name is Sebbe and I tell you what I

6369
09:09:27.040 --> 09:09:29.200
called

6370
09:09:30.360 --> 09:09:35.598
ehm and then as I remember it, there is a little shorter a little shorter

6371
09:09:35.598 --> 09:09:43.238
conversation with the friend after the eh but eh Sebastian is increasingly stated eh and

6372
09:09:43.238 --> 09:09:49.480
and that call ends eh and he says he is not feeling well

6373
09:09:49.480 --> 09:09:54.000
eh asks if you get allowed and lie down in my bed

6374
09:09:54.000 --> 09:10:00.278
and he gets that eh but he seems

6375
09:10:00.278 --> 09:10:05.800
have eh hard and be able to lie down without hurting

6376
09:10:05.800 --> 09:10:11.878
eh a lot and also gets very stressed by that he eh it bleed through

6377
09:10:11.878 --> 09:10:17.598
this eh band he has put on eh so there will be blood in bed and blood on

6378
09:10:17.598 --> 09:10:24.040
the sheets eh and eh he got in the armchair

6379
09:10:24.040 --> 09:10:32.200
again and is quite white and shakes throughout the body

6380
09:10:32.200 --> 09:10:38.918
and eh says he freezes very much so i eh take my my quilt

6381
09:10:38.918 --> 09:10:44.398
and put about him eh and talk to him eh

6382
09:10:44.398 --> 09:10:48.480
eh pick up alvedon

6383
09:10:48.480 --> 09:10:54.278
eh and so I ask again if we should not call an ambulance

6384
09:10:54.278 --> 09:11:00.640
ehm and that it is enough that

6385
09:11:00.640 --> 09:11:09.360
that he would need help with with these knife the injuries he has

6386
09:11:09.520 --> 09:11:13.878
Ehm so

6387
09:11:13.878 --> 09:11:22.640
eh yes we talk a little eh forward back and he says that if we call a

6388
09:11:22.640 --> 09:11:29.000
ambulance he will end up on sis and and he does not want to and he he is

6389
09:11:29.000 --> 09:11:37.238
sorry about that ehm eh but it is still he who takes eh

6390
09:11:37.238 --> 09:11:44.160
the phone in the end and calls eating two eh and

6391
09:11:44.160 --> 09:11:49.438
eh they get to hear the same story he first told me that he has

6392
09:11:49.438 --> 09:11:55.398
become eh robbed and eh knife cut

6393
09:11:55.398 --> 09:12:00.480
ehm but to eh

6394
09:12:00.480 --> 09:12:06.122
eh during that call it is a fairly long conversation with 1 t

6395
09:12:06.122 --> 09:12:12.200
eh like ehm yes then they will inform us about

6396
09:12:12.200 --> 09:12:18.200
that eh it is not only ambulance personnel coming but there will also police

6397
09:12:18.200 --> 09:12:26.160
ehm and in eh after eh the first call

6398
09:12:26.160 --> 09:12:32.718
with t two has finished eh so we just sit and wait and eh

6399
09:12:32.718 --> 09:12:38.800
We talk to each other eh and I notice that Sebastian has a lot of anxiety

6400
09:12:38.800 --> 09:12:43.840
eh and i feel

6401
09:12:43.840 --> 09:12:48.840
Ehm i feel very much empathy for him eh

6402
09:12:48.840 --> 09:12:51.840
eh

6403
09:12:52.122 --> 09:12:57.360
and trying to calm and eh

6404
09:12:57.360 --> 09:13:05.238
eh tell him that eh i have also made shit stupid things in life eh

6405
09:13:05.238 --> 09:13:08.398
and my life was pretty tangled too when i was 16

6406
09:13:08.398 --> 09:13:16.238
ehm but i wish so sincerely he won't let this event

6407
09:13:16.238 --> 09:13:24.800
define how life will be in the future without him choosing a good path in life eh for

6408
09:13:24.800 --> 09:13:30.480
that I met a delicious guy eh that I really want it to go

6409
09:13:30.480 --> 09:13:32.598
Good

6410
09:13:32.960 --> 09:13:41.200
because so eh yes and then eh actually rings 112

6411
09:13:41.200 --> 09:13:46.238
up again because they have a hard time finding my apartment eh so I get to guide

6412
09:13:46.238 --> 09:13:52.040
the police to traites but then they have just found l I open and let in

6413
09:13:52.040 --> 09:13:57.200
them mm about what time was it like you

6414
09:13:57.200 --> 09:14:00.718
bumped on him you said that the last commuter tag had gone so you were allowed

6415
09:14:00.718 --> 09:14:04.278
to ride the bus you have any idea what time it was yes

6416
09:14:04.278 --> 09:14:12.000
Eh i have looked up that eh eh 10 in one so the bus went from

6417
09:14:12.000 --> 09:14:18.598
Civic site and eh it was a bit late then so i think it was 20 over

6418
09:14:18.598 --> 09:14:24.520
an approximate mm and then it was like relatively in

6419
09:14:24.520 --> 09:14:27.680
the near -time to you stepped off this bus that you met on him where I know after all

6420
09:14:27.680 --> 09:14:31.078
not really like this where it stops you described any shortcut you went and so on

6421
09:14:31.078 --> 09:14:36.520
Yes but just ehm it stays on the other side of the trail over here

6422
09:14:36.520 --> 09:14:43.278
Eh so then you have to go in a subway underneath and then past the commuter train eh and

6423
09:14:43.278 --> 09:14:52.680
away on the back of the eh that block with eh ica maxi and lidel and so eh but it

6424
09:14:52.680 --> 09:14:58.558
Don't be many minutes afterwards you tr on a maximum of five minutes

6425
09:14:59.960 --> 09:15:05.640
Mm eh and where somewhere in an approximately

6426
09:15:05.640 --> 09:15:10.598
was what you met on him you remember that yes

6427
09:15:10.598 --> 09:15:17.840
Eh it is eh i think it's named ebb boat square eh so it this street outside

6428
09:15:17.840 --> 09:15:25.960
the house and so exactly eh it is between a deserted plot eh with building fence around

6429
09:15:25.960 --> 09:15:33.718
around eh and eh a newly built house with red plaster so we

6430
09:15:33.718 --> 09:15:37.960
right at the crossing point there mm and how would you describe his

6431
09:15:37.960 --> 09:15:44.360
state of mind when you hit him eh up in turns

6432
09:15:44.360 --> 09:15:47.960
Quite focused

6433
09:15:48.438 --> 09:15:57.200
ehm and so eh somehow confident that he he

6434
09:15:57.200 --> 09:16:02.558
thought he would get help from me and very open to telling you what

6435
09:16:02.558 --> 09:16:08.918
that had happened etc. and you described there several different calls as here from your

6436
09:16:08.918 --> 09:16:12.840
phone then to any friend it was the same friend as one called all the time

6437
09:16:12.840 --> 09:16:17.320
Or were the different friends I perceive as it was the same voice

6438
09:16:17.320 --> 09:16:23.278
All the time mm and one of the conversations I perceived as was except there

6439
09:16:23.278 --> 09:16:29.558
Still yes eh and you said that you you heard him

6440
09:16:29.558 --> 09:16:34.840
say something about some mistake that it is the friend ask about it yes and how

6441
09:16:34.840 --> 09:16:38.758
do you perceive it when it came to talk between you and Sebastian when you were talking

6442
09:16:38.758 --> 09:16:45.640
about what I actually did not attach so much to it without me eh I got it

6443
09:16:45.640 --> 09:16:51.078
here the explanation that it was a soft airgun gun etc.

6444
09:16:51.078 --> 09:16:55.078
Eh and and

6445
09:16:55.758 --> 09:17:01.840
eh yes, probably didn't know if it was or was anything else but

6446
09:17:01.840 --> 09:17:07.360
Eh i was in that situation just focused on we needed to get in

6447
09:17:07.360 --> 09:17:12.360
indoors that it was dangerous for us to stay out

6448
09:17:12.360 --> 09:17:18.278
mm he said something more about these then the people who had encountered him

6449
09:17:18.278 --> 09:17:24.438
So what their agenda was was to rob him on this phone or

6450
09:17:24.438 --> 09:17:31.758
Eh I rather think they were wondering what he was doing there okay he said something about

6451
09:17:31.758 --> 09:17:38.800
that eh i asked

6452
09:17:43.200 --> 09:17:49.520
not eh i was going to read one piece then

6453
09:17:49.520 --> 09:17:56.878

6454
09:17:56.878 --> 09:18:06.320
6 October then there at night at 0 335 mm eh and then you ask this about this

6455
09:18:06.918 --> 09:18:12.758
If said what he has said to you and then you get a question quite high up on the page

6456
09:18:12.758 --> 09:18:18.078
204 he said something more then it says that yes he was afraid he

6457
09:18:18.078 --> 09:18:21.718
finished too much they tried to squeeze him

6458
09:18:21.718 --> 09:18:28.960
mm and I think that is eh under the second abuse eh it

6459
09:18:28.960 --> 09:18:36.680
Second abuse etc. When he was drawn in in the forest mm eh and eh as I

6460
09:18:36.680 --> 09:18:40.480
perceived torture him for him to reveal who is his

6461
09:18:40.480 --> 09:18:45.718
client eh and he he tells his friend at

6462
09:18:45.718 --> 09:18:52.278
telephone that he has revealed that the name of the client begins at J MM and

6463
09:18:52.278 --> 09:18:56.480
He ask his friend if the friend thinks that is enough

6464
09:18:56.480 --> 09:19:01.878
information for the client to want to murder him

6465
09:19:01.878 --> 09:19:07.758
