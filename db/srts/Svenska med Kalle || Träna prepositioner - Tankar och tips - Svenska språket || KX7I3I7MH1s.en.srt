00:00:01,725 --> 00:00:02.725
Hello

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:06.115
I was going to talk a little about

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:08.695
how to learn and

4
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:11,255
Exercise on prepositions

5
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:14,805
Pretty many ask about prepositions

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,315
in Swedish

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,900
and thinks it's hard

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,440
so my first tip

9
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:25.525
And the most important thing I think is to

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,765
Learn prepositions

11
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:30,515
in ordinary phrases

12
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:34,485
So I think it's

13
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:37.565
wasted time, I don't think you win on

14
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:40,465
to try to learn some kind of rules

15
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:43,925
For all the rules have exceptions

16
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,035
and there are none

17
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49.555
Clear rules for how prepositions

18
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:51,735
will be used

19
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:55.605
in different types of sentences and phrases

20
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:58.455
There are no determined rules

21
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:01.715
For how prepositions are to be used

22
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,735
they do not have such a definite meaning

23
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:07.415
so start step by step to

24
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:10,425
learn them in regular phrases

25
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:12.055
As you often need

26
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:15,495
so it can be good to start with

27
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:18,495
stuff you might say quite often

28
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,975
As I study at SFI

29
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:25,005
or I am studying at

30
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:27,945
high school, I go to the movies

31
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:30,605
I am going to party, I go

32
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:31,785
on the toilet

33
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,155
Pretty common sentences so you learn

34
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:38,075
on along with those words, but maybe then

35
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,725
I'm in the shop, I'm

36
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,185
in the center, i'm

37
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:44,395
in school

38
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:48,245
and so on, at the dentist

39
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:49,895
at the doctor

40
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:53.555
so start with the most common

41
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55.535
that you can use frequently
