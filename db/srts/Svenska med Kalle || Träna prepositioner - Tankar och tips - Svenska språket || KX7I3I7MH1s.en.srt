00:00:01,725 --> 00:00:02,725
Hello

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:06,115
I was going to talk a little about

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:08,695
how to learn and

4
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:11,255
Exercise on prepositions

5
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:14,805
Pretty many ask about prepositions

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,315
in Swedish

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,900
and thinks it's hard

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,440
so my first tip

9
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:25,525
And the most important thing I think is to

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,765
Learn prepositions

11
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:30,515
in ordinary phrases

12
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:34,485
So I think it's

13
00:00:34,485 --> 00:00:37,565
wasted time, I don't think you win on

14
00:00:37,565 --> 00:00:40,465
to try to learn some kind of rules

15
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:43,925
For all the rules have exceptions

16
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,035
and there are none

17
00:00:46,555 --> 00:00:49,555
Clear rules for how prepositions

18
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:51,735
will be used

19
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:55,605
in different types of sentences and phrases

20
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:58,455
There are no determined rules

21
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:01,715
For how prepositions are to be used

22
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:04,735
they do not have such a definite meaning

23
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:07,415
so start step by step to

24
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:10,425
learn them in regular phrases

25
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:12,055
As you often need

26
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:15,495
so it can be good to start with

27
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:18,495
stuff you might say quite often

28
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,975
As I study at SFI

29
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:25,005
or I am studying at

30
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:27,945
high school, I go to the movies

31
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:30,605
I am going to party, I go

32
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:31,785
on the toilet

33
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,155
Pretty common sentences so you learn

34
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:38,075
on along with those words, but maybe then

35
00:01:38,075 --> 00:01:40,725
I'm in the shop, I'm

36
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,185
in the center, i'm

37
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:44,395
in school

38
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:48,245
and so on, at the dentist

39
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:49,895
at the doctor

40
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:53,555
so start with the most common

41
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,535
that you can use frequently

42
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,215
null

43
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:02,185
And as I already did a little now

44
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:04,385
that you might also be able to take them and like

45
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:07,265
take a few ordinary words

46
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:10,165
As you want to be able to use with the correct preposition

47
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:13,075
and so put them in groups

48
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:16,005
So for example: in town,

49
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:18,425
at party, at the cinema

50
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,915
You may be able to remember some such common ones together

51
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:24,775
and then you can take some

52
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:25,775
in Gothenburg

53
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:29,245
in the center

54
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,545
in, whatever it may be,

55
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:33,725
in the shopping center

56
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:36,825
But it is mostly if it helps you

57
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:39,655
to find, as well as taking some small groups,

58
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:42,755
take a few words and learn together

59
00:02:43,445 --> 00:02:44,445
null

60
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:45,845
yes

61
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:49,455
And what would I say more, yes

62
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:52,585
My feeling is that

63
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:55,415
make some wrong with prepositions

64
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:58,465
or make pretty big errors with prepositions

65
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:01,535
is not such a big problem in many contexts

66
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,005
Many times so

67
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:06,575
so do not do that much because the prepositions

68
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:09,235
not have such a clear, determined

69
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:12,105
meaning, so it won't be so dangerous either

70
00:03:12,105 --> 00:03:13,935
When doing wrong

71
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,995
and because there is

72
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:19,105
a lot of different words and sentences

73
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:22,095
that you should use together with prepositions

74
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:25,335
so it is very difficult to get it right all the time

75
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:28,145
so my tip is to stress not

76
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,875
with it without attempt to think

77
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,865
What are the most common?

78
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:34,865
Which do I want to use

79
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:37,295
very

80
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,275
and learn them first and then

81
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:43,275
Step by step teaches you more and more phrases

82
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:46,155
and sentences with the correct prepositions

83
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:47,995
and don't be like that

84
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,265
worried that it gets wrong sometimes because

85
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:53,385
We still understand

86
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:56,505
and i have friends who have learned

87
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:59,885
Swedish as always makes some mistakes

88
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:03,185
But it doesn't matter that much, of course, it doesn't sound

89
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:06,345
Perfect but it is not difficult to understand either

90
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:08,095
What the person means

91
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:10,275
null

92
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:12,655
and then

93
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:15,705
Exercise by listening, exercising by reading

94
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:19,075
If you think about this movie

95
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,115
thinking about this movie

96
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,855
There you had a preposition

97
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,865
so i use a bunch of prepositions

98
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:29,665
All the time in many of my sentences

99
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,795
So when you listen

100
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:35,805
on when people talk, when you read

101
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:38,645
so be a little attentive

102
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,015
and think about the prepositions and sometimes you can stay up

103
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,475
especially when the usual words

104
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:47,385
and sentences that feel that, this is important

105
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:50,025
stop, think a little to

106
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:52,945
aha, now he used this one

107
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:53,945
preposition

108
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:55,055
null

109
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:58,565
Then, as well as, can

110
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,585
the most common, I can think so that it is

111
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:04,425
Common errors are that you say this:

112
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:06,495
I talk *to, but that sounds weird

113
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:08,695
man say i talk to

114
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:11,895
But if you listen to

115
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:15,045
People talking, so you will hear quite often

116
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:17,965
I was talking to Kalle

117
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:19,485
I talked to Johan

118
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:23,145
And if you are just ...

119
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:26,065
Like ... focus a little on it when you hear it;

120
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:28,405
so will it get stuck by itself

121
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,005
so

122
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,405
Pay attention to prepositions as you read

123
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:36,125
And when you listen, you will automatically

124
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,395
repeat the most common

125
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:40,465
for you will see and hear them often

126
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:43,955
Yes

127
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:47,235
so learn common phrases

128
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,065
Maybe way

129
00:05:49,755 --> 00:05:52,495
those in groups if it helps you

130
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:55,595
to remember, some common examples with on

131
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:58,245
some common examples with in

132
00:05:58,245 --> 00:06:01,045
maybe some common examples with by and for

133
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,795
and don't worry so much

134
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:09,685
Don't stress because it gets wrong with prepositions

135
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,115
and four: Repeat when you listen

136
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:15,775
Repeat as you read

137
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:18,425
Then you come

138
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:22,095
so to say being safer over time

139
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:25,295
just have patience so it will be fine

140
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:29,045
That was my tip about prepositions

141
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,725
Feel free to ask, please discuss, please comment

142
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:36,385
Please read my blog, please check out

143
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:37,795
My second channel

144
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,905
with different films about different subjects

145
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,915
You can listen to which prepositions I

146
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:46,695
using in those movies

147
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:50,345
In those films

148
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:51,345
in

149
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:55,835
I should also remind you that

150
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:58,635
Feel free to press that little bell

have notifications, if you want to be reminded of

153
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:08,085
when i post a new movie because if you don't

154
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:10,765
pressing on the bell so you will not

155
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:14,075
Get a message every time I post a new movie

156
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:17,585
So please do it and

157
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,025
yes

158
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,465
