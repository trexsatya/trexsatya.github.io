1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,160
- Hello! My name is Jael. - My name is Sebastian.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,880
- We will answer some questions about the medical program.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,720
- Here we go!

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,880
- I think you should plug in the medical program,

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,000
For above all, two reasons.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,200
Partly if one is genuinely interested in the human body,

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30.560
And to understand how it works.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,600
And if you have an interest in helping people.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,040
Because that's what we do in the medical role.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,680
- I like to have both the theoretical

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,000
And practical elements in their everyday lives.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,080
And to have a job that is both exciting and varied after graduation.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58.560
During the program you learn how the body works from top to toe.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,160
Then you learn about the most common diseases that affect the body.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07.560
Then you have to be out at the clinics and learn how to practically treat the diseases.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,840
- Then we have another very important part we learn.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,720
Much about patient contact and how to meet patients.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,080
How to make patients feel safe, that we listen to them,

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,320
And that in our role we are there to help them.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,240
You have to be out already from the first semester.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,680
But then it is very short that you are out, just a few days.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,120
Then you are out in primary care, ie at a health center.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,800
Then from semester three you can start to be out in the hospital a little shorter periods.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,600
In semester seven, the majority of the time is in practice.

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,200
- I experienced it as good that you got to be out on internship early, already during semester one.

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,640
So you got to know what it is like to be a doctor and see how it works in practice.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,320
- I agree with you. It was a bit uncomfortable at first.

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05.960
Or you didn't really know what you were doing there and it was very nervous.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,520
What I think is fun about the practice because you feel that the longer I come,

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,880
The more confident in that role you become.

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,160
It is a very fun development I think.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,800
We read everything in blocks.

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,200
You have a theme you read that is constantly returning.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,840
I think that is very good.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,280
Because when you start the program, there is a lot that is new.

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
A little difficult to understand and put things in context. Very new words and such.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,360
Then you notice with the course of time that there will be things that come back.

38
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,320
I very much like to learn things in depth.

39
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,880
I like that it is being built all the time and that there will be a lot of aha experiences.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55.440
It will be like puzzle pieces that are put in place.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,600
- I like that we have some PBL in Örebro, which means problem -based learning.

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,480
Which is to sit in a group of about eight people.

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08.080
You get a case for each week that you then go through.

44
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,760
So you get some time to collect some information.

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,880
Then you discuss this in groups to solve the disease,

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,840
Which you may have read about during that week.

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,840
It is nice to get some interruptions from just sitting and reading in the books.

48
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,880
Sit with your friends in a group and discuss these issues as well.

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,040
New for this year is that the medical program is six years instead of five and a half years.

50
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,800
Which means that after graduation, you do a basic service that is one year.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,520
- After that you specialize. It's about five years.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Then you can work at a health center, the hospital, private or research.

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,440
- You can say that every organ in the body has its own specialty, ie its own doctor.

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,280
Like, for example, the heart that is cardiology.

55
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09.080
After graduation, I want to work with a surgery specialty.

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,280
Preferably where you get the opportunity to work a little pre-hospital.

57
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,600
I was at the ambulance helicopter a few weeks ago and looked.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,360
There I would like to work in the future.

59
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,360
- For those who do not know, what does pre-hospital mean?

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,920
- Pre-hospital means working outside the hospital's walls.

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,800
As with an ambulance for example.

62
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
- I wish I was as safe as you,

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,040
But I actually don't really know what I want to do.

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,600
I was very much in surgery when I started the program.

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,440
But there is a lot that is fun so I have a little trouble deciding.

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,160
- I think that is very nice that we have such a long program.

67
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,160
That you have time to change many times along the way.

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,280
Student life in Örebro begins with three weeks of introduction.

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
Where you get to know new people.

70
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,000
I thought it was great, because I'm not from Örebro from the beginning,

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02.880
Getting to know new people.

72
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,320
- I'm from Örebro from the beginning so I may not have been as involved in student life.

73
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09.640
But I've been on some stuff.

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,200
I know that MFÖ, which is the medical association Örebro,

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,120
They arrange a lot of stuff for medical students.

76
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,800
What is so fun about it is that there will be very good community over the semesters.

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,040
You get to know both elderly courses and those who go younger semesters.

78
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,000
Then you can get a lot of help and tips from elderly courses,

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Which I think has been superb.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,880
- Exactly! I also think MFÖ has been great to be involved in.

81
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,440
That arranges slightly different sessions and we have pub rounds,

82
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Where there is the opportunity to get to know other people on the program.
