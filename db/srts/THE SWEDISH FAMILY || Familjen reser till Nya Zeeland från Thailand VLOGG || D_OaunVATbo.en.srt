1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,520
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,340
We are in...

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,100
New Zealand!

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,120
Yes!

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,360
If you follow our Instagram, then you already know this.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,720
If you watch our channel then you probably know
that we have been in Thailand with TUI.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,060
We have posted several vlogs from there.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,900
We will now bring you along
on our journey from Thailand to New Zealand!

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,580
We are at the airport in Phuket!

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,340
It's a good thing that the kids are in a good mood,
because we have a long journey ahead of us.

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,760
Very long!

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,240
- Yes!
- Rama X...

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,380
Mommy, look. It's Rama X.

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,440
- Who is Rama X?
- The King of Thailand.

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,380
We are bringing lots of bags, as usual.

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,360
I don't really know how it happened, but...
It's our change of clothes.

17
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,340
- Passport and boarding pass, please.
- Yes.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,040
Hey.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,260
Hello.

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,420
Harry, they said "hello". What do you say back?

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,640
- What should I say?
- You can say "hey".

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,480
Hey.

23
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,460
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
- Bye!
- Bye, bye!

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,560
We have now gone through security.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
Yes.

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,580
Our flight from Phuket to Singapore
leaves in one hour, at 2:30 PM.

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,100
And then we are going to...

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,060
New Zealand!

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,920
That's right!

31
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,800
Do you know which city we are going to?

32
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,640
- Auckland.
- Correct.

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,040
Oops!

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,920
Auckie-landie, Auckie-landie...

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,980
Auckie... Auckland.

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,320
How are you feeling?

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,160
I'm good! I'm excited to experience something new.

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,800
- Thailand was a great start to this long trip.
- Yes, indeed!

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,380
- So...
- S...

40
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,560
We both started talking.

41
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,600
- Hey!
- Hey!

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,560
How happy are you with Thailand?

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,680
Goo... goo... goo...

44
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,180
Good!

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,500
That sounds like a good review.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,560
- It was really nice to stay at a resort.
- Mhm.

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,160
Leopard...

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,580
But...

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,940
Alma, go play. Bye, bye.

50
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't know what's with them today!

51
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,300
I think that they are feeling anxious about traveling.

52
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,680
Yes, I think so too. But...

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,000
Hey!

54
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,060
Off you go.

55
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,260
- Leave for a bit, please.
- Go play!

56
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,340
This Kid Zone is quite spartan
in comparison to the hotel we just stayed at.

57
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,400
Yes, indeed.

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,800
- The entire resort was like a Kid Zone!
- Yes.

59
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,460
It was just a bunch of kids running around,
having the best time!

60
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,480
Yes!

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,200
I also want to mention how great it is
to travel during off-season.

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,560
- Yes.
- Isn't it so nice?

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,660
It isn't crowded anywhere, like at the restaurants,
on the sunbeds, or other places like that.

64
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:05,020
Everything goes smoothly. But there are still
lots of other kids there, and good things to do.

65
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
Yes.

66
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,020
- And on some days the beach was almost empty.
- Yes.

67
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,360
- Travel during off-season, if you can.
- Yes.

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,220
- That is our tip!
- It's a good tip.

69
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,980
This flight is only two hours long. 
Me, Alma and Harry are at the very back...

70
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,380
...bouncing around!

71
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,100
Daddy Axel is seated two rows in front of us.

72
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,920
That's right. There he is...

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

74
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,740
What's the matter, my little guy?

75
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,720
I am scared.

76
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,060
Here, hold my hand. Tell me, why are you scared?

77
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,020
The airplane will probably crash.

78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,000
No, no, no... It's only raining, it's nothing dangerous.
They are still able to land.

79
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,500
- They will land on the water.
- No, we will land at the airport.

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes...

81
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,960
- If we don't land on the water...
- No...

82
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,060
- If we land on the water we will get on a boat...
- No, Harry...

83
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,160
...and wear those nasty masks.

84
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,260
We will land at the airport, I promise.
It's just rainy and cloudy outside. Everything is okay.

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,260
- We are almost there!
- Yes!

86
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,560
We have almost arrived at the place we were traveling to.

87
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,900
You were right, we will be landing on land!

88
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,280
- It didn't take that long to get here.
- No.

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,480
It was super close! Alma, we are almost there!

90
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,180
Singapore!

91
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,740
- It felt like that flight went by quickly.
- Very quickly.

92
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Now we have...

93
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,060
...3.5 hours to spend here.
I'm looking at a clock in front of us.

94
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,980
Oh, here comes someone who is in a hurry.

95
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,080
Sorry!

96
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,460
There is the clock, can you see?

97
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,940
It is currently 6:05 PM, local time.

98
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,380
Our flight to Auckland leaves at...

99
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm having trouble speaking, as usual.

100
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
- 9:30 PM.
- Yes!

101
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,700
We have a few hours to...

102
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,300
- Hi, guys! Have a safe flight.
- Thank you!

103
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,480
- Thank you, enjoy!
- Thank you.

104
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,760
To eat and chill.

105
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,780
There...

106
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,760
...some food.

107
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,300
Lots of exciting food!

108
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,640
- Also, one might think we are at a play center.
- Yes.

109
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,140
We are still in Singapore - at Changi Airport.

110
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,180
Does it taste good, Alma?

111
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,180
Very.

112
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,140
Ouch.

113
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,300
It's time to change into something long-legged.

114
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,440
Nice, because it felt like I twisted my foot
coming down this thing.

115
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,360
We just changed clothes, and now we will
check out the stores here at the airport.

116
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,220
- This airport is really big.
- Yes, it's huge!

117
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,540
- There are lots of stores.
- Yes.

118
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,420
We are going to a different terminal
and we have to take a train to get there.

119
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,040
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

120
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,780
- What is it that you are sitting in?
- A wheelchair.

121
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,320
Daddy just bought something very good for the trip!

122
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,620
It might not look that exciting,
but it's for the headphone jack.

123
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,660
It allows you to connect two pairs of headphones.

124
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,040
You can use your headphones...

125
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,500
...and you can use your headphones!

126
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,000
- Good, right?
- That wasn't anything fun.

127
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,980
- It wasn't anything fun?
- It's really fun!

128
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,980
It will be so much fun!

129
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,940
This flight will take nine hours.

130
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,600
Axel and the kids have these three seats, and mine is...

131
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,700
...here.

132
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,000
- We are starting off like this, we might switch later.
- Yes. We are trying something new.

133
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,660
They are getting really tired.

134
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,980
Yes, and they keep picking on each other.
I'm probably going to have to sit between them.

135
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,340
- Guys?
- Yes?

136
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,920
- Could you open this?
- Yeah...

137
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,260
- We can hardly see you, Harry.
- No, that hair...

138
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,780
Mommy? Could you start this for me?

139
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,840
- The braids looked so good when they were just done.
- And now they have like...

140
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,260
- It's a little sad.
- They have loosened up.

141
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,940
You can have new ones done.

142
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,000
Or we could find a cool hairdresser in New Zealand
that can do something cool with your hair, Harry.

143
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:31,480
- Harry, I can't help you put it on now, I can help you later.
- The TV doesn't work right now.

144
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,080
You have to eat some of it.

145
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,560
Hey, hey.

146
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,100
- You guys are talking so loud with your headphones on.
- Yes, but they can't hear anything.

147
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
...have to shout.

148
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,980
The time is 11:30 PM, so I don't think they will eat much.

149
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,260
But it's worth a try.

150
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,760
ONE HOUR LATER

151
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,540
It's hard to find a good sleeping position in these chairs.

152
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,960
There are 2.5 hours left of this flight.

153
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,920
The kids have been sleeping for 4 hours.

154
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,260
To us, the time is 4:30 in the morning.
We went to sleep in the middle of the night.

155
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Well, "went to sleep"...
We passed out for a little while.

156
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,140
- It's very bumpy.
- Yes.

157
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,120
- The entire flight has been bumpy.
- Yes, it has.

158
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,080
WOHO!

159
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,060
- We are in New Zealand!
- Yes!

160
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,480
Local time is 1:30 PM.
We are currently 12 hours ahead of Sweden.

161
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,420
Yes.

162
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,780
- We are as far away as we can get on Earth!
- Yes.

163
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,160
At home the time is currently 1:30 at night.

164
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,220
For us, still on Thailand time, it is early morning.

165
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,580
- Yes, and we have slept very little.
- Yes.

166
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,000
The last bag, they are all here. Amazing!

167
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,500
Yes, you found it. How fun!

168
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,860
Well, it's kind of hot, anyway.

169
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,840
- Yes! It's hot.
- Yes, it's actually nice and hot.

170
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,560
We were prepared to feel cold now.

171
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,740
- Taxi rank.
- Let's take a taxi.

172
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,620
We are on our way to a house
that we have rented in central Auckland.

173
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,180
- Yes!
- Oh God, that's so scary!

174
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,580
- It's so exciting...
- I didn't see you! He did an "Alma".

175
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,180
Oh, God...

176
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,660
- To do an "Alma" you just pop up like that.
- Yes.

177
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,140
Oh, God.

178
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,980
We have arrived!

179
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,500
- Should we take a look inside of the townhouse?
- Yes!

180
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,080
We rent this from a family living abroad.

181
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,740
It's so nice!

182
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,380
We can even use Netflix!

183
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,160
There is a second floor!

184
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,440
- Yes, but let's check out the kitchen and patio first.
- Okay. I'll stay here.

185
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,980
Here we can sit and eat.

186
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,220
Here we can cook our food.

187
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,080
Here is our second floor!

188
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
This is my room!

189
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,860
- You will stay in here?
- Yes, I call dibs on this room.

190
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,900
Harry can sleep in here.

191
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,580
- Harry is having this big bed?
- Yep!

192
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
The bathroom.

193
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,080
Oh... Nice!

194
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,240
Oh, this looks good!

195
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,800
- The image turned yellow.
- Aha!

196
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,820
That's how it is.

197
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,140
Mommy and daddy's bed!

198
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,880
- Here is a little balcony.
- And a mirror.

199
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Wow...

200
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,700
This is super nice... And really hot!

201
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,540
It smells like food, it smells really good!

202
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,080
Yes... I can see that you are hungry,
you didn't really eat much during the flight.

203
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,700
Hey, Harry!

204
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,180
- Do you want to build this with me?
- Yes, we are coming down to build it with you.

205
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,400
Alma and Harry...

206
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,540
We should take out your braids.

207
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,220
No...

208
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,940
They don't look that good anymore.

209
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,940
We have now been here for a few days.

210
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,900
Yes!

211
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,480
The children's braids are gone.

212
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,700
Harry, your smile...

213
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,840
Today's Question of the Day has been asked by a lot of you.

214
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,280
And that is:
"What will you be doing in New Zealand?".

215
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,720
I know!

216
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,100
Travel in an RV for one month!

217
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,900
- Yes!
- That's right!

218
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,440
We will stay in Auckland for a few days,
and then we will travel in the RV that we have rented.

219
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,900
And of course we will be vlogging during our entire trip!

220
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:29,980
Thank you for watching this video!

221
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,860

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,700
