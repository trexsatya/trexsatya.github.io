1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02.560
Also, do not forget to sign up for your exams.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04.560
You have to do that.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,980
It was something I missed.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,500
Hello and welcome to a new section of them call us students.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,600
My name is Dana and with me today I have Indy.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,080
And today we will go through:

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
Things that can be good to know as a new student.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,180
A little practical stuff like this right in the beginning.

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,180
We will talk a little about student services.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,420
We'll talk about what Blackboard is. It will persecute you throughout the education.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,420
And much much more. So hang with it.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,520
But first and foremost, we just want to welcome you all to Örebro University.

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,680
I think, or we think, this will be a fun time for you.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,428
At least it has been for us.

15
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,977
Hope you will be happy.

16
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:41,438
And hope you will find your place here.

17
00:00:41,438 --> 00:00:43,438
It will go great. I think so.

18
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:46,915
As a new student, it is good to know some stuff.

19
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:48.531
And we were going to go through now.

20
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:53.057
But Indy, how much should you actually study at the university?

21
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:56.438
The idea is really that you should plug in 40 hours a week.

22
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58.619
So it really becomes like a full -time job.

23
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:01,377
But it differs quite a lot.

24
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,920
Partly from different programs I can imagine.

25
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:06,710
And then week to week how much you have.

26
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:09,132
Then it is some responsibility too.

27
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:12,406
That you learn what you need to be able to.

28
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,712
As Indy says, you have easy things for different things.

29
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:18,678
And then you can feel:

30
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:23,006
I may have to spend a little more time on this course.

31
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:27,083
Or that I feel that I can handle this without spending those 40 hours.

32
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,680
Exactly, and some weeks maybe you have more.

33
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:34.018
And then maybe you spend 45 hours.

34
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:36,358
And one other week maybe you spend 5 hours.

35
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:38,358
If you are a little lazy.

36
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:41,498
Ok Dana so we have this student services.

37
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:43,778
What is it really?

38
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:46,138
That can be said is the heart of the plug.

39
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:46,638
That's where everything is.

40
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:52.638
There you can look at the syllabus and see study results.

41
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,598
This is where you sign up for the exam.

42
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:58,918
Where you get their scanning exams since after the exam

43
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01.238
So you see your answers.

44
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:06.898
This is also where you get in touch with teachers and staff at the school.

45
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:10,118
If you have any questions or concerns.

46
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:14,878
So everything like this is important and substantially happening there.

47
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,238
It may be good to check what you have placed for e-mail address there.

48
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:22,918
For information from the university being sent to that email.

49
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:25,471
And sometimes these are pretty important things.

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,020
So it can be a good thing to look up like this in the beginning.

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,260
And don't forget to sign up for your exams.

52
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,260
Because you have to do that.

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Because it was something I missed.

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,240
About a month before, you can see that the exam has been scheduled.

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,580
And you also see your schedules that are constantly updated.

56
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,580
And so we have this blackboard that I mentioned in the beginning.

57
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,580
What is that?

58
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,240
Blackboard is where all material is posted.

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,180
All the tasks that the teachers publish.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,040
There is more focus on the courses you read.

61
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:08.463
On Blackboard there is more focus on the courses.

62
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:11,812
So every course you read has its own page on Blackboard.

63
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:15,458
Where teachers put up stuff that you said, lectures and other things.

64
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:19,037
Information to be submitted is also submitted to Blackboard.

65
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:23,457
And sometimes like this in the beginning, it can feel a bit bondy with the studies.

66
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,681
That you do not really find your study technique.

67
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:30,845
It may be difficult to get into the fact that you have your own responsibility.

68
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:34,645
And then there is very good support you can get from the university.

69
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,199
There are usually many good free lectures

70
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:43,519
For example, as the university organizes study technology and stress management.

71
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,774
Which can be good to check if you feel you need it.

72
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:53,492
When you start at the university, it is no wonder that you do not know how it goes.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,400
You can easily feel stress that you feel that you do not keep up.

74
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01.455
But you have to get into it to learn.

75
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:05.959
For example, if you have dyslexia, there is something called Funka.

76
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,270
Which can help you with very good tools in your studies.

77
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,510
For example, you can get programs that read texts.

78
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17.510
So you don't have to read it yourself.

79
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:22,204
So you get help with your studies if you feel you need it.

80
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:25,884
And when you start plugging here you get one here.

81
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,219
A university card.

82
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:33,273
And you use this to access the university's premises on campus, among other things.

83
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:36,633
You use it to borrow books at the University Library.

84
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:42,797
And more how to get one like this can be found at www.oru.se which is the university's website.

85
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:49,313
And something else that is really good when you are in the university area

86
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:52.697
So you have access to free wifi.

87
00:04:53,261 --> 00:05:00.44
The WiFi is called Eduroam and how to connect on it is on the university's website.

88
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:05,486
The good thing about Eduroam is that there are slightly different places around the world.

89
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,880
Because when I was in Spain once, Eduroam appeared.

90
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:16,788
As a new student, it can be difficult to find on campus.

91
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:23,524
Then you can either ask some on campus or download an app called Maze Map.

92
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:35,580
And there can enter the hall you are going to, the app shows where to go somewhere.

93
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,966
Supersmid really.

94
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:47,182
For me who does not read on big campus but on campus usö

95
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:49.818
which is away at the hospital.

96
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,182
But it is also inside the Maze Map.

97
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54.818
So that's good. They have got with everything.

98
00:05:55,363 --> 00:06:00.703
And this also applies to you who are going to study on Campus Grythyttan.

99
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02.703
But Indy where do you usually sit and plug?

100
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:06,222
I am such a real library plugger.

101
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08.767
I can't plug in at home.

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,540
I get so distracted. One goes type and throws the garbage

103
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,994
Put on News Morning and then you lose it completely.

104
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,449
So I usually plug in the bible.

105
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:21,881
But the university is very plug -friendly.

106
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,881
There are a lot of places where you sit.

107
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:27,847
Different benches, tables and group rooms.

108
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:33,783
Actually, there are dedicated plug sites in all buildings on campus.

109
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,419
As it is intended to sit and plug in.

110
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,964
Either yourself or in group.

111
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
So it's super smooth.

112
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:46,352
Then in the middle of the city there is also something called Congrego.

113
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:51,626
And it is also a small building that is dedicated to Örebro University.

114
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:55.561
And there you can also sit and plug.

115
00:06:56,106 --> 00:07:01,366
Then depending on what you are on for a plug humor.

116
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,370
So there are a few different types of plug racks.

117
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,170
For example, if you want to sit in a group and talk a little.

118
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09.715
If you want to "latch plug" a little.

119
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,250
Then you can sit at some table in a corridor only.

120
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:17,904
Then in the library there are also quiet reading places.

121
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,044
If you are easily disrupted and there it should also be completely silent.

122
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,408
So you really get to a good study environment.

123
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:26,653
Then there are slightly different group rooms on campus that you can book.

124
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
We the university's website.

125
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,198
And it is super smooth for group work and the like.

126
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:34,973
If you want to sit in your own room and be undisturbed.

127
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:39,347
And did you know that you can go abroad and plug in a semester.

128
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,893
So -called exchange studies.

129
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,454
I think Örebro University has collaboration with type 150 different

130
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48.809
University around the world.

131
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:53,483
So they have established contact with different universities in the world.

132
00:07:53,938 --> 00:07:57,558
And there are great opportunities for those who want to plug abroad to plug

133
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00.012
At the very place you want.

134
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:03.098
And have you been thinking about plugging abroad

135
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:06.743
so it is good to be a little set already now

136
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:10,958
on how to go about it and check out a bit.

137
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:13,852
This requires some preliminary work.

138
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,579
But there is no stress either.

139
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:22,494
For it comes, among other things, information evenings for those who want to study abroad.

140
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:28,068
For you as a student at Örebro University, there are lots of free activities.

141
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:32,484
Which is organized by the university.

142
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:38.668
Like, for example, various lectures by writers, politicians and so on.

143
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:42.013
As you are super interesting to go on simply.

144
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:44,973
And so there are concerts.

145
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,859
Which the School of Music organizes that you can go on.

146
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,404
Which is super nice.

147
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:56.609
And information about when such lectures take place continuously

148
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:04,124
on Örebro University's website, on message boards and in social media.

149
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,520
So you won't miss it if you hang out on campus or look in your smartphones.

150
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:17,064
And do you as a new student have questions and concerns, which you have certainly

151
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
And it's perfectly understandable.

152
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,840
So you can ask basically anyone.

153
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,980
Those who are older for example. Or your teachers.

154
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
Or your sews.

155
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Then there is also the student center.

156
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,080
You can basically ask anyone and you will be led to the right person.

157
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,140
And don't be afraid to ask questions. For everyone is here to help you.

158
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,200
And it will be much easier if you have all the information.

159
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,100
Ok corner! Hope you have received answers to some questions that you might have.

160
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06.660
Again, congratulations to your admission here.

161
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,780
And hope to see you.

162
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,780
Bye! Bye!
