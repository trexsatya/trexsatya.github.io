1
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:15,137
  Right at the Malmö School of Music is a lot of focus on one's own expression.

2
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:23,650
  There is always a very open atmosphere when you enter the cafe and you can sit with anyone and talk.

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,650
  I enjoy being very, great at the School of Music.

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,143
  I would say that the most fun thing about studying at the Malmö School of Music

5
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:37,597
is to be in an environment where you get to meet so many other musicians.

6
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:46,960
Also to get to know the experience that our teachers have and try to practice it on their instrument.

7
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:57,169
  One can expect great freedom which also comes with a great responsibility.

8
00:00:57,622 --> 00:01:03,220
There are endless opportunities to do an incredible amount.

9
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:26,562
  When I have gone here I have developed in a lot of ways that not only have to do with my instrument,

10
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:31,198
Without a lot, I think I have to do with my maturity as a musician.

11
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:40,644
  My ability to tackle things that I might not before thought that I would be able to do in the way I do now.

12
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:52,529
  An ordinary week is that you come here in the morning and then you go home late at night.

13
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,139
Because you have been here all day and played and practiced.

14
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:01,537
That is what is mostly.
