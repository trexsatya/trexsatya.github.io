1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:02,500
"Mommy, can we please buy
the Frozen ice cream?"

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,739
I'm so bitter.

3
00:00:04,893 --> 00:00:06,826
Five!

4
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:09,808
- Balalaika! Hey, ho!
- Balalaika!

5
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:20,566
Hey, hey!

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:25,395
Today we will be trying ice cream!

7
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:36,470
Those who have followed our channel for a while
know that every year we try the new ice creams of the season.

8
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,326
Yes!

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,585
Here in Portugal,
GB Glace is called OLÁ.

10
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:46,737
- Olá!
- Olá!

11
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:52,364
- OLÁ's new ice creams are quite similar to GB's back in Sweden.
- Yes.

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,126
But not entirely. So, we will try the new ones in Portugal,
but many are the same as the new ones in Sweden.

13
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,176
Yes.

14
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,129
- Ready?
- YES!

15
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,131
Let's go!

16
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:06,278
"Frozen Snowflake Cone"

17
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:09,260
It looks like this.

18
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:17,057
- Well, mommy. Laura has played with yours.
- Yes, mine is beaten.

19
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,679
Laura didn't like yours.

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:25,213
Ice cream melts quickly here in Portugal,
so we have to start munching.

21
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,755
Oh, Laura really wants to munch.

22
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:30,424
- It feels pretty small.
- Can she start? Shall we start?

23
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,726
- Isn't it quite small?
- Really small.

24
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:36,334
- A super tiny ice cream.
- Let's go.

25
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,268
Oh, Laura...

26
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:45,428
- She loved it!
- She's going to be so dirty after this, I can feel it.

27
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:48,001
Can I also try it?

28
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:51,466
It's blueberry ice cream.
Super tasty.

29
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:56,584
Oh, Laura isn't in the frame.

30
00:01:56,717 --> 00:02:01,090
Maybe that was just as well -
her table manners aren't very good.

31
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:08,204
I like the pre-taste, and I like the aftertaste,
so this one was actually very good.

32
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:12,328
How many points do you give it, from 1-5?

33
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:16,390
I give it a strong 3 points.

34
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:21,285
- I give it 3 points.
- I also give it 3 points.

35
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:25,534
- Daddy, you ate the whole thing.
- Yes. Yum!

36
00:02:25,788 --> 00:02:29,863
I think Laura gives it 5 points.

37
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:33,330
I give it 2 points.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,191
- Look how much Laura has eaten.
- I know. She's crazy about this one.

39
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:41,862
I feel this was a "little kid's ice cream".
Can I say that?

40
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:50,464
Yes. It's like one of those, when you're at daycare, you're just like:
"Mommy, can we please buy Frozen Snowflake Cone?"

41
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:54,241
- And it's the right size for a smaller child. 
- Yes.

42
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,758
- Good taste. 
- Yes.

43
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,393
"Solero Pineapple" 

44
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,940
It's a popsicle,
and it looks like this.

45
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,687
This popsicle is not available in Sweden.

46
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:14,036
- Laura...
- You can't cheat! She had a sneaky little taste.

47
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,499
- Shall the rest of us try it?
- Yes.

48
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:28,554
- Very pineappley.
- Very, very pineappley.

49
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:30,050
I like it.

50
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:36,208
It says that the pineapple is from the Azores,
which is a Portuguese island group we would love to go to.

51
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,730
Right.

52
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:44,491
- Floppy.
- Yeah, it's a bit like jelly.

53
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:48,711
It's not a hard popsicle, like "Piggelin".

54
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,466
Yes, you like it.

55
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,671
I give it 3.5 points.

56
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:07,115
I think this is a really good ice cream,
but it's a bit of a shame it got floppy so quickly.

57
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,873
I give this ice cream 3 points.
It was all right.

58
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,223
Laura seems to love it.
Do you give it 4 or 5 points?

59
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:20,561
I really like it. 5 points.

60
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,896
The first 5-pointer of the day.

61
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:30,001
- If you don't count Pipita's 5 points to the snowflake cone.
- Oh, right! But does her points count?

62
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,439
- No.
- No, we make them up.

63
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:39,879
She seems to like all ice cream.
She's really taking it in, it's all over her body.

64
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,475
I give it 3 points.

65
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:45,418
"Magnum Almond Remix"

66
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:50,379
It looks like this.
It's dipped in white and brown chocolate.

67
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:57,030
Daddy, you said "white and brown chocolate".
Isn't all chocolate brown?

68
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:02,069
Yes, unless it's dark - which we call
"Old man's chocolate" - or white.

69
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:06,140
- Then what do you say?
- Milk chocolate?

70
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:12,530
What do you say?
Comment below!

71
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:16,793
They're so lame.
They're mocking me for saying "brown chocolate".

72
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,674
And also, leave a like
if you think it's called "brown chocolate"...

73
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,798
- No, then we won't get any likes!
- ...as a consolation to daddy. 

74
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:28,019
Okay, leave a like if you DON'T think...

75
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:33,623
- Leave a like if you like the video. Nice and simple.
- Leave a like.

76
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,107
Leave a like anyway.

77
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:39,554
- Balalaika. Let's go!
- Balalaika! Hey, ho!

78
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,938
Balalaika!

79
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:48,615
- I'm just sucking on it.
- Why? It's delicious! Take a bite.

80
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:55,155
Oh, now I get it. The whole ice cream is dipped in white chocolate
and almond pieces, and then half the ice cream is dipped in...

81
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,125
- Brown...
- ...brown chocolate.

82
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:00,827
It tastes like "Mandelkubb" inside.

83
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:07,725
I've actually cheated.
I tried this on the beach one day. I love it!

84
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:13,086
"Mandelkubb" and white chocolate...
What do I live with?

85
00:06:13,202 --> 00:06:14,577
It's amazing!

86
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:19,798
- The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
- No. That's good, Laura.

87
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:23,350
Good taste.
What do you guys think?

88
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:28,689
I don't like it. I don't really like almonds,
so I don't like this one.

89
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,792
I give it 1 point.

90
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:34,962
- I think it's all right.
- 1 point? Oh.

91
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,061
- What do you give it?
- Zero.

92
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,599
- What?!
- Zero?!

93
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:43,403
Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero!

94
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,631
You're crazy! You're crazy!

95
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,706
Okay. I think this is a bit of a
"senior citizen's ice cream"...

96
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:56,997
- Thanks.
- ...but I give it 2 points.

97
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,520
Laura and I give it a very strong 5 points.

98
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,981
"Calippo Lime"

99
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:06,760
I think everyone knows
what this one looks like.

100
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:13,575
- Very limey.
- Mm.

101
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:22,251
- Great on a hot summer day.
- My hands!

102
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:27,676
- What is it?
- It's so cold on the hands.

103
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:37,826
- I like this one.
- They've frozen together. I can't move them.

104
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:44,164
The sugar has gone to their heads.

105
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:50,003
It happens so quickly. I was a little tired
before we started filming. Now I'm, like, ding-dong!

106
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,806
Ding-dong, indeed.
Or it's because...

107
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:58,410
- ♪ "Rena rama ding-dong..." ♪
- Oh, not that one.

108
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,332
♪ "Rena rama ding-dong" ♪

109
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:03,683
Oh, God.

110
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,516
Not only are you forced to watch The Melody Festival every year,
you also have to listen to those awful songs.

111
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,062
- Stop being so bitter.
- I'm so bitter.

112
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:18,001
They are great!

113
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,957
What do you think of the popsicle?
That's what we should talk about.

114
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:28,474
When I eat this popsicle, my tongue crumples up.
Kind of like I'm drinking something chemical.

115
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,211
But it feels like
it contains a lot of energy.

116
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:34,614
It feels like you're drinking something
that makes you, like, superfast.

117
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:38,344
Look at me! Zoom, zoom...

118
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:47,897
- "Zoom, zoom." What's he doing?
- They can't see you. He's lying on the floor and spinning around.

119
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:53,110
I give this popsicle 3.5 points.

120
00:08:53,641 --> 00:09:01,186
I give it 2 points.
Laura gives it maybe... 3 points.

121
00:09:02,547 --> 00:09:07,405
But...!
Put away my padel racket.

122
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,686
Alma, how many points?

123
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:18,525
I give it 2 points.
I also think it feels a bit chemical, if I may say so myself.

124
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,486
But, it's nice on a hot and sunny day.

125
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,232
- What are you doing?
- Come here and give points.

126
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,459
- Okay, sure.
- Hey, Zoom-o.

127
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:34,674
That can't be here, Laura will get it super dirty.
Bye-bye, rabbit.

128
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,344
Harry's points.

129
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,512
Zoom-zoom.

130
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:42,233
- To the camera.
- Zoom-zoom.

131
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,627
"Salted Caramel Brownie Peace Pop"

132
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:50,383
It's an ice cream on a stick
that looks like this.

133
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,683
Laura is coming to take it.

134
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:58,985
This is also a new ice cream
in Sweden this year.

135
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:03,864
- Exciting.
- Very exciting.

136
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,939
- Ready?
- Yes!

137
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,716
Let's go.

138
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:19,083
- Oh, that's a lot of flavor.
- It's very salty. Do you want to taste it?

139
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:23,539
Oh, there's so much in this one.

140
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:26,226
Yes, you like this one.

141
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:34,049
- It's almost like Arne's Salty Licorice.
- What?! It's not even similar to anything with salty licorice.

142
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,772
- Arne's Salty Licorice.
- What was that?

143
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:43,559
- I think it was a new ice cream last year.
- Arne's...

144
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:51,045
- Don't you remember when I, like, threw up?
- Oh, right. Uncle Arne.

145
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:56,106
- Here in Portugal, a salty licorice ice cream would never work.
- No.

146
00:10:56,106 --> 00:11:03,963
One of GB Glace's news in Sweden is a licorice ice cream,
but no Portuguese would ever buy it.

147
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,001
- They don't eat licorice down here, they don't eat pick-and-mix...
- No.

148
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:13,727
They have a completely different
culture around sweets.

149
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,846
The caramel was very, very salty.
A little too salty.

150
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,796
When I bit into it, I almost got a shock
because it was so salty.

151
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:28,355
It feels like a strange mix.

152
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:36,196
Brownie and salted caramel, and ice cream too.
It was a lot in one.

153
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,325
A bit of everything.

154
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,854
A chicken has stepped on mine.

155
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:49,719
That's the peace sign, Harry...
that looks like a chicken foot.

156
00:11:51,264 --> 00:12:00,420
I give this ice cream 2 points.
I think it was too much in one. It was a strange mix.

157
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,357
- I get it.
- I give it zero-superhero.

158
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:08,764
- Zero?!
- Scanner eyes.

159
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,832
- He doesn't like chocolate ice cream.
- No. That's his second zero today.

160
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,336
Harry doesn't like salted caramel.

161
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:21,171
I give it 4 points.
What does Laura give it?

162
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,770
Five!

163
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:29,682
- What's this?
- I spilled Calippo Lemon.

164
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:37,921
- You made the classic mistake and turned it upside down.
- Not lemon - lime. Calippo Lime. Not lemon.

165
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,694
- Don't do it. Never turn a Calippo upside down.
- No.

166
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:47,200
We have a Question of the Day.
Alma, are you listening? This one is for you.

167
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,669
Okay. Yep!

168
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:54,545
"Will Alma make a movie about Portugal?"

169
00:12:54,674 --> 00:13:00,747
- YES, I will!
- Yes, she will! Pipito is with!

170
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,183
Yes, I will.

171
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,585
- You will?
- Yes!

172
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:10,841
- When will it be done?
- I don't really know, but it will come.

173
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:13,374
Keep an eye out on Alma's channel.

174
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,545
"Solero Barrinha Manga"

175
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:24,574
It looks like this.
"Barrinha" is Portuguese for "barbell".

176
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:30,675
- In Sweden, a new Sandwich ice cream has come out.
- A new flavor.

177
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,181
Yes, exactly.
This is Portugal's version of Sandwich.

178
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:41,256
Very difficult to eat,
because it doesn't have... the Sandwich bread.

179
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:46,966
Exactly.
It's not a sandwich, it's just the insides.

180
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:53,218
It's mango and vanilla ice cream.

181
00:13:56,434 --> 00:14:06,753
This feels like an ice cream they've come up with last minute
to be able to fill up the sign with news.

182
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:11,684
It's an ice cream that's easy to make,
but completely impossible to eat.

183
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,309
The white vanilla melts faster
than the yellow mango, so it's completely...

184
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,092
It's very unclear why it's not on a stick.

185
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:24,609
It'll just turn into goo when you buy it,
so I don't think anyone will buy this.

186
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:30,301
- I like it. I give it a strong 3 points.
- A strong 3 points.

187
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:39,738
It took me a while to, like, figure out
if this is ice cream or if it's real mango.

188
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:43,351
- Oh, you think it was that mango-like?
- Mm.

189
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:49,355
Pipita is now demonstrating what it will look like
when people eat this ice cream in the summer.

190
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:53,750
It's going to be an orgy of ice cream goo.

191
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,352
Horrible.
I give it 1 point. A weak point.

192
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:04,047
I give it a strong 4 points. No...

193
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,875
- It's on your upper lip.
- 4 points. Not strong.

194
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,581
4 points?

195
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:19,607
I give it 0 points.
A very, very zero-y zero.

196
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,979
"Cornetto Rose" 

197
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:26,110
It looks like a rose.

198
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:33,299
This is not a new ice cream in Sweden this season.
It says that it's "raspberry milkshake flavor".

199
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:39,875
So, it tastes like a raspberry milkshake.
Are you ready?

200
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,877
1, 2, 3!

201
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:58,100
- Good raspberry flavor.
- It's better than I thought. The "milkshake" scared me a little.

202
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:02,361
- Me too.
- No, Laura. What have you done?

203
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:08,262
When it said "milkshake",
I was sure I would give it 5 points.

204
00:16:08,516 --> 00:16:12,338
That says something about
one's starting point, I guess.

205
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:18,000
Laura also likes it.

206
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:22,117
Oh, she's really munching on it.

207
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:27,353
She has come to a family that loves ice cream.
We are all ice cream lovers.

208
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,024
I love this ice cream!
This is the best one we've ever tried.

209
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,494
- Really?!
- 5 strong points.

210
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:38,108
- So, you think this one should come to Sweden?
- YES!

211
00:16:40,854 --> 00:16:44,337
Yes. How many points? 

212
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,285
Oh, wow! That's a lot.

213
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,645
- She held up her whole hand. 5 points from Laura.
- Yes, I think so. Was it the best ice cream?

214
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,021
Good, Laura! Good!
You have my taste. Good taste!

215
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:00,313
- I give it 3 points.
- I also give it 3 points.

216
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,618
3 points.

217
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,983
- This was the last new ice cream!
- Yes.

218
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:13,199
In summary, you could say that
Portugal has more fruity flavors than chocolate flavors.

219
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:18,004
- Yes. More than chocolate and soft serve and such.
- Exactly.

220
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,708
They don't have Cornetto Soft here in Portugal.
Not the new ones, at least.

221
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:27,560
- Or Cornetto Dragon.
- Right. I don't know if it's still available in Sweden either?

222
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,517
- No, but it's really good.
- Yes, you like it.

223
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:40,655
- Hope you guys liked this video.
- Yes! If you come to Portugal, you can always try these ice creams.

224
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:48,046
Thank you for watching this video!

225
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,374
- Please leave a thumbs up, or down.
- Mostly thumbs up!

226
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,110
Comment, ask questions
and take care until next time.

227
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,513
Bye-bye!
