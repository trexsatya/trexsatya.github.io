00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
My name is Eva EiderstrÃ¶m.

2
00:00:02,096 --> 00:00:06.105
I work at the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and I work in a department called "Shop Environmentally friendly".

3
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:09.623
We work very much with important issues for all of us.

4
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:16,281
How can I live in a better way that makes us cope with all the challenges society faces?

5
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:20,447
And how can we with our way of living actually support the change needed?

6
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:25,024
Then we can use such concrete tools as what we do daily -

7
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,642
- And we can make it through what choices we make.

8
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:36,057
We have developed an eco -labeling system that helps in these everyday elections.

9
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:37,366
It's called Good Environmental Choice.

10
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:39,729
Our eco -label has ...

11
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:45,720
The first criterion was presented in Sweden's nature number one 1990.

12
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,284
So we have been around for quite some time.

13
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:53,882
We still try to encourage people to do what you can.

14
00:00:54,675 --> 00:01:00.135
Not to make demands that you do everything right, because it is quite unreasonable.

15
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:03,677
And if it gets harder, at least do something right.

16
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:07.088
There are both cheap and expensive eco -labeled products.

17
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:12,480
Ecolabelling itself does not lead to the products being more expensive or worse for that matter.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,522
So then you can choose what suits your economy -

19
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:18,870
- And maybe at least buy every other time if you have previously bought every time.

20
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:21,940
But everything you do is better than not doing anything at all.

21
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,293
If you talk about some kind of theoretical long -term goal, it would be ..

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,666
If you see shop as both buying and acting -

23
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:39,675
- So we worked on how we look at gaining access to what we need.

24
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:44,713
If we can do it in ways other than buying your own gadget, for example.

25
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:50,497
Actually, by extension, a way to try to reduce the entire large resource consumption that is the consequences of -

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,524
- That we use things for a very long time and then replace them with something new.

27
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:02.438
It is very exciting and it would be very fun if it took off and favored in different ways in society.

28
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:10,398
There are many tests in different places among different companies and different phenomena that already exist that mean this.

29
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:16,197
But that it was scaled up and became the new norm would in some way be very, very good.

30
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:23,203
And it would also mean that climate emissions dropped dramatically as this entire resource sales -

31
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:26.305
- As we do, a lot of resources cost.

32
00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:33,370
And then when we have used them, they suddenly become hopelessly mixed and we cannot benefit from them again.

33
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:40,539
Instead of using them for as long as possible and finding ways to make sure we don't have to replace everything -

34
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,639
- Without just replacing parts and so on.
