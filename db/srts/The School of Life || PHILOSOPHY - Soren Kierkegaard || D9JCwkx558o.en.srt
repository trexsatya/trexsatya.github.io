00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:12,120
SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard was a brilliant, gloomy, anxiety-ridden, often hilarious Danish 19th century philosopher.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,620
The author of 22 books, of which 3 continue to make his name.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,860
He was born in an immensely wealthy family in Copenhagen in 1813, the youngest of 7 children.

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,000
Death was around him constantly from a young age, and was to obsess him throughout his career.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,100
It is, in a sense, his only theme.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,320
Not only was he extremely physically frail,

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,860
by the time he was 22, all his siblings had died except for he and a brother.

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,440
It drove him to furious production of books over 15 years.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,820
On a single day in 1843 he published no less than 3 works.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,280
He wasn't writing for the money; he was working to save himself, and, he thought, humanity.

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,300
As it happened, he made it to the age of 42, then died of an excruciating spinal disease.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,940
In "Either/Or" and "Fear and Trembling", what Kierkegaard wants to do above all

13
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,880
is wake up and give up our cozy sentimental illusions.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,880
He systematically attacks the pillars of modern life: our faith in family, our trust in work, our attachment to love,

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,240
and our general sense that life has purpose and meaning.

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,520
His enemies were the smug in all their guises,

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,480
particularly, the prosperous Danish haute bourgeoisie, and the members of the established Danish church.

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:33,900
He tells us, "As I grew up I opened my eyes and saw the real world, and I began to laugh and I haven't stopped since.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,000
I saw that the meaning of life was to get a livelihood,

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,600
that the goal of life was to be a High Court judge,

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,760
that the brightest joy of love was to marry a well-off girl,

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,520
that wisdom was what the majority said it was,

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,560
that passion was to give a speech,

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,600
that courage was to risk being fined ten dollars,

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,760
that cordiality was to say "you're welcome" after a meal,

26
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,920
and that the fear of God was to go to communion once a year.

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,180
That's what I saw and I laughed."

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,680
Kierkegaard was especially caustic about the 19th century understanding of love,

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,000
and the new ideology of passionate marriage, which aimed to unite desire with prudence,

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,440
and suggested that one could enjoy all the thrills of a love affair,

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,800
and, at the same time, all the stability for long-term relationship.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,860
But, Kierkegaard mocked the notion that one could ever fuse romantic laugh with marriage,

33
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,280
that one could have passion and sex, and, at the same time, children, stability, and routine.

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,880
He respected both, he just couldn't believe you could have them both at the same time-

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,440
in a cozy marriage sanctified by the state and the neighborhoods.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,520
His belief arose out of his own tortured love life.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,820
He fell in love with a beautiful, precocious, and talented 18-year-old girl, called Regine Olsen,

38
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,780
only then to break off the engagement as he realized

39
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,700
that to try and live with her forever would also mean killing the love that had drawn him to her.

40
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,080
Everywhere he turned, Kierkegaard saw intolerable incompatibilities, and impossible choices.

41
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,620
It led him to one memorable explosion in "Either/Or":

42
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,720
"Marry and you will regret it. Don't marry; you will also regret it."

43
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,800
"Marry or don't marry; you will regret it either way."

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,540
"Laugh at the world's foolishness; you will regret it."

45
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,080
"Weep over it; you'll regret that too."

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,340
"Hang yourself; you'll regret it. Don't hang yourself and you'll regret that too."

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,640
"Whether you hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you will regret both."

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,160
"This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,600
The mention of laughter is not a coincidence; key to Kierkegaard's philosophy is that:

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,000
the only intelligent tactical response to life's horror is to laugh defiantly at it.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,060
Rarely has a philosopher taken humor as seriously.

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,280
Kierkegaard is often described as the founder of the philosophical movement known as "existentialism",

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,240
because, in him, we find all the themes that would so interest later thinkers, like Sartre, Camus, and Heidegger.

54
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,280
The book that fascinated the existentialists was Kierkegaard's, "The Concept of Anxiety", published in 1844,

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,320
in which he emphasized a new word, "angest", or "angst", as we know it in English,

56
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,300
a condition where we understand how many choices we face,

57
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,440
and how little understanding we can ever have of how to exercise these choices wisely.

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,580
As Kierkegaard wrote, "Life can only be understood backwards, but must be lived forwards".

59
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,620
Our constant angst means that unhappiness is more or less written into the script of life,

60
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,320
as he wrote, "anyone who has given the matter any serious thought will know that I'm right when I say,"

61
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,000
"it's not possible for anyone to be absolutely, and in every conceivable way, completely content,"

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,120
"not even for a single half hour of his life."

63
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,220
"No one has come into the world without crying. No one asks when you want to enter the world; no one asks when you want to leave."

64
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,260
"How empty and meaningless life is; we bury a person, throw three shovels of earth over him,"

65
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,240
"drive out in a coach, drive back in a coach, and console ourselves that we still have life enough left to live."

66
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,480
"But really, how long is three score and ten; why not just get it over with straight away?"

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:07,280
For Kierkegaard there was, however, one answer that he put forward ever more stridently in his later works: Jesus Christ.

68
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,080
Kierkegaard loathed the Christianity of the established Danish church,

69
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,840
but he adored the simple truths of the Gospels that his father taught him as a boy

70
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,160
For him, Christianity was a religion of extreme surrender to a theology of almost peasantlike simplicity:

71
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:30,240
one was to be ready to die for Christ, to give up all attachment to worldly things, and to love all humans like one's siblings.

72
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,640
Kierkegaard wasn't interested in justifying his attachment to Christianity through rational means;

73
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,280
instead, he recommended a dramatic and now famous 'leap of faith',

74
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,520
wherein one wouldn't apply one's puny mind to attempting to prove the existence of God,

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,520
one would merely switch off one's faulty rational faculties, and jump into the idea of God as the total solution.

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,200
As he put it, "To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God".

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,720
Like Marxist communism, Kierkegaard's solutions to the problems of being human

78
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,240
are far less convincing and interesting than the diagnoses of our ills; few of us now make that leap,

79
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,320
but Kierkegaard deserves our attention for the beautifully bitter, caustic look he casts on the human condition.

80
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,200
He's one of the few philosophers one can turn to when the world has badly let us down, and we're in need of a friend

81
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:30,100
who can fully understand the dark places we're in once the sentimental illusions, that normally keep us going, fall away.
