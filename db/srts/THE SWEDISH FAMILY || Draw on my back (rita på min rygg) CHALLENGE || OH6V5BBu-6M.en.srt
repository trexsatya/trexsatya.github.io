1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,397
Is it hard?

2
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:05,114
I felt nothing about that.
 Cheating!

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,406
Oh no!

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,903
This has balled out.

5
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:15,084
  A papaya coconut!
 No, what do I say?

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,303
Hello Hello!

7
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:33,134
Today we will do ... Draw on my back challenge!

8
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,903
Yeah!
 And you may wonder what it means.

9
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:39,340
"Draw on my R*MPA Challenge!"

10
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:43,778
- No.
 Almost.
 - It means: "Draw on my back challenge".

11
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,814
- Yes!
 - No, you're wrong.

12
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,951
It's great fun, we think.
 We've seen it on Youtube, when others do it.

13
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:56,190
- Yes.
 We thought, "It looks funny. We have to do it!"
 - We have to test.

14
00:00:56,257 --> 00:01:00,361
- It is very simple, so you can test it at home too.
 - Yes.

15
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:04,239
But before we start with today's video we want to say ...

16
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,167
THANKS!

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:12,464
Thanks to everyone who participated and donated money to our collection in collaboration with Save the Children-

18
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:17,111
-What the money went to children in Ukraine, and around the world, who are having a hard time.

19
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:17,945
Yes.

20
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:23,717
Together with you we collected over SEK 200,000!

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,821
Very good.
 Very good.

22
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,789
"Aplausos! Aplausos!"

23
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:35,629
We can help many children with that sum of money, so it was so nice of you.

24
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,897
Several thousand children.

25
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,434
We are super happy that we have such a nice and fantastic community.

26
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,170
Really.
 I almost get a tear in my eye.

27
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:47,575
I would also like to take the opportunity to say thanks to everyone else who made their own initiative-

28
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,912
-And maybe gathered toys at home, or clothes or whatever, to help someone else.

29
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:52,846
Thanks.

30
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:56,517
- An applause for that too.
 - "Aplausos! Aplausos!"

31
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:02,456
You don't have to be part of our collection, it's enough to just be a fellow human being, right?

32
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,792
- Yes!
 - One more time.

33
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,462
- "Aplausos! Aplausos!"
 - Now "Aplausos" is enough?

34
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,900
That's enough.
 Now we start today's video.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,768
Challenge!

36
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,889
- Harry is ready to tell us how this goes.
 - Yes.

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,946
We have taped a paper on Alma's back, and here we have a paper on the wall.

38
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:32,019
Then I'll draw one thing.
 We pretend I draw a tree here ...

39
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:37,458
Then Alma will feel it and draw here.

40
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,462
Yes exactly.
 I'll try to draw what I feel.

41
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:44,832
- It sounds easy.
 - But it also sounds difficult.

42
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,367
We'll see if it's easy.

43
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,369
- (Axel) I think it's pretty tricky.
 - (Harry) I think it's very difficult.

44
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:51,305
- Are you ready?
 - Yes!

45
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:57,042
- Wait, wait, wait.
 Is Dad ready?
 - Yes.
 I'll just put on "play" here.

46
00:02:58,572 --> 00:02:59,575
Yes.

47
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:13,190
- What do you think it is?
 - God, I don't know.

48
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:21,429
- Harry, don't draw so fast.
 - (shoulder) must draw harder.

49
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,938
(Axel laughs at)

50
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:34,841
- It is actually difficult to draw on a back.
 - Yes I understand it.
 Sorry I laughed.

51
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,018
I'm finished.

52
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,001
Did I draw right?

53
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:42,384
- No!
 - Oh no.

54
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:47,349
- Then Alma gets 3 guesses.
 - Right.

55
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:52,318
- My first guess is 2 cherries.
 - No.

56
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:57,536
- My second guess is an ice cream.
 - No.

57
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,076
- It looks like an ice cream.
 - That looks a bit like Donald Trump.

58
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:07,764
- Is it an R*MPA?
 - NO!
 Absolutely not.

59
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,684
It is...

60
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,382
Pipito!

61
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:15,604
- Oh, wait.
 - Pipito!

62
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,059
- Oh, what a lot of hair she has!
 - Yes indeed.

63
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:24,846
She is in the future.
 I have seen her in the future, she became a paper guy.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,473
Laura is not here now because she can't draw, so she was not allowed to join.

65
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,110
- Who got a point in the first round?
 - Harry.

66
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,515
- Harry, Harry ... - Harry.

67
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,062
Oh no!
 Sorry!
 I'd hug you, and you just ...

68
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,357
Harry dies, Harry dies ...

69
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,321
- May I take your score?
 - No.

70
00:04:56,619 --> 00:05:03,070
Don't forget to push thumbs up if you like when we do challenges!

71
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,148
  Cha-cha-cha, Cha-cha-cha, Challenge, Challenge, Cha-Cha-Cha!

72
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,287
(Joanna) Is it difficult?

73
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:35,907
- Is it hard?
 - Yes Yes.
 There is full concentration here.

74
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:45,954
(Axel) But what is this?
 I do not get it.

75
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:52,619
(Axel) oh my good.

76
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,621
(Alma) I'm done!

77
00:05:54,912 --> 00:06:00,000
What?
 What is this?
 So ... you are kidding.

78
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:04,498
(Joanna) I can say so much as it is not right.

79
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:08,108
- It's wrong.
 3 guesses.
 - Okay.

80
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:12,284
- I think it's an old man.
 - Error.

81
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:16,009
- A car?
 - Error.

82
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:18,865
Gosh.
 Come on.

83
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:23,424
Then it's a ... flower pot.

84
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:31,191
- Error.
 It was a ... pineapple!
 - Oh, God, so hard.

85
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,862
- Because my favorite fruit is pineapple.
 - and dad's with.

86
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:41,535
- Well ... is that?
 Yes, maybe it is.
 - You probably said it at some point as a question of the day.

87
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:46,918
Yes exactly.
 Indian pineapple, in that case.
 With chili and salt.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,079
- I like regular pineapple.
 - Yes, it's much better.

89
00:06:52,179 --> 00:07:00,020
- And which is your favorite fruit?
 - A papaya coconut!
 No, what do I say?

90
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:06,538
(Alma) Harry, what do you eat, type ... What fruit do you live on, Harry?

91
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:10,187
- Banana!
 - Yes, my God.
 The banana man, that is.

92
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,698
The banana man!

93
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,334
He is kind of crazy in bananas.

94
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,474
He eats kind of bananas for breakfast and bananas for dinner.
 Except on the weekends, he also eats bananas for lunch.

95
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:25,779
- How many bananas in a day?
 - I would say type 5 bananas in one day.

96
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:27,848
That is pretty good.

97
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:33,823
When we have bananas at home.
 Usually we have it, but they end very quickly.

98
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:39,793
My favorite fruit is actually the one that Harry sang about.

99
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,276
  A papaya coconut!
 You-you-you-you

100
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,969
  And a place in the sun!

101
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:52,931
That sounded awful!
 But we offer it.

102
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:58,521
The position in today's Challenge is 1-1.

103
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,670
Mm.

104
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:06,575
Now Axel will draw me.
 Alma is filming.
 Let's go!

105
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,413
- Are you ready?
 - Yes, I'm ready.

106
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:16,063
I do this, then it feels better.

107
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,853
It is really difficult!

108
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:35,698
I felt nothing about that.
 Cheating!

109
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:40,355
But what do you do now for ...?

110
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,401
(Shoulder) clear.

111
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:47,512
No?!

112
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:52,699
- (Alma) So, a little does it actually look like ... - No?
 Is it the same?

113
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,912
- (Alma) a little.
 Tiny.
 - It's very abstract.

114
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,778
- Okay.
 I guess I'll guess, then.
 - mm.

115
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,978
- A pair of glasses.
 - No.

116
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,143
Good guess, but no.

117
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,008
- A pair of br*st.
 - It could have been me, but no.

118
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:18,166
Could it be you?!

119
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:23,669
Who drew it.
 But there are lots of sticks and stuff.
 So, there are not so much sticks in br*st.

120
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,532
I think.

121
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,852
- A stick.
 - No.

122
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:33,773
- It was a ... - bike!

123
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,088
Aaaah ...

124
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:41,548
- A pretty ugly bike.
 - Yes, it was actually an ugly bike, shoulder.

125
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,017
FUL J*DRANS Bike, Dad!

126
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:48,355
(Axel) This looks like bicycle parts, so I think mom gets half a point.

127
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,190
- Do I get half a point?!
 - Yes.

128
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,059
- Do we share the score then?
 - Yes we can do that.

129
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:59,730
Mm, for Dad drew so badly, so he doesn't get a point.
 He doesn't deserve a point.

130
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:03,003
Yes.

131
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,027
Now Mom will draw on Harry.

132
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,772
- Are you ready?
 - Yeah, man!

133
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:13,380
- What did you say?
 - Yeah, man!

134
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,537
Well!
 I thought you said "Jermaine".

135
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,569
Okay.
 Jermaine.

136
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,242
Now I drive!

137
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:48,704
Clear!

138
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:53,120
Please and guess, Harry, because you drew completely wrong.

139
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,686
So, I don't even see what you have drawn.
 I don't understand what you have drawn.

140
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,001
- huh?!
 - That can be anything.

141
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,539
- No, I think this is very clear.
 - Yes, I also think it's pretty clear.

142
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:07,329
- Is it a car?
 - No.

143
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,603
You can join in and guess, Alma.

144
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,941
Should Alma get a guess?
 She has seen what it is, so you get the worst help.

145
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:20,975
- I think it's a pool of something ... kind.
 - No.

146
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:25,048
- Isn't it a pool of any kind?!
 - No.

147
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,435
Okay, Harry.
 You have the last guess.

148
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,779
Is it...

149
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:34,273
...a car?

150
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,219
But you have already guessed that!

151
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:43,276
But is it kind of a rickshaw?

152
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,006
No!
 No no no!

153
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,934
It is the country Sweden!

154
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,225
Well, what a ugly!
 Who takes that?
 It looks like a P*nis!

155
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:02,856
It doesn't look like an "hmm-hmm"!
 Don't you see?
 Here is the Stockholm area, here is ...

156
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:10,153
There is the thing that stands out and here are the little balls, as you call them, and here is the other ball.

157
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,866
Shhh ... Here is Öland and Gotland!

158
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,838
I like that Gotland is kind of a square dot.
 It's a little Roblox feel.

159
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:25,244
Okay, it's actually very difficult to draw on your back.
 Should I tell you why I drew Sweden?

160
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:27,480
- Nah.
 - Shouldn't I tell you that?

161
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,252
Yes, yes!
 Tell us why.

162
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:38,191
I drew Sweden because the most common question we get is:

163
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:44,103
"When will you come home to Sweden?"

164
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:48,501
And what is the answer?

165
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:53,671
- You can say the answer, because I don't know.
 - Don't you know that?

166
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,297
Or yes, we come home this summer and are there on the summer holidays.

167
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,512
- Exactly.
 - Ouch ouch ouch.

168
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,781
Oh.
 Careful with little brother.

169
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:08,983
We will drive up to Sweden after the school closure, and it is type 11 or June 12.

170
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:10,823
Yes.
 Yes, Yes, Yes.

171
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:18,031
- So that's why I drew Sweden, and I think ... yes.
 - I thought it was kind of slave or kind of kiss.

172
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:22,001
The name, so ... this has balled out.

173
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:27,774
Now we have all drawn on each back and on the wall.

174
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:32,099
- On a paper on the wall.
 - Yes, on a piece of paper.
 Just.

175
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,862
- And we will count our points together.
 - Yes!

176
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:39,485
- A half.
 - One.

177
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,287
- One.
 - One.

178
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,315
- And one and a half.
 - Wooo!

179
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,901
So Joanna won.

180
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:51,826
Yes, but it is very stupid, because it became the case that the one who drew on his back all the time got the point.

181
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:53,366
Yes.

182
00:13:53,533 --> 00:14:01,474
And I was definitely not the best in any way, so you have to decide who has won today's Challenge instead.

183
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,810
So we usually do.

184
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:11,050
And then you have to look at these and think through ... who drew the most fun ...

185
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:15,224
- Or who drew most like.
 - Yes.

186
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,839
Or who drew the ugliest and needs a consolation prize.

187
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:26,099
You can write down in the comments section simply, who you think should win.

188
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,524
- Yes!
 - Yaaay!

189
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,140
Thanks for watching this video!

190
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:39,303
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down!

191
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,483
Most thumbs up.
 And have a great time, and we'll see you again soon!

192
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,952
Bye!
