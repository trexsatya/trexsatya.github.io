1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,397
Is it difficult?

2
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:05,114
I felt none of that. Cheating!

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,406
Oh no! 

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,903
This has gone off the rails.

5
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:15,084
♪ One Papaya Coconut! ♪
No, what am I saying?

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,345
Hey, hey!

7
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:33,134
Today we are doing the
Draw on my back CHALLENGE! 

8
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,903
Yep! And what does that mean?

9
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:39,340
"Draw on my bum CHALLENGE!"

10
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:43,778
- No. Almost.
- It means "Draw on my back challenge".

11
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,814
- Yep! 
- No, you're wrong.

12
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,951
It's really fun, we think.
We have seen others do it on YouTube.

13
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:56,190
- Yes. We thought: "That looks fun. We have to do it!"
- We have to try it.

14
00:00:56,257 --> 00:01:00,361
- It's very simple, so you at home can also try it.
- Yes.

15
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:04,239
But before we get started on today's video,
we want to say...

16
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,167
THANK YOU!

17
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:12,464
Thank you to everyone who donated money
to our fundraiser with Save the Children-

18
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:17,111
-where the money went to kids in Ukraine,
and around the world, who are in vulnerable situations.

19
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:17,945
Yes.

20
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:23,717
Together with you guys, we raised over 200,000 SEK.
(21,000 USD)

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,821
Very, very good.

22
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,789
"Aplausos! Aplausos!"

23
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:35,629
We can help many kids with that money.
It's just so nice of you guys.

24
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:40,434
- Thousands of kids.
- We are super happy to have such an amazing community.

25
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,326
Indeed. I'm almost getting teary-eyed.

26
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:48,008
I also want to say thank you to everyone else
who has taken their own initiatives, such as-

27
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,912
-donating clothes or toys or whatever,
to help someone else.

28
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:52,846
Thank you.

29
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:56,517
- An applause for that as well.
- "Aplausos! Aplausos!"

30
00:01:56,617 --> 00:02:02,456
You don't have to donate to our fundraiser,
it's enough to just be a fellow human being, right?

31
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,792
- Yes!
- One more time.

32
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,462
- "Aplausos! Aplausos!"
- That's enough "aplausos", right?

33
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,900
That's enough.
Let's get started on today's video.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,975
CHALLENGE!

35
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,889
- Harry is ready to explain how this is done.
- Yes.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,946
We have taped a piece of paper to Alma's back,
and here is a piece of paper on the wall.

37
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:32,019
Then I'll draw something,
let's say a tree...

38
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:37,458
Then Alma will try to feel that,
and draw it on here.

39
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,462
Exactly.
I will try to draw what I feel.

40
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:44,832
- It sounds easy.
- But difficult.

41
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,901
- We'll see if it's easy.
- I think it's quite tricky.

42
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,436
I think it's really difficult.

43
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:51,305
- Are you ready?
- YES!

44
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:57,042
- Wait, wait, wait... Is daddy ready?
- Yes. Let me just press "Play".

45
00:02:58,572 --> 00:02:59,575
Yes.

46
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:13,190
- What do you think it is?
- God, I don't know.

47
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:21,429
- Harry, don't draw so fast.
- You have to draw harder.

48
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:34,841
- It's actually difficult to draw on a back.
- I understand that. I'm sorry I laughed.

49
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,018
I am done.

50
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,001
Did I get it right?

51
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:42,384
- No!
- Oh, no.

52
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:47,349
- Then Alma gets 3 guesses.
- Right.

53
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:52,318
- My first guess is 2 cherries.
- No.

54
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:57,536
- My second guess is an ice cream cone.
- No.

55
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,076
- It looks like an ice cream cone.
- That looks a bit like Donald Trump.

56
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:07,514
- Is it a bum?
- NO! Definitely not.

57
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,684
It is...

58
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,486
Pipito!

59
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:15,604
- Oh, wait.
- Pipito!

60
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,059
- She has so much hair!
- Indeed.

61
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:24,846
It's her in the future. I've seen her in the future,
she turned into a paper figure.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,473
Laura is not here right now because she can't draw,
so she can't participate.

63
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,110
- Who got a point in the first round?
- Harry.

64
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,515
- Harry, Harry...
- Harry.

65
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,187
Oh, no! Sorry!
I was going to hug you, and you just...

66
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,357
Harry is dying, Harry is dying...

67
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,321
- Can I take your point?
- No.

- Is it difficult?
- Yes, yes. I'm super concentrated here.

00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:45,954
What is it? I don't get it.

76
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:04,498
I can tell you this much:
You did not get it right.

77
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:08,108
- Wrong. 3 guesses.
- Okay.

78
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:12,284
- I think it's a figure.
- Wrong.

79
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:16,009
- A car?
- Wrong.

80
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:18,865
Oh, come on.

81
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:23,424
Then it's a... flowerpot.

82
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:31,224
- Wrong. It's a... pineapple!
- Oh, God. That's a hard one.

83
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:35,862
- Because my favorite fruit is pineapple.
- And daddy's too.

84
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:41,592
- Well... is it? Maybe it is.
- I think you said that in a video.

85
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:46,751
Oh, right.
Indian pineapple - with chili and salt.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,112
- I like regular pineapple.
- Yeah, that's much better.

- ♪ One Papaya Coconut ♪ No, what am I saying?

Harry, what do you eat, like...
Which fruit do you live on, Harry?

89
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:10,187
- BANANA!
- Yeah, God... Banana man.

90
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,698
Banana man!

91
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,334
He's crazy about bananas.

92
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,268
He eats bananas for breakfast and for dinner.
And on the weekends, he also eats bananas for lunch.

93
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:25,779
- How many bananas per day?
- I'd say 5 bananas per day.

94
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:27,848
That sounds right.

95
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:33,823
When we have bananas at home, that is.
We usually do, but they run out very quickly.

96
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:39,793
My favorite fruit is actually
the one Harry sang about.

97

But that's fine.

The score in
today's challenge is 1 - 1.

101
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:06,116
Now Axel will draw on me.
Alma is filming. Let's go.

102
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,413
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

103
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:16,063
I go like this, so I feel it better.

104
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,853
It's really difficult!

105
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:35,698
I felt none of that. Cheating!

106
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:40,355
What did you do now?

107
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,401
Done!

108
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:47,512
No?!

109
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:52,699
- I mean, it kind of looks like...
- No? Is it similar?

110
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,912
- A little. Very little.
- It's very abstract.

111
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,778
- Okay. So, I guess I should guess.
- Mm.

112
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,978
- A pair of glasses.
- No.

113
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,143
Good guess, but no.

114
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,008
- A pair of br*asts.
- That could've been me, but no.

115
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:18,166
That could've been you?!

116
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:23,669
Who drew that, I mean. But there are a bunch of
sticks and stuff. Br*asts don't really have sticks.

117
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,532
I think.

118
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,852
- A lollipop.
- No.

119
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:34,797
- It was a...
- Bicycle!

120
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:41,581
- A pretty ugly bicycle.
- Yes, that was actually an ugly bicycle, Axel.

121
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,017
An ugly darn bike, daddy!

122
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:48,355
This looks like bicycle parts,
so I think mommy should get half a point.

123
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,190
- Do I get half a point?!
- Yes.

124
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,059
- So, we split the point?
- Yes, we can.

125
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:58,645
Daddy drew so badly, so he doesn't get a point.
He doesn't deserve a point.

126
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:03,003
Yeah.

127
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:07,340
Now mommy will draw on Harry.

128
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,772
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, man!

129
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:13,380
- What did you say?
- Yeah, man!

130
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,537
Oh, I thought you said "Jermaine".

131
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,569
Okay. Jermaine.

132
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:24,242
Let's go.

133
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:48,704
Done!

134
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:53,120
Go ahead and guess, Harry,
because you drew completely wrong.

135
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,686
I don't even see what you've drawn.
I don't get what you've drawn.

136
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,001
- What?!
- That can be anything.

137
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,539
- I think this is very clear.
- Yeah, it's pretty clear.

138
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:07,329
- Is it a car?
- No.

139
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,637
You can guess too, Alma.

140
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,941
Should Alma have a guess?
She has seen it, so it'd be a big help for you.

141
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:20,975
- I think it's a puddle of some sort.
- No.

142
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:25,048
- It's not a puddle of some sort?
- No.

143
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,435
Okay, Harry.
You have the last guess.

144
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,779
Is it...

145
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:34,273
...a car?

146
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,219
You've already guessed that!

147
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:43,276
Is it, like, a rickshaw?

148
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,106
No!
No, no, no!

149
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,934
It is the country Sweden!

150
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,225
No! How ugly!
Who would get this? It looks like a p*nis.

151
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:02,856
It doesn't look like a "hmm-hmm" at all!
Don't you see? Here's the Stockholm area, here's...

152
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:11,030
Here's the thing that pokes out, and here's one of
the little balls, as they're called, and here's the other ball.

153
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,866
It's Öland and Gotland.

154
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,838
I like that Gotland is, like, a square dot.
It has a Roblox feel to it.

155
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:25,578
It's actually really difficult to draw on a back.
Shall I tell you why I drew Sweden?

156
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,480
- No.
- I shouldn't?

157
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,252
Oh, yes! Tell us why.

158
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:38,191
I drew Sweden because
the most common question we get is:

159
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:44,103
"When do you come home to Sweden?"

160
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:48,501
And what's the answer?

161
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:52,372
Can't you say it?
I don't know the answer.

162
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:57,297
- You don't?
- We'll go home for the summer break.

163
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,552
- Exactly.
- Ouch, ouch, ouch.

164
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:01,781
Be careful with little brother.

165
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:08,983
We will drive back to Sweden after graduation,
which is June 11 or 12.

166
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:10,823
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

167
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:18,031
- So, that's why I drew Sweden, and I think... yeah...
- I thought it was slime or, like, pee.

168
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:22,001
I mean...
This has gone off the rails.

169
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:27,774
Now we have all drawn on a back each,
and on the wall.

170
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:32,099
- On a piece of paper on the wall.
- Yes, on a paper. Exactly.

171
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,862
- And we will add up our points.
- Yes.

172
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:39,485
- Half a point.
- One point.

173
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,287
- One point.
- One point.

174
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,315
And one and a half points.

175
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,901
So, Joanna won.

176
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:51,826
It's so silly, because the one who drew
got the point every time.

177
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:53,420
Yes.

178
00:13:53,533 --> 00:14:01,474
And I definitely wasn't the best in any way,
so you guys get to decide who has won today's challenge.

179
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,810
That's what we usually do.

180
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:11,050
So, take a look at these and think through
who made the funniest drawing...

181
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:15,224
- Or who drew the most similar.
- Yes.

182
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,839
Or who made the ugliest drawing
and needs a consolation prize.

183
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:26,099
Write in the comments section below
who you think should win.

184
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,524
- Yes!
- Yay!

185
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,140
Thank you for watching this video!

186
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:39,303
Please leave a thumbs up, or down!

187
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,483
Mostly thumbs up.
Take care, and we'll see you again soon!

188
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,952
Bye-bye!
