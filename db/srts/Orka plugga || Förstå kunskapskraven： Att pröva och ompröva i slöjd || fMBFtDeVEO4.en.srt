00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,480
TRYING AND RETRYING

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,400
To try and retry ways to solve problems 
is a part of life.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,240
When you play games, 
you try different solutions to challenges.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,880
When you cook, you try different spices 
with varying results.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,720
And sometimes 
you may turn a T-shirt into a tank top.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,560
Learning things at school involves trying 
different solutions over and over again-

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,600
-and coming up with new ones.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,720
Getting everything right straight away 
is neither possible nor particularly fun.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,800
To assess the quality 
of your school work-

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,600
-your teachers consult 
the knowledge requirements.

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,120
These are part of the curriculum, 
which governs what our schools teach.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,200
The requirements 
for craft, art, and technology include-

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,520
-being able to systematically 
try and retry solutions.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,560
In craft, this relates to how you can 
combine materials and techniques.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,320
When you do that, you also have to 
formulate different plans of action-

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,640
-to move your work forward.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,480
That means you constantly 
have to think about new solutions.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,920
Here, a student has been tasked with 
creating some form of storage unit-

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,480
-using recyclable materials.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,680
And the unit has to, at least in part, 
be made using a braiding technique.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,840
That sounds like a task 
with loads of possible solutions.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That makes it especially important 
to systematically try and retry ideas.

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,960
I could use a place to keep my chargers, 
earphones, and game controllers.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,760
I could make the box out of wood 
with a lid made from recycled fabric.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,200
And with handles made of wood, I think. 
Or would another material work better?

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,800
Won't a wooden box be a bit too heavy?

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,440
Yeah. My initial thought 
was a regular wooden box.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,680
But then I started sketching a box 
with thin strips forming a sort of grid.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,240
It will be a little trickier to build, but I 
think I'll end up using that one more.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,000
That was a good question. So 
the student retried the sketch early on-

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,240
-or more specifically, the material.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,120
The first option would be quicker to build.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,560
But the other is a better long-term choice 
because the material for it weighs less.

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,000
That is exactly how to go about trying 
your first idea when making something.

35
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,560
Examine the pros and cons 
of your material.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,880
And ask yourself how 
the finished object is going to be used.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,200
There. I'll combine the wooden box 
with cotton-strap handles.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,320
I can make the straps from my own 
discarded clothes, thus recycling fabric.

39
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Oh, cotton straps? I thought you had 
wooden handles on your sketch.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,320
I did. But I'll braid the straps 
to make them stronger, look.

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,640
Besides, they're more comfortable to use 
than wooden ones.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
I made a model and tested it out.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,840
You have to compare your original idea 
with other solutions.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So make several sketches 
of what you're making.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,360
You can also plan to make a prototype, 
which is a simplified model.

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,520
You will probably choose to combine 
different materials and techniques.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Justify and explain your choices.

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,040
What are you planning for the lid?

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,280
I'm going to put fabric over a frame, 
like this.

50
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,000
This fabric looks good, but it's too thin, 
so I don't think it's going to work.

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,600
But I've got some back-up fabric, 
so I can try both.

52
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,680
Great! Make sure you have options 
before you get started.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,080
So: Give yourself time 
to try different solutions and materials.

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,200
To systematically 
try and retry something-

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,000
-is all about planning 
and choosing between different options.

56
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,280
And make sure to document 
your process and your choices.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:00,360
That will help you assess your work and 
show that you've worked systematically.

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,440
Finally, let's review the working process.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
Proper planning is important.

60
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,160
When do you have to complete 
the different stages? And in what order?

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,760
Is there time to make a simplified model?

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,000
Which materials should you work with? 
Which are best in terms of function?

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,480
Can you combine materials?

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,960
Make several sketches 
and compare alternative solutions.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,080
How should you go about it? Which 
techniques are appropriate to use?

66
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,040
And which methods and tools 
would be best?

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,440
Analyse your options 
and justify your choices.

68
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,400
That is what "formulating and choosing 
between different plans of action" means-

69
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
-in the knowledge requirement.

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,360
Finally, document your entire process 
by taking pictures and making notes.

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,720
Share the reasons behind your choices.

72
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,400
Also share any technical or aesthetic 
issues you encountered along the way.

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,920
Being able to systematically try and retry 
solutions through planning and analysing-

74
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,720
-will serve you well in many situations.
