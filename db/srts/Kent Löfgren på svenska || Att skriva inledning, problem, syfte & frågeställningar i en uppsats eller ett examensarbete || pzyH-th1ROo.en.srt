1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,900
Traditionally, an essay or degree project usually consists of these main parts.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,060
In this video I talk about the first part, introduction and purpose.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,620
The introduction is usually about one to one and a half pages.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,860
There you tell the reader what kind of relevant problem you have found when you have read previous research in the form of primary sources.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,520
That is, examined articles published in scientific journals or dissertations.

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:41,120
To tell the reader what kind of problems you have found is also called problem formulation.

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,440
It means the same thing and just means describing a problem.

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,240
For example, there is previous research, but there is no knowledge of a special thing.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,460
In other words, you have discovered a knowledge gap.

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,280
Here it is important that you underpake your arguments with the support of primary sources.

11
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,400
In this concrete example, the student initially describes the importance of good healthcare.

12
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,400
Then the role of pedagogy is focused.

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,600
Finally, the student argues that there is a need for a certain type of study in the field.

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,500
A common beginner error in the introductory text is to forget to motivate with support in previous research.

15
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,680
It is not enough to refer only to government reports, course literature and the like.

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,460
This is because there are secondary sources.

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,480
I recommend one or two scientific articles in the introduction.

18
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,340
In addition, you are welcome to use a current and relevant dissertation in the introduction.

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,080
In this example, references to the National Agency for Education are not enough, I think.

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,360
Although it is a relevant authority for this study.

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,500
I want to see something more.

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,780
Let's add some arguments substantiated by primary sources.

23
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,360
The introduction is getting better because the reader understands what is the study's problem area.

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,580
In addition, it becomes clear that this study is based on previously completed research in the area.

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,635
However, remember that the introduction must not be too long.

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Briefly tell us about these sources but save the longer descriptions for the section on the purpose.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,360
It is enough if you show that your study is based on a scientific basis and not on your own opinion.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,400
Another error in the introduction is to describe the problem too broad and unclear.

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
It is not enough to only point out a general problem area.

30
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,440
You have to specify what your study is all about.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,540
The reader should not be forced to guess what problems or lack of knowledge you have discovered when you have read in the area.

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,960
This example describes an appreciated business, but the reader may find it difficult to understand what is the study's real problem area.

33
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:27,180
By adding a precise text, with references to articles and/or dissertations, the study's research problems become much clearer.

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,780
We now see that the research problem is that there is a knowledge slot regarding open preschools' work to support parents.

35
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,460
Another error is to focus on yourself too much in the introduction.

36
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,880
Admittedly, it may be of interest to the reader to know something about you.

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,000
However, there is no reason that you write an introductory background story based on your personal experiences.

38
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,620
You can briefly mention that you have your own experience in the field of study.

39
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,660
However, your problem formulation, that is, the knowledge gap you have discovered, should be based on scientific primary sources.

40
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,840
Once the reader has taken note of your introduction, he or she should think:

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:27,200
"This is a relevant and important problem of public interest and someone should conduct a study to create knowledge that can help to solve this problem."

42
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,460
A perfect introduction creates this feeling in the reader :-)

43
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,660
For your purpose, tell the reader what you have for your essay or your degree project.

44
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,240
You may also have two or three issues to further clarify and specify your intentions.

45
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,660
The purpose and issues must be about the problem you describe in your introduction.

46
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,500
A common beginner error in the purpose is to write that the study's purpose is to conduct a survey.

47
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,820
The purpose is rather to create knowledge.

48
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,740
You want to help clog the knowledge gap regarding the problem you describe in your introduction.

49
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,320
Another error is that the student believes that the issues should look like interview questions.

50
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,720
It is a common mistake to believe that the issues should be addressed to individuals.

51
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,520
Instead, they should be designed more overall and addressed to what the study intends to investigate.

52
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,320
Do not write: "What do you think as an employee of this company about management's investments in skills development?".

53
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,080
Instead, write a more comprehensive issue that affects the study's implementation.

54
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,760
For example: "What perceptions does employees have about investments in skills development?".

55
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,000
A common mistake is to neglect with words and concepts.

56
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:04,600
You cannot vary these anyway because it confuses the reader and contributes to poor quality.

57
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,160
Find out which words and concepts occur in this particular area of research.

58
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,260
Stick to these.

59
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,740
You can write briefly.

60
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,480
Save definitions and longer descriptions for the section on the purpose.

61
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,920
Another error is to use information and arguments that do not belong in the field.

62
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,660
Let me give a concrete example.

63
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:54,180
An essay in business administration can not only use articles and dissertations that deal with memory research, right?

64
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,800
Furthermore, you probably cannot use theories and concepts from the field of literary science.

65
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,620
Therefore, consider which academic unit or institution to which your essay or degree project belongs.

66
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:20,620
Then use information, scientific sources, words and concepts that show the reader that your study belongs in this area.

67
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,820
Another error is to discuss the method in detail.

68
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,340
In nine cases out of ten, you can remove this information from the introduction and purpose.

69
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,620
This is because it is presented to the reader in the method chapter later.

70
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,100
This example describes the method and selection, but it is unnecessary.

71
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,020
That information can be removed.

72
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,340
It is enough to tell us what you want to achieve with your study.

73
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,360
Another mistake is to write that there is a total lack of research.

74
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:02,740
Readers and examiners can react negatively if a student claims that there is completely no research in an area.

75
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,820
My recommendation is that you downplay this and instead tell us about the research you have found.

76
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,380
In this example, the student does not write that there is completely lacking research.

77
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,620
Instead, the student writes that there seems to be few studies focusing on what the student's essay is about.

78
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,640
Here is another example where a student does not claim that there is no completely lack of research in the field.

79
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,900
Instead, the student writes that there seems to be a need for Swedish studies in the area.

80
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,540
Another beginner's error is to get stuck for too long in the reading.

81
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,980
Admittedly, you must read articles, dissertations, reports, and so on to get acquainted with the area.

82
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,140
It is an important introductory phase of your work on writing your essay or your degree project.

83
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,200
But for God's sake, never hesitate to interrupt this reading on time and for further with writing.

84
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,440
You do not need to read and understand every document published in the field.

85
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,980
This is not a must to write the introduction and purpose.

86
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,440
It's so easy to end up on time, don't let it happen to you.

87
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,480
Finally, let me remind you that all these are my recommendations.

88
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,180
Other teachers, supervisors and examiners are likely to have partly or completely different views on what applies.

89
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,340
In other words, it is your responsibility to find out what applies to the course you read.

90
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,380
You must find out what instructions, templates and grading criteria apply to the essay or thesis work you write.

91
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,580
For example, in some courses, students do not need to use any formal theory, while on others it is a requirement.

92
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,400
I also recall that you can download and read old essays.

93
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,340
Partly via essay.se and partly through the digital archive that is shortened Diva.

94
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,700
Try to see in the first place how previous students on your course has done.

95
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,280
Read instructions and grading criteria and if you have received a template you should use it.

96
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,400
Click the Gilla button and be happy to subscribe to my Youtube channel.

97
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,660
Also, write some comments you are busy if you have questions or your own tips.

98
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,540
Bye for now!
