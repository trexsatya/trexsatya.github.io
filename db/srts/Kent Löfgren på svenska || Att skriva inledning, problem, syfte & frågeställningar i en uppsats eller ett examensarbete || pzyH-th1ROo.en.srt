00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,900
Traditionally, an essay or degree project usually consists of these main parts.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12.060
In this video I talk about the first part, introduction and purpose.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,620
The introduction is usually about one to one and a half pages.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,860
There you tell the reader what kind of relevant problem you have found when you have read previous research in the form of primary sources.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,520
That is, examined articles published in scientific journals or dissertations.

6
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:41,120
To tell the reader what kind of problems you have found is also called problem formulation.

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,440
It means the same thing and just means describing a problem.

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,240
For example, there is previous research, but there is no knowledge of a special thing.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,460
In other words, you have discovered a knowledge gap.

10
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,280
Here it is important that you underpake your arguments with the support of primary sources.

11
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,400
In this concrete example, the student initially describes the importance of good healthcare.

12
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,400
Then the role of pedagogy is focused.

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,600
Finally, the student argues that there is a need for a certain type of study in the field.

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,500
A common beginner error in the introductory text is to forget to motivate with support in previous research.

15
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,680
It is not enough to refer only to government reports, course literature and the like.

16
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,460
This is because there are secondary sources.

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,480
I recommend one or two scientific articles in the introduction.

18
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,340
In addition, you are welcome to use a current and relevant dissertation in the introduction.

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,080
In this example, references to the National Agency for Education are not enough, I think.

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,360
Although it is a relevant authority for this study.

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,500
I want to see something more.

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,780
Let's add some arguments substantiated by primary sources.

23
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,360
The introduction is getting better because the reader understands what is the study's problem area.

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,580
In addition, it becomes clear that this study is based on previously completed research in the area.

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,635
However, remember that the introduction must not be too long.

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Briefly tell us about these sources but save the longer descriptions for the section on the purpose.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,360
It is enough if you show that your study is based on a scientific basis and not on your own opinion.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,400
Another error in the introduction is to describe the problem too broad and unclear.

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
It is not enough to only point out a general problem area.

30
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,440
You have to specify what your study is all about.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06.540
The reader should not be forced to guess what problems or lack of knowledge you have discovered when you have read in the area.

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,960
This example describes an appreciated business, but the reader may find it difficult to understand what is the study's real problem area.

33
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:27,180
By adding a precise text, with references to articles and/or dissertations, the study's research problems become much clearer.

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,780
We now see that the research problem is that there is a knowledge slot regarding open preschools' work to support parents.

35
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,460
Another error is to focus on yourself too much in the introduction.

36
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,880
Admittedly, it may be of interest to the reader to know something about you.

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,000
However, there is no reason that you write an introductory background story based on your personal experiences.

38
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,620
You can briefly mention that you have your own experience in the field of study.

39
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04.660
However, your problem formulation, that is, the knowledge gap you have discovered, should be based on scientific primary sources.

40
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,840
Once the reader has taken note of your introduction, he or she should think:

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:27,200
"This is a relevant and important problem of public interest and someone should conduct a study to create knowledge that can help to solve this problem."

42
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,460
A perfect introduction creates this feeling in the reader :-)

43
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,660
For your purpose, tell the reader what you have for your essay or your degree project.

44
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,240
You may also have two or three issues to further clarify and specify your intentions.

45
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,660
The purpose and issues must be about the problem you describe in your introduction.

46
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,500
A common beginner error in the purpose is to write that the study's purpose is to conduct a survey.

47
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08.820
The purpose is rather to create knowledge.

48
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,740
You want to help clog the knowledge gap regarding the problem you describe in your introduction.

49
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,320
Another error is that the student believes that the issues should look like interview questions.

50
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,720
It is a common mistake to believe that the issues should be addressed to individuals.

51
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,520
Instead, they should be designed more overall and addressed to what the study intends to investigate.
