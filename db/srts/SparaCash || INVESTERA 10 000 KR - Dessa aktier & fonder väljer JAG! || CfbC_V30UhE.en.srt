1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,873
Is it the case that you have saved up SEK 10,000?

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:06,249
You may be wondering:
What are you going to do with the money?

3
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:09,518
You can not have them in
a bank account at your regular bank!

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:11,981
What do they give? Like 0% in interest.

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,966
Then this video is perfect for you!

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,609
I'm going to show you how I think,
if I had invested SEK 10,000 just today.

7
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:23,012
If you do not know who I am, my name is
Marcus Lindblad and I run SparaCash.

8
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:26,735
I have started SparaCash.se,
as well as this YouTube channel,

9
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:32,663
with the goal of teaching you as a beginner
how to invest in stocks, mutual funds and much more.

10
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:35,768
But keep in mind that investing
comes with a very high risk.

11
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:41,737
This means that when you invest your money
, you can lose part, or all, of your capital.

12
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:44,205
So be careful when investing your money.

13
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:48,352

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,752
The absolute first thing I had done
with these 10,000 kronor

15
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:54,780
is that I had divided them
into four smaller pieces.

16
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:58,482
The first will then be SEK 2,500.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,151
What do I do with them?
Well, the first thing I had chosen is a global fund.

18
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,472
With a global fund, you get a very
wide spread all over the world

19
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,802
and the absolute largest companies in the world.

20
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:14,309
If you look at global funds today
, you get exposure to, among other things:

21
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:19,932
Apple, Google, Microsoft and
large, US, stable companies

22
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:24,056
who has made a lot of money
and will do so for many years to come.

23
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:30,731
If the world economy is doing well, the
funds will also go up and your money will grow.

24
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,264
But which global fund to choose then,
maybe you are thinking about.

25
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:40,462
Yes, I had chosen Länsförsäkringar Global Indexnära
or Avanza Global.

26
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,030
Two perfect global funds.

27
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:48,784
There is not much difference between these two
so it does not matter much which one you actually choose.

28
00:01:52,686 --> 00:02:00,337
So, now we have invested SEK 2,500 in a fund, and now
I want us to take the step and actually buy a share.

29
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:04,444
We thus pound SEK 2,500 into Investor. Boom!

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,729
Investor is an investment company,
which means that they in turn own other companies.

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,663
These companies are stable, secure, Swedish companies
that do well with profit and also distribute the profit,

32
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:23,593
which means that we as shareholders get some pure cash
into the account by owning these shares.

33
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:29,915
Investor is a perfect beginner
stock that has also hit the stock market, historically.

34
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,158
But what do you get if you buy Investor?

35
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:37,009
Yes: Atlas Copco, ABB, EQT and many others.

36
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,650
The third investment.
SEK 2,500 more, we will now add.

37
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,697
There I want to strike a blow for a fund robot.

38
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,172
A fund robot manages the investments for you.

39
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,454
Do you need a fund robot? No.

40
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,964
You absolutely do not need to
invest in a fund robot if you do not want to.

41
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,820
But I think it's nice to have a fund robot.
A bit like an airbag.

42
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:07,562
If you yourself have a little problem
with dealing with the emotions

43
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:13,265
and may not know what to invest in,
a fund robot is perfect for you who are a beginner.

44
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:16,390
With a fund robot, you usually get
a very wide spread

45
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:21,175
among a variety of funds and ETFs
at a fairly low fee.

46
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:28,759
If you do not want to choose a fund robot, you can instead
double the amount you put in a global fund.

47
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:32,415
It goes just as well with a global fund
as with a fund robot.

48
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:37,906
If you are eager to invest in a fund robot
, I have made a comparison between Lysa and Opti

49
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:42,297
which are two of the larger fund robots in Sweden,
which you probably know.

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,283
My favorite is Lysa.

51
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:51,752
Lysa is the cheapest fund robot and the fee is
very important to look at if you compare different fund robots.

52
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:56,575
My strategy, when I invest in a fund robot,
is to always have 100% shares.

53
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,592
This is because when you choose a fund robot
, you get to answer a few different questions.

54
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:08,532
These questions will give you a suggestion
on different investments to choose from.

55
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:16,076
The fund robot will thus give you a proposal for the distribution
between shares and interest rates in your investments.

56
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,443
My philosophy as an investor is to always
have 100% shares among my investments.

57
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:26,717
Since the interest rate is quite low now,
around the world but also in Sweden,

58
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:31,020
so you do not get much for your money
when you invest in interest rates.

59
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:36,445
Therefore, I prefer stocks instead, in the long
run, if you are a long-term investor.

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,786
If you want a little more stability
and that your money does not fluctuate so much ...

61
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,465
If you were to invest in shares
, it goes like this

62
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:50,323
but if you invest in a mix of stocks
and interest rates, you get a more stable return.

63
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:54,427
So for you who may need
the money in a little less time,

64
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:56,769
if you need them within 3-5 years,

65
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,432
Maybe it's a good idea to
have some interest rates in your portfolio.

66
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:03,010
But I'm not a proponent of that.

67
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:08,025
If you want to read more about fund robots, I have
a comparison on SparaCash that you can check out there.

68
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:15,960
The fourth and final investment.
We still have SEK 2,500.

69
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:18,823
Here I want to pass over the ball to you.

70
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,144
I want you to read on. Think about what
you are interested in investing in.

71
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:27,417
Do you want to choose a stock
or a special fund? Think!

72
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,974
In any case, I would have chosen another fund.

73
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:37,298
I usually advise beginners to
aim to have 80% mutual funds and 20% equities.

74
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:42,822
In my case, I choose a fund that I believe in.
Then I choose a small company fund.

75
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:49,738
But you can choose another type of fund.
For example, an Asian fund, an emerging market fund,

76
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:53,080
or a particular country you think
will do well in the long run.

77
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:58,237
Or another fund, such as technology,
sustainable energy or the like.

78
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:03,917
Think about what you believe in,
that you enjoy following and reading about.

79
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:09,498
I choose a small company fund because the
small companies have actually done very well over time.

80
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,996
Small companies have tended to outperform the
stock market in the long run.

81
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:16,686
Because if you find these
small companies at an early stage

82
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,572
so you get to be part of
a very nice trip in the long run,

83
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:24,046
if it is the case that they increase,
make more money and grow in the long run.

84
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:26,243
Then you can make a really nice trip.

85
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,840
But, like I said,
I want to pass the ball to you.

86
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,015
Think about what you wanted in your portfolio.

87
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:38,964
When investing in stocks and mutual funds,

88
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:44,219
then make sure you do it in an ISK account
or in endowment insurance.

89
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:48,695
It gives you a low tax
and you do not have to declare your business.

90
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,481
If you have them in a share and fund account
, you will instead have to pay 30% tax on your profit

91
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:59,797
and you will need to report your business
to the Swedish Tax Agency in your next tax return.

92
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:01,768
And it can be a little boring!

93
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:05,778
Do you have any thoughts on
these investments I have talked about,
