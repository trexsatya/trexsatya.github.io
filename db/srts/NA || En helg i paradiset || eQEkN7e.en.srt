1
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:57.160
Now Göran is shooting again.
 Yesterday he pulled heating loops on the porch.

2
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.720
I immediately saw that there was something wrong with him.

3
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.560
- Why do you just O'boy for you?
 - In this country ...

4
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.680
... no one can be pleased that others are doing well!

5
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.680
- I have to do it myself then.
 - Don't go, I took the last one.

6
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.880
- Finter that you have shot, Gustav.
 - Single, the snow is gone anyway.

7
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.240
Trust nature.
 Everything has a meaning!

8
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.680
- In addition to you.
 -Come here!

9
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.600
Look at our new neighbor.
 What do you see?

10
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.640
- An idiot.
 - Göran is shooting morning and evening.

11
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.640
Man's meaningless struggle against the elements.

12
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.640
His wife does not have to scoop out of the bathroom window anyway.

13
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.160
I'll take care of it.
 - Max, pick up the snow shovel!

14
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.160
- I take care of the home and you garden.
 - ORGETS, I want to change.

15
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.720
Sanda at the mailbox as well.

16
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.720
- Don't Max do anything?
 - Yes, drink chocolate.

17
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.520
If you touch it there I will read the Post's staff magazine for you!

18
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.640
Max!
 Today is Tuesday and it is your turn to scale potatoes.

19
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.040
I am allgeric!

20
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.000
Everyone is just trying to throw away their tasks.

21
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.200
Yes, it is best that you do everything.

22
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.000
- You have five seconds on you!
 -One two...

23
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.560
Mom, there is someone who is shooting ... how did you do?

24
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.120
I said I had lost the remote control there.

25
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.800
Here are sandwiches and chocolate.
 How was school?

26
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.840
Math interviews ... The gym teacher was sick, so then Eva and I went smoking.

27
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.200
-What are you saying?
 - The truth.

28
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.200
Why do you tell the truth?

29
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.600
Our teacher says we should be honest.

30
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.000
So stupid!

31
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.920
Do you not belong to the open parent generation?

32
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.920
Do we do well ... you are 15 years old and curious about life.

33
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.320
You want to explore things that we may have difficulty accepting, such as smoking ...

34
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.320
... guys, snuff and sex and stuff.

35
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.320
- Should you have secrets?
 - You can be a little low sometimes.

36
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.240
Grandma knows e.g.
 Not that Dad is a postman.

37
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.040
Last time they talked, he was certainly the commander.

38
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.440
- So it was done!
 - Are you already done?

39
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.800
Do not you trust me?
 After 20 years of hiking, side by side ...

40
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.800
-Move!
 -Okay okay.
 It's cold out there ...

41
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:58.440
- Why don't guys make things clearly?
 - People are half finished.

42
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.200
The body works fine, but we women are allowed to talk about what to do with it.

43
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.560
- Do you come and go to bed?
 -I can not move.

44
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.440
Shot a little more often, so you don't get hurt.
 Look at Göran!

45
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:30.280
- I don't want to look at Göran.
 - Göran is not just at the TV.

46
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.840
Within six months he sits here next to me.

47
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.680
The doorbell rings

48
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.200
Lena, open!

49
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.080
Come in!

50
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.200
- Gustav!
 Am I Disturbing?
 - What you look happy.
 Is it snowing?

51
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:09.080
I need your help.
 We haven't been able to talk so much with each other -

52
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.080
- But I immediately felt that we would have nice contact ...

53
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.360
What is it that you want?

54
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:29.120
Annika and I have a wedding day on Saturday, but I have a problem.

55
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.080
I would like to surprise her with something nice, but I'm not so ...

56
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.360
-Shrewd?
 - Not so inventive.

57
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.480
Whatever I do, she will never be surprised, so I was going to ask you.

58
00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.600
You want help in amazing your wife?
 You have come to the master!

59
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.400
Why do you think Lena has stayed with me for 20 years?

60
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:19.160
I'm not so successful, pretty lazy, voting for the guys ...

61
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.160
... but I have the ability to surprise.

62
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.320
Lena and I have celebrated 20 fantastic wedding days.

63
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.320
- Do you want to tell you about one?
 -Do it!

64
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.040
How was it now ...?

65
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.200
Yes!
 There is a guest house called Solgläntan -

66
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:52.480
- With mileage views of fields, meadows, sea ...

67
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.760
The helmet, do you mean?

68
00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:03.200
So this year the snow is deep, the guests are picked up with horse and sled.

69
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.160
How complicated.
 Can't you plow?

70
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.640
I'm trying to tell you about a great moment.

71
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.200
- Here is the brochure.
 - "Make your own chips" ...

72
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.880
"Pension State Solgläntan - a weekend in paradise."

73
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.680
Timbered cabin, first class food, soft bear traps in the beds.

74
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.680
-Perfect!
 Can I borrow the brochure?
 - Yes, Lena orders new every year.

75
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.800
- Is there something I can ... - Yes, that's one thing ...

76
00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:02.120
Lina is getting big.
 We have to pay attention to her.

77
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.920
I am attentive.
 I always drive her to the riding school.

78
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.920
She stopped riding a year ago.

79
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:18.000
That's why she got so angry when I let go of her at the stable.

80
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.000
She is getting new interests.

81
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:29.120
- I am easily scared away.
 -What is that sound?

82
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.360
Max that snores ...

83
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:46.600
- What do Göran do on our porch?
 - Some heating loops would in ...

84
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.680
-In the middle of the night?
 - He is grateful for some good advice.

85
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.760
- "Always guard away matches"?
 - We talked about how to show love.

86
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.880
- Did you know how to do it?
 - I told him.

87
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:13.880
They are going to celebrate the wedding day and I talked about the guest house Solgläntan.

88
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:20.040
I described for Göran how nice it was there.

89
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.600
But we have never been there!

90
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:30.000
We have looked at the brochure so many times.

91
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.960
For ten years I have dreamed of going to Solgläntan!

92
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.960
I've wanted to have a TV in the bedroom for 15 years!

93
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:49.200
- We can go there next year.
 - You have said that for a decade.

94
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.480
Göran wanted to make his wife happy on the wedding dance, and I gave advice.

95
00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:02.360
Your own wife you shit in, but when it comes to Göran's wife, it gets speed!

96
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.520
We have had lots of nice wedding days!

97
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.320
- Mention one!
 - I can name ten.

98
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:19.560
- Can't do not right now ... - awake me when you come to someone.

99
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.160
Have!
 Gotland –91.

100
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.560
Then you celebrated the 15th anniversary with your lumpy buddies.

101
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.560
It was a wonderful atmosphere anyway.

102
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.080
- When was the French Revolution?
 –1789.

103
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.200
Why did they have to kill so many?

104
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:59.200
There were positive sides too.
 Look at that!
 Big party, lots of people.

105
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.320
The looting of Versaille.
 1,400 people died!

106
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:14.000
Here is a list of all romantic places where we celebrated our wedding day.

107
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.560
Can I see?

108
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:25.160
1987: 12th anniversary.
 What a mood!
 Gavlerinken ...

109
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.000
- Gavlerinken?
 - Brynäs - play sand.

110
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.920
-Another example!
 –1992 Don't forget ...

111
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:44.680
- Night Himpers, the snow, the ice ... - Boltic - Ljusdal it was.
 3–2 ...

112
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:54.080
Do you see anything in common with all our wedding days?

113
00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.760
- No ... - it's just sporting events!

114
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.200
You're right about that...

115
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:10.200
Have I ever said: Gustav, can't we go to hockey?

116
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.560
Not so clear ...

117
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:20.360
- Have I asked to go on a band?
 -No...

118
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:27.560
Have I said: Can't we go to Pensionat Solgläntan?

119
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:34.560
-That sounds familiar.
 - Then I should not disturb anymore.
 Bye!

120
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.960
1994: Tomas Brolin's parents' home.

121
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.480
That night was magical!

122
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.400
Hello, the old man!
 How are you?

123
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.800
- I think we talk so rarely.
 -Sch.

124
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.200
It's good that you are independent, but ...

125
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.200
- Sometimes I want to know what you are thinking.
 -I do not think so.

126
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:27.280
One should be responsive to each other's wishes.

127
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:34.000
There may be things you want to do that we do not know about.
 Fishing and so ...

128
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.560
- Mom, do you need support and comfort?
 -Yes...

129
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:46.120
I'm too small, talk to dad.
 He left a note to you.

130
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.160
"Pettersson has acquired a big -screen TV. Coming home after the match."

131
00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.760
-Come in!
 -Hello!
 What are you doing?

132
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:07.000
- Imagine on my husband.
 - I always think about Göran!

133
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.640
Not the same way ...

134
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.360
- How is Göran as a husband?
 -Wonderful!

135
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:24.800
He is safe, kind, honest and ... he loves me.

136
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.320
Am I so stupid so I ask ...

137
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.520
Tomorrow is our first wedding day and then we will go to Solgläntan.

138
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:44.240
- Want to see the brochure?
 - I know it outside.

139
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.440
I have wanted to go to Solgläntan for ten years, but it has not been done.

140
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.280
- What have you done then?
 - Wear hockey.

141
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.760
- Are you such a hockey fan?
 -No.

142
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:06.560
- Have you told Gustav?
 - Yes, then we went on a bandy instead.

143
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:13.480
But you have much else in common.
 Your children, for example.

144
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:19.040
I would give a lot for such lovely kids.

145
00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.040
How much do you have?

146
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:31.400
Honey, is this you are?
 Oh, what I have longed for you!

147
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:38.200
The best moment at Dan is when even loved ones come home from work.

148
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.200
Back home!

149
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.200
Lena, it's your turn to shovel!

150
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:56.080
- What was it with her?
 - Gustav, I want to talk to you.

151
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.840
-Where have you been?
 - Run around a bit and thought.

152
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.120
- I should do it more often.
 -Drive around?

153
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.600
The thing about Solgläntan was an idiotic idea.

154
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.600
It is we who need to travel away and do something romantic.

155
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.600
Göran and Annika are so new, they can have as much fun in the garage.

156
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.600
Not in our garage.

157
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:08.240
- So it was for us before.
 - But why did you never say away?

158
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.240
I thought you perceived the signals.

159
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.880
You know you have to be clear with me.

160
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.960
- Do you remember Leksands shirts?
 - As you burned in the boiler?

161
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:34.080
- Why do you think I did it?
 - For they missed the playoffs?

162
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:42.240
- Did you know what I was thinking about in the car?
 - Would it be good with a sausage?

163
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:48.640
I asked myself what I love most here in the world.

164
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:56.240
Sport or my wife?
 It depends on what sport you talk about of course.

165
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.240
But I just came to an answer ...

166
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.680
That I am more important than bandy but not even hockey?

167
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.680
The only thing that matters is you.

168
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.360
-Do you mean it?
 -I love you, honey.

169
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.640
From now on, there will be a change.
 We will decide everything together.

170
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.800
Wedding days, holidays, tip ...

171
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:34.560
Tomorrow after breakfast we decide together what to do this weekend.

172
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.760
No, you decide!
 You are planning our weekend.

173
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.800
- Did you know what you are getting into?
 - I've never known that.

174
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.720
- Good morning, kids!
 - Why is mom so strange?

175
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.520
We've had a small problem ...

176
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:10.520
Mom keeps the house and you meet us every other weekend?

177
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:18.160
Once you will understand how important it is to speak openly with each other.

178
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.680
-Hello Darling!
 -Slept well?

179
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.280
Should we go to the Flower Exhibition -

180
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:35.080
- Eat lunch at Stadshotellet and then go to the cinema tonight?

181
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:42.080
- There's nothing.
 - But I would have to decide?

182
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:48.200
I have changed my mind.
 It's better that I decide.

183
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.600
Hello?
 We want to know when to eat.

184
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:59.200
- We are in the middle of a discussion ... - at seven.
 Max eats fish sticks.

185
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:06.200
We are going to Pensionat Solgläntan.
 Göran and Annika take care of the children.

186
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.520
- Taxine is waiting.
 Are you ready?
 -No...

187
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:28.680
- Should we be alone with them?
 - Max, calm.
 We will be on Sunday.

188
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.400
Göran has a steam engine from 1971.

189
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.400
I have an air rifle from 1996.

190
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.040
Time to say goodbye to everyday life!

191
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.080
Hello then, Max and Lina.

192
00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:57.320
- What are we going to come up with now?
 - Do not turn, it can be late.

193
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.120
Stop there, Lina.
 Where are you going?

194
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:09.520
I'm not saying.
 Mom has said that you should not tell everything.

195
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:15.520
- Then I want to go out too!
 - No, you are too small.

196
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.000
- So sweet he is.
 - Lilla Gullesnutten.

197
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:27.880
- This one I never forget!
 -Neither do I.
