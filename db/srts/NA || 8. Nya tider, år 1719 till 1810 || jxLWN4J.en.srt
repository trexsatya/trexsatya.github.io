1
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.840
That is Axel von Fersen, the most powerful official in Sweden.

2
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.960
But it ignores the crowd outside - they want to tear him into pieces.

3
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.120
Now he hides for his life.

4
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.840
He was a close friend of Gustav III, interpreter for George Washington -

5
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.240
-And lover for French Queen Marie-Antoinette.

6
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.880
/ Banking/ But none of it helps him now.

7
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.880
At the beginning of the 18th century, Sweden is an exposed and exhausted land-

8
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.480
- After Karl XII's war.
 But out of the ashes something new is emerging.

9
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.040
New ways of thinking beats root.
 Trade and science flourishes.

10
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.680
With the enlightenment comes new ideas about freedom of the press and popular influence.

11
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.720
But it is a development that will encounter resistance.

12
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.880
This is the story of our country.

13
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.840
About the people and forces that have shaped it -

14
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.880
- Endure from the ice age until our days.

15
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.680
This is the story of Sweden.

16
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
/Upset votes/

17
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.720
Inside, Ulrika Eleonora - Sweden's Queen and Regent is located.

18
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.600
She will not gain as much power as her predecessors.

19
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.440
She has been forced to sign a new form of government.

20
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.640
It states that the Riksdag should appoint Sweden's king or queen.

21
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.880
The Riksdag has begun to raise its vote against the royal power.
 The time of freedom is here.

22
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.920
The most important thing for the Riksdag in 1719 is to abolish royal monarchy.

23
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.800
The change can almost be called a revolution in Swedish state.

24
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.160
During the 18th century freedom, Sweden receives a constitution-

25
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.760
- As closest to a republic in everything except the name.

26
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.560
The background to the revolution is Karl XII's long war.

27
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.680
The nobility wants to break the king's monarchy and put more power at the parliament -

28
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.000
- To not end up in a similar situation again.

29
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.200
When Karl XII dies, at that moment the ball meets him at the war scene -

30
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.000
- Breaks up noble commanders and heads on to Stockholm.

31
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.520
Work on a new form of government is being started.
 A chance they do not provide.

32
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.040
The nobles of the National Council manage to get Ulrika Eleonora -

33
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.400
- Giving up his right to inherit the throne of his brother Karl XII.

34
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.040
Instead, the Riksdag should choose her.

35
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.440
But after only one year as Queen, she is completely challenged from the throne.

36
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.800
Her husband Fredrik is elected king.

37
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.160
But he doesn't get so much power either.

38
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.200
He tries to strengthen his position through a coup attempt.

39
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.440
When things don't go as he wishes, he pulls back -

40
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.720
–And is engaged in leisure interests and hunting.

41
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.160
Fredrik I becomes a winged king.

42
00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.720
He is a member of the national council, but participates without much commitment.

43
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.440
Maybe it's not that strange.
 The King is no longer allowed to start war -

44
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.520
- Decide on taxes or enacts laws.

45
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.200
All things must be approved by Parliament.

46
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.080
It was greatly noticed abroad.

47
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.360
The enlightenment philosopher Voltaire considered Sweden to be the world's freest country.

48
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.840
Rousseau, who was also a philosopher -

49
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.440
- Called the Swedish form of government for an example of the perfect.

50
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.920
But the freest country in the world is not yet as free for everyone.

51
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.040
In Parliament, representatives of the four stands are:

52
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.480
Adel, priests, citizens and peasants.

53
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.920
But many Swedes are not a stand.

54
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.040
Those who are outside the system are those who lack property.

55
00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.200
For example, all service caves, boys and maids in the countryside.

56
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:08.000
They are in turn represented by the farmer who owns the land where they work.

57
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.920
But the influence of the farmers in Parliament is also limited.

58
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.840
The farmers are allowed to participate in the Riksdag, which was unique to Europe.

59
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.760
But they were excluded and were not allowed to participate in decisions relating to foreign policy -

60
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.800
- Finance policy and defense policy.
 They were not considered knowledgeable enough.

61
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.320
They were prejudiced that they would leak state secrets.

62
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.760
The 18th century is a time of change.

63
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.600
The farmers no longer accept the old rules of the game.

64
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.360
They do not want the nobility to decide on issues that affect their lives.

65
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:09.320
Outside the country, dissatisfaction boils.
 It's emergency year again.
 Many people have a hard time.

66
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.240
You miss the time when the country was ruled by a strong king.

67
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.920
It may seem strange that the Swedish farmers, omnipotence -

68
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.360
- Sized layers of the poor, stood on the king's side.

69
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.920
But for them, the king was a deputy for God.

70
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:43.960
A group of young noblemen are now drawing Sweden into a new war against Russia.

71
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.800
War costs human life, all farmers know very well.

72
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.960
The government's war against Russia was aimed at restoring the superpower.

73
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.280
One may have perceptions of how realistic that mindset was -

74
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.200
- But the war went to the forest.

75
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.960
Those who pulled Sweden into war have an unrealistic picture of a simple victory.

76
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.880
And they were not thinking about how these affected farmers.

77
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:21.200
They, in turn, wondered if it was not better to reintroduce a single empire.

78
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:27.080
A strong royal power could better protect their interests than the Riksdag.

79
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.200
The question is just who will take over after the now old Fredrik I.

80
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.000
He has been sitting on the throne for over 20 years without having children who can inherit the crown.

81
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.960
You have to find a follower of throne.

82
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.520
Now the farmers want to be involved and decide.
 The question is important to them.

83
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.680
In Dalarna you want the gentlemen in Stockholm to respect their opinion.

84
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.320
On the part of the rulers, this is partly incomprehensible.

85
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.960
Farmers should take care of agriculture, they are unkind on political issues.

86
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.360
Here they mix themselves in the absolute highest political level.

87
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.960
The governor has been assigned the task of speaking the valley farmers to the right.

88
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.160
But it is an impossible task.

89
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.640
They no longer want to listen to the authorities.
 They want to be heard themselves.

90
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.800
And not just on the question of the followers of the throne - the peasants require the stop at the war -

91
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.120
- And that the responsible generals are executed.

92
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.680
In thousands, they walk towards the capital.

93
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.000
Now the big valley uprising is a fact.

94
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.520
Here in central Stockholm, the farmers gather.

95
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.920
But the confident mood gradually transitions into concern.

96
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.760
The state power now decides to put the military against the farmers.

97
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.240
The rebellions had hoped to negotiate, but it will not be.

98
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.840
When it is morning, 90 farmers have been wounded and 40 have been killed.

99
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.080
Thousands are captured the days that follow.

100
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.320
The law states that rebellion should be punished with 120 sprouts.

101
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.680
And every tenth rebel is to be sentenced to death and executed.

102
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.200
But so far you don't go.

103
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:10.440
In this case, and usually it is so, the courts turn out to be gracious.

104
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.840
You do not want to create even more worry by executing a lot.

105
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.560
There are six leaders who are executed.

106
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.680
But you also take other methods to punish the farmers.

107
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.480
Instead of killing and tormenting, they are subjected to shame.

108
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.920
Those who have been imprisoned in Stockholm must eventually come home.

109
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.960
They are forced to go home without wearing a hat.

110
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.240
At this time, the hat is an important status symbol.

111
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.320
Not having a hat is like not wearing pants today.

112
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.640
It is an incredibly shameful way home that they get to suffer.

113
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.280
This is one of the last big peasant rebellions.

114
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.600
It does not end as the farmers hoped.

115
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.000
But there are signs of something new in the spirit of time, in politics.

116
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.400
Now the thoughts on influence have reached ever further down in society.

117
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.440
The valley uprising showed that the peasantry in general, not just in Dalarna -

118
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.800
- Began to have great political self -confidence.

119
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.080
They thought they would be involved and influence in all types of issues.

120
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:57.360
That they were knowledgeable and could participate on the same conditions as others.

121
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.960
During the freedom period, national policy is discussed in the country.

122
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.920
It is very important who is elected to the Riksdag.

123
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.440
There is increased political commitment.

124
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.400
It is not just in politics that new winds are blowing.

125
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.120
Now Sweden is seriously becoming part of the growing global trade.

126
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.120
Swedish goods are shipped far out into the world, especially iron.

127
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:43.000
Salted herring is exported to the Caribbean, as food to the slaves.

128
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.000
In 1731 the Swedish East India Company is formed.

129
00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:57.720
A trading company sailing with goods from Chinese Canton-

130
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.960
- Written Africa's headland, and then to Gothenburg.

131
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.840
The director of the company does not come from the land -owning aristocracy.

132
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
He is a merchant, ie a citizen.

133
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.600
The citizens will take up more and more space during the 18th century-

134
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.800
- Special when some of them get rich - really rich.

135
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.560
Two to three expeditions were enough.
 Then you could retire.

136
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.200
Now new, exotic goods are flowing into Sweden:

137
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.560
Tea, silk and cotton fabrics - and porcelain.

138
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.400
The item that the Swedes become extra fond of is coffee.

139
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.360
The coffee drinking spreads quickly in the population.

140
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:53.440
There is a practical reason: you could cook coffee again on the same sump.

141
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.880
As a result, both service people and poor people could taste this luxury.

142
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:06.000
But all these new foreign goods worry the rulers in several ways.

143
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.120
One is afraid that the kingdom will be emptied of assets, if the whole people -

144
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.720
- Even the simplest maids, get a taste for luxury goods that need to be purchased abroad.

145
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.520
In order to limit imports before you law for how to dress -

146
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.680
- What you can eat, and who can do what.

147
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.800
The new laws are not just about saving the country's economy.

148
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.080
The rulers also want to preserve the old order.

149
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.880
It is about a social order with strict hierarchies -

150
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.720
- And it was considered that the order at all costs must be retained.

151
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.560
You are almost obsessed with order.

152
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:53.520
You couldn't have people who acted as if they were better than they were.

153
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.680
Each would be in place.

154
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.200
An unequal society works worse unless the inequalities are visible.

155
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.520
So in the Swedish position society it was very important -

156
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.600
- The differences were made visible, preferably through the clothes.

157
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.560
Someone who challenges the order with their attire is this woman:

158
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.720
Maja Stina Kjellström will be nationally known as Bellman's Ulla Winblad.

159
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.360
But so far she is an unknown and poor woman.

160
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:38.240
Her fine coat of the most modern cut is not just a violation of the label.

161
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.480
It is a crime against the law, so she is arrested by the police.

162
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.320
Disorder feared man.

163
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.160
It was believed that society would go down if one questioned the order -

164
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.520
- or behaved in ways that did not fit.

165
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:05.680
It is mainly noble ladies that are allowed to dress in imported expensive fabrics.

166
00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:11.400
Citizens are allowed to wear velvet caps, and also mittens and muffs in velvet.

167
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.960
Service people and farmers should dress in Swedish linen and wool.

168
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.920
The fine is high for those who do not comply with the laws.

169
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.600
Anyone who does not have money may pay with a body penalty or prison.

170
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.760
But there are loopholes in the law.

171
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.080
There were some exceptions.
 If you worked with silk -

172
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.680
- You can get permission to wear these garments.

173
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.200
Maja Stina claims that she is authorized.

174
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:53.360
We also know that there were men who wrote false ones such conditions -

175
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.560
- Maybe to women who sold sexual services.

176
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.080
We also know that these garments were hard currency -

177
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.920
–And could be used as compensation in the 18th century sex trafficking.

178
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.520
Maja Stina shows a certificate.

179
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.120
How she got it we do not know, but she escapes punishment.

180
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.800
She is not alone in challenging the old order.

181
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.520
There were so many laws because people were inclined to break them.

182
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.960
And why that?
 They might want up, maybe wanted to live another life -

183
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.960
- behaved in a different way than what was predetermined for them.

184
00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:45.560
It becomes like a tug of war between the old and the new one that is emerging.

185
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.960
This is something that characterizes the entire 18th century.

186
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.680
The new one wins more land, and society is changing in many ways.

187
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.440
It is also the great century of science -

188
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.000
- Then the world is explored and explained.

189
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.240
Carl von Linné is considered to be one of Sweden's foremost scientists.

190
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:25.480
His way of systematizing and categorizing nature -

191
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.240
- Consider enormous impact in the world.

192
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.280
But in eagerness to classify he also divides the human race -

193
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.640
- In different varieties or types he ranked.

194
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:44.520
Something that many believe contributed to the emergence of scientific racism.

195
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.840
Linnaeus embarks on several trips where he studies plants and animals.

196
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
At the same time, he works for the state and studies geology and culture.

197
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.600
His most famous journey is the Lapland trip.

198
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.320
Linnaeus was not traveling just to map the flora.

199
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:15.320
He would map natural resources, what the state could make money on -

200
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:22.840
- So that resources in the state could be made useful for the good of the public.

201
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.120
State power has limited knowledge of what northern Sweden looks like.

202
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.520
When Linné returns from his journey with a thorough inventory -

203
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.640
- In a way, he bidders to the exploitation of northern Sweden.

204
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.200
Lapland's trip results in the book Flora Lapponica -

205
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.200
- As is an international spread.

206
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:59.920
Linnaeus believes in science, and is passionate about eagerness to explore nature.

207
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:05.480
But during the trips he sometimes encounters things that are difficult to explain.

208
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.720
The thinking of the time still has its restrictions -

209
00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.800
- As most people believe that what is in the Bible cannot be questioned.

210
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.880
On Gotland, Linné finds boulders of a rock that does not belong there.

211
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.040
It puzzles him.

212
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.040
We now know that the inland ice brought the boulders -

213
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.360
- For over 13,000 years ago.

214
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:39.440
Linnaeus knew nothing about the ice age.
 He believed, like others in his time -

215
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.920
- The earth was created by God for a short time and 6,000 years ago.

216
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.360
Of course, the ice age as an explanation model was not available.

217
00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:03.160
So Linné tried many different explanations for these boulders.

218
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.040
Finally he wrote down a ...

219
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.640
Maybe it was so that they were moved with streams along the seabed.

220
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.720
It is believed in the text that Linné is not entirely convinced of his explanation.

221
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.720
One can also see in his notes that he would have given the earth -

222
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.880
- A longer, older history - if there had been support for it in the Bible.

223
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.040
It's typical for this time.

224
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.840
Linnaeus, like many others, has a strong belief in science -

225
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.200
- But they are also deeply Christians, and deeply rooted in their faith.

226
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.360
But Linnaeus had a very big impact.

227
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.000
His work affected botany all over the world.

228
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.840
And he was involved in forming the Swedish Academy of Sciences.

229
00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.480
The Royal Academy of Sciences becomes an important force -

230
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:06.240
- And contributes to the researchers starting to think outside traditional courses.

231
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.120
Their research is solid, focused on practical benefit.

232
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.840
It's about streamlining beekeepers -

233
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.520
- And to dika arable land to increase production and make it rainproof.

234
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.440
It was the research they felt they needed.

235
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:30.280
The Swedish standing society had small margins, a lot of poverty, starvation -

236
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.120
- And a very underdeveloped agriculture in our eyes.

237
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.440
One constructs grain cleaning machines -

238
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.560
- Inspired by a Chinese model.

239
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.840
New tools and more efficient methods increase productivity -

240
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.920
- And facilitates the work for the farmers.

241
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:59.080
It is also now that you discover that potatoes are not just an ornamental plant.

242
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.320
The tubers of the plant in the soil turn out to be a filling food.

243
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.280
But they can also be used for something else, popular by many Swedes.

244
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:22.000
Scientific woman Eva de la Gardie's method of making spirits on potato -

245
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.520
- Spread quickly in the country.

246
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.360
She is the Society's lady, but beyond the glamor out on the estate -

247
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.680
- She makes both spirits and makeup of her newly invented potato powder.

248
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:42.640
With her knowledge of chemistry, she becomes the first woman in the Academy of Sciences.

249
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.640
But scientific discoveries and contacts with abroad-

250
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.840
- Not only the Swedes spirits and new agricultural machines.

251
00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.000
It is also the spark of the 18th century idea movement-the enlightenment.

252
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.600
The scientific, critical look that has long been directed at nature -

253
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.040
- Now aims at man and society.

254
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:23.680
It is thought that man can shape and improve his own world -

255
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.440
- With the help of science, studies, enlightenment.

256
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.200
By extension - better politics.

257
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.840
When you take part in all the progress made in science and other -

258
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
- So you realize that development and change is possible, and desirable.

259
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.960
It will be at the heart of the age of reason.

260
00:25:53.680 --> 00:26:00.080
Thinking freely is not without risk.
 The old order is struggling against.

261
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.760
The state censorship tries to stop what the rulers consider inappropriate.

262
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.120
Now this man has been called for questioning.

263
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.480
He has written a text that disturbs power.

264
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.840
He is from Helsinki and is called Peter Forskål.

265
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.280
His writing will have significance for the free word in Sweden.

266
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.600
It is a short pamphlet, with some powerful paragraphs.

267
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:32.160
It speaks for strengthened legal security and ownership, equality before the law -

268
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.440
- Improved the training system, and free and unlimited freedom of the press.

269
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:56.240
They probably expect a remorseful trash, but he does not regret it.

270
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:04.720
"Next life can be nothing more than freedom," he writes.

271
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.880
And he intends to argue that.

272
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.160
He succeeds in part, and gets away with a warning.

273
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.800
But the power holders still want to prevent the spread of the text.

274
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.960
The authorities know that the script cannot be banned.

275
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.640
It will only increase demand.

276
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.560
So the last resort is to prohibit all handling of the script -

277
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.720
- With threats of fines, unreasonably large fines.

278
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.840
The idea is that many may be curious about the script -

279
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.360
- But maybe not so curious that they want to risk leaving houses and home.

280
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:58.880
This is one of the few copies that remains today, the others were burned.

281
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:05.720
The content of the text was considered far too radically, dangerous.

282
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.840
This scripture presents the Swedish Press Freedom Ordinance - -

283
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
- One of our constitutions.

284
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:27.960
The Freedom of Pressure Ordinance arises at a time characterized by political debate.

285
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.440
The capital is the pulsating heart of political life.

286
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:37.520
The discussions are lively.
 New social groups are heard.

287
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.440
Not least the citizens, who are becoming more and more and want more influence.

288
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.200
Much of the politics is formed at the city's taverns and coffee houses.

289
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.720
Here, alliances are created, and political proposals are negotiated.

290
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.240
Conflicts between the various alliances in the Riksdag -

291
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.640
- Biders to make the Freedom of Pressure Regulation Swedish reality.

292
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.200
When the enlightenment ideas are spread, a power struggle is also underway

293
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.560
- Between two parties in Parliament: the hats and hats.

294
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:19.680
At the end of the time of freedom, the 1760s, the hats become the party for the nobility-

295
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.200
- While the caps were the party for priests, citizens and farmers.

296
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:32.600
The hats govern Sweden for a long time, increasingly powerful and corrupt.

297
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:39.160
The hats had prevented transparency in the state apparatus and the decision -making process.

298
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:45.080
In this way, they could have placed their allies on key positions.

299
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.680
When the hats still manage to take power in Parliament -

300
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.960
- They drive through extensive reforms to put an end to the hats.

301
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.920
One of them is the Press Freedom Regulation.
 When introduced in 1766–

302
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:05.240
- Is Sweden's first country in the world to introduce such a regulation as a law.

303
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:09.720
It reinforces the already intense political debate.

304
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.360
A river of magazines, books and pamphlets are printed.

305
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:20.040
On the city's walls and planks you can now publish critical texts.

306
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.920
You dare to express yourself drastically.

307
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.640
Some authors are progressive, with far -reaching requirements for change.

308
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:33.600
Against them are more conservatives trying to turn the clock back.

309
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.720
We again have the tension between old traditions and new ideas.

310
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:46.200
But the new ideas gain land.
 Criticism begins to be directed at the nobility:

311
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.120
Why should the nobility be allowed to keep their old privileges -

312
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.040
–And his exclusive right to prestigious offices?

313
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.360
There is a strong movement among the non-adequate stands.

314
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:03.480
Why cannot non-a-saddle that is merit and well-trained-

315
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.880
- Know the finest services?

316
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:14.400
Many nobles begin to feel that the privileges they have had are threatened.

317
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.040
For the nobility, this is worrying.

318
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.600
Now the three stands against them that everyone wants to take away from them their privileges.

319
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.200
They think that the radicalization of the political conversation has now gone too far.

320
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:38.240
The nobility begins to think that the time of freedom has become too free.

321
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.080
So the nobility changes foot.

322
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:47.200
From trying to limit royal power, they now want the king's support.

323
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.560
Gustav III is on the throne.

324
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.560
He has recently been crowned king.
 The nobility hopes for an alliance with him.

325
00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:01.800
Gustav III does not disappoint them, at least not at first.

326
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.240
When Gustav III comes to power all the reforms disappear -

327
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:12.160
-which was introduced during the freedom period of the non-a-adolescence.

328
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.520
The king is now for a more noble -friendly policy.

329
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:25.040
Gustav III exploits the new situation and takes back lost power.

330
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.080
He conducts a coup so that he gets freer hands to control Sweden -

331
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.640
–And gets enthusiastic support from the high nobility.

332
00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:41.040
Gustav III calls it a revolution in the spirit of the Enlightenment.

333
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.720
But it is a revolution from above.

334
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.280
What he does is cancel -

335
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:54.480
- The social and political reforms that have taken place at the end of the freedom period.

336
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.440
At one time he restores what was before -

337
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.680
- With a strong nobility with undisturbed social and economic preference.

338
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.000
/Song at a distance/

339
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.920
It is a party in this guard house at Skeppsholmen.

340
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:25.480
At The party there is a poet who will soon get his big break.

341
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.120
Namely Carl Michael Bellman.

342
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:47.480
Together with officer friends, he celebrates Gustav III's bloodless coup.

343
00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.960
Bellman has even written a show to honor the main character.

344
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.880
<c.sang> Gustaf's bowl!
 <c.sang> the best king, which the Nordic countries own

345
00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:10.360
<c.sang> he can't tolerate <c.sang> that the weight bowl unevenly weighs

346
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.520
<c.sang> Gustaf's bowl!

347
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.480
Bellman's show quickly gets the king's attention.

348
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:20.200
Gustav III became very fond of Bellman's work.

349
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:29.040
Bellman was known before, but as the king is paying attention to him -

350
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.760
- It is like having one on the hit lists, to trend on Instagram.

351
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.000
Everyone knew who he was.

352
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:43.880
The king's attention benefits Bellman's poor economy, at least for some time.

353
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.760
Previously, Bellman had a service at the Riksbank, but it did not fit well.

354
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:57.760
At Bank you should be good on counting and mathematics, and he was not.

355
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.400
He was always lousy on numbers in every way.

356
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.560
So he has to stop at the Riksbank.

357
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.360
With his way of life, he pulls on large debts.

358
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:14.080
Probably his tavern visit to the strained economy contributes.

359
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:19.200
On an unpaid pub is one of his few preserved script.

360
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.560
The bill also reveals that Bellman did not directly spit in the glass.

361
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.640
Together with his friends he has one evening drinking eight bottles of wine -

362
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.720
–And a bottle nice arrack.

363
00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.400
Bellman drank a lot, so did people.

364
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:42.320
You drank in a different way, spirits for breakfast for example.

365
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.720
But there is no indication that he drank more than others.

366
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.720
By the mid-18th century, spirits are part of the everyday diet.

367
00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.320
It contains calories and also works painkillers.

368
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.600
Even children with toothache or sleep problems could get a sup.

369
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.000
I think we have a hard time imagining the amount.

370
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:14.520
You can see in different sources, diaries and letters, that it is huge.

371
00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:21.240
A recommendation from 1754 says that you should stick to seven supar/day.

372
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.360
Then you could optimize the good effects.

373
00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.560
You cleared the stomach upon ascent, for breakfast you took a morning desert -

374
00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:38.560
- You triggered the appetite for dinner, and continued to the sleep soup.

375
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:50.120
You are happy to drink at the city's taverns.
 Here Bellman finds her inspiration.

376
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.080
In Fredman's epistles, Bellman does something new and unique:

377
00:36:54.240 --> 00:37:00.400
He writes about whores and drunk, groups you did not write about.

378
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.360
The people in Bellman's songs are taken from the real Stockholm -

379
00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.360
—The people he knows, such as the military and musician Movitz -

380
00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.520
- Or the watchmaker Fredman.

381
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.880
And not least the beautiful Ulla Winblad.

382
00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.320
It is Maja Stina, she with the coat, who is Ulla Winblad.

383
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.680
This is how she calls herself when she moves in Stockholm's nightlife.

384
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:45.320
Bellman's Ulla Winblad is the most beautiful - she is Venus, the goddess of love -

385
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.320
- And also a regular woman and prostitute.

386
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:02.240
She is already known as Ulla Winblad, some kind of party princess.

387
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.520
She shows up at taverns and bales, called horbals.

388
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.640
It was scandal -ridden and unauthorized parties.

389
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:21.440
For these parties came both simple women, maids and public women.

390
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:28.800
Here men with money could meet sexually available women.

391
00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.880
Many women at this time depend on men financially.

392
00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.080
But sex is risky, especially if you get pregnant without being married.

393
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:46.160
Maja Stina gives birth to a daughter except marriage, who dies after eight days.

394
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.640
But her worries don't end there.

395
00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:56.840
Maja Stina is reported.
 In the 18th century, it is a crime for unmarried to have children.

396
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.360
It is a crime to have sex outside of marriage for both men and women.

397
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:10.280
But usually it is the women who go there, while the men swear free.

398
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:18.040
Bellman's songs make Maja Stina known.
 Many now know who Ulla Winblad is.

399
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:26.360
It was probably too many humorous to connect this Venus figure -

400
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:33.720
- With the woman you recognized from the taverns and bales of reality.

401
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.640
For Maja Stina, it was a scourge that persecuted her life.

402
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.360
She did not want to be associated with Ulla Winblad, but did not get away.

403
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.960
Maja Stina marries and moves to Norrköping.

404
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.160
Maybe she hopes for a fresh start, far from Stockholm and poverty -

405
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.160
- Free from Ulla Winblad.

406
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.800
But Bellman's songs are spread far outside the capital.

407
00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.160
The rumor that Maja Stina is a role model for Ulla Winblad pursues her.

408
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.360
She does not let comments that connect the two pass.

409
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.960
In a preserved trial protocol-

410
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.520
- Has Maja Stina reported a note on the city's bulletin board.

411
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:32.080
There she is portrayed as a cheap pleasure for everyone who is interested.

412
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.240
It was the end-shaving of the time.

413
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.480
It is reminiscent of the scribble in telephone kiosks in the 70s-

414
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.280
- Or how you can be suspended today on the Internet.

415
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.320
When Gustav III comes to power he is a young and modern king-

416
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.200
- With great interest in art and literature.

417
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:35.280
We probably would not have had a Swedish opera or our literature without Gustav III.

418
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.200
He had a huge influence.

419
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:43.040
He was not only interested but also knowledgeable.

420
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:55.720
Gustav III sets up performances here at Drottningholm Castle Theater.

421
00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.920
He institutes cultural institutions such as the Swedish Academy and Dramaten.

422
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.560
Not least, he lets build the opera house -

423
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.920
–Ast form the scene of a crucial event in our history -

424
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.480
- Where King Gustav himself plays a lead role.
 But we're not there yet.

425
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.240
Gustav III was a skilled power player.

426
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.880
Certainly there is a cultural interest.

427
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.560
He wants to develop the culture and the arts.

428
00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.720
But it is also a demonstration of power.

429
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:40.800
The academies, the art projects, the buildings that are built -

430
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.000
- Also there to pay tribute to him.

431
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.480
Gustav III sees himself as an illuminated despot in the spirit of enlightenment.

432
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:56.600
He abolishes the reforms of freedom, but makes decisions that lie in time.

433
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:02.000
He prohibits torture, and in the face of an early form of religious freedom.

434
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.440
In 1775, Jews are allowed to settle in Sweden -

435
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.600
- The extent to convert to Christianity.

436
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:22.280
Later, they founded a synagogue, where the Jewish Museum now lies.

437
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:35.920
But there are no enlightened thoughts on religious freedom behind this.

438
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:42.440
They wanted the Jews to contribute knowledge, networks and capital.

439
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:49.000
In order to settle in Sweden as a Jew, you needed a security letter.

440
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.600
For that, they had to pay 2,000 riksdaler.

441
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.880
In today's monetary value equivalent to SEK 800,000.

442
00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:03.680
Only a small, privileged group of Jews ended up here in Sweden.

443
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:10.640
It is not easy for the first Jews to establish themselves here.

444
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.920
There is a hostility, mainly at the Citizenship -

445
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.120
- Which is afraid of competition.

446
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:24.600
So just a few years later, the freedom of the Jews begins to be limited.

447
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:31.440
The Judae regulations from 1782 state where they are allowed to live, what they are allowed to work with.

448
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:37.240
They are not allowed to marry non-Jews, and they must not testify in court.

449
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:43.720
And they are not allowed to work with something that competes with established crafts.

450
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.240
As a result, most Jews came to commerce.

451
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:54.280
And the textile and textile industry became a Jewish niche.

452
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.800
Freedom is the greater for Gustav III and his closest men.

453
00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.040
After a year -long trip in Italy and France -

454
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.960
- They show up art that they brought home.

455
00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.280
One of the guests is Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotta.

456
00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.920
She is married to the king's brother and lives near the center of power.

457
00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:35.440
A diligent writer who writes sharply about politics and everyday things.

458
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:41.280
She wrote all her life.
 One of the most important testimonies of time.

459
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:46.160
It is unusual for a woman so close to power that writes so much.

460
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:51.680
She writes about the young men who have been on Gustav III's journey -

461
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:56.120
–And that comes back to the Swedish court - spikes.

462
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:01.480
It was a common, comic figure in the 18th century:

463
00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:07.360
Extremely fashion conscious men with large wigs and tight costumes.

464
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.160
Also on the trip was Count Axel von Fersen.

465
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.280
He is an obvious part of Gustav III's closest circle.

466
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:36.320
He has a deal with Charlotte, and with many other women -

467
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.320
-Not at least Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France.

468
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:49.480
At the court, both women and men had great sexual freedom.

469
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.720
Of course, it was about women who were married.

470
00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.240
It was a common career path for young men.

471
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.720
They could ally themselves with an older, more experienced woman, with large network of contacts.

472
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:07.800
For a woman, it was positive to have relationships alongside.

473
00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:14.240
Then she appeared as beautiful, popular, worthy of loving.
 So it was positive.

474
00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.840
From his journey, the king's company does not just have statues with him.

475
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.560
They have also succeeded in a deal that the king longed for.

476
00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:33.960
They have negotiated with France, so that Sweden gets Saint-Barthélemy.

477
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.960
It is clear early on that the island is not suitable for plantation use.

478
00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.400
There are no roads, there is no fresh water in large quantities.

479
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:49.120
But this island could offer a very good place for trade -

480
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:55.720
- Special during war, which was often between Europe's great powers.

481
00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:02.880
In this neutral port, goods could be reloaded, not least slaves.

482
00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.880
In Sweden, slavery has been abolished since the 1300s.

483
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:17.240
But the Swedish state power decides that other rules apply to the colony.

484
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:25.080
Sweden copies parts of a French regulatory framework: code noir, black teams.

485
00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.320
There are extreme abuses against the Swedish slaves.

486
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:36.880
Sweden's history is full of oppression but characteristic of this system -

487
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:42.160
- Is one group so totally subordinate to another.

488
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:50.000
It would take until 1847 before Sweden completely abolishes slavery -

489
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.720
-By banning it even at Saint-Barthélemy.

490
00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.920
But a lot should happen before then.

491
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:08.880
At the end of the 1780s, Gustav III's popularity has dropped.

492
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:15.000
These are times of turmoil and miscarriage years, the alliance with the nobility cracking in the joints -

493
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.400
- And the king's luminous power has begun to fall.

494
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.160
When he also starts war on his own, against the nobility's will -

495
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.840
- They turn to him.

496
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.680
The alliance between the king and the nobility is broken.

497
00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.440
Gustav III is a strategist.

498
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.840
He realizes that if he can't bring the rebellious noblemen -

499
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.640
- So he can get support from elsewhere.
 So he turns to the farmers.

500
00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.400
He now gives the farmers the right to hunt on their own land.

501
00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.120
They also get the right to buy the earth they usually from the nobility.

502
00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.360
Something Gustav III abolished a few years earlier.

503
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:11.880
Because he is a skilled politician, he sells it as his own agenda:

504
00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:18.360
He does this with conviction, to promote the little ones in society.

505
00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.800
With the peasants on their side and other non-adequate help in the parliament-

506
00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.320
- Gustav III glanced to strengthen his power.

507
00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.800
It is a victory that annoys the nobility even more.

508
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:40.280
It will be expensive to him.
 Now he becomes isolated and alone.

509
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:59.200
Gustav III's sister -in -law has a party, but the king is not here.

510
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.760
What happens here is a boycott.

511
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:08.640
A boycott where several from the king's innermost circle participate -

512
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.960
- Till and with his own sister, Sofia Albertina.

513
00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.440
You organize your own parties, and do not go to the parties the king arranges.

514
00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:23.280
A good example of how women at the court could exploit their power.

515
00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:29.480
They do what they can.
 They cannot lead parliamentary debates.

516
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.960
Nor can they be part of political clubs.

517
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:37.040
But they can exploit their absence.

518
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.320
When they are not there, it is noticed and visible.

519
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:51.120
It is an effective means of power, which they have not exploited in the past -

520
00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.400
- To say to their friends: "Don't come at the king's parties."

521
00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.560
Then he cannot invite to a party either.

522
00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.600
The court life is a reflection of what is happening politically.

523
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:08.480
Gustav III appears to be lonely, ridiculous and weak.

524
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:23.240
The king's political game will cost more than loneliness and isolation.

525
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:29.160
When he lets out a noble officer who defied him and his war -

526
00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:33.000
- So it is the drop that causes the beaker to run over.

527
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.240
Charlotta writes:

528
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.960
"The poured blood fears I will shout revenge."

529
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:49.120
"The King of Dutch may one day regret his severity."

530
00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:07.480
She gets right.
 A group of noblemen conspire about killing the king.

531
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:31.600
This costume carries the king on March 16, 1792-

532
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:36.080
- On a masquerade ball at the opera he himself had to build.

533
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.840
There he is shot by Jacob Johan Anckarström.

534
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.560
13 days later Gustav III is dead.

535
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.560
Three years later, the king's guardian Bellman also dies.

536
00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:15.280
He is from a wealthy family, but is buried in an unmarked grave.

537
00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:29.600
Maja Stina, who is said to rest here at Maria Magdalena cemetery -

538
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.760
- Make a reverse trip.
 She marries, and up.

539
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.920
She ends her life quite well -off.

540
00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:43.240
Then the year is 1798, and a new Sweden rests around the corner.

541
00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.240
Many more will rise up in society.

542
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.840
The old rulers are no longer sitting.

543
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.400
Axel von Fersen is now a national marshal, the highest official of the court.

544
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:17.880
But he is in a country that has changed shape in several ways.

545
00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:23.680
Finland, the eastern national half, is no longer Swedish - since 1809

546
00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:29.080
- And won't be again.
 As a result of yet another lost war against Russia.

547
00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:33.600
It's not the only thing that happened.

548
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:39.640
Gustav IV Adolf, Gustav III's son, has been deposed in a coup.

549
00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:47.760
There is a lot of concern in society.
 It swings on all levels.

550
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:54.480
One tries to find ideologically and practically how society should be arranged.

551
00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:58.240
It is questioned the value of the old hierarchies.

552
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.840
In 1809 Sweden gets a new form of government -

553
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.920
- Which means the end of the royal monarchy for good.

554
00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:16.240
From now on, power is shared between the king, the government and the parliament.

555
00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.000
What happens in 1809 is truly revolutionary.

556
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:23.680
1809's Constitution and Government Form -

557
00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:29.760
- Not as before perfect, divine, infallible.

558
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:37.440
On the contrary, it is said that constitution and constitution must be able to change.

559
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:44.760
In the midst of this revolutionary mood -

560
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:49.320
- The rumors are spread that Axel von Fersen is counteracting the new board.

561
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:53.440
On the way through Stockholm, he is chased by a crowd.

562
00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:59.240
He manages to escape into a house, but the crowd is after him.

563
00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:04.440
At this time, his revelation for many is a pure provocation.

564
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:10.840
That he has been so close to both the Swedish kings and the French-

565
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.640
- Makes that he is largely a symbol of the old type of aristocracy.

566
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.640
The thought that the old order, with von Fersen in the tip -

567
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:34.000
- would conspire power, arouses an uncontrolled anger.

568
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.760
He dies on the street, disgraced.

569
00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:53.160
The murder can be seen as a ritual murder on the old order.

570
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:58.200
An expression of the social resolution that prevailed in Sweden.

571
00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.080
One has lost Finland, the king is deposed -

572
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:07.320
- And here is one of the highest officials of the kingdom Lynchad on the open street.

573
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:27.440
In here, at the Riddarhuset, the news strikes like a bomb.

574
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:33.640
The murder is a sign that the power of the nobility and the king is not what it has been.

575
00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:38.200
It is soon over the old time and the old order.

576
00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:44.040
In the 19th century, more and more people in society will require rights.

577
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:49.840
Sweden takes the first steps towards democracy and government.

578
