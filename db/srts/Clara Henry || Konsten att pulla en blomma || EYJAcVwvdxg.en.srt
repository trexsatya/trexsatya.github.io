00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
MORNIN MORNIN MORNIN


2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.240
Pussies before guys, y'all.


3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.660
HHHAAAAAAA


4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.380
What am I doing


5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.380
Is this rolling?


6
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.780
Okay! Hi! Hello! How are you!


7
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.140
A while ago, me and Keyyo a.k.a Kristina were in Japan.


8
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.700
Phone company Comviq sent us there to record the youtube series "Welcome to Japan" which now is out on the internet!!!


9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.240
The second episode came out on Thursday, in which we visit a fish market and a very special restaurant.


10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.480
And this restaurant is the strangest thing I've ever been to in my entire life.


11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.120
So many strange things were going on there,


12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.380
so I thought that I'd make a story time today


13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.260
to tell you about what really happened at the Kagaya restaurant.


14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.660
I'd actually recommend you to watch the episode first, link in the description,


15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.320
because what I'm about to tell you is all my own experience


16
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.740
it's some sort of bonus material if you wish,


17
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.500
which we chose not to show in the episode because it's basically too rude.


18
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.280
Yep.


19
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.820
Well, it all starts with us going to a fish market.


20
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.640
We were at the market and found out that we were being sent to a restaurant.


21
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.640
But we eat at restaurants every day, so we start wondering what we're supposed to record, there has to be some kind of content.


22
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.640
So we arrive at the restaurant, there's a frog on the outside of the building,


23
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.380
quite an ugly frog.


24
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.480
It's just like an ordinary residential, there are stairs going both up and down,


25
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.060
and photographer Erik and producer Teo goes down the stairs to the basement floor,


26
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.580
telling me and Kristina to wait on ground floor.


27
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.220
It takes a while until Teo comes back up


28
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.260
and when he does, he tells us that this restaurant is driven by a man, Mr Kagaya, and his mother


29
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.360
so his mother cooks the food while he does the entertainment.


30
00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.460
So the thought was initially that me and Kristina should take part in this show.


31
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.700
I went like "oooooohhhhhhh no"


32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.360
I don't like showing. I'm not a shower. I'm no entertainer.


33
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.700
I like sitting in my sofa, speaking to my camera.


34
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.560
That's the total amount of show I can expose myself to.


35
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.400
So I'm like "oh fuck"


36
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.240
But then it seemed like Mr Kagaya changed his mind in the last minute.


37
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.980
He's afraid that we won't understand his art so he wants to see how we are,


38
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.020
and if he likes us, then he'll allow us to be on the show.


39
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.880
I'm like *breathing out* gosh that's a relief,


40
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.460
there's a risk of us not getting along well, which means I don't have to do the show.


41
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.780
Yaasssss.


42
00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.080
Naah. Mostly I'm thinking of how amazing it is to be in Japan and to challenge myself.


43
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.540
Of course. Mostly that.


44
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.920
But a tiny part of me is glad that I maybe don't have to pull off a show.


45
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.560
Anyway, we follow Teo down in the basement


46
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.340
and end up in the tinyest room, like 10 square metres,


47
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.200
no windows because it's in the basement, bright yellow walls,


48
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.840
and a super strong ceiling lamp, so it's not really cozy time.


49
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.540
We sit around a table, people drop in and finally it's full.


50
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.160
And that's when Mr Kagaya enters to start the show.


51
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.560
The first thing he does, after standing and saying "hello hello welcome"


52
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.520
... and he goes quiet...


53
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.400
... and then he hits his hands together and starts screaming.


54
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.120
Something like that.


55
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.660
We start giggling, like, what is going on


56
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.700
he he?


57
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.240
Then he starts singing a jingle. Very monotone. Goes like this:


58
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.580
DA-TADAAAAAAAAAAA. DA-TADAAAAAAAAAAA.


59
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.020
And he kinda squats down


60
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.980
and starts jumping, tiny jumps on both feet, towards me and Kristina


61
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.400
while he does like this.


62
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.300
So eventually he is all the way up in our faces doing like


63
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.000
DA-TADAAAAAAAAAAA


64
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.780
I know that the air is free for anyone but JESUS, MAN


65
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.100
So he's up doing datada in our faces and then, the first act is finished.


66
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.500
Then he brings in the menu, which is a coloring book.


67
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.300
He has written the menu himself.


68
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.580
And this menu, when he puts it on the table, we spot that there's a flower on the front page.


69
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.600
So he starts to...


70
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.520
... he starts to touch the flower.


71
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.560
Damn why am I so shy? He starts fingering the flower, okay.


72
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.000
He starts pulling the menu flower.


73
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Do you understand me?


74
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.400
The flower is a vagina.


75
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.200
And this is just solely uncomfortable.


76
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.300
It's not only the fact that he is fingering it,


77
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.740
he's also making very... sensual noises.


78
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.760
I don't know why I find this disturbing. It may be because I'm kinda shy.


79
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.800
It could also be taht I'm not quite ready to start sexualising flowers.


80
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.320
The flower gets an orgasm. Which flowers get, of course.


81
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.940
I never thought I'd say those words.


82
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.040
So it's time for us to order.


83
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.460
And we have to sing our order.


84
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.180
So spontaniously, I don't feel like singing in a room full of strangers and with Splay's camera in my face.


85
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.140
And Kristina was like "I can't sing. What do we do?"


86
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.940
So we're like "let's do a rap!"


87
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.920
So Kristina does a rap while I go like "uhm chicka aah chicka uhm"


88
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.500
while I hold my hand like this because that's what they do in cool beatboxing movies


89
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.840
and the order is approved!


90
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.720
High five.


91
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.240
Anyway, we get our foods and drinks


92
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.660
I eat tofu and pumpkin and like, it is what it is, but it's actually kinda tasty.


93
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.960
So we have our dinner and when we're finished, he begins his final act.


94
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.140
He walks into his little walk in closet and puts a big piece of cardboard in front of the entrance.


95
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.380
A couple of minutes go by and suddenly, a puppet frog appears.


96
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.660
This frog starts talking to us: "helloooo?"


97
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.780
We're like "hello".


98
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.260
"What's your name?"
"... Clara, Kristina."


99
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.260
"Have you seen my cousin?"


100
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.960
No. We haven't seen your cousin.


101
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.120
"Do you know my cousin's name?"


102
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.840
No. How do you expect us to know what your cousin's name is.


103
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.860
"My cousin's name... is Dick."


104
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.900
Well of course your cousin's name is Dick, anybody surprised in here? Didn't think so.


105
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.100
So this bloody frog puppet starts chanting "DICK! DICK! DICK!"


106
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:29.580
"COME OUT DICK!" and we're like oouuuuhhh should we really? Couldn't Dick just stay where he is?


107
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.700
"COME OUT DICK!!!" and then when he has shouted this like 75 times


108
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.280
he kicks away the piece of cardboard,


109
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.820
and jumps out wearing a frog suit,


110
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.300
so he puts this frog puppet as some kind of genital


111
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.540
gallops over to our table and starts humping our faces.


112
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.720
Just let that sink in for a second.


113
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.560
dick, dick dick


114
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.380
grwaaaaaaaaaahhh


115
00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.580
*humping sounds*


116
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.980
I don't even know.


117
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.260
Mr Kagaya, you're wacky.


118
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.060
Seriously. Get help.


119
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.460
Do you understand what I meant when I said that this is the craziest thing I've experienced?


120
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.200
So like I said, this is what happened at the Kagaya restaurant


121
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.580
which never made it to the "Welcome to Japan"-episode.


122
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:24.320
That's all for this video, and don't forget to go watch the episode!! I think it's hilarious.


123
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.000
Also if you watch it and comment and like, maybe me and Kristina can travel to other places and that would be nice.


124
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.580
Anyway, this video is at it's end,


125
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.200
Take care and I'll see you guys as usual next week.


126
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.140
Bye!


127
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.840
PUSSIES BEFORE GUYS Y'ALL!!!


128
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.840
Oh god aah iiih ooh help no
