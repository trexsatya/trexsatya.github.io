1
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.160
-What will you do today?
 - Not a shit.

2
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.160
-Just take it easy.
 - Fan what a nice.

3
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.320
THE PHONE IS RINGING

4
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.480
- It's Elin.
 - Hi Elin.
 - Hi, Leif.

5
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.600
Sorry for the nuts.
 Next time it will be beef, not fox meat with nuts.

6
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.880
-What did he say?
 - He apologizes.

7
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.000
He gave nuts to someone who could not tolerate.

8
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.160
What happens?!
 - Stupid, you have given her nuts!

9
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.360
- How is it with you, Elin?
 -Alright.
 I may come home today.

10
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.680
- I was going to ask you for a service.
 -Obvious.

11
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.760
Grandma is alone in the house.
 Could you look at her?

12
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.880
Of course we can look at Gamkäri ... the little ... Grandma yours.

13
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.080
Thanks.
 I'm back at three o'clock.

14
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.960
We will fix that.
 We look at her.

15
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.520
We have to go over and look at 'Na.

16
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.760
-Hello!
 - Hallå, Grandma!

17
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.880
It is Leif and Billy who come to look at you.
 Hello, Anna-Greta.

18
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.480
- Here she sits in and day out.
 - It is strange that she looks depressed.

19
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.120
What if she sits and starves?
 She may be hungry.

20
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.400
- She would need some fresh air.
 - Should we bring her out on a turn?

21
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.480
Just right, Billy.
 Get the wheelchair.

22
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.880
Surely it will be nice, Grandma?
 So you can join the village, in Volvon.

23
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.040
I have an alarm from Anna-Greta's home in Sörbäcken.
 I check it.

24
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.360
- This is where you like, huh?
 - She may want to go a little.

25
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.080
Do you want to go on a cord with Volvon?

26
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.320
-Satan, Leif!
 - That was fun?

27
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.240
- Is she?
 - No, she just sits there.

28
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.760
- Want Grandma go and eat at the grill?
 -We'll do that.

29
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.280
Hello?
 Anna-Greta?

30
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.720
I have been looking through the whole house and she is not here.
 We call the police.

31
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.640
See if she wants any food.

32
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.920
Now, Grandma, we have a large teddy bear sausage going on.

33
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.680
Shouldn't you have some?

34
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.160
Anna-Greta, you have to eat, otherwise you die.

35
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.400
Sit back and enjoy the sausage.

36
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.160
Now local news.

37
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.960
A woman in her 80s has been reported disappeared by the home service.

38
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.240
The police have made a search.

39
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.120
A tasty sausage with a little mustard and ketchup and bread will be loaded.

40
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.640
It is not possible to get her to eat.

41
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.040
I'm not going to beed with her, now it must be good.
 My limit is reached.

42
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.040
If she wants to set hard against hard, we must play that game.

43
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.560
- Maybe the last time she sees the sun.
 - Or get good food in the stomach.

44
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.360
It is finished.
 Now we go home and lock you in again.

45
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.800
Do you manage to stand up when you haven't eaten anything?

46
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.520
It's like taking care of an infant.

47
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.080
Now we go home to the cave hole.
 - Write it down on the bill.

48
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.400
The police.

49
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.200
I've seen the wanted aunt.
 I think she is kidnapped.

50
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.920
It is sad that you do not want to eat, drink or be out.

51
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.720
When given the chance, you should take it.

52
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.840
SIRENS

53
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.840
- Hell, Leif, the cop is behind us.
 - What the hell is that now?

54
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.600
- You have paid the car tax?
 - No, I happened in it.

55
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.960
The heat pump collapsed and I had to pay it too.

56
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:17.400
- Are they deaf?
 Don't they hear the sirens?
 - And he drives in the middle of the road.

57
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:25.120
- I get nervous, now the heart jumps.
 - I have to try to maneuver.

58
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.880
Okay - I flash right, then I turn left.

59
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.240
He drives like a damn fool.
 Call and hear what he is doing.

60
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.400
- They are still there.
 Hell, Leif.
 - Curse parasites!

61
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.720
THE PHONE IS RINGING

62
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.800
–Leif.
 - It's the police.
 Stop the car.

63
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.680
I'm not out driving a car.

64
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:09.360
I would never drive an untaxed and undeveloped car.

65
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.080
That's not why.
 You have a wanted woman in the back seat.

66
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:23.280
Anna-Greta is wanted by the home service.
 We see her in the back seat.

67
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:31.360
Wait a second.
 -They say that Anna-Greta is wanted.

68
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.480
She has probably pressed the alarm bell on her hand.

69
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.640
Kidnapping, it gives 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years ... It can be Guantánamo!

70
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:50.320
- Don't say so, Leif, I panic!
 - Take it easy, I'll be on something.

71
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.560
- Hall again.
 - What the hell are you doing?!
 Stop the car!

72
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:05.520
What did you say, Anna-Greta?
 You want to stop and tell the truth to the police?

73
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:12.720
She says she wants us to stop and talk.
 She wants to tell you something.

74
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:19.240
- We turn in here.
 - Yes, now he turns in.

75
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.960
- What the hell are you doing?
 -We...

76
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.720
Leif, silent.
 -Anna-Greta, how are you?

77
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.680
We should be honest.

78
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:49.840
We would look at the car, because it is not estimated or inspected.

79
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.240
But it was gone.

80
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.800
We took a walk down the village and looked, and we found it.

81
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:05.880
- Guess who was sitting in it?
 - she put in the car?

82
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.080
Okay?

83
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.840
Yes, she has stolen the car.

84
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.400
- You say she has stolen your car?
 -Yes.

85
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.960
Is that true, Anna-Greta?

86
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.440
After all, she is ashamed and gets a total heavy heap.
 She is not doing well.

87
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.000
-Anna-Greta?
 - We should not stress her up anymore.

88
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:40.200
- We drive her home, that's good.
 - We do not want to make any notification.

89
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.600
She is spinning in the skull and does not know what she is doing.

90
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:51.640
- Then we trust that you drive her home.
 -Yes.

91
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.680
Okay then.
 Run legally.
 And inspect the car.

92
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.760
Fy damn, it was close to the eye.

93
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.520
-What time is it?
 -I do not know.

94
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.080
Elin comes home in a quarter!
 We have to take the shortcut home.

95
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.440
Take it easy!
 The girl is on the seat.

96
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.080
-Hello Hello!
 -Hello.

97
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.480
-Hello?
 -Hi Elin.

98
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:47.040
- How did it go on sickness?
 -Good.
 But ... no more nuts for me.

99
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.560
No, no more ... nuts for me.

100
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:56.840
- How has it been today?
 -Good.
 We have taken it easy.

101
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.520
-How nice.
 What did the home service do here?
 - We invited them to some coffee.

102
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.480
-We have spiced up Anna-Greta.
 - She needed a little piff.

103
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.120
- Can you offer a thank you dinner?
 -I do not know...

104
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:20.640
We go on a six-seven diet.
 We have to go home and fast before the sun goes down.

105
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.800
- Thanks for you could set up.
 -No problem.
 Thanks.

106
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.920
- Hi, Elin.
 -Oh.
 Hello.

107
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.600
Has things been going well today, Grandma?
 But, how do you look!

108
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.840
Have they made up you?!

109
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.880
