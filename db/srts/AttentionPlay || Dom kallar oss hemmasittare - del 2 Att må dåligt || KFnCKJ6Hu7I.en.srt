1
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,320
My teachers and classmates must have taken that I did not

2
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:35,960
was feeling something good.

3
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
I have had problems with self -harm and such and it was

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,160
Not something I hid because I wanted people to

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,400
Know so I couldn't say I needed help.

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
But I needed help and I want people to understand.

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,880
Yes, the doctors, they said I was exhausted, but they put

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,880
No diagnosis on it.

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,920
I had a lot of performance anxiety and then became

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,360
that I thought exactly all the time about what I did and how

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,080
it would be submitted and every little thing would be

12
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,920
Perfect for me.

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,840
And to think so all the time was not sustainable for me

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,560
And my feeling.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,440
So it became very, very difficult in the end.

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,840
I was exhausted.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,160
They just thought I was tired of school and happened in school.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,480
Because I was not at school and I was up on

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
The nights and slept in the days.

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,800
So my biological clock was not there.

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,640
When I was home that I really had shit.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,200
It was the lowest point in my life I would say.

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,760
It was as I said before that I go about high school so will

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,240
I kill myself and I have met people who say that

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,440
It's extreme.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,960
But it really was.

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,800
It was like that.

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,720
Then there are no points.

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,120
I can't, I can't handle it to high school.

30
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,280
So yeah, I've never felt worse.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,960
Partly I was glad I was home and I

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,920
let go of school, which made me like satisfied

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,360
in the whole.

34
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,240
But how do you really feel when you sit at home,

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,640
isolated and playing TV games on at night and up in the days

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,600
Or sleeps in the days at night?

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,640
How are you doing?

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,880
I think it says a lot of my feeling.

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,200
After all, it was on the summer holidays between the six and seven.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,800
We used to go out to our cabin by the DalÃ¤lven and swim.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,840
But I was just lying inside.

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
I couldn't be able to be out and bathe and

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,840
It was well where we noticed that something was wrong.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,240
It is hard not to think negatively because one does the same

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,880
thing every day.

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,840
You wake up, stay home and go to bed basically.

47
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,680
You meet the same people and you see that it is going well

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,280
for them.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,680
It went well for my siblings to go to school, so why went

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,600
that good for me?

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,520
And it becomes more negative the more

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,000
It is built up.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,520
I felt the worst.

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,080
So I even stopped going on the handball that was one of

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,880
my favorite chores before because I had kind of not peppy

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,640
to do something.

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,120
I felt completely emotional and not yes, it didn't feel

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
Like I wanted to do something.

59
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
My self -image deteriorated I would say.

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,680
And thus my self -respect.

61
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,880
All this is connected.

62
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,280
And to see everyone else go to school, my siblings,

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,480
go to school and see my siblings become annoyed and

64
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,440
confused that I was not at school creates a

65
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,880
confusion in me.

66
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,080
There is something human about comparing yourself to others.

67
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,120
It feels like everyone does.

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,640
I think it is quite natural to do it and

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
I compared myself to everyone around me, with my siblings,

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,800
With my classmates, with my friends and such.

71
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,480
But for me there were.

72
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,360
It was a time when it went over from comparing to

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
That you went.

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,880
It was against someone, that was all the time became one

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Competition against everyone.

76
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,200
And I know it even now that I've finished high school.

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,760
But it feels like my job is too bad or that I

78
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,000
performs too bad or that I am not really where I

79
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,240
want to be because everyone else is like,

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,080
Everyone else is so good.

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,120
Although not true.

82
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I often asked mom what it was wrong, why I didn't

83
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,640
Went when everyone else could.

84
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,880
And for every single day that went as I was at home that have it

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,080
also even more worse because I thought how much had

86
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,880
missed and I would not get with me and all the tests and

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,920
Rating and all that I sabotaged all the time.

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,760
And then it was laid on even more anxiety

89
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,040
than just performance anxiety.

90
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,040
Now that I've got a functioning schooling so have

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
Like everything has started to work it with talking to people

92
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,600
And the medicine also helps in a large part.

93
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,040
After I started at my new school, I felt that I got

94
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,760
more self -confidence because I was able to be with more on

95
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,440
the lessons and then I hung with more teaching and

96
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Succeeded on the tests.

97
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,120
I never had to reproduce or anything and then I had

98
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,760
more self -confidence in myself that I would actually succeed

99
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,240
with my goals in life and then I managed to fight further and

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
come to school more often and stuff like that.
