1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,880
The art of moving to the country.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,120
Have you ever thought about moving to the country?

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,840
It's been almost ten years since I took that step - and I haven't regretted it.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,340


5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:14,880


6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,740
Time goes by and everything does not go as you imagined.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,720
I was going to do a little series about what it's like to be a beginner in the country.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,340


9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,700
This first part will be an introduction. Then I intend to address other topics such as:

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,380


11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,480
Economy,

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,760
how to support yourself,

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,600
buying a farm

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,620
Utensils, neighbors and much more. I have many ideas.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,120


16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,100
If you come up with more ideas then write in the comments and will put it

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,860


18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,800
on my to-do list.

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,540


20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,180


21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,260
That said - it's been almost exactly ten years now since i bought the farm.

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,660


23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,420
and everything has not become as I imagined.

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,180
But much has nevertheless fallen into place.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,860


26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,200
In the beginning when I had the farm - when I had just moved here full time.

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,700


28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,200


29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,240
I took a course in food crafts

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,200
One of the first tasks was to paint with watercolors.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,700


32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,620
You would show with a picture what you thought the future would look like.

33
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,120


34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,560
Much has actually become as I planned.

35
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,080


36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,580


37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,020
If you look at the map here – don´t get stuck in the artistic qualities.

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,420
I know it's a masterpiece. But see beyond that.

39
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,700
See what it represents instead.

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,200


41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,440
In this picture I have included the dreams I had for the future.

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,740
You can see here: the bees,

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,880
The pond with the crayfish cultivation - it was not dug then.

44
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,700
The forest is gone and instead I have crops.

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,340


46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,920
Rhubarb cultivation and apple cultivation. You see the hens too

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,420


48
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,200
I even got a bus stop.

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,340
One of the ideas I had.

50
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,200
All of these things have actually come true.

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,740


52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,560
But, not everything has become exactly as I thought.

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,300


54
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,000
I had three more hopes:

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,540


56
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,280
That I would be rich, powerful and an amazing lover.

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,100
Everything will not be as you imagined,

58
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,420
but one in three is not so bad.

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,020


60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,160
That said, this is supposed to be a series about what it's like to be a beginner in the country.

61
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,660


62
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,340
There is a lot of television being made and a lot is being written about how fantastic it is in the country.

63
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:47,840


64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,960
But they only show the sunny side.

65
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,460


66
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,580
With this series I'm planning to give you the whole picture, from my experience anyway.

67
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,200


68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,980
and bring both - the good - and the bad. (You may remember that TV series.)

69
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,480


70
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:02,980


71
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,920
I will also adress the problems, it will not be exactly as you planned.

72
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,420


73
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,360
There are drawbacks to living in the countryside.

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,860


75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,200
Mainly practical: there are long distances

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000


77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,960
you usually pay higher taxes when you live in the countryside

78
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,460


79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,060
and you usually get worse service.

80
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,480
There is worse public transport

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,980


82
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Worse - or at least longer to medical care.

83
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,700
The time to get an ambulance here is considerably longer than in Stockholm.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,580


85
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,080


86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,620
That is a part of the decision to move to the country.

87
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,080
There are still plenty of qualities.

88
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,800


89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,380
The great quality of living in the countryside is freedom.

90
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,880


91
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,040
You have freedom and a huge amount of opportunities to do the things you want to do yourself

92
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,300
and that's hard to do in town.

93
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,820


94
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,300
If you live in a residential area it can even be difficult to have chickens if the neighbors complain.

95
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,800


96
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,480
Here you can get chickens - start beekeeping without anyone protesting.

97
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,080


98
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,260
You can get lots of animals if you are interested.

99
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,760


100
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,060
If you are interested in cultivation you can do it on a variety of scales.

101
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,140
You can have your little garden where you grow your own apple tree

102
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,680
or you can farm on a big scale.

103
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,160
It all depends on what you want to do yourself.

104
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,140
If you, like me, are beginners in the country, it requires a lot of change.

105
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,640
Above all to think about

106
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,080
to start thinking about things you didn't do before.

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,580


108
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,200
For example, there are no property managers.

109
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,680
If a pipe freezes in the barn during the winter, you have to deal with it.

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,180


111
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,760
and you have to deal with it right away.

112
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,360


113
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,880
If an animal gets sick or injured then you have to deal with that situation.

114
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,960
And you have to deal with it right away.

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,460


116
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:05,060
When I moved I thought that it would be a more stress free environment in the country.

117
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,560


118
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,060


119
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,540
And it is in many ways-

120
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,500
Especially because I decide for myself what to do, and when to do it.

121
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,920
By and large.

122
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,700
But when things happen, you have to deal with it. There is no one else to turn to.

123
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,880
Not in the first stage anyway. You have to take responsibility yourself.

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,580


125
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,580
This can be seen as a disadvantage - or an advantage.

126
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,080


127
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,280
The advantage is that you feel that you are in control of this yourself.

128
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,660
This is also a big difference between having a holiday home in the countryside

129
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,420


130
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,980
Spending a few months in the summer cottage is not at all the same thing as living in the country.

131
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,480


132
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,260
Above all, you will notice the difference during the winter months.

133
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,760


134
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,120
When you have maybe six months where most of the day consists of compact darkness.

135
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,700


136
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,900
My first winter out here – one of the first steps was setting up exterior lighting.

137
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,700


138
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,320
So that you could see something outside the windows.

139
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,960
It is easy to feel claustrophobic otherwise.

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
You also have to get used to dealing with loneliness.

141
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,220
I have had no problems with that. But if you are a very social person

142
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,720


143
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,660
it may be a struggle.

144
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,180


145
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,680


146
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,360
In the summer you can have visitors all the time

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,500
not so many want to visit the farm in January.

148
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,640


149
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,140


150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,860
However, what you have - which you do not have in town - is the neighbors.

151
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,400


152
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,400
The neighbors! I know pretty much all the neighbors here. I didn't do that in Stockholm.

153
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,700
There I hardly knew who lived in the door next door.

154
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,200


155
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,780
Here you have some form of contact with just about every neighbor

156
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,520
and it's a real community.

157
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,020


158
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,000
We know each other and we hang out. Not every day, not every week, but regularly enough

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,620


160
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,000
so that you feel: If something happens I can call the neighbors.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,500


162
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,760
Neighbors are more important than authorities, municipalities, police and so on.

163
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,260


164
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,760


165
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,880
It is the neighbors who are first in place if something happens.

166
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,440
Like when the barn was burning.

167
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,280
Then the police and fire brigade did not come first - it was the neighbors.

168
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,080


169
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,620


170
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,440
This is a small taste of this series. I'm planning for it to come out

171
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,940


172
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,880
once a week. The goal is a new episode every weekend.

173
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,860
If you like the idea, give me a thumbs up

174
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,360


175
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,900
and if you want to follow life on the farm and this series, please subscribe to this channel.

176
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,400


177
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,660
Bye – see you again soon.
