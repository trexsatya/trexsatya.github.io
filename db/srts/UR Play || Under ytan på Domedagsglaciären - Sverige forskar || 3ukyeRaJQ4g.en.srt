1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04.920
There is a gigantic glacier in the West Antarctic.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,320
It is called the doomsday glacier, because if it crashes into the sea-

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,400
-Resiacating coastal cities all over the earth to disappear below the surface.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,880
My name is Anna Wåhlin and I am a professor of oceanography.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27.560
We are the first to mapped out what is happening under the surface of thwaites-

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,720
-An known as the doomsday glacier.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,640
Thwaite's glacier on the western part of the South Pole is one of the world's largest.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,480
To explain the size, it is 40 % of Sweden's area.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,080
It is called the doomsday glacier because the ice is about to melt now-

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09.840
-And we don't know how fast it will go in the future.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,280
If it goes fast, the earth's water level will rise much faster-

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,880
-And it would have very big negative consequences for many.

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,480
In order to understand the changes, measurements must be performed under the ice.

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,360
The glacier is about 500 m thick and extends far below the surface.

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,120
In order to get in there, a self -governing submarine is required.

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47.560
A robot traveling after a preset program-

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52.440
-And with sensors maps the ice from below.

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,440
We at the University of Gothenburg participated and produced it.

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02.880
It's called Ran, is 7.5 m long and can ride 30 miles.

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,160
It can be at 3,000 m deep.

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,800
There is no other way to access these environment-

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,040
-In the ice and in deep seas.

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,640
The sensors on the rank measure temperature, calculate the direction of water currents-

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,920
-To water samples and scan the environment with sound waves and eco-

25
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,160
-To traveling in a pre -programmed pattern.

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44.560
At the latest assignment of the RAN

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,360
-That the supply of warm water to the glacier is greater than expected.

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,320
The researchers have seen large cracks that they suspect go straight through the ice.

29
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,240
This has also been seen with ranks under nearby glaciers.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,560
A glacier tongue formed when hot water melts ice at the seabed-

31
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,040
-And leaves a floating tongue at the surface.

32
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,320
The part of the tongue that meets the bottom is like a dam in a pond.

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,760
It is held back by the tongue, which presses against mountains underwater.

34
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,840
If you remove the tongue, it is free for the ice to flow.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
If it is likely, the researchers are not sure.

36
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,680
It is possible that a new tongue is created and stops the glacier-

37
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,280
-Do that IS from the land -based part becomes like a new dam.

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,680
The laws of physics can help us.

39
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,520
If you move such amounts of ice out into the sea, it will be colder.

40
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06.720
A new glacier tongue can also be created.

41
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,800
The fact that the ice melts is both natural and something that man affects.

42
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,280
The ice has melted naturally since the last ice age, and we affect the climate.

43
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,080
To what extent it is human and naturally we do not know.

44
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,080
We know too little about these systems to say so.

45
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,520
Although we do not know man's exact impact-

46
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,400
-So our impact on the climate is great.

47
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,800
In 300 years we have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by almost 50 %-

48
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,720
-And is thus a cause of global warming.

49
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00.120
As for Thwaites glacier, Anna Wåhlin belongs to those who believe-

50
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04.920
-That it will take time for the doomsday glacier to fall.

51
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,440
The nickname is probably a little exaggerated, at least in the near-time

52
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,760
-But climate change is a problem-

53
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,800
-And we must leave a habitable plane to future generations.

54
