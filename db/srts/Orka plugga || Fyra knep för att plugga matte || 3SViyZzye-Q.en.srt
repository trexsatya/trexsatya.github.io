HOW TO STUDY MATHS

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,960
<i>In maths, you can't fool yourself. It's</i>				
				<i>better to do a few problems thoroughly-</i>

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,240
<i>-and to fully understand them,</i>				
				<i>than to do many.</i>

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,080
<i>If you don't get it,</i>				
				<i>be honest with yourself.</i>

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,280
<i>Turn back a few pages to stuff</i>				
				<i>that you do get. This is important.</i>

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,040
TURN BACK A FEW PAGES

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,760
<i>Mathematics is a language.</i>				
				<i>Just like with any language-</i>

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,080
<i>-you must look up things</i>				
				<i>you don't understand.</i>

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,520
<i>Look it up in a book, google it,</i>				
				<i>or ask someone who knows.</i>

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,200
THE LANGUAGE OF MATHS

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>Divide the problem into smaller parts.</i>

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>A big problem can be divided into seve-</i>				
				<i>ral parts that you solve individually.</i>

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,080
SUBPROBLEMS

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
<i>Always verify your solutions-</i>

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>-for example by putting them back</i>				
				<i>into the equation you just solved-</i>

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,880
<i>-to verify that it works both ways.</i>

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,840
VERIFY THE SOLUTION
