1
00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:03.116
Staffan was a chair loss,

2
00:00:03.116 --> 00:00:06.144
If the plants he protects,

3
00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:09.728
He watering his flowers five,

4
00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:13.104
He does not have the sharpest brain.

5
00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:16.384
No day of care seems yet,

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.706
The snow clouds in the sky they splash.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.066
Best flower turned gray

8
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:29.184
toward the frost stalk bail

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.489
But Staffan does not give up anyway

10
00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.328
provides plant lights with the lanterns

11
00:00:35.584 --> 00:00:38.656
No day of care seems yet,

12
00:00:38.912 --> 00:00:44.800
The snow clouds in the sky they splash.

13
00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:48.896
No one water flowers like him

14
00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:51.941
Staffan, Staffan

15
00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:54.807
No no one water flowers like him

16
00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:57.884
I say, Staffan, Staffan
