1
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:18,491
There are few times in Laxton's history that we have difficulty putting words

2
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,567
on an investigation we will conduct.

3
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:23,271
But this time it really is.

4
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,749
It is with mixed feelings that we are now back in our childhood apartment in Kiruna.

5
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,698
Where everything started almost 35 years ago.

6
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37.555
Memories from our childhood flushes over us, and the interior of the apartment

7
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:40,602
As our mother built and installed is still there.

8
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,325
We have the purpose of being back right here and it is ...

9
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,959
Becomes contact stronger at the place where our cousins Peter and Johanna

10
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51.669
spent his last time in life?

11
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:56,671
And can we get in touch with our mother who loved this apartment?

12
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:03,853
Then we have entered here in our childhood apartment.

13
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:08,996
-We are up in Kiruna, so we have made our way to the apartment where we grew up.

14
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:13,376
Where it all started and where Laxton also grew up.

15
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:17,831
What I mean is that it grew up, the interest started in this apartment.

16
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,435
We had paranormal phenomena that happened here, which made us so fascinated

17
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:24,880
That we stand here today.

18
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:30,363
I can say like this that do you want to know what it was like for us to step into this apartment

19
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:34,489
For the first time, we have done a pod about this that you can listen to.

20
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:37.761
There is also a video odd so you can watch it if you want to do it.

21
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:42,444
What is so special to be here and talk about memories with our one sister.

22
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:45.903
Who started telling memories that didn't even remember.

23
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:50,442
It was totally sick. I don't even remember the paranormal memories, I've suppressed them.

24
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:55,094
So there are certainly more memories inside the head of one, but they are gone.

25
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59.095
-But it is special to be back and we have to thank those who have the apartment today.

26
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:00.529
That we may come here.

27
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:04,161
Because the apartment itself is not haunted right now.

28
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06.507
We always go to places where it is said that a lot of things happen.

29
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,494
Now we got the chance when we were in Kiruna to actually visit this apartment.

30
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:18,762
And now we will find out if we can get in touch with Peter and Johanna.

31
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:21,970
Our cousins that tragically passed away in this fire in 1988.

32
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,350
Where they spent their last hours in this apartment.

33
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,388
Shit what dizzy I became when I talked about them.

34
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,536
It just spins ...

35
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:32,959
My eyes ... it feels like I would start to faint when I said that.

36
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,344
That was damn uncomfortable.

37
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:40,535
-It can also be when you listened to the pod, we talked about the wrong year.

38
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,218
You get completely gone.

39
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,541
But we should not forget that there are a lot of emotions here.

40
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:48,600
Our own feelings that the brain starts to work with when we came in here.

41
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,187
Because it is so many years we lived here and experienced things.

42
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,936
What is the unique when we come here as Tony said

43
00:04:54,936 --> 00:04:57.913
So those who live here now do not notice anything at all.

44
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:03,859
But we should try in an experimental way.

45
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't even talk.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,707
- We will try with an experiment. This is strange, we always be able to convey directly.

47
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,131
So I'm a swine.

48
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,652
Wondering what the hell was that happened there.

49
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:20,425
We will test different things and see if we get in touch with Peter and Johanna.

50
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:23,653
But also our mother who loved this apartment.

51
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:29,872
- There are details left from our upbringing that mom brought here.

52
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32.311
They are repainted now, but we will be close to this.

53
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:38,814
But we will then seek contact with loved ones, which we have never done in this way before.

54
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:43,667
But now we are in this apartment and then we will see who wants to get through.

55
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:48,874
She who lives here now has no activity, but she said we want to test our theory around this

56
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:51.019
So you have this apartment to do it in.

57
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52.416
Now I start to shudder about my legs.

58
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,000
So this is totally sick.

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
- I wonder if I should sit down.

60
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:59,566
Shall we back in or should I ...

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01.070
- No, go and sit on the couch.

62
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02.320
- I sit down for a while on the couch.

63
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,139
- But if we say they are here now and they come in, because they hear that we are talking about them.

64
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,062
I don't know what it is, there is something heavy here.

65
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,694
It is very difficult to say if there is something paranormal or if it is the brain that works.

66
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,791
- I don't know either, it was ...

67
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:22,890
... a dizziness that came only came from nowhere.

68
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,508
I thought "now I'm fainting here".

69
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,002
We have lots of stuff here now.

70
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:29,035
- Yes we have instruments that are here.

71
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:37,510
. We have never done anything like this before, now we should actively seek contact with our cousins

72
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,614
Who passed away in this fire, and our mother.

73
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:42.007
- Exactly, but should we first try ...

74
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:44,486
Oh my brain.

75
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:45,946
I do not know what it is.

76
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,476
I shake and ...

77
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:52,404
I can also say that I felt bad and had a headache since we came here.

78
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:58,496
I don't know, but should we first seek contact with the mother?

79
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:07.314
We have a PRS here, which has static fields and now we place it right in front of us.

80
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,117
Then we have a new thing ahead of us too, should we post it too?

81
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,221
Or should we just take an instrument?

82
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,345
We know that there is nothing that disturbs the person who lives here now.

83
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:21,256
But do we drag anything with us? That is the question.

84
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:24,000
I place this one, and we'll see.

85
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:29,850
And you who have seen it know for sure about close contact and static fields.

86
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:32,462
- Okay, we back here then.

87
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,617
We have lived in this apartment for many years.

88
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:40,435
This is where we celebrated Christmas Eve together.

89
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:44,289
So if Peter or Johanna is still here ...

90
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,477
Could you be able to go up to

91
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:51.062
This tool that is on the table and touching the stick that is there?

92
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,394
If you are here, go up to

93
00:07:56,124 --> 00:07:58,318
This thing that is on the table.

94
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02.908
Is our mother here?

95
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:03,632
Irene.

96
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you with us?

97
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:17,734
Take energy from us, something affected us when we came in here.

98
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,183
I don't know what it is.

99
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,709
But take energy from us.

100
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,340
Stir the instrument here.

101
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,451
When we were little here, things were thrown.

102
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,355
If you have that kind of power

103
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,980
So you have to do it too.

104
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,724
And when we say Irene, it's the name of our mother.

105
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,353
We put this new one too.

106
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,569
We can only direct it straight out here.

107
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:49,403
I thought we should place it somewhere on the floor.

108
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,905
We were sitting on the Christmas table

109
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:52.814
Here somewhere. Should I post it?

110
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55.830
We take the chair here.

111
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04.420
So if something then comes

112
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:06,279
So you see that it gets

113
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:07.673
White

114
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,406
It's this pyramid

115
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:12.605
So if

116
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,241
Irene, our mother. If you can get through stronger.

117
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:21,088
Now that we are in this apartment where there was a lot of joy.

118
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:24,137
A lot of children, we were many children.

119
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:26,693
Is there more

120
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:29,782
Chances for us to talk to you here?

121
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,886
Can you come in to us here?

122
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:34,886
And touch this iron stick.

123
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:36,876
-A real shudder came and went here now.

124
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,534
- You sit in an active corner then when we lived here.
