1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09.840
Fiction or facts? Yes, the interest rate market's pricing of what the central bank is to do-

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
-none year is, according to ECB, science fiction.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,160
For now, the European interest rate market expects a good bit more-

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,360
-An 1 percentage point interest rate reductions in 2024 starting already in the spring.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:31,800
And even for the Riksbank, the market has tightened the arch considerably. A good bit below 3 % policy rate-

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,320
-In the end of 2024 is priced in the interest rate market.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,000
We get more facts already tomorrow, Friday. Then comes the US employment data-

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,320
-For November. It is likely to show an upturn in employment-

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,120
-As a result of American car workers being back at work after the strike.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02.600
The underlying trend should be weaker. We see signs from vacant places-

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08.080
-But also ADP figures a week, which shows that the labor market is cooled off.

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,400
The question is at what rate.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,040
More facts next week: inflation figures, also for November-

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,440
-And them gets the Fed with them to the meeting where you have to put your foot down.

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,120
What happens to the interest rate now, unchanged everyone believes, but how to signal before 2024?

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,400
The market has tensioned the bow, pricing lots of interest rate cuts-

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,800
-and Fed must fight against.
