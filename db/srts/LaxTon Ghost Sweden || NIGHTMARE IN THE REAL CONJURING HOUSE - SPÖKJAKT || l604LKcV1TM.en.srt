1
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:11,258
Then we finally arrive at The Conjuring House.

2
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:13,503
And it's hot, my glasses fog up again I notice.

3
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:17,747
So exciting to be here really, this is a dream to investigate.

4
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:18,491
Oh my God.

5
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,371
One of the world's most haunted houses.

6
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:28,490
If you've seen the movie The Conjuring, everything in the movie is about what happened here, but a little changed, it's a movie.

7
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,377
And they say that what was in the movie is only a fraction of that, but has downplayed that very much, what happened here in real life, with the Perron family.

8
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,884
They lived here for almost ten years.

9
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:51,642
But there are things that have happened here. We have the big seans room, now there is no table and so on there. They tell me the mother is sitting there and is thrown all the way back and hits the fireplace.

10
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:57,107
They get very angry so Ed and Lorraine are thrown out of here after this session.

11
00:02:57,107 --> 00:03:00,857
We have the guise of a little boy upstairs.

12
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,978
We have something walking down in the basement.

13
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:11,830
People also talk about The Crooked Lady. There is a child who has drawn a woman with a crooked neck, much like one has been hanged. "There is no documented suicide in the house by someone hanging themselves"

14
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,989
It's really cool.

15
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:22,747
This is really going to be a great night, the team has already started bringing in all the bags. We're fixing all the cameras, so I think we'll start the investigation.

16
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:23,732
We go in.

17
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:27,064
Yes, then we are inside the house.

18
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:29,008
How does it feel?

19
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,502
I feel awful.

20
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,480
Yes, you see... we've talked a bit off camera too...

21
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:55,776
Even when we got here I started to get a bit of a headache. Then we walked around the house, filmed a little behind the scenes and I just feel worse and worse, now I feel completely finished.

22
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:08,475
Yes, it is a powerful house, we talked about it at the beginning, so much has happened here. Now we have to form our own opinion, there are many who have been here and investigated

23
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:22,549
and there are many stories. Now we are here to see if what people are saying is true. And I think we should have the background story of the Perron family with us.

24
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:28,700
Because we know that happened, it is documented. So we proceed from that.

25
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,723
Of course.

26
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:32,592
How does Johanna feel now that you came into the house here?

27
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:38,005
Dizziness and nausea. I'd be surprised if I didn't throw up today.

28
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:38,766
Is it that bad?

29
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:44,383
Yes, it's the same feeling. I'm not feeling well...

30
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,728
Wilma then?

31
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:58,068
I have never felt so affected. I already feel that I am very affected. I feel pressure above my head, I feel a little groggy. Like I'm a little drunk.

32
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:02,612
Also nausea and like the eyes just hang.

33
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:04,735
So this...

34
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:09,359
Exciting introduction. And we're going to start now.

35
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,907
What was that?

36
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,265
Did something bite me there or?

37
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,349
Bite you?

38
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,740
Damn that felt.

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,160
Huh?

40
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,855
Like a damn needle. I thought it was a wasp that bit me.

41
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,336
Was it that strong?

42
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:27,418
Wait, I have to hold onto this. I was completely giddy.

43
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,699
Huh?

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,249
Is there anything?

45
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,474
Does it feel like a wasp stung you?

46
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,541
It was like someone taking a needle and...

47
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,704
Nothing is visible.

48
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:50,467
Okay, but we'll keep an eye on it in case it comes up. It's like this, we've gone around, we've set up all the cameras here and you feel very affected. I feel like I'm pretty much on top, yet.

49
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:57,211
I may not have quite gotten that paranormal feel from the house, but I've done this so many times that I know it will come.

50
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:58,276
And you?

51
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:09,826
I've walked around here and in some places these shivers come. And it's hot here, but it feels like someone is standing behind you and it's freezing cold, your hair just stands on end.

52
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:11,663
Goosebumps indeed.

53
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:18,412
We can say it's not cold in here. It's probably 27.28 degrees in the house here. And you see how we are dressed.

54
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:28,065
It's not like we're freezing. But it is good that we walk with bare arms because then we might feel these caresses, because they can touch one or caress one's back.

55
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:32,288
So we'll see what comes up. And it happens in certain places here in the building.

56
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:42,678
But what do you say, shall we get started? And I think that now first you go Niclas, me and Wilma, we go around pretty much the whole house.

57
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:48,555
We´re just gona fell the house and bring few tools. And then you get… did you see something?

58
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,620
Lennie come here....

59
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,700
No, you're not either. No, Viktor, you have to stay there.

60
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,560
I have to see what it is. It looks like...

61
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,873
Johan, move. It is Johan who is seen in the mirror, it looked as if someone was standing and looking in through a window. But it was a mirror, okay.

62
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:15,099
You see, this house will give us things, we are on the alert. Every little thing we will definitely do here.

63
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:20,832
Then we have surveillance with six cameras. We will also place some different things and test here.

64
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:29,567
But let´s go, we start walking around. You Johanna and Lennie need to rest, drink some water and sit at the surveillance with Johan.

65
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,733
Then we get started.

66
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:41,615
Here again. I walk into something all the time. Check this out. I don't know if you see this.

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,464
It's like entering something, this came after the boat, I don't know, I've never felt this much before.

68
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,667
Sick, you walk into it.

69
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:58,322
The instruments I have brought are Melmeter, Polterscript and I have a Spiritbox in my pocket.

70
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:59,455
You have an Ovilus.

71
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:09,923
Now it's... you haven't been inside the house before, you came in just now, but this is where the big séance table was. Where the Perron family had their séance.

72
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:17,700
So if you know that story, it was here that she, the mother of the family, flew into this fireplace.

73
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:25,677
I see like an energy line, right here around the sofa in the same size, like a circle.

74
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:38,402
And this has happened way back, when black magic was practiced here, in this room. So they have cast spells and called up and down lots of evil forces.

75
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:46,152
I see a bunch of women who have been doing this and you haven't really known what you've been doing.

76
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:56,058
So that here it is like an open portal, anyone can enter here, from the spirit world. Or even the entities can get in here.

77
00:08:56,058 --> 00:09:07,741
And I feel that there is a lot of activity here, but the spirits that belong to the house do not like to be here. But this is out of the question.

78
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:21,077
Spirits coming from outside and into this portal then. Because the energies in the house are in different rooms here instead, because they don't like this thing about bringing in anything or that energies come and go.

79
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,302
I start an Ovilus.

80
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:35,269
Here I am very affected, it rumbles in my ears and it becomes like a lid. And in here there is a lot of activity.

81
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:39,391
I take a step in..

82
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:53,804
It's like the energy in here.. I realize that there are two energies here. It wants to draw us in, but when we enter it disappears, it wants to play a game.

83
00:09:53,804 --> 00:10:04,010
And I see these two energies working together and will build throughout the evening. The more times you pass here, the stronger it will become.

84
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:14,631
A man and a woman, they belong together somehow. They have made this their room and there is something about the books here, it is some special book.

85
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:20,782
I saw before me, a few weeks ago, a blue book that will fall.

86
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:32,333
I can't pinpoint which one it is now. But it is a book that is very special, like those who were here before and put spells, they also put a spell on that book.

87
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:44,015
There are quite a few blue books here, because this was a very active area. Here we have some blue books that stand out.

88
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:45,453
It could be something.

89
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:47,905
I'll try to scan a bit.

90
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:51,408
Yes, it could be interesting.

91
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,803
Because this has been a completely different room, you know that.

92
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:06,902
And, what had to do with this room..

93
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:09,294
is a bit special.

94
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,181
After all, they had...

95
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:18,568
a guise that appeared here. And it wasn't very nice.

96
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:19,404
No.

97
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:23,324
It looked quite menacing. And it was here.

98
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:27,049
Because this used to be a bedroom.

99
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:33,769
So the bookshelf and that came in a little later, but we know that books fly here.

100
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:39,237
Shall we just walk around with Melmeter and look around the library here?

101
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:41,691
Here we have a lot of doors too..

102
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:50,364
I was going to say about doors Niclas, they are said to open and close.

103
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,668
That's a lot of blue books you're dealing with there.

104
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:59,595
That's why I was drawn to this.

105
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,817
It was..

106
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:10,680
If we have something in here that could throw out one of these books..

107
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,916
that has that power.

108
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,457
Oh, powerfully right away!

109
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,089
It's blue...

110
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:33,486
What's it called?

111
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:42,261
Leave.

112
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:50,083
It feels like they don't like, this energy Johnny or whoever it may be..

113
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,237
Every time you say Johnny.

114
00:12:52,237 --> 00:13:00,531
He's mad at me because I'm digging something up now, what I mention with the book, that's something..

115
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:08,022
now it stings my back when I talk about it too. It's something that he doesn't want me to dig up and speculate on.

116
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,434
It gets very aggressive.

117
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:13,549
Now the shivers are coming again, they come and go all the time. Like someone is behind you.

118
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:19,697
I was just going to say it, he's behind us. He's on my back all the time.

119
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,209
I'll just come in between you.

120
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:29,854
I don't know who Johnny is, it's not a name that we recognize.

121
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:09,967
I am getting in communication with him now. Then I get that he says you don't know what you're playing with now.

122
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:15,003
As if he wants to warn, that You doesn't know what you are about to do.

123
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,739
Shall we check out the living room too?

124
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:30,000
The first thing I notice here is that there is someone sitting in the armchair behind here. And that energy was already here when I came in, it has been here the whole time.

125
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,988
And it's like that energy sticks to this surface and kind of keeps track of who's passing in and out.

126
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:44,525
And this energy communicates with the other spirits here and tells them that now they are coming in here and they are going to do this.

127
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:56,387
It's a male energy and it's like he's tapping, he's finding out everything about us and sending it to the others. It's the only one I get on this surface.

128
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:59,531
Is there a basement or something here?

129
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,863
There's a basement there.

130
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:09,976
Okay, because I've heard it being shouted from there. A woman with a knot in her hair sits and waits down there.

131
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,884
What this mother was in contact with, do you get in who it could be? Because it is a case that has been talked about.

132
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:53,111
After all, it was a form of portal, that it wasn't the spirits that were around, but something else.

133
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:05,194
What is it that has such power, I think. Because it is almost five meters and being pulled or thrown requires enormous force.

134
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:20,389
Yes, I get that it is.. in the ritual world or whatever you want to call it, when you take from the good you take from up and when you take from the bad you dig down.

135
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:30,385
And I see images that you have sat in a circle, a group of women and that they have dug up. I also see that they have been doing voodoo dolls.

136
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:44,679
People have put needles in dolls to hurt others. And this that they've brought up, it's a form of energy I've never seen before. It feels like it could be something demonic or something very, very dark.

137
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:54,000
I think it was interesting when you said that about needles and woodoo dolls, I was thinking about the opening with your leg Niclas. Needles, the sting. We are close to this too.

138
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,469
Yes and when you mentioned it I get the number 7. I think we should remember the number 7 because it feels important, I can't connect why now.

139
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:07,210
There is something about 7, when you started talking about it.

140
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:19,859
Now that we've been standing here, it's been a long time since I felt this, I've had these shivers, but right now it's like someone is squeezing my shoulder blades together.

141
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:29,259
Like someone sitting or hanging on one. That's why I get these shivers I think because something is behind it.

142
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:32,695
I feel it like a weight on my shoulders.

143
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:38,252
You know when that happens then it will go down. Then it will settle in the lower back.

144
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:43,334
We'll see if it lets up. But shall we go down? Wilma was drawn there.

145
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:57,212
When you opened the door I got the name Deborah. Check out that name.

146
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:59,341
Interesting I got now.

147
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:07,747
Things have really happened here, a lot has happened here and it's a very, very powerful place.

148
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:21,388
There is a woman here, moving like this, running here. She has dark hair in a bun, she also wears something white.

149
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:33,866
She runs here and this is her place as well. And I see something like schizophrenia, like during the day she's a normal woman, but at night she changes completely.

150
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:44,585
Then she gets long nails, she gets dark hair in front of her face and becomes really uncomfortable. And she has pulled us down now, she is waiting for us.

151
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:51,920
She shows me three o'clock, as a sign that at night something happens here.

152
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:03,008
Yes we'll see. Again that with Niclas, that needle thing. Or the sting you felt.

153
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:12,539
Down here they talk about The Crooked Lady. She with her neck.

154
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,362
What happened there?

155
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:23,034
Spiritbox started in my pocket. Maybe that means we need to communicate.

156
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,267
Exactly, I thought so too.

157
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:26,894
Shall we get there?

158
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:28,127
No, stay put.

159
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:51,165
There is a woman in here too who says she wants to talk.

160
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,349
A woman.

161
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,758
Here it's good, I shiver here. 

162
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,720
Shall we get over there then?

163
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,472
Wait, just let me be here a little bit, I want this feeling.

164
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:39,470
It was like she just wanted to say Get out, Leave.

165
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,869
And the last thing was like now I'm sick of it, leave.

166
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:52,393
I sense that this woman has no problem with me. She likes me very much and she likes women.

167
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:57,107
And I hear Oh, a witch like me! That she recognizes herself in me.

168
00:20:57,107 --> 00:21:04,275
But that men provoke her, that they come down here and only provoke. She wants to talk about that.

169
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:11,603
I'm getting a heat here, I could lay on the floor here. I feel no threat that way.

170
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,448
So it's also kind of interesting, against what she's sending out.

171
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:20,732
It was here that the father of the Perron family got pats on the back when he went down here.

172
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:21,573
What was that?

173
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:26,921
*The sound of something moving in the building*

174
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,090
What was that?

175
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,000
In the middle of your speech.

176
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,142
Can you do it again?

177
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:41,500
I think, Wilma senses something in that room.

178
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,390
We'll let this one remain, we'll go a little bit there then.

179
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,413
Wait..

180
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:54,819
Something was dropped on the floor above.

181
00:21:54,819 --> 00:22:00,972
*The sound that Niclas hears*

182
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:04,957
It will be... above the floor, inside...

183
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,171
by the fireplace, right?

184
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:07,561
It will be, right?

185
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:14,507
Now we are in a very special place, we have a well behind here. You can't take another step behind because I don't want you to fall into it.

186
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:19,510
But if you get something out of this well, it's also very special, they said.

187
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:35,371
The first thing that comes to mind is the name Nea, or Linnea. It feels like I'm standing at a funeral, or not a funeral either but that someone has been thrown down here, someone who died here.

188
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:48,331
I see a little girl, like someone threw a child down or brought something down here. And I feel those energies and that energy is stuck here calling for me.

189
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:59,349
Or crying out for some kind of contact. And it feels like this room is very active. That you have sat here and really get in touch in here.

190
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:04,555
Because what's beneath me is so desperate, it really wants to communicate.

191
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:14,104
And here in the chair it's like there's an elderly woman sitting and she's not so distraught that there's something down here.

192
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:21,635
It's more like she's keeping watch, she's the one who wanted us to come in here.

193
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:31,201
But it feels very powerful, that it is connected to throwing someone down here.

194
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:46,504
We can say that children's cries have been heard from there. That it's like there's a child there. You can hear voices in here and all kinds of things, so you could sit down here and just be completely silent.

195
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:55,304
Here I think they have done some Challenge and tested here.

196
00:23:55,304 --> 00:24:11,092
I read in the book about gallows, which move, being thrown when the Perron family was here. They were even beaten with hangers in some closets.

197
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,403
A voice is heard in the room.

198
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:23,255
What the hell was that? Did you hear?

199
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:25,677
Wait, I'll check.

200
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:27,376
Someone was talking.

201
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,548
A voice is heard in the room.

202
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,894
Woman.

203
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:45,540
Damn, I heard something through the headphones.

204
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,559
Did you?

205
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,275
It was a woman who answered.

206
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,506
Could you hear what she said?

207
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:52,668
No, it didn't work. Damn I'm shivering.

208
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:57,195
Did someone whisper?

209
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,287
Yes. It was something like that.

210
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:07,383
Good. This is what could happen and now it is happening. This is what we want because voices have been heard here and now you heard it Viktor. Too bad you couldn't interpret what she said.

211
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,625
Because I only said Hello, so maybe it was a Hello back.

212
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:29,790
This is the coolest thing I've ever experienced now.

213
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,798
Right now the hair is being messed with in different ways.

214
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,138
Are you touching me now?

215
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:46,006
Grab my arm firmly.

216
00:25:56,405 --> 00:26:05,325
Imagine when you get a touch here, one there, one here, it jumps between.

217
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:10,141
I thought I'd see if the hair could move. But cool with an evp.

218
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:15,025
Wonder what it said. But we will be able to listen to that during the analysis.

219
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:18,586
And it's great that you got to hear it in real time. I'm super happy about that.

220
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,446
It's something with the mirror, I think.

221
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:26,759
I try to sit in front of it.

222
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,748
I do, because it's like they step out all the time.

223
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:34,122
I stand in here to the side.

224
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:38,390
Can you show yourself in the mirror to Niclas?

225
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,312
That's kind of what I felt.

226
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:46,556
Wait!

227
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:52,503
Is anyone walking?

228
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:57,669
Someone is walking.

229
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:16,154
There were clear steps over here.

230
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:18,358
That must have been heard!

231
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:20,951
We're moving towards it, I just have to bring this one up.

232
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:24,560
Did you hear the steps in the headphones?

233
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:41,657
Damn!

234
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:49,520
It was here Niclas.

235
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,597
Go towards it then.

236
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:55,809
Again!

237
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:20,273
But we're going up the stairs now, and we'll come back into the living room. Then we take the upper floor as well.

238
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,554
Did it restart?

239
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:27,831
Now its time.

240
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,297
I'll take this up then.

241
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:35,283
It's crazy that it starts up twice.

242
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:39,270
We're going to start something else, I'll turn this one on.

243
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,383
It's a hell of a run here, it's everywhere.

244
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,225
What are you feeling? What is that up here?

245
00:28:50,225 --> 00:29:00,762
I feel stressed and have stress attacks up here. I see children again, but I also see adult energies.

246
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:10,405
I see that there has been a family here, or a mother and a father. And that something dark has stood here roaring and scaring.

247
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:20,356
And that you have stepped forward and then you have come from the side and taken a stranglehold on people who have slept in this bed.

248
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:29,641
Then there is a huge portal from here to here, this is where everything runs. Very much in there.

249
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:34,937
It's like the energies just pull me in there. That we should go further.

250
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:40,398
Shall we go further then? Shall we bring it too? Bring PRS.

251
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:53,757
This was the children's bedroom. Those who slept in these beds went into that room, that's where the older sister always was, Andrea Perron.

252
00:29:55,089 --> 00:30:04,889
But it is also here, around the wall, this is where they woke up and heard this chant.

253
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:14,236
And their bodies have been found outside the house.

254
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:26,753
Right. The previous owners took the theory of these soldiers. That maybe it's not this wall but that wall that goes around. And then they found five.

255
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:31,820
But they haven't dug them up. They don't really know, but they think it's there.

256
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,865
Shall we try going into the last room here too? See if anything else happens.

257
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:44,822
And this should be Andrea Perron's bedroom. The oldest of the siblings.

258
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:55,821
I get to see two people the same age anyway, two girls. Now it's one of these girls who shows how she got pulled out of this bed.

259
00:30:55,821 --> 00:31:05,805
That she was lying in bed and then was pulled by the leg and pulled out. She wants to show me that there is something here.

260
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:15,490
I also see a smaller girl, who gets out of bed and walks around the room, in circles.

261
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:24,529
Like she wakes up and then walks around and around like this. Like something has affected her and tried to take over her body.

262
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,348
Someone controls her?

263
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:27,912
Exactly.

264
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:38,835
The children have come in here because they have found it to be a safe place. But they have also seen a little boy who comes walking.

265
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:48,225
They have even played with the boy and had discussions with him from what I understand. But they have also been thrown around in that scrub there.

266
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:56,766
The door to that scrub has also been opened so I think you can check in there too before we go down.

267
00:31:56,766 --> 00:32:15,200
I'm getting very dizzy in here. I see as an energy sitting down, thin and dark. It is not a person I see, but this is also some kind of entity.

268
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:27,408
Who just growled at me. Sitting in the corner now growling, with red eyes. Very unpleasant. Sitting there in...

269
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:35,242
It sits in the corner and bites the nails like this.

270
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:39,251
So yes, very uncomfortable.

271
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:43,251
We go down and then we make a new constellation.

272
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:09,258
Now we have changed a little in the groups here. I think we'll go down to the basement, you see I'm wearing headphones so it's going to be an Estes Method. Or if Johanna gets to test.

273
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:15,225
We're going down to this table that's down in the basement, we also see this well there.

274
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:20,681
We will place some instruments in the corridor at the same time. Now I'm starting to shiver, now it's coming..

275
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:22,308
Good.

276
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:30,373
I've had it like twice, you've had it a little more. It comes out of nowhere, it's nice.

277
00:33:30,373 --> 00:33:31,180
Or?

278
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,972
Or?

279
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:41,807
But we'll go down, lay out stuff and get started and communicate a bit. We have no other communication tool, but now it is us and listen for voices.

280
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:45,329
And maybe we'll manage to catch some more evp, we caught one when we were down there.

281
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,073
We go down.

282
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:51,457
What is it?

283
00:33:51,457 --> 00:33:54,943
There was a red light flashing over there.

284
00:33:54,943 --> 00:33:56,097
Wait stay here.

285
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:57,389
Did you say a red light?

286
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:58,496
Yes.

287
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:01,705
I'll see if it blinks again.

288
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:02,894
No.

289
00:34:02,894 --> 00:34:04,421
Here.

290
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:13,841
Here it was a red light that was flashing.

291
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:24,525
So hopefully the camera caught it, no hell I was probably in its way. I thought maybe it was a unit that was glowing, but it isn't.

292
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:32,096
I will okace the Paranormal Movement Alert. We'll maybe hear it if there's something moving out here.

293
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:45,105
I also have some motion sensors that say Hello Welcome, so I'll place them here. And we know that the woman has been seen walking here.

294
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:52,979
Now I have set it quite sensitively, just in case something goes by there. I'll try stomping next to it.

295
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,118
Over here I put a Hello Welcome.

296
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:15,284
And then we have these cat toys. We put everything in one line here.

297
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:25,197
We then have the surveillance camera over there and we go into the room there.

298
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:36,395
Here, Johanna, there is one that has been talked about, The Crooked Lady. It is this one that the children have drawn.

299
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,990
Yes, they have drawn her yes.

300
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,968
Yes.

301
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:41,173
I will place this.

302
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,948
Red and green. Wilma said there is a woman sitting in this chair.

303
00:35:53,133 --> 00:36:02,327
So we can see if it gives an answer at the same time, because I will sit here, you can sit one there and one there maybe. So I start with the Estes Method.

304
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:07,116
I put another Flux behind us here.

305
00:36:11,308 --> 00:36:23,458
For those of you who don't know what the Estes Method is, Niclas will start a spirit box with headphones. He also has a blindfold so he can't see.

306
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:29,240
So all the energies that are down here in the basement.

307
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:31,827
Can come in here.

308
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:35,868
Go to them here blue pulsating...

309
00:36:35,868 --> 00:36:41,481
By the way, I have noise cancelling, so I won't hear what you say.

310
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:44,813
Yes. Good!

311
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:46,256
I'm getting started.

312
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:48,982
Now I got shivers.

313
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:50,635
It hasn't started anything before, has it?

314
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,523
No, now this begins.

315
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:03,586
Why do you want us to go?

316
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:11,823
Will you show up for us tonight?

317
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:23,159
Then show yourself to us.

318
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:30,153
Behind who?

319
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:33,556
Can you make a loud noise?

320
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:40,666
Yes, there!

321
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:43,714
My arms start to shiver.

322
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:45,217
Same here.

323
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:49,926
Both! There and there.

324
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:51,639
Someone touched my neck.

325
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,921
Okay.

326
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:53,775
Look!

327
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:55,695
Nor does he know that these have just started.

328
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:57,183
No, he doesn't know that.

329
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,992
What is it?

330
00:37:59,512 --> 00:38:02,133
It sounded like someone was standing there.

331
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:07,074
Who are you who came and stood behind you?

332
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:12,162
Do you see him looking that way? Where you tell that you saw someone.

333
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:14,245
No, I heard..

334
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:19,671
It kind of creaked on the floor.

335
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:25,192
We want to know who you are.

336
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:39,595
There's someone touching my neck all the time, I'm going crazy.

337
00:38:39,595 --> 00:38:42,543
Are you behind Niclas now?

338
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:48,177
Continue touching the neck.

339
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,781
I got a huge headache now.

340
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:56,933
Did you get a headache?

341
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:00,313
Here.

342
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:02,173
In the temple? I don't really see.

343
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,871
Yes, the temple.

344
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:05,209
Okay.

345
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,659
Who is affecting Viktor as well?

346
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:10,864
I have to break.

347
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:15,078
What is it?

348
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:20,241
There's someone pulling their fingers on my neck all the time, it's so fucking uncomfortable.

349
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,903
Like this?

350
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:30,916
No, very loose. Like this. From one side to the other. At first I think maybe it's a moth or something that landed on my neck.

351
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:33,306
But then you would have seen it and said so.

352
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,706
Viktor got a hell of a headache.

353
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:37,847
Is it going well?

354
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:43,523
But now I have tested. Now I want you to try this.

355
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,576
Do you want to hold it?

356
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:53,623
Immediately we get green.

357
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,558
Good. We immediately get green.

358
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:59,125
And then shivers.

359
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:06,000
What's your name? Can you say who you are?

360
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,225
Were you behind me before?

361
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:13,640
*No steps recorded*

362
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,838
I heard someone walking there.

363
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:19,187
Is a woman here with us?

364
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:34,764
*Loud bang in the building*

365
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:36,448
Did you hear that?

366
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:43,002
It came from that iron cabinet...

367
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,474
What was it?

368
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,223
Did you hear that?

369
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:48,618
Yes.

370
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,119
It is from outside.

371
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:54,999
That was it..

372
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,898
Although a duller bang.

373
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,444
*Loud bang in the building*

374
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:09,066
Now everything is starting to spin for me.

375
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:12,898
At the same time it sounds like a cricket, but we haven't had that in here.

376
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:14,315
No.

377
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,434
Things are starting to spin for Johanna.

378
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:22,737
She might feel something in the back of her neck there.

379
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,283
What is that sound?

380
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:29,563
I don't know if it's some cricket or...

381
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:31,864
Is it coming from outside or?

382
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:35,190
Now something happens.

383
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,979
It feels like someone is pushing, I kind of want to pull my head like this...

384
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:43,765
it's like someone is pushing like this.

385
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,817
What is it?

386
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:49,968
The battery on this one.

387
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:50,986
On which?

388
00:41:50,986 --> 00:41:54,796
It went down to 20% now.

389
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:55,854
On the display?

390
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:57,469
Yes.

391
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:00,420
And then this strange sound.

392
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,018
Now it takes battery.

393
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,372
Should I break?

394
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:09,403
You can do that.

395
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:22,938
Wow strange. It was really like, I didn't feel like someone was pushing, but it felt like the head wanted to go that way. And then when I would pick it up, it was sluggish.

396
00:42:22,938 --> 00:42:28,873
We said your name once, then you say your name.

397
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,818
Yes, green.

398
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:33,790
I really heard Johanna.

399
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,874
I have a headache.

400
00:42:35,874 --> 00:42:38,473
Shall we cancel and go up?

401
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:48,641
Or are you going to run up and get a Sony camera and we'll continue a bit? We do Nighvision only here.

402
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:49,661
Okay.

403
00:42:49,661 --> 00:43:00,724
We have switched to Nighvision because we don't have the normal camera we usually have. Because Viktor who has the camera has an extreme headache, we also have Lennie who has completely crashed, he is completely exhausted.

404
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:10,351
Wilma who also feels things, we haven't been up for a while so we don't know how the others are doing. But we had to send Viktor away so he can recover a bit.

405
00:43:10,351 --> 00:43:15,102
We're continuing down here. I feel like it still works for me. Does it work for you?

406
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:16,619
Yes.

407
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:17,377
For you?

408
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,488
Same here.

409
00:43:18,488 --> 00:43:25,210
We have tested the Estes Method and we got decent stuff on different instruments. Wait...

410
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,806
Now it's music.

411
00:43:26,806 --> 00:43:28,035
Huh?

412
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:29,489
Is it music?

413
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:40,170
Didn't you hear music?

414
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,170
No.

415
00:43:47,149 --> 00:43:48,469
With piano.

416
00:43:56,496 --> 00:43:58,998
I hear it! I shiver!

417
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:03,270
Why do I hear this music? I hope the camera catches this.

418
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,308
*The music Niclas hears is not caught by the camera*

419
00:44:08,323 --> 00:44:15,363
Is that the lady with the crooked neck walking down here?

420
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:21,798
Green on it.

421
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:23,097
Right there.

422
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:24,490
Thanks!

423
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:29,625
What shivers I have now, they come and go.

424
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,749
Do you Johanna want to go and stand there and look this way?

425
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:41,261
Okay, if there's someone behind Johanna, can you come here?

426
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:45,632
That's how Johanna gets to know you, if you're there.

427
00:44:46,054 --> 00:44:47,637
I don't like this.

428
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:50,473
Does it feel like it could...?

429
00:44:54,307 --> 00:44:57,062
I hear steps!

430
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,409
There is something behind it.

431
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:01,074
It's like someone is standing like this.

432
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,102
Will you show up for us tonight here?

433
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:06,305
*Knock*

434
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:17,760
Do you know what we do Johanna? We go up and check if Viktor is okay, then I think you and Wilma should walk around.

435
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:26,925
I want you to try sitting on the couch where the seans room was. And after that, I want you to go upstairs and test.

436
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:32,180
So we'll see if anything happens. We go and check how the others are doing.

437
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,723
Where do you want to go?

438
00:45:53,723 --> 00:46:01,398
I am drawn to the room with the books. So if we go in there and see what I get through.

439
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:08,802
I have a PMB with me that I intend to place against this bookshelf.

440
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:21,888
What I will do now is that I open up and then I ask the energies...

441
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:24,156
to come here.

442
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:36,000
It is still this blue book that is being talked about. That's what I see connected to this man.

443
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,936
I'll see if I can get a name.

444
00:46:45,778 --> 00:46:50,370
You standing there, could you touch any of the books?

445
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,640
Could you push something down from the bookshelf?

446
00:46:52,640 --> 00:47:01,785
I would like to ask you to push something down from the bookshelf. Thank you so much for showing us so clearly.

447
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:07,483
*Steps in the other room*

448
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:12,699
*Whispers heard from the other room*

449
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:16,493
Surely there is someone whispering outside?

450
00:47:16,948 --> 00:47:18,496
Oh God!

451
00:47:19,048 --> 00:47:21,262
That's exactly what I heard.

452
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,899
As soon as I started with my hands.

453
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:36,537
What was that?

454
00:47:36,537 --> 00:47:38,349
It was a great movement.

455
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:43,346
But God I saw some form here by the couch!

456
00:47:43,346 --> 00:47:48,153
Step in here with us and affect the equipment again.

457
00:47:51,793 --> 00:48:00,833
He's sneaking out there. He's sneaking around out there and it's like he wants to drag us out. Do you want to move to out there?

458
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,402
Does he want us to go out there?

459
00:48:02,402 --> 00:48:04,539
Yes or so he....

460
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:11,294
I would like him to come in here first. If he comes in here, we'll gladly go out to see him later.

461
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,409
Oh my God!

462
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,708
This is absolutely insane.

463
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,462
Very strong.

464
00:48:19,404 --> 00:48:20,377
Thanks!

465
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:22,615
We'd love to go out now.

466
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:27,419
Yes, now we have actually said it. We thank you very much and we will come out to you.

467
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:31,742
Now he is here! He plays here now.

468
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,887
He probably wanted to be in there himself then.

469
00:48:33,887 --> 00:48:35,447
He wants us out.

470
00:48:35,447 --> 00:48:36,818
Surely what he wanted.

471
00:48:36,818 --> 00:48:38,278
I have such chills now.

472
00:48:38,278 --> 00:48:42,000
Would you like to sit on the couch and I'll sit on the floor?

473
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,372
Can I place this?

474
00:48:43,372 --> 00:48:45,084
Put it between us here.

475
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:56,335
And the energy that I was in contact with in there is standing in the doorway watching us. It's like they're charging up for something to happen here.

476
00:48:56,335 --> 00:48:59,528
If we have someone with us now..

477
00:49:01,056 --> 00:49:02,827
Thank you.

478
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:07,904
Is your name George?

479
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:11,077
Thanks!

480
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,371
Is that your book George you keep showing me? Does that book belong to you?

481
00:49:25,448 --> 00:49:26,707
Thanks.

482
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:46,885
I see him charging up a lot, with energy before he can answer. He has quite weak energy in him, not that powerful so a lot is required of him.

483
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,656
Thanks!

484
00:49:49,306 --> 00:49:54,828
Could you take out the book and show us?

485
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,879
If a book falls now I die...

486
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:09,346
I know you have affected and torn that book down, can you do it again?

487
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:11,433
*Loud bang in the building*

488
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:13,176
What was that?!

489
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,000
What was that?

490
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,050
Was it a book?

491
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,401
It could have been a book.

492
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:23,333
It was from there! Yes.

493
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,722
Yes, it was from there. 100%

494
00:50:26,722 --> 00:50:28,092
From upstairs.

495
00:50:35,144 --> 00:50:39,432
It sounded like a chair was knocked over or something.

496
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:44,827
It was right after we asked him too.

497
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:54,412
It was like someone threw something.

498
00:50:57,564 --> 00:51:00,875
Shall we check out the library down there?

499
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:10,754
No book lying.

500
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:15,314
The stones are still there too.

501
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,716
I heard it like it was coming from the hall.

502
00:51:18,716 --> 00:51:21,500
Yes, I heard it from your side as well.

503
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:52,583
There's no one here. Now it's all crickets we hear. Me and Tony are sitting with our headphones on and we hear this bang, we feel it on the floor.

504
00:51:52,875 --> 00:52:00,543
And everyone says it came from where we're sitting. Johan, who is sitting without headphones, says that it comes from outside.

505
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:04,261
This is very difficult.

506
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,423
*Loud bang in the building*

507
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:37,704
This house has been on our bucket list for as long as we've had the paranormal interest.

508
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:50,645
The dream of one day getting to the USA and getting to investigate this house has become a dream and it now feels almost unreal to stand in this famous house.

509
00:52:50,645 --> 00:53:02,655
We entered the house with the knowledge of what happened to the previous owners and the hopes of experiencing something like this are high.

510
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:12,000
We got to feel the feeling of being watched early on and the whole group was affected in different ways.

511
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:22,842
What stands out during this investigation is the sound of steps in the basement. And an evp that the cameraman perceived.

512
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:32,859
But what affected us the most is the distinct bang that everyone heard, but the cause of which we could not find.

513
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:42,601
We thoroughly went through the whole house and outside, but without finding the cause of the noise.

514
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:56,203
If we get the chance, we will go back one day and hopefully see and experience what made the Perron family leave for good.
