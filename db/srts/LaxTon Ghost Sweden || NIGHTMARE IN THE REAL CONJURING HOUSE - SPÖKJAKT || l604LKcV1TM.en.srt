1
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:11,258
Then we finally arrived at The Conjuring House.

2
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:13,503
And it is warm, my glasses Immar again I notice.

3
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:17,747
So exciting to be here really, this is a dream to investigate.

4
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:18,491
Oh my God.

5
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,371
One of the world's most haunted houses.

6
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:28,490
If you have seen the movie The Conjuring, everything in the movie is about what happened here, though a little converted, it is a movie.

7
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,377
And it is said that what was included in the film is only a fraction of it, but have toned it down a lot, what happened here in reality, with the Perron family.

8
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,884
They lived here for almost ten years.

9
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:51,642
But there are things that have happened here.
 We have the big Sean room, now there is no table and so left there.
 They say that the mother sits there and is thrown all the way away and hits the fireplace.

10
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:57,107
They get very angry and then they throw out oath and Lorraine from here after this session.

11
00:02:57,107 --> 00:03:00,857
We have the form of a little boy upstairs.

12
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,978
We have something that goes down in the basement.

13
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:11,830
You also talk about The Crooked Lady.
 There is a child who has drawn a woman with crooked neck, much like being hung.
 "There is no documented suicide in the house that someone has been hung"

14
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,989
It's really cool.

15
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:22,747
This will really be a great evening, the team has already started to carry in all the bags.
 We are fixing all the cameras, so I think we start the investigation.

16
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:23,732
We go in.

17
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:27,064
Yes, then we are inside the house.

18
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:29,008
How does it feel?

19
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,502
I feel bad.

20
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:34,480
Yes you see ... we have talked a little off camera too ...

21
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:55,776
Already when we got here I started to get some headaches.
 Then we have walked around the house, filmed a little behind the scenes and I just feel worse and worse, now I feel completely finished.

22
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:08,475
Yes, it is a powerful house, we talked about it initially, it has happened so much here.
 Now we are going to form our own view, there are many who were here and investigated

23
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:22,549
And there are many stories.
 Now we are here to see if it is true that people tell.
 And I think we should have the background the story of the Perron family with us.

24
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:28,700
Because we know that happened, there is documented.
 So we start from that.

25
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,723
Obvious.

26
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:32,592
How does it feel Johanna now when you entered the house here?

27
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:38,005
Dizzy and nausea.
 I would be surprised if I was not vomited today.

28
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:38,766
Is it so bad?

29
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:44,383
Yes, it's the same feeling.
 I do not feel good...

30
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,728
Wilma then?

31
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:58,068
I have never felt so affected.
 I already feel that I am very affected.
 I feel pressure over my head, I feel a little groggy.
 Like I'm a little full.

32
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:02,612
Even nausea and like the eyes just hang.

33
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:04,735
So this ...

34
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:09,359
Exciting introduction.
 And we should start now.

35
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,907
What was that?

36
00:05:12,907 --> 00:05:14,265
Was there something that bit me there or?

37
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,349
Bet you?

38
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,740
Damn what it stuck.

39
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,160
Huh?

40
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,855
Like a damn needle.
 I thought it was a wasp that bit me.

41
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,336
Was it so powerful?

42
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:27,418
Wait I have to hold on to me.
 I was completely crazy.

43
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,699
Huh?

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,249
Is there anything?

45
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,474
Does it feel like a wasp stack you?

46
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,541
It was like someone is taking a needle and ...

47
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,704
There is nothing visible.

48
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:50,467
Okay, but we have control over it in case it shows up.
 It's like this, we've gone around, we've set up all the cameras here and you feel very affected.
 I feel that I'm pretty much at the top, yet.

49
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:57,211
I may not have really got that paranormal feeling of the house, but I have done this so many times so I know it will come.

50
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:58,276
And you?

51
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:09,826
I have been walking around here and in some places these shivers.
 And it's hot here, but it feels like someone is behind one and it gets ice cold, the hair just rises.

52
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:11,663
Goose bumps really.

53
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:18,412
We can say that it is not cold in here.
 It is probably 27.28 degrees in the house here.
 And you see how we are dressed.

54
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:28,065
It's not that we freeze.
 But it is good that we go with only arms because then maybe we know these caresses, because they can touch one or caress one on their backs.

55
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:32,288
So we'll see what pops up.
 And it happens in some places here in the building.

56
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:42,678
But what do you say, should we start?
 And I think that first you go Niclas, me and Wilma, we walk around almost the whole house.

57
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:48,555
We just know and bring few tools.
 And then you get ... did you see something?

58
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,620
Lennie came here ....

59
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,700
No, it's not you either.
 No, Viktor, you have to remain there.

60
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,560
I have to see what it is.
 It looks like....

61
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,873
Johan, touching you.
 It is Johan who is visible in the mirror, it looked like someone was standing and looking in through a window.
 But it was a mirror, okay.

62
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:15,099
You see, this house will give us things, we are on the alert.
 Every little thing we will definitely chop here.

63
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:20,832
Then we have a surveillance with six cameras outside.
 We will also place a few different things and test here.

64
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:29,567
But we drive like that, we start walking around.
 You Johanna and Lennie need to rest, drink some water and sit at the surveillance with Johan.

65
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,733
So we run.

66
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:41,615
Here again.
 I go into something all the time.
 Check this out.
 I don't know if you see this.

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,464
It's like going into something, this came after the boat, I don't know, so much I haven't known before.

68
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,667
Sick, you go into it.

69
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:58,322
The instruments I have brought are melmeter, polterscript and so I have a spirit box in my pocket.

70
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:59,455
You have an oily.

71
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:09,923
Now it is ... you haven't been inside the house before, you came in right now, but this is where the big Sean table was.
 Where the Perron family had their seans.

72
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:17,700
So you know that story so it was here that she, the mother of the family flew into this fireplace.

73
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:25,677
I see as an energy line, right here around the sofa of the same size, as a circle.

74
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:38,402
And this has happened far back, then you were doing black magic here, in this room.
 So you have thrown spells and called up and down lots of evil forces.

75
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:46,152
I see a bunch of women who have been doing this and you have not really known what you have been doing.

76
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:56,058
So that here it is like an open portal, anyone can get in here, from the spirit world.
 Or even the being can get in here.

77
00:08:56,058 --> 00:09:07,741
And I feel that there is a lot of activity here, but precisely the spirits that belong to the house do not like to be here.
 Without this, this is out.

78
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:21,077
Spirits that come from and into this portal then.
 For the energies in the house are in different rooms here instead, because they do not like this with taking in anything or that it comes and goes energy.

79
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,302
I start an OVILUS so we have it.

80
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:35,269
Here I am very affected, it is rushing in my ears and it becomes like a lid.
 And in here there is a lot of activity

81
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:39,391
I'll take a step in ..

82
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:53,804
It's like the energy in here .. I get to me that there are two energies here.
 It wants to pull us in, but when we come in it disappears, it wants to run a game.

83
00:09:53,804 --> 00:10:04,010
And I see that these two energies collaborate and will build up during the evening.
 The more times you pass here, the stronger it will be.

84
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:14,631
A man and a woman, they belong together in some way.
 They have made this their room and there is something about the books here, it is a special book.

85
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:20,782
After all, I've got to myself before, a few weeks ago, a blue book that will fall.

86
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:32,333
I can't pin point out who it is now.
 But it is a book that is very special, like those who were here before and put Spells, they have also put a game on that book.

87
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:44,015
There are some blue books here, because this was a very active area.
 Here we have some blue books that stand out.

88
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:45,453
It could be something.

89
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:47,905
I try scanning a little.

90
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:51,408
Yes, it can be interesting.

91
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,803
Because this has been a completely different room, you know about it.

92
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:06,902
And, what had to do with this room ..

93
00:11:06,902 --> 00:11:09,294
Is a little special.

94
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,181
They had ...

95
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:18,568
A shape that appeared here.
 And it wasn't very nice.

96
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:19,404
No.

97
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:23,324
It looked pretty threatening.
 And it stood here.

98
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:27,049
For this was previously a bedroom.

99
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:33,769
So the bookshelf and it has come in a little later, but we know that books are flying here.

100
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:39,237
Should we go around with Melmeter just and look around the library here?

101
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:41,691
Here we have a lot with doors too ..

102
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:50,364
I was going to say to doors Niclas, they are said to open and close.

103
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,668
There are lots of blue books you are doing there.

104
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:59,595
That is why I was drawn to this.

105
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,817
It was..

106
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:10,680
If we have something in here that could throw out any of these books ..

107
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,916
that has that power.

108
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:24,172
Do you have that power and strength to be able to pull out one of the books?

109
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,457
Oh, powerful right away!

110
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,089
It is blue...

111
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:33,486
What is it called?

112
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:42,261
Leave.

113
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:50,083
It feels like they don't like, this energy Johnny or who it might be ..

114
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,237
Every time you say Johnny.

115
00:12:52,237 --> 00:13:00,531
He is angry with me because I am digging something now, what I mention with the book, it is something ..

116
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:08,022
Now it sticks in my back when I talk about it too.
 It's something he doesn't want me to dig up and speculate on.

117
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,434
It becomes very aggressive.

118
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:13,549
Now the shivers comes again, they come and go all the time.
 Like someone is behind one.

119
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:19,697
I was just going to say that, he's behind us.
 He's on my back all the time.

120
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,209
I just come in between you.

121
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:29,854
I don't know who Johnny is, it's not a name that we recognize.

122
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:33,772
Can you throw down any of the books for us?

123
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:40,891
Can you make this light up against which book you will throw?

124
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:50,947
I go to this shelf.
 You have done this here before.

125
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:09,967
I get communication with him now.
 Then I make me say that you do not know what you are playing with now.

126
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:15,003
Like he wants to warn, now now does not know what you are about to do.

127
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,739
Should we check out in the living room too?

128
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:30,000
The first thing I get to me here is that there is someone in the armchair behind it.
 And that energy was already sitting here when I came in, it has been sitting here all the time.

129
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,988
And it's like that energy sticks to this surface and keeps a little track of who passes in and out.

130
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:44,525
And this energy communicates with the other spirits here and tells us that now they come in here and they will do this.

131
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:56,387
It is a male energy and it is like he blocks, that he finds out everything about us and sends it to them others.
 It's the only one I get on this surface.

132
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:59,531
Is it a basement or something here?

133
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,863
It's a basement there.

134
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:09,976
Okay, because I've heard that it is shouted from there.
 A woman with a knot in her hair sits waiting down there.

135
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:16,201
What threw the mother in the perron family ..

136
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:18,602
across the room ..

137
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:24,133
Could you please do something so we know you're here?

138
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:29,707
Tap the wall or move something.

139
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,884
What this mother was in contact with, do you get who it might have where?
 Because it is a case that you have talked about.

140
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:53,111
It was a form of portal, that it was not the spirits that were around, but it was something else.

141
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:05,194
What is it that has such power, I think.
 Because it is almost five meters and being drawn or throwing requires a huge power.

142
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:20,389
Yes, I get like it is .. within the ritual world or how to call it, when you take from the good you take up from and when you take from the evil that digs down.

143
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:30,385
And I see pictures that you have been sitting in a circle, a bunch of women and that they have dug up.
 I also see that you have been doing woodoo dolls.

144
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:44,679
Needles have been put in dolls to harm others.
 And this that they have raised, it is an energy form I have never seen before.
 It feels like it could be something demonic or something very, very dark.

145
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:54,000
I think it was interesting when you said it about needles and woodoo dolls, I thought about the introduction with your leg Niclas.
 Needles, Stungen.
 We are standing near this too.

146
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,469
Yes and when you mentioned it I get the number 7. I think we should remember the number 7 because it feels important, I can't link why now.

147
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:07,210
There is something about 7, when you started talking about it.

148
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:19,859
Now that we have been standing here, this was a long time that I knew, I have had them here the shivers, but right now it is like someone compressing the shoulder blades.

149
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:29,259
Like someone sitting or hanging on one.
 That is why I get these shivers I think that something is behind.

150
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:32,695
I feel it as a weight in the shoulders.

151
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:38,252
You know that what usually bends then it will go down.
 Then it will settle in the lumbar spine.

152
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:43,334
We'll see if it releases.
 But should we go down?
 Wilma was pulled there.

153
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:57,212
When you opened the door I got the name Deborah.
 Check that name.

154
00:17:57,212 --> 00:17:59,341
I got interesting now.

155
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:07,747
Here it has really happened, a lot has happened here and it is a very, very powerful place.

156
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:21,388
There is a woman here, who moves like this, runs here.
 She has dark hair with a ball, she also has something white on her.

157
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:33,866
She runs here and this is her place as well.
 And I see much like a schizophrenia, like that on the day she is an ordinary woman, but at night she completely changes.

158
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:44,585
Then she gets long nails, she gets dark hair in front of her face and gets really unpleasant.
 And she has pulled us down now, she is waiting for us.

159
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:51,920
She shows me at three o'clock, as a sign that at night something happens here.

160
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:03,008
Yes we'll see.
 Again it with Niclas, that needle thing.
 Or the sticker that you felt.

161
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:12,539
Down here you talk about The Crooked Lady.
 She with her neck of Sne.

162
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,362
What happened there?

163
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:23,034
Spiritbox started in my pocket.
 It may mean that we have to communicate.

164
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:24,267
Exactly, I thought so too.

165
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:26,894
Should we get there?

166
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:28,127
No, stand.

167
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:34,080
Who are you?

168
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,575
Is your debroah called?

169
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:51,165
There is also a woman in here who says she wants to talk.

170
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,349
A woman.

171
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:58,374
Could you say your name to me?

172
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,758
Here it is good, here I shudder.

173
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,720
Should we get away there then?

174
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,472
Wait, just let me be here a bit, I want this feeling.

175
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:39,470
It was like she just wanted to say go out, leave.

176
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,869
And the last thing was like I'm tired of it now, leave.

177
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:52,393
I feel that this woman has no problems with me.
 She likes me a lot and she likes women.

178
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:57,107
And I hear oh, a witch like me!
 That she recognizes herself in me.

179
00:20:57,107 --> 00:21:04,275
But that men make her provoked, that they come down here and just provoke.
 She wants to talk about that.

180
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:11,603
I get a warmth here, I could lie down on the floor here.
 I feel no threat that way.

181
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:15,448
So it is also a little interesting, against what she sends out.

182
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:20,732
This is where the father in the Perron family got caresses on his back, when he went down here.

183
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:21,573
What was that?

184
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:26,921
*The sound of something being moved in the building*

185
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,090
What was that?

186
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,000
In the middle of your speech.

187
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,142
Can you do it again?

188
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:41,500
I think, Wilma knows some in that room.

189
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,390
We leave this one, we go a little there then.

190
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,413
Wait..

191
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:54,819
Something was dropped on the floor above.

192
00:21:54,819 --> 00:22:00,972
*The sound that Niclas hears*

193
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:04,957
It will be ... above the floor, inside ...

194
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,171
At the fireplace will it be huh?

195
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:07,561
That is it?

196
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:14,507
Now we are in a very special place, we have a well behind it.
 You must not take any more steps behind because I do not want you to fall into it.

197
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:19,510
But if you get something with this well, it is also very special they said.

198
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:35,371
The first thing I get to me is the name Nea, or Linnea.
 It feels like I'm standing at a funeral, or not a funeral either but that someone has been thrown down here, someone who died here.

199
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:48,331
I see a little girl, like throwing a child down or having brought something down here.
 And I know them the energies and that energy is stuck here and calls for me.

200
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:59,349
Or shouting for some kind of contact.
 And it feels like this room is very active.
 That you have sat here and really get in touch here.

201
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:04,555
For what is below me is so desperate, it really wants to communicate.

202
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:14,104
And here in the chair it is like there is an older woman and she is not so despairing that there is something down here.

203
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:21,635
It's more like she's guarding, she's wished we would come in here.

204
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:31,201
But it feels very powerful, that it is linked to throwing someone down here.

205
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:46,504
We can say that child screams have been heard from there.
 That it is like there is a child there.
 There are voices in here and everything possible, so here you could sit down and be completely silent just.

206
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:55,304
Here I think they have done some challenge and tested here.

207
00:23:55,304 --> 00:24:11,092
After all, I read in the book about hangers, moving, thrown when the Perron family was here.
 They even got beaten with hangers in some wardrobes.

208
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,403
A voice is heard in the room.

209
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:23,255
What the hell was that?
 Did you hear?

210
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:25,677
Wait I check.

211
00:24:25,677 --> 00:24:27,376
Someone was talking.

212
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,548
A voice is heard in the room.

213
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,894
Woman.

214
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:45,540
Damn, I heard something through the handsets.

215
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,559
Did you?

216
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,275
There was a woman who answered.

217
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,506
Could you hear what she said?

218
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:52,668
No, it was not possible.
 Damn what I shudder.

219
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:57,195
Did anyone whisper?

220
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,287
Yes.
 It was something like that.

221
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:07,383
Good.
 This is what can happen and now it is happening.
 This is what we want because voices have been heard here and now you heard it Viktor.
 Too bad you couldn't interpret what she said.

222
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,625
Because I just said Hello, so maybe it was a Hello back.

223
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,764
What's your name?

224
00:25:25,647 --> 00:25:29,790
This is the coolest I have ever experienced now.

225
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,798
Right now it is pillaged in the hair in different ways.

226
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,138
Are you touching me now?

227
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:46,006
Grab my arm properly.

228
00:25:56,405 --> 00:26:05,325
Imagine when you get a touch here, one there, one here, it jumps between.

229
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:10,141
I thought I would see if the hair could move.
 But awesome with an EVP.

230
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:15,025
Wonder what it said.
 But we will be able to listen to that during the analysis.

231
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:18,586
And it's fun that you heard it in real time.
 I am super happy about that.

232
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,446
There is something about the mirror I think.

233
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:26,759
I try to sit in front of it.

234
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,748
I do, because it's like they step out all the time.

235
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:34,122
I stand here next to it.

236
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:38,390
Can you show up in the mirror for Niclas?

237
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,312
It was kind of what I knew.

238
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:46,556
Wait!

239
00:26:50,813 --> 00:26:52,503
Is anyone going?

240
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:57,669
There is someone who goes.

241
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:16,154
There were clear steps here.

242
00:27:16,154 --> 00:27:18,358
That must have been heard!

243
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:20,951
We go against it, I just have to pick this up.

244
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:24,560
Did you hear the steps in the headphones?

245
00:27:40,094 --> 00:27:41,657
Damn!

246
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:49,520
This is here Niclas.

247
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,597
Go against it then.

248
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:55,809
Again!

249
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:20,273
But we go up the stairs now, and we will come back to the living room.
 Then we take the upstairs as well.

250
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,554
Did it start again?

251
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:27,831
Now its time.

252
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,297
I'll take this up then.

253
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:35,283
It is sick that it starts twice.

254
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:39,270
We start something more, I put on this.

255
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,383
It's a damn run here, it's everywhere.

256
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,225
What are you feeling?
 What is up here?

257
00:28:50,225 --> 00:29:00,762
I feel stressed and get stress up here.
 I see children again, but I also see adult energies.

258
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:10,405
I see that there has been a family here, or a mom and a dad.
 And that something dark has stood here and roared and frightened.

259
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:20,356
And that you have stepped forward and so you have come from the side and taken a strangle of people who have slept in this bed.

260
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:29,641
Then it is a huge portal from here and here, this is where everything runs comes.
 Very much in that.

261
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:34,937
It's like the energies just pull me in there.
 That we should go further.

262
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:40,398
Should we go further then?
 Should we bring it too?
 Bring PRS.

263
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:53,757
Here was the children's bedroom.
 Those who slept in these beds went into that room, that's where the big sister always was, Andrea platform.

264
00:29:55,089 --> 00:30:04,889
But this is also here, around the wall, this is where they woke up and heard this frame.

265
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:14,236
And you have found them bodies, outside the house.

266
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:26,753
Just.
 The previous owners took the theory of these soldiers.
 That it may not be this wall but the wall that goes around.
 And then they found five.

267
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:31,820
But they have not excavated them.
 They don't really know, but they think it's there.

268
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,865
Should we try to go into the last room here too?
 See if anything more happens.

269
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:44,822
And this should be Andrea Perron's bedroom.
 The oldest in the siblings.

270
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:55,821
I get to see two peers in any case, two girls.
 Now it is one of these girls who shows how she pulled out of this bed.

271
00:30:55,821 --> 00:31:05,805
That she was lying in bed and then been pulled in her leg and pulled out.
 She wants to show me that there is something here.

272
00:31:05,805 --> 00:31:15,490
I also see a smaller girl, who gets out of bed and walks around the room, in circles.

273
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:24,529
Like she wakes up and then walking around and around like this.
 Like something that has affected her and tried to take over her body.

274
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,348
Someone controls her?

275
00:31:26,348 --> 00:31:27,912
Exactly.

276
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:38,835
The children have come in here because it thought it was a safe place.
 But they have also seen a little boy coming.

277
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:48,225
They have even played with the boy and had discussions with him what I understand.
 But they have also been around thrown in that scrub there.

278
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:56,766
The door to that scrub has also been opened so I think you can check it out too before we go down.

279
00:31:56,766 --> 00:32:15,200
I get very dizzy in here.
 I see as an energy that sits down, narrow and dark.
 It is not a man I see but this is also some kind of being.

280
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:27,408
Who just grumbled for me.
 Sitting in the corner now and growls, with red eyes.
 Very unpleasant.
 Sitting there in ....

281
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:35,242
It sits and the corner and bites the nails like this.

282
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:39,251
So yes, very uncomfortable.

283
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:43,251
We go down and we make a new constellation.

284
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:09,258
Now we have changed a bit in the groups here.
 I think we are going down into the basement, you see that I have been lurking on me so it will be an Este's method.
 Or if Johanna gets to test.

285
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:15,225
We will go down to this table which is down in the basement, we here too this well there.

286
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:20,681
We will place some instruments in the corridor at the same time.
 Now I start to shudder, now it will ..

287
00:33:20,681 --> 00:33:22,308
Good.

288
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:30,373
I've had it twice, you've had it a little more.
 It comes from nowhere, that's nice.

289
00:33:30,373 --> 00:33:31,180
Or?

290
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,972
Or?

291
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:41,807
But we will go down, place stuff and get started and communicate a little.
 We have no other communication tool, but now we are and listen for voices.

292
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:45,329
And maybe we manage to catch something more EVP, we caught one when we stood down there.

293
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,073
We go down.

294
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:51,457
What is it?

295
00:33:51,457 --> 00:33:54,943
It was a red lamp that flashed over there.

296
00:33:54,943 --> 00:33:56,097
Wait stay here.

297
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:57,389
Did you say a red lamp?

298
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:58,496
Yes.

299
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:01,705
I'll check if it flashes again.

300
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:02,894
No.

301
00:34:02,894 --> 00:34:04,421
Here.

302
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:13,841
Here it was a red lamp that flashed.

303
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:24,525
So hopefully the camera caught, no damn I was probably in the way of it.
 I thought if it might be an aggregate that was shining, but it is not.

304
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:32,096
I will post paranormal Movement Alert.
 We may hear it if something is moving out here.

305
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:45,105
I also have some motion sensors, who say Hello Welcome, so I post them here.
 And we know that the woman has been seen walking here.

306
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:52,979
Now I have put it quite sensitive, in case something goes by there.
 I'll try stamp next to it.

307
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,118
Here I put a Hello Welcome.

308
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:15,284
And so we have these cats toys.
 We place everything in a line here.

309
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:25,197
We then have a surveillance camera over there and we go into the room there.

310
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:36,395
Here Johanna is one that you talked about, The Crooked Lady.
 It is this that the children have drawn.

311
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,990
Yes, they have drawn her yes.

312
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,968
Yes.

313
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:41,173
I will post this one.

314
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,948
Red and green.
 Wilma said there is a woman in this chair.

315
00:35:53,133 --> 00:36:02,327
So we can see if it gives answers at the same time, because I will sit here, you can sit there and one there maybe.
 So I start with Este's method.

316
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:07,116
I put one more flux behind us here.

317
00:36:11,308 --> 00:36:23,458
For those of you who do not know what Este's method is, Niclas will start a spirit box with headphones.
 He also has a blindfold so he doesn't see.

318
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:29,240
So all the energies that are down here in the basement.

319
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:31,827
May come in here.

320
00:36:32,249 --> 00:36:35,868
Go to these blue pulsating ...

321
00:36:35,868 --> 00:36:41,481
By the way, I have Noise Canceling, so I will not hear what you say.

322
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:44,813
Yes.
 Good!

323
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:46,256
I get started.

324
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:48,982
Now I got shudder.

325
00:36:48,982 --> 00:36:50,635
There has been nothing started before huh?

326
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,523
No, now this is starting.

327
00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:58,795
What's your name?

328
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:03,586
Why do you want us to go?

329
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:11,823
Will you show up for us tonight?

330
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:23,159
Then show you to us.

331
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:30,153
Behind who?

332
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:33,556
Can you make a loud sound?

333
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:40,666
Yes, there!

334
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:43,714
It starts to shudder on my arms.

335
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:45,217
Same here.

336
00:37:47,752 --> 00:37:49,926
Both!
 There and there.

337
00:37:49,926 --> 00:37:51,639
Someone touched me at the neck.

338
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,921
Okay.

339
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:53,775
Check!

340
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:55,695
He also doesn't know that these have just started.

341
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:57,183
No, he doesn't know.

342
00:37:57,605 --> 00:37:58,992
What is it?

343
00:37:59,512 --> 00:38:02,133
It sounded like someone was standing there.

344
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:07,074
Who are you who came and supported?

345
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:12,162
Do you see that he is watching this?
 Where you tell me you saw someone.

346
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:14,245
No, I heard ..

347
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:19,671
It crushed as well as in the floor.

348
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:25,192
We want to know who you are.

349
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,711
Who are you?

350
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,479
Do you want us to leave this room?

351
00:38:36,504 --> 00:38:39,595
There is someone who moves me at the neck all the time, I get mad.

352
00:38:39,595 --> 00:38:42,543
Are you behind Niclas now?

353
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:48,177
Continue touching the neck.

354
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:51,310
You can touch him.

355
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,781
I got a lot of headaches now.

356
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:56,933
Did you get a headache?

357
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:00,313
Here.

358
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:02,173
In the temple?
 I don't really see.

359
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,871
Yes, the temples.

360
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:05,209
Okay.

361
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,659
Who is it that affects Viktor too?

362
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:10,864
I have to break.

363
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:15,078
What is it?

364
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:20,241
Someone pulls their fingers in the neck all the time, it's so damn uncomfortable.

365
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,903
Like this?

366
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:30,916
No, very loose.
 Like this.
 From one side to the other.
 First, I think it might be a moth or something that landed on my neck.

367
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:33,306
But then you had seen it and said it.

368
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,706
Viktor got a damn headache.

369
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:37,847
Is it going well?

370
00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:43,523
But now I've tested.
 Now I want you to test this.

371
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,576
Do you want to hold it?

372
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:53,623
Directly we get green.

373
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,558
Good.
 We get directly green.

374
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:59,125
And so shivers.

375
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:06,000
What's your name?
 Can you say who you are?

376
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,225
Were you behind me before?

377
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:13,640
*No steps recorded*

378
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,838
I heard someone walking there.

379
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:19,187
Is a woman here with us?

380
00:40:30,951 --> 00:40:32,707
Can you do something against Johanna?

381
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:34,764
*High bang in the building*

382
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:36,448
Did you hear that?

383
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:43,002
It came from the iron cabinet ...

384
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,474
What was that?

385
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,223
Did you hear that?

386
00:40:47,223 --> 00:40:48,618
Yes.

387
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,119
It's out.

388
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:54,999
It was it ..

389
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,898
Though a daughter bang.

390
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:01,444
*High bang in the building*

391
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:09,066
Now everything is starting to spin for me.

392
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:12,898
At the same time, it sounds like a cricket, but we haven't had that in here.

393
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:14,315
No.

394
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,434
It starts to spin for Johanna.

395
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:22,737
She may know something in the neck there.

396
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,283
What is that sound?

397
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:29,563
I don't know if there is any cricket or ...

398
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:31,864
Does it come out from or?

399
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:35,190
Now something happens.

400
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,979
It feels like someone is pressing, I want to pull my head like this ...

401
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:43,765
It's like someone presses like this.

402
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,817
What is it?

403
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:49,968
The battery on this one.

404
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:50,986
On which?

405
00:41:50,986 --> 00:41:54,796
It went down to 20% now.

406
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:55,854
On the display?

407
00:41:55,854 --> 00:41:57,469
Yes.

408
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:00,420
And so this strange sound.

409
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,018
Now it takes on battery.

410
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,372
Should I break?

411
00:42:07,372 --> 00:42:09,403
You can do that.

412
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:22,938
Be strange.
 It was really like, I didn't feel anyone pressed, but it felt like the head wanted that way.
 And then when I was going to pick it up, it was sluggish.

413
00:42:22,938 --> 00:42:28,873
We said your name once, then you say your name.

414
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,818
Yes, green.

415
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:33,790
I really heard Johanna.

416
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,874
I have a headache.

417
00:42:35,874 --> 00:42:38,473
Shall we cancel and get up?

418
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:48,641
Or should you run up and get a Sony camera and do we drive a little neighbor?
 We just drive in Nighvision here.

419
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:49,661
Okay.

420
00:42:49,661 --> 00:43:00,724
We have switched to Nighvision because we do not have the usual camera we usually have.
 For Viktor who has the camera has extreme headaches, we also have Lennie who has crashed totally, he is completely exhausted.

421
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:10,351
Wilma who also knows things, we have not been up for a while so we do not know how the others feel.
 But we had to send away Viktor so he has to recover a little neighbor.

422
00:43:10,351 --> 00:43:15,102
We drive down here.
 I feel it still works for me.
 Does it work for you?

423
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:16,619
Yes.

424
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:17,377
For you?

425
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,488
Same here.

426
00:43:18,488 --> 00:43:25,210
We have tested Este's method and we got decent stuff on different instruments.
 Wait...

427
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,806
Now it's music.

428
00:43:26,806 --> 00:43:28,035
Huh?

429
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:29,489
Is it music?

430
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:40,170
Didn't you hear music?

431
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,170
No.

432
00:43:47,149 --> 00:43:48,469
With piano.

433
00:43:56,496 --> 00:43:58,998
I hear it!
 I shiver!

434
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:03,270
Why do I hear this music?
 I hope the camera catches this.

435
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:06,308
*Music Niclas Hear not caught by the camera*

436
00:44:08,323 --> 00:44:15,363
Is it this lady with crooked neck who goes down here?

437
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:21,798
Green on it.

438
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:23,097
Directly there.

439
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:24,490
Thanks!

440
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:29,625
What shivers I have again, they come and go.

441
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,749
Do you want to go and stand there and look here?

442
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:41,261
Okay, if anyone behind Johanna can you come here?

443
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:45,632
So Johanna will feel you, if you are there.

444
00:44:46,054 --> 00:44:47,637
I don't like this.

445
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:50,473
Does it feel like it could ...?

446
00:44:54,307 --> 00:44:57,062
I hear steps!

447
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,409
There is something behind it.

448
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:01,074
It's like someone stands like this.

449
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,102
Will you show up for us tonight here?

450
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:06,305
*Knock*

451
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:17,760
Do you know what we do Johanna?
 We go up and check if Viktor is okay, then I think you and Wilma go away.

452
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:26,925
I want you to test sit on the sofa where the Seans room was.
 And after that, I want you to take you upstairs and test.

453
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:32,180
So we'll see if something happens.
 We go and look at how it is with the others.

454
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,723
Where do you want?

455
00:45:53,723 --> 00:46:01,398
I am drawn to the room with the books.
 So if we go in there and see what I get through.

456
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:08,802
I have a PMB with me that I intend to place against this bookshelf.

457
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:21,888
What I will do now is I open up and then I pray the energies ...

458
00:46:21,888 --> 00:46:24,156
come here.

459
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:36,000
It is still this blue book that is talked about.
 That's what I see linked to this man.

460
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,936
I'll see if I can get any name.

461
00:46:45,778 --> 00:46:50,370
You who stand there could you touch any of the books?

462
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,640
Would you be able to push something down from the bookshelf?

463
00:46:52,640 --> 00:47:01,785
I would like to ask you to push something down from the bookshelf.
 Thank you so much that you show us so clearly.

464
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:07,483
*Steps in the second room*

465
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:12,699
*Whispers heard from other room*

466
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:16,493
Surely someone whispers outside?

467
00:47:16,948 --> 00:47:18,496
Oh God!

468
00:47:19,048 --> 00:47:21,262
That's exactly what I heard.

469
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,899
As soon as I started with my hands.

470
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:36,537
What was that?

471
00:47:36,537 --> 00:47:38,349
It was a giant movement.

472
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:43,346
But God I saw some shape here on the sofa!

473
00:47:43,346 --> 00:47:48,153
Step in here with us and influence the equipment again.

474
00:47:51,793 --> 00:48:00,833
He sneaks out there.
 He sneaks around out there and it's like he wants to pull us out.
 Do you want to move out there?

475
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,402
Does he want us to go out there?

476
00:48:02,402 --> 00:48:04,539
Yes or so he ....

477
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:11,294
I would like him to come in here first.
 If he comes in here, we are happy to go out to him later.

478
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,409
Oh my God!

479
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,708
This is totally sick.

480
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:18,462
Very strong.

481
00:48:19,404 --> 00:48:20,377
Thanks!

482
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:22,615
We are very happy to come out now.

483
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:27,419
Yes, now we have actually said it.
 We thank you so much and we will come out to you.

484
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:31,742
Now he's here!
 He is playing here now.

485
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,887
He probably wanted to be in there himself then.

486
00:48:33,887 --> 00:48:35,447
He wants us.

487
00:48:35,447 --> 00:48:36,818
Certainly what he wanted.

488
00:48:36,818 --> 00:48:38,278
I have such shivers now.

489
00:48:38,278 --> 00:48:42,000
Would you like to sit on the couch, will I sit on the floor?

490
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,372
Can i put this one?

491
00:48:43,372 --> 00:48:45,084
Place it between us here.

492
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:56,335
And the energy I had contact with in there is in the doorway and looks at us.
 It's like they are uploading for something to happen here.

493
00:48:56,335 --> 00:48:59,528
If we have someone with us now ..

494
00:49:01,056 --> 00:49:02,827
Thanks.

495
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:07,904
Is your name George?

496
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:11,077
Thanks!

497
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,371
Is it your book George that you show me all the time?
 Does that book belong to you?

498
00:49:25,448 --> 00:49:26,707
Thanks.

499
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:46,885
I see as he uploads a lot, with energy before he can answer.
 He has quite weak energy in himself, not so powerful so it takes a lot for him.

500
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:48,656
Thanks!

501
00:49:49,306 --> 00:49:54,828
Would you be able to pick up the book and show us?

502
00:49:59,183 --> 00:50:01,879
If it falls a book now I die ...

503
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:09,346
I know you have affected and torn down that book, can you do it again?

504
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:11,433
*High bang in the building*

505
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:13,176
What was that?!

506
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,000
What was that?

507
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,050
Was it a book?

508
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,401
It may have been a book.

509
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:23,333
It was from there!
 Yes.

510
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,722
Yes, it was from there.
 100%.

511
00:50:26,722 --> 00:50:28,092
Up from.

512
00:50:35,144 --> 00:50:39,432
It sounded like a chair or something was overturned.

513
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:44,827
It was just after we asked him too.

514
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:54,412
It was like someone was throwing something.

515
00:50:57,564 --> 00:51:00,875
Should we check the library down there?

516
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:10,754
No book that lies.

517
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:15,314
The stones are still there.

518
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,716
I heard it like it came from the hall.

519
00:51:18,716 --> 00:51:21,500
Yes I heard it in your direction as well.

520
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:52,583
There's no one here.
 Now all crickets we hear.
 Tony and I are sitting with lurks and we hear this bang, we know it in the floor.

521
00:51:52,875 --> 00:52:00,543
And everyone says it came from where we sit.
 Johan who sits without headphones says it comes from the outside.

522
00:52:01,193 --> 00:52:04,261
Very difficult this.

523
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,423
*High bang in the building*

524
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:37,704
This house has been on our bucket list as long as we have had the paranormal interest.

525
00:52:37,899 --> 00:52:50,645
The dream of once being allowed to get to the United States and being able to investigate this house has been a dream and it now feels almost unreal to stand in this mentioned house.

526
00:52:50,645 --> 00:53:02,655
We went into the house with the knowledge of what happened to previous owners and the hopes of experiencing something that this is large.

527
00:53:02,655 --> 00:53:12,000
We got to know early on the feeling of being observed and the whole group was affected in different ways.

528
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:22,842
What stands out during this investigation is the sound of steps in the basement.
 And an EVP that the cameraman perceived.

529
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:32,859
But what affected us most is the clear bang that everyone heard, but which we did not find the reason for.

530
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:42,601
We thoroughly went through the whole house and outside, but without finding the cause of the sound.

531
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:56,203
If we get the chance, we will once go back and hopefully get to see and experience what got the Perron family to leave for good.
