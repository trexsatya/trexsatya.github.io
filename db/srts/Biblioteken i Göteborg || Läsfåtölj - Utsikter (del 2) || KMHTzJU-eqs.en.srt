00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,960
Welcome back to Gothenburg City Library

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,440
And our second part of reading chair.

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,420
Timo and Annika are with this time too

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,080
And we continue on our theme: Views.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,540
Views

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,320
In the synonym dictionary we also find:

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,820
overview

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,860
chance

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,920
ability

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,420
perspective

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,160
From perspective to Nils Ferlin:

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,880
The wind is grievous,

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57.560
The cold string:

14
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01.440
Please be good for a small stable!

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,100
For he wishes something for his own part

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,120
Is it just a Magdeburg game.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,260
That would he finger little songs on

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,660
that would all the parish with astonishment beating.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,580
And people would travel in miles and more

20
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,880
To hear his handkind.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,320
Vregig is the wind, the cold string:

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,160
He curves up,

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Our stable.

24
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,780
However, soon he will sit in highness large

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,300
And snap on buttons of pearl.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,260
Then it will be to say at mill and crusher:

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49.560
A strange man! - An acquaintance to us.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,980
Yes he went here and froze just like us.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,340
- A great genius

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,900
So it could sometimes fall a word.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,940
- Although air is air and soil

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,600
so that it is likely that our stable bang freezes stiff

33
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,240
in the cold string.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,060
Freezes themselves - just like we,

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,180
And never get big and famous and free.

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27.560
Without just allowed to go there -

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,520
day after day,

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,440
as we

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,080
with pre -grazed

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,480
features.

41
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,120
First

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,440
It became quite quiet in the village:

43
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,980
Denied the comet proved his place in the sky

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,700
For the whole congregation!

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Portent

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,780
said one to the end

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05.340
- A racker to shine! - -

48
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08.820
Now the grace time was blown out,

49
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,200
Now it's time to think!

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,100
Now is the time to shop right

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,920
toward the mor- and fatherless,

52
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,640
and garde in every way

53
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,400
And be religious.

54
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,400
So they set out with speed at glasses and postillas

55
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,240
and sighed so heavy and rare

56
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,140
About the world's wreck conditions.

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,880
They bowed for poorjon as before for thick stomachs

58
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,740
and weighed right in the trading residence

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,820
for almost 14 days

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,880
They looked at the almanac's leaves in sproutingly surprised,

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,520
Until someone came one day and sad:

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now it's even a month.

63
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01.660
Then they shone up and called:

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,260
See,

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,720
Birch and lunders are still shining.

66
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,880
What were we put in sigh and woe for old church customers?

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,420
Yet jumps

68
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,200
Over the meadow and the sun over the rye.

69
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,120
But bring quickly, stable, back the old wave!

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,740
So it became speed and racial and noise and business again

71
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,940
And poverty and crayfish around all the landowners.

72
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,200
In happy friends' cheerful teams sat the guys and soppy

73
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,200
and laughed in full

74
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,280
ate the rumors as a run.

75
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,880
For, they said -

76
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,300
at fat flare on gorgered cigars,

77
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51.080
Plästa and coming us with whips and guitars.

78
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,120
We are sitting where we are sitting now

79
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,200
And don't have it so crazy.

80
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,900
That comet comes three times in the quarter.

81
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,900
He is still here, he is still there and curvature worse.

82
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07.967
- We toast for the day that is

83
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,940
And trust our Lord!

84
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,520
Now i will pray to be able to sing a song

85
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
on Yiddish

86
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,960
by a poet named Anna Margolin, who was born in Belarus in 1887.

87
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,520
Already in 1912 she moved to New York and lived there until 1952.

88
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,700
and it was a few months since I got the honor

89
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,500
To compose some fantastic poems by Anna Margolin.

90
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,600
Among other things this, "Ich bin Gewen A Mol A Jingling"

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,780
"I was once a youngster"

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,640
(song on Yiddish)

93
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,440
I was once a youngster

94
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,260
heard Socrates in the arcades

95
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,100
and my soul mate, my darling

96
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,620
Had the most beautiful Torson in Athens.

97
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,940
Yes Caesar

98
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,960
And a bright world built of marble.

99
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,220
I, the last

100
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,440
And to wife I chose out

101
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,280
My proud sister.

102
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,200
In rose wreath with wine until late

103
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:02,200
I heard with highly calm about the waving from Nazareth

104
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,120
and wild stories about Jews

105
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
(song on Yiddish)

106
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,700
From Margolin to Andersson:

107
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,839
Now the spring's lukewarm winds

108
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,911
In the Yellow's Yellow Star,

109
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:49,055
And slowly rise the fairy tales around the island in Berga Fors.

110
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,407
Forgive a splash of bitter joy,

111
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,700
a show to guitar,

112
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59.800
The strong us to healing

113
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,880
Like the young pores of the beach.

114
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06.080
A song to you, my sister,

115
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09.020
When all the ground awaits ours!

116
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,680
Luossas Ljunghed buzzes dizzy of wind and wild bees.

117
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,260
There we learned heavy steps

118
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,060
In our youngest years,

119
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,180
And no one knows how deep we drank our childhood bitter wine.

120
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,740
But lovely,

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,860
Lovely spring came every year in roses dressed,

122
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,720
Although the twilight of the grief sought us and bleached the color of the cheek.

123
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42.047
A day on knees for the king,

124
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,340
one night for the shadow scared,

125
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,680
and then you drank bliss

126
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,220
out of river and mountains and mountains.

127
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,660
Come out,

128
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,860
When the storm winds wild in Apel, Arrow and Hägg!

129
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,280
See, spring heavens burn

130
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,820
To the praise of God and stars!

131
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,680
And when you are anesthetized to dreams

132
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,820
of the resented at your wall,

133
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,260
All the roses of meadows shout,

134
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,760
Come out to us and slept!
