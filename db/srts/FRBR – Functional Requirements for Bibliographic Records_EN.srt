1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:15,640
Now we will talk about FRBR - Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,160
And this presentation it contains reviews of

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,340
FR models: FRBR, FRAD and FRESS.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,696
FR models' groups of entities.

5
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,024
FRBR and LIBRIS/BIRTFRAME.

6
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,864
The user needs of the FR models.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:45,500
And finally, quick questions about FRBR's entities of copies, manifestation, expression and works.

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:54,160
RDA is based on internationally recognized models, especially IFLA's models:

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,140
FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records)

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,900
Frad (Functional Requirements for Authority Data)

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,140
Frozen (Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data)

12
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,200
We will go through the FR models' entities now.

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:30,080
The FR models identify a number of so-called entities that are central to users of bibliographic data.

14
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,460
These entities can be divided into three groups.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:45,340
Group 1, works, expression (works and expressions correspond to works in Libris).

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,280
Manifestation (manifestation corresponds to the instance of Libris).

17
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
And finally copies.

18
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:03,840
Group 2 consists of person, family and institution.

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:12,500
And group 3, concept, object, event and location.

20
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:25,300
Group 1, Works - It is a defined intellectual or artistic creation.

21
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:35,800
Expression - the intellectual or artistic form a work may every time it is realized,

22
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,940
Text, sound, image, etc. Or a combination of these forms.

23
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:52,000
Manifestation - The physical design of an expression of a work, e.g. A certain edition

24
00:02:52,540 --> 00:03:00,200
Copies - an individual representation of a manifestation.

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:15,320
Example 1 - text, works events at water by Kerstin Ekman

26
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,220
Expression of that work - the original text from 1993.

27
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,480
A translation into English of events in water is another expression of the same work.

28
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,580
Manifestation, which is thus called the body in Libris.

29
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,760
The edition published by a book for all in 2007.

30
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
The same text published as e-book is another manifestation of the same expression.

31
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
Copy

32
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,664
KB's copies of the edition from a book for everyone.

33
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,808
Gothenburg City Library's copies of the same edition is another copy.

34
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,720
Example 2 - Music Recording

35
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,840
Works - Arbos by Arvo PÃ¤rt.

36
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,040
Expression - the recording with The Hilliard Ensemble from 1987.

37
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,220
Manifestation - ECM edition from 2008.

38
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,380
And copies - KB's copies of the ECM edition from 2008.

39
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,200
Group 2 - person, family, institution.

40
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,940
They are called with a common name for agents.

41
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:05,000
The agent may, for example, be responsible for the creation, participation or publishing of the entities in Group 1.

42
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:14,120
and indicated at any of its levels: works, expression, manifestation or copies.

43
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:26,260
Group 3 - Concept, object, event and location.

44
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,060
These entities can be the topic of the entities in Group 2 creates.

45
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,680
A work can be about a concept (eg Japanese theme),

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,380
an object (eg a statue), an event (eg a concert, or a demonstration)

47
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,480
And finally, the subject can be a place (for example Stockholm).

48
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,420
Here is a model that shows the entits in the FrB's group 1:

49
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,260
Works, expressions, manifestation and copies with examples and mutual relationships.

50
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,380
The idea of defining the different levels is that information that is linked to the higher

51
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,040
The description levels works and expressions should be able to be "inherited" by the underlying levels.

52
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
And here we have works - the Red Room created by August Strindberg, writer

53
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,335
The work is realized in expression

54
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
The original text in Swedish

55
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,015
The text translated into Danish

56
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,120
And the text read in Swedish.

57
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,480
The term is being embodied in manifestation

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,300
Original edition of the original text in Swedish and a second edition of the original text in Swedish.

59
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,120
First edition of the text translated into Danish, an audio book in Swedish

60
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,220
of the text read in Swedish and an audio book on MP3 CD

61
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
of the text read in Swedish.

62
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,903
And the manifestation is finally represented by copies.

63
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,535
Then we have KB's signed copies of the original edition,

64
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,220
KB's two copies of the second edition of which the other has a worn cover,

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,880
KB's copy of the first edition of the text translated into Danish,

66
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
As a gift from Denmark,

67
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:55,135
KB's copy of the audio book on CD and KB's copies of the audio book on MP3-CD,

68
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,380
Which happens to be scratched. This is a fictional example I can announce.

69
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,380
And here is the same example in Libris/Betframe.

70
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,920
Since Betframe has merged works and expressions to one level, here lies, the translation and read

71
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
on the same level.

72
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,343
We still have the work Red Room

73
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,023
But at the same level, the text is translated into Danish and the text read in Swedish

74
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,887
And the work still has August Strindberg as a creator,

75
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:45,055
While the text translated into Danish has a translator as with a

76
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,639
Overall names are called contributors.

77
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,551
The contributor to the text read in Swedish, it is the reader.

78
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:04,255
At the level of instance we have the original edition of the Red Room and the second edition.

79
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,180
We have the text translated into Danish in a first edition

80
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,520
And we have read the text in Swedish in audio book on CD and audiobook on MP3 CD.

81
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,740
And then we have stocks. The equivalent of copies.

82
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,440
And then, as before, we have KB's signed ex of the original edition,

83
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,511
KB's two copies of second edition,

84
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,375
KB's copy of the first edition of the Danish text

85
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,263
And KB's two copies of the audio books, one of which was scratched.

86
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,503
FRBR and Frad also defines a number of user needs as bibliographic

87
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,831
Data and authority data must fulfill.

88
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,695
These user needs are also important in RDA.

89
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:14,820
Bibliographic data describing a resource should help the user find.

90
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,740
Find materials that correspond to the search you have made. For example

91
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:28,220
Should you be able to find all resources within a particular subject, or a recording that has been released with a certain title.

92
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:39,240
Identify - identify a resource. For example, one should be able to be sure that the resource described

93
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,120
corresponds to the resource you are looking for, or be able to distinguish between two resources that have the same title.

94
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:54,600
Choose - choose a resource that is adapted to one's needs.

95
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,960
For example, you should be able to choose a text that is in a language that you understand.

96
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Gain access to - gain access to the resource described.

97
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,640
For example, one should be able to order a resource in the library's collection, or via the internet have access to a

98
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,140
Electronic document stored on another computer.

99
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,103
Authority data - which describes an entity related to a resource,

100
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:32,479
Such as a person or institution or a work,

101
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
shall help the user to

102
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:42,020
Find information about an entity as well as resources related to the entity.

103
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,380
Identify that the entity is the one to seek for and be able to distinguish between one or more

104
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
entities with the same or similar name.

105
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,055
Get clarity in the relationship between the entity and a resource.

106
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,223
And understand why a name has been chosen as the preferred name for the entity.

107
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:12,415
And here is a concrete example of user needs for bibliographic data.

108
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:21,120
I want to find the movie "Go on Water", and then identify that it's the movie about

109
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,480
The construction of the Ãresund Bridge, and not a movie about Jesus.

110
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:36,000
Then I choose the DVD edition and not the one on Blu-ray, because I have no Blu-ray player.

111
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,120
Then I can access it after ordering it from another branch.

112
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,839
And now we finish this presentation with a number of quick questions

113
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,959
that is about identifying the entities in Group 1.

114
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,567
And the first question is: identify the copy

115
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,000
An edition of the Red Room published in 1981

116
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,880
A hardcover signed copy

117
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,900
A Finnish translation

118
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,600
Recording of Drottningholmsmusiken by Johan Helmich Roman

119
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,720
GÃ¶sta Berlings saga by Selma LagerlÃ¶f

120
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,960
Which one (s) of these is a copy

121
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
And the answer is

122
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,687
B - a hardcover signed copy

123
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,159
The next question will be: Identify the manifestation of these examples.

124
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,255
A - an edition of the Red Room released in 1981

125
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,840
B - a hardcover signed copy

126
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,420
C - a Finnish translation

127
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,340
D - A recording of Drottningholmsmusiken by Johan Helmich Roman

128
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,420
E - GÃ¶sta Berlings saga by Selma LagerlÃ¶f

129
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,903
And the correct answer is a - an edition of the Red Room published in 1981

130
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
Identify the expression

131
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,935
A - an edition of the Red Room released in 1981

132
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,020
B - a hardcover signed copy

133
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,840
C - a Finnish translation

134
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,740
D - A recording of Drottningholmsmusiken by Johan Helmich Roman

135
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,080
E - GÃ¶sta Berlings saga by Selma LagerlÃ¶f

136
00:14:52,420 --> 00:15:02,360
And here it is both C - a Finnish translation and D - recording of Drottningholm music that is expression.

137
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,280
And identify the work

138
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,895
A - an edition of the Red Room released in 1981

139
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,711
B - a hardcover signed copy

140
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,783
C - a Finnish translation

141
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,980
D - A recording of Drottningholmsmusiken by Johan Helmich Roman

142
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,260
E - GÃ¶sta Berlings saga by Selma LagerlÃ¶f

143
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
And here is the correct answer e - GÃ¶sta Berlings saga by Selma LagerlÃ¶f

144
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
That is all.
