1
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.720
The school has a very dark side too.

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.480
It felt like an experiment.

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.040
Whoever invented the railways received criticism.

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.880
The stamp came.
 "We can't have whole houses full of stamps!"

5
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.240
It's almost the worst thing you can do to children, to divide them.

6
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.560
Everyone, all interesting ideas have started to say:

7
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.600
"You can't, so you can't do that?"

8
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.440
We all knew what temperaments we were.

9
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
You are sentenced and then you remain in that union.

10
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.800
"Now thick Daniel will be allowed to run, he needs exercise."

11
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.640
Yes, but it was mental abuse.

12
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.840
What a fucking society we are sitting in, that's what we are trying to change.

13
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.120
Rules about food, how to dress ...

14
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.800
There was a spiritual idea with everything.

15
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.000
You sat in the teacher's knee, and then the teacher held the mouth and nose with his hand.

16
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.920
Pain and horror would be so strong that the child "woke up".

17
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.720
It is a hell to change society.

18
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.000
You have to start by changing yourself.

19
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.000
Everyone has murdered someone, everyone has raped someone.

20
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.160
Then it might not do anything if you get a little frightened in the forest.

21
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.440
I am head of school at the school.

22
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.400
Would you say that something could happen today?

23
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.320
<c.sang> up through the air

24
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.280
<c.sang> away over the ocean

25
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.080
<c.Sang> over the earth

26
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.560
<c.sang> in a staggering journey!

27
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.800
<c.sang> the queen of the morning

28
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.200
<c.sang> with the rosy rod

29
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.720
<c.sang> waving us out

30
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.840
<c.sang> against a waking world

31
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.520
<c.sang> the queen of the morning

32
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.760
<c.sang> with the rosy rod

33
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.960
<c. Head Tapers> For a year I have tried to understand <c. Head Tapers> What we were with om-

34
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.520
<c. Head Tapers> - which magnificent goal <C. Head Treaty> who justified the school's actions.

35
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.480
<c. Head Tapers> and Slowly but surely <c. Head Tapers> I think I get closer to an answer.

36
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.000
This is my "dead", I am getting rid of all the books.

37
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.560
Cleaning out before flying from here -

38
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.160
- So others do not have to take care of it.

39
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.920
Of course, Steiner and Anthroposophy.

40
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.600
It is an experiment that has been going on for far too long.

41
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.320
You have been walking around and felt that you are intended for something bigger.

42
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.040
Then comes reality and hits one in the face: where are your high school grades?

43
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.200
Fuck no, you are like anyone as well.

44
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.840
Everyone is so damn pie.

45
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.040
<c. Head talkative> As a child we were involved in <c.hhuvoretare> an experiment -

46
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.120
<c. Head Tapers> - which largely <c.hhukhurstare> was led by Pär Ahlbom.

47
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.640
After all, it is Pär who is the "inspirator".

48
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.120
I was asked by him, several were asked by him.

49
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.160
He was the spiritual principal.

50
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.320
<c. Head Tapers> Solvik, like all Waldorf schools, is based on an anthroposophical view of humanity.

51
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.520
Many people usually put similarities between anthroposophy and Waldorf school.

52
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.840
Yes, one is not conceivable without the other, so you understand.

53
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.600
<c. Head talkative> At Solvik, it was mainly Pärs <c. Head Treaty> Interpretation of Anthroposophy.

54
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.400
He was like the highest.

55
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.560
He sat on the throne at Solvik.

56
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.560
People come from all over the world to listen to him -

57
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.960
- And learn from him.

58
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.400
<c. Head Tapers> To truly understand <c. Head Tapers> What we have been through, and why -

59
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.000
<c. Head Tapers> - I must understand Pär.

60
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.680
There he is.

61
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:21.120
If I were interested in earthly worries, I would beware.

62
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.400
Then I would say no to this movie job.
 Actually.

63
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.880
But I'm not interested.
 I am interested in something completely different -

64
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.040
- As then.

65
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.680
This with that he is so spiritually interested -

66
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.040
- Can it be reflected in what the students are about?

67
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.240
I really think so.

68
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.600
<c. Head Treaty> This is Elsa, Pär's daughter.

69
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.360
I broke my arms in six places and got such a serious concussion -

70
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.320
- That they had to drill holes in the temple to even out the pressure.

71
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.360
-How did you do it?
 - The swing.

72
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.520
I had a near-death experience.
 So, I don't know if I was dead -

73
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:30.040
- But I saw myself from the top when I was unconscious.

74
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.360
I know which way they went and how they put me in the car and stuff like that.

75
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.520
And Dad was totally ... So, he was so excited.

76
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:48.040
My value went up by a thousand percent when I had the near-death experience.

77
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.680
<c. Head Tapers> Pär is a convinced anthroposophtics.

78
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.080
<c. Head Tapers> Anthroposophy was created <c. Head Treaty> by Rudolf Steiner -

79
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.640
<c. Head Tapers> –And for him was the spiritual life <c. Head Treaty> as real as the physical.

80
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.240
We are almost not here, there is very little comparatively.

81
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.240
It is a continuous existence -

82
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.920
- Which is of a completely different dignity and reality.

83
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.600
<c. Head Tapers> that Steiner believed in knowing this -

84
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.080
<c. Head talkative> - many of his followers <c.hhukhurstare> were due to his being clear.

85
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:45.120
<c. Head Tapers> that he could fully see <c. Head Treaty> in the spiritual world.

86
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.720
He was clear -sighted, yes.

87
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.360
He says it all the time, "There is a difference between me and all of you."

88
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.840
Would you say that you are clear -sighted?

89
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.080
To some extent.
 There are those who like it.

90
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.960
If a clear look is, then just sit and receive.

91
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.160
For all that comes out of that person is truth.

92
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:44.880
I had such impressions, I was often looking at the earth from the outside.

93
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.400
And knew that outside the world of mind began another world-

94
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.280
- which was even more real.
 Clearly.

95
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.360
Me and the teacher have a conflict.

96
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.240
I run and hide under the pillows in one corner of the classroom.

97
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.760
Then he takes some classmates with him and jumps on the pillows -

98
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.080
- When I lie down.

99
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.840
People jump on me, lie on me -

100
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.240
- And I don't know what's up and what's down.

101
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.400
I remember thinking it didn't hurt as much to die as I thought.

102
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.400
And then it gets black.

103
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.760
It is a very difficult experience.

104
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:15.360
And then I wake up under the pillows and it is completely empty in the classroom.

105
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.760
There is no one there who says it is okay or takes care of me.

106
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.080
<c. Head Tapers> Maya's teacher does not want to participate in a <c. Head Treaty> Interview.
 He does not remember the event -

107
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.040
<c. Head Tapers> - But at the same time, it does not have <c. Head Treaty> is unthinkable that it may have happened.

108
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.240
I get very sad when I think about that situation.

109
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:56.680
I think of myself as that little six -year -old girl.

110
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.840
I mourn what happened to her very much.

111
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
<c. Head talkative> It is not Pär himself who has been accused <c. Head talkative> of being violent against the children.

112
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.160
<c. Head talkative> but how the students <c.hhuvatare> have perceived his reaction -

113
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.640
<c. Head Tapers> - goes as a red thread <c. Head talkative> through much of what I hear.

114
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:28.720
I tried to talk to Pär about my experiences, at a little more adult.

115
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:37.960
This experience of not having a sense of up and down ...

116
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.560
It became a philosophical discussion of it.
 It was about-

117
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.720
—That I had an out -of -body experience -

118
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.080
- For then you do not have access to the balance mind.

119
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.320
It was turned to the fact that it was an exciting and special experience -

120
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.880
- As I was treated to experience.

121
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.520
It was like ... It was something really fantastic.

122
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.720
It sounds really sad.

123
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.480
If she really experienced death anxiety, then it is terrible -

124
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.760
- Meeting someone trying to make one think it was good.

125
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:34.000
Sadly, I don't remember the situation as it was.

126
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.240
I don't do that at all.

127
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:43.720
<c. Head Tapers> What can be so important that it <c. Head Practer> justifies such behavior?

128
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.440
<c. Head talkative> How can a child's trauma <c.hhukhuktare> be perceived as something fantastic?

129
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.240
<c. Head Tapers> It has taken me a long time <c. Head Tapers> to understand -

130
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.200
<c. Head talkative> - But eventually the case the token down.

131
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.360
<c. Head Tapers> Steiner stated that man <c. Head talkators> in the future will develop -

132
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.040
<c. Head talkative> - to a higher level of spirituality.

133
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.160
<c. Head talkative> but that development is threatened.

134
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.960
He warns, and it has become just that.

135
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.560
I see an ongoing social disaster in full swing.

136
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.480
It is powerful forces, what we call materialism.

137
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.880
<c. Head Tapers> Steiner says that the modern <c. Head Treaty> Society and its Materialism -

138
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.800
<c. Head Tapers> - Risk to Destroy <c. Head Table> Our Spiritual Development.

139
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.560
Our only rescue is actually spiritual knowledge.

140
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.160
For the whole pedagogy is a matter of awakening the young man.

141
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.960
<c. Head Tapers> Through the Waldorf pedagogy, Steiner <c.hhukhurstare> saw an opportunity to counteract the threat.

142
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.920
<c. Head Tapers> Children are in closer contact with <c. Head Treaty> The spiritual world, he explained.

143
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:47.720
You know, this is a truth, my friend.
 Children meet angels.
 All children!

144
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.400
And to stop it is a pure crime.

145
00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:01.480
You mean that the role of the school is to help the children on their way to the spiritual?

146
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.120
Yes, so they can open up and do not close.

147
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.120
So that the opportunities exist.

148
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:47.600
<c. Head Tapers> The idea of an approaching threat is <c. Head talkative> The basis for the entire Waldorf pedagogy.

149
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.800
<c. Head Tapers> But Pär and other founders at Solvik <c. Head Treaty> made a more radical interpretation.

150
00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.040
When Steiner had done Waldorf School, they asked him: "Are you satisfied?"

151
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.800
Then he replied: "No. Much more art!"

152
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.960
"For materialism, people cure much faster than I thought."

153
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.120
The world becomes materialistic and cold at furious speed.

154
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:24.000
So we fought for a Waldorf school that Steiner would have wanted it.

155
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:34.600
Pär: If you take Steiner seriously, then you get a damn thinker.

156
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.360
<c. Head Tapers> with such a conviction <c. Head Tapers> About the Spiritual World -

157
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.520
<c. Head Tapers>-Is it easier for me to understand <c. Head Treaty> How a Near-death-experience-

158
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.600
<c. Head talkative> - Can be seen as something positive.

159
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.440
Critics for Steiner would say that much cannot be proved ...

160
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.320
Yes exactly.
 But what then proves?

161
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.760
I can't even prove that thoughts exist.
 I don't actually care.

162
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:08.320
I think it's so damn stupid, so sluggish and so cheap.

163
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.640
Thus, I think the criticism of Steiner is cheap.

164
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.120
And if now you don't have the slightest interest -

165
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.640
- Because there is a world outside the sensual one, then you can have it.

166
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.600
Please, eat your sausage and lie in your bed and sleep-

167
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.720
- and fuck and make money, please.

168
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.960
What a life, what a limited fucking life.

169
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.000
<c. Head Tapers> Pär was the chief ideologist, <C. Head Treaty> The Mentor of the Teachers.

170
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.320
<c.huvudaret> But in contact with the students <c.hhuktaret> it was the teachers themselves who decided.

171
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.400
<c. Head talkative> and in his eagerness to "wake the students" -

172
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.640
<c. Head Tapers> - Some have been prepared <c. Head Treaty> to go very far.

173
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.760
The teachers made a game with us ...

174
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.760
... who was voluntary.

175
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:29.120
You sat in the teacher's knee, and then the teacher held the mouth and nose with his hand.

176
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.120
He kept to his nose and mouth of us child-

177
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.280
- We were panicked as well.

178
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.920
You had to say when he was going to release, and then he usually released.

179
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.640
Or not.
 So maybe he lasted a little longer.

180
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.120
So you were almost suffocated.

181
00:20:53.320 --> 00:21:00.680
Some of us were incredibly brave and quite strong children in some way.

182
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:08.600
Sometimes I think he found a pleasure in forcing those kids -

183
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:15.240
- And go even further to crack them as well.

184
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:24.800
It was called "Mangling Children".
 It was useful to manage a child.

185
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.760
They stood on our stomachs.

186
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.360
We lay there, seven to eight year olds, with our narrow little bodies.

187
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:40.040
The purpose was probably some form of ... shock therapy -

188
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.440
-or as well as near-death therapy.

189
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.200
Pain and horror would be so strong -

190
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.960
- That the child like "woke up".

191
00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.440
<c. Head talkative> The teacher confirms that they kept for <c. Head talkative> mouth and nose on the children.

192
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.600
<c. Head Tapers> He says it was an exercise <c. Head Treaty> that had to do with breathing.

193
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.360
<c. Head talkative> But he denies that he <c. Head Treaty> should have stood on some children.

194
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.160
<c. Head talkative> He doesn't want to be interviewed.

195
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.880
I recognize it from thoughts and ideas about the teaching -

196
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.640
- And some teachers who ... took methods.

197
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.880
<c. Head Tapers> During this year I <c. Head Tapers> got to take part in so many stories -

198
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.760
<c. Head Tapers> - If teachers who must have been <c.hhuktaret> violent against children at Solvik.

199
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.960
I don't understand, I've never beaten a child.
 I do not understand.

200
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.280
I don't get it into my head how they could believe -

201
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:57.040
- That it would have to do with pedagogy.

202
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:10.960
No one takes responsibility for all broken people who left school -

203
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.800
- And for all the crap that has happened.

204
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.800
Nobody has said:

205
00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:24.840
"Fuck, we fucked up. I wish I could correct it."

206
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
People just want to silence it and pretend it has never happened.

207
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.320
Take rods, all.
 Each.

208
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.960
<c. Head Tapers> Pär is still at Solvik, <c. Head Treaty> as a mentor for some teachers.

209
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.120
<c. Head Tapers> Sometimes he jumps in <c. Head Tapers> into teaching.

210
00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.280
<c.huvudaret> But he is no longer responsible <c. Head talkative> for what is happening at school.

211
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:07.640
My name is Peter Friemann and I am today head of school at the school.

212
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.640
<c. Head Tapers> 13 years ago <c. Huvudpratare> was Peter student at Solvik.

213
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.800
<c. Huvud Tapers> Facebook Group <c. Huvud Tapers> with students' stories -

214
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.600
<c. Head Tapers> - became an eye opener for him as well.

215
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.960
There was pretty much that happened before I went here to school.

216
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:29.120
And that way, it became mostly a kind of surprise because ...

217
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.760
... It wasn't right with my experience when I went to school.

218
00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:40.200
But at the same time, I had no doubt whatsoever that it was true.

219
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.480
It was quite clear that it had happened.

220
00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.480
How serious did you think it was?

221
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.640
So, very serious.

222
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.920
A lot of what was described is something that people can break down.

223
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.400
<c. Head Tapers> Many former students <c. Huvudpratare> tell about a stray bullying -

224
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.560
<c. Head Tapers> - and a culture of violence between the students.

225
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.760
<c. Head talkative> The question is how much of the <c. head talkator> remains at the school today.

226
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.400
I would not say that the risk at Solvik is greater than at other schools.

227
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.120
After all, it is not as free as then.
 It is more controlled, more structure.

228
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.840
And there are more rules that also apply to the children and so on.

229
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.120
<c. Head Tapers> Today when I visit the school, <c. Head talkative> so is very different.

230
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.280
<c. Head Tapers> There are <c. Head Tapers> Schedules, Benches and Watches.

231
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.520
<c. Head Tapers> Most of the stories I heard <c. Head Treaty> took place many years ago.

232
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.680
<c. Head Tapers> But the problems with teachers <c. Head Treaty> who have been hard -handed with students -

233
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:59.480
<c. Head Tapers> - Works have been left to fairly <c. Head Treaty> recently, albeit to a lesser extent.

234
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.680
There have been boundary cases.

235
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:09.640
There has been reason to look at it more closely on some occasions.

236
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.680
I would not say that there are teachers here who abuse the children -

237
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.360
- As a common feature of teaching.

238
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.000
I am convinced that it is not so.

239
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.320
<c. Head Tapers> Although much <c. Head Tapers> seems to have changed at school -

240
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.080
<c. Head talkative> - some things are equal.

241
00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.360
Do not stop, then you get them in the skull.
 Just go.

242
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.040
<c. Heat Tapers> Helena is still <c. Head Treaty> as a teacher.

243
00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.440
<c. Head Tapers> and just a few years ago <c. Head Treaty> was the Meete Rector.

244
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.760
Welcome!

245
00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.640
How much of the anthroposophical steiner tanks-

246
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.440
- Are you experiencing there in school today?

247
00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:02.200
There is a lot, as many teachers attended the Waldorförarhöre School -

248
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.960
- And brought thoughts from there.
 There are also teachers left-

249
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.920
- Which has worked with the founders and brought thoughts from there.

250
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.400
You have understood the former teachers and founders -

251
00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.640
- That they really took Steiner seriously.

252
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.200
One thing that is central to Steiner's thoughts is karma and reincarnation.

253
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.560
Right.

254
00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:38.280
The essence of anthroposophy is that you are not here for the first time on earth.

255
00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.760
You already have the bag full.

256
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.400
I have been told since I was a kid theories about what reincarnations -

257
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.600
- I have had before, and how it has affected how I am now.

258
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.280
<c. Head Tapers> Steiner said <c. Head Tapers> that we live several lives on earth.

259
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.520
<c. Head Tapers> What we did in a life <c. Head Treaty> affects how our next life becomes.

260
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.440
If one has a rather powerful personality -

261
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:14.160
- So maybe you have been an emperor in your last life for example.

262
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.800
<c. Head Treaty> A fine singing voice.

263
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.000
<c. Head talkative> How to go and move.

264
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.520
<c. Head talkative> if you have a big or small head.

265
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.600
<c. Head talkative> whether you are noisy or shy.

266
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.840
<c. Head Tapers> Everything may have <c. Head Treaty> with the child's karma.

267
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.760
How important was it to you and for you as a teacher in your response?

268
00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:43.480
Fully one hundred percent important.
 Most importantly!

269
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.240
<c. Head Tapers> According to Steiner, a Waldor Flear <c. Head Treaty> should help the child on its karmic trip -

270
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:56.560
<c. Head Tapers> - so that it will further <c.hhuvoretare> in its spiritual development.

271
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.680
<c. Head talkative> for if you live a life <c.hoe -Catcher> without contact with the spiritual -

272
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.160
<c. Head Tapers> - so it can have consequences.

273
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:12.320
If I choose the other way in life, the materialistic ...

274
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.000
Then I get a full dividend as long as I am here.
 And then...

275
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.600
Then it will be fun.

276
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:29.400
As a rule, it will be a march back, maybe without arms and legs.

277
00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.520
Or almost without understanding.

278
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.880
After all, I've seen how difficult the disabled people -

279
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.320
—Rot their, or precisely because of their severe handicap -

280
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.640
–Not had any materialistic perception -

281
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.720
- The without helplessly extradited to an inner world.

282
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.000
So that such a life can repair a giant damage.

283
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:07.480
<c. Head Tapers> If you deny the spiritual world, <c. Head talkative> then you risk, according to Pär -

284
00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.680
<c. Head Tapers> - to be disabled in the next life.

285
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.520
Everyone has murdered someone, everyone has raped someone -

286
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.720
- All has stolen something, and everyone has done something.

287
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.960
So then maybe it does not do anything if you get a little frightened in the forest.

288
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.200
Precisely that branch, when it lived -

289
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.040
- Then you could stand on it and go out.

290
00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.920
<c. Head talkative> This is Marcel.
 He is a former <c. head talkative> teacher and head of school at Solvik.

291
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.920
<c. Head Tapers> He was with us from the beginning, <C. Head Tapers> and built the school.

292
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.600
When we hung up the swings, there were sometimes from ten feet up -

293
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.480
- That you would throw yourself down and hit a volt and so on.

294
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.200
Up here is the one I told you about.

295
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.720
- Here they did bungy jump.
 -Yes.

296
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:35.280
That people basically broke their backs and there came ambulance helicopter -

297
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.960
- Was there anything reflected on then?

298
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.120
Then we noticed that "this does not hold".

299
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.960
Therefore, I felt that I could not stand for that swing anymore.

300
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.120
But it took a while for me to be able to say ...

301
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.560
--... that we remove it.
 -In order to...?

302
00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:02.160
In the beginning when someone fell, it was: "It fit in that person's life".

303
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:07.600
So there was some kind ... It doesn't happen by itself, not without further ado.

304
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.760
Something else would have happened to that person.

305
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.240
There were such thoughts that we often experienced -

306
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.040
- That if something happens, it is not by chance.

307
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.920
Then there is something inside.

308
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.640
<c. Head talkative> The swing was thus left -

309
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.920
<c. Head Tapers> - With the motivation that if children <c.hhuvatare> injured themselves, it was their karma -

310
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.560
<C. Head Tapers> - And that would not be counteracted.

311
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.320
Do you remember discussing the swings and saying it must be dangerous?

312
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.280
- "If you hit yourself, then you hit yourself."
 -No.

313
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:51.320
- Can you have participated in the discussion?
 -Absolutely not.
 Absolutely crazy.

314
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.800
If you discussed, "Is it worthwhile that so many people settle off? Should the swing away?"

315
00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.800
No.
 First, I know that there are not many.

316
00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.960
Me, Kristoffer and Iduna may be the ones who have hit the most.

317
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.720
Yes, but ... I actually haven't bothered that.

318
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.880
- But why haven't you bothered?
 - I don't think it's important.

319
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.160
Children could have died.
 Why don't you think it's important?

320
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.720
Well, I think that is very important.

321
00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:35.520
So comes the School Inspectorate and wonders how much anthroposophy means.

322
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.280
Then it is important to be a little smart, and so you say:

323
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.000
"We are doing Waldorf pedagogy and not anthroposophy."

324
00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.120
This with reincarnation there is nothing in the Waldorf pedagogy ...

325
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.280
... finished.

326
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.720
So I always thought when they came:

327
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.680
"Reply so they can accept it, it will be quiet."

328
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:04.000
<c. Head Tapers> I went to a school <c. Head Treaty> where you should have let children bullied -

329
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.080
<c. Head talkative> - because they were who they were.

330
00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:13.320
<c. Head talkative> a school where children were allowed to hurt themselves, <c. head speaker> because it fit in their lives.

331
00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:20.440
All this is anthroposophy.
 And I see on the other side several students -

332
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:24.720
- That has been damaged by the consequences of this.

333
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.480
It is quite awkward against Steiner and his intentions -

334
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.880
- Trying to find angles that show that it can go awry.

335
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.960
How oblique has it been for Christianity, for Muhammedanism -

336
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.240
–Af the science or for the medicine?

337
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.080
It is not possible to reason so, to remove responsibility ...

338
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.600
I see a confused spoiled upper -class kid with too much leisure -

339
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.880
- As found on something and made people believe in him.
 Because it's not ...

340
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.360
He is not behind all that.

341
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:09.960
He is funny.
 He has his games, but ... yes ...

342
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.040
There is really no weight behind it.

343
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:24.560
He thinks he can see as well as the intangible in some way.

344
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.400
- You shake his head ... - He can't, but he wants it.

345
00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.080
I think he has intellectually learned and knows a lot about it.

346
00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:42.000
Then I think Dad wish he was one who could see longer ...

347
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.280
He sometimes pretends that he can talk to animals and such.

348
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.440
Hello friend.
 Yes I know.

349
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.000
He often greets, I think.

350
00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:00.080
Several times he has been injured and bitten by some poisonous centipa-

351
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.480
- Because he wants it so much.

352
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.840
He has certainly been cruel to people, but not present to his children.

353
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.680
He has always said, "I don't love you more than anyone else."

354
00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.800
"I love people who can do something good."

355
00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.800
- Does he own?
 -Yes.

356
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.720
To feel that you have the family behind you, it has never been there.

357
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.440
It has always been the school.

358
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.920
Everyone looked up to him so damn much, and everything he said was team.

359
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.720
It was always like "Pär".

360
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:53.560
But he is not ... He is not God like that.

361
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:07.320
It is not possible to save that place.
 It sits in the walls.

362
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:19.240
A former teacher has said that they did not tell the School Inspectorate -

363
00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.400
- How much reincarnation and anthroposophy affect pedagogy.

364
00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:29.000
- You just have to say what they want to hear.
 - Yes, God ... yes, exactly.

365
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.760
These are exactly the things that the school needs to move on.

366
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.200
If there are such light -shaded things left -

367
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.520
- So you simply have to work them away.

368
00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.120
I hear myself say on many questions: "Today it is different."

369
00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:57.800
Obviously there are things that are a bit special here -

370
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.480
- As you need to continue working with.

371
00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.920
If we choose to do school like this, then special situations - then arise -

372
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:12.080
- Where things can happen that don't happen anywhere?
 The answer is probably yes.

373
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.560
Why is it so hard for you to talk about this?

374
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:25.560
Because I have my children in school, actually.

375
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.240
My children are in school now.

376
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.400
I don't want to expose them to anything -

377
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.080
- And I don't want to expose myself to anything.

378
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.160
- So they go to the school you yourself ...?
 - I have put my children there.

379
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.800
-How is it that?
 - Yes, I swore to never do.

380
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:57.160
Because my feeling is that the school has changed a lot.

381
00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:03.360
The beautiful thing that was there when I walked there is left, but not as extreme.

382
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.440
The art and game are still there.

383
00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:20.080
- I put my son on Solvik.
 - Trot you have been through yourself?

384
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:26.240
Yes, but I went in and said, "Hello, Merete! So this is the situation ..."

385
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:33.320
My concern for what is left in the atmosphere -

386
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.480
- They were responsive to, I experienced.
 So I believed in it.

387
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.200
But I regret it bitterly.

388
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.400
<c. Head Tapers> Robin had felt bullied by his teacher throughout his school time.

389
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:56.400
<c. Head Treaty> In 2010 he still chose Solvik <C. HOVA PREPRATER> as a school for his son.

390
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:02.680
He probably got the same role, my son, as I got -

391
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:07.160
- And not placed in that.

392
00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:13.840
I am in deep sadness that it became so at least -

393
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.720
- That he had to make the same trip as me in some way.

394
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:30.240
<c. Head Tapers> It seems that some problems <c. Head Tapers> from the past have remained.

395
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.800
<c. Head Tapers> At the same time I see how the school <c. Huvudpratare> has changed in several ways.

396
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.120
<c. Head Tapers> But perhaps the <c. Head Treaty> Most important question remains:

397
00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.600
<c. Head Tapers> Which of Steiner's ideas are still alive?

398
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.400
<c. Head talkative> I think of karma.

399
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:50.680
<c. Head Tapers> that you looked at children's injuries <c. Head Treaty> as something that fit into their lives.

400
00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.480
Is that attitude left at school?

401
00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.400
Many teachers at the school are anthroposophists -

402
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.000
- As has cared a lot about what Steiner has said and so -

403
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.880
- So I dare not say that it is not left.

404
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.840
<c. Head talkative> Steiner talked a lot about karma.

405
00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.040
<c. Head Tapers> I think of the Solviks Teacher <C. Head Treaty> who has been accused of -

406
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.840
<c. Head Tapers> - To with an educational thought <c. Head Treaty> Have paired Children -

407
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.920
<c. Head talkative> - where one needed to fight -

408
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.000
<c. Head Tapers> - and the other needed to learn <c. Head Treaty> to stand up for himself.

409
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.480
Mm ... Yes, there we get into that swampy area -

410
00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:46.280
- Which is almost similar to Karma or so there, or reincarnation.

411
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.400
Yes ... that's a tricky idea.

412
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.080
Would you say that something could happen today?

413
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:15.560
Yes, it is a little difficult, if you think the ideas remain.

414
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:21.720
It can easily happen without anyone noticing, if it is not pronounced.

415
00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:26.520
If it were to be pronounced in the college, then my hope - is

416
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:32.480
- That it gets reactions that show that it may not be a good idea.

417
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:38.800
But I may not think that the school has done such a job around the issue -

418
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:44.280
- It is quite clear that this is not what we do.
 I do not think so.

419
00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.080
It would need to be done, actually.

420
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.800
Mm.

421
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.520
<c. Head Tapers> What Started <c. Head Tapers> As a Story of My School Time -

422
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:05.560
<c. Head talkative> - deals with suddenly about what is going on <c. Head talkative> for the children attending school today.

423
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:11.000
<c.huvudaret> that they run the risk of being treated <c. Head talkative> from a karmap perspective.

424
00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.880
<c. Head Tapers> Since the autumn of 2020 <c. Head Tapers> Solvik is included in the same organization -

425
00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.320
<c. Head Tapers> - like the other Waldorf schools <c.hhuvatare> in Sweden.

426
00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:28.160
<c.huvudaret> I want to know how Waldorfskole- <c. Head talkative> Federation views its new member.

427
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.760
Please Johannes, can you email me?

428
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.840
Do not want to participate - as the main organization of the Waldorf Schools

429
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
- And give you a picture of what a Waldorf school is?

430
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:45.120
I ask you now, hearing my prayer, write it down.

431
00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.800
<c. Head talkative> but they do not want to put up <c.hhuktaret> in an interview.

432
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:54.520
<c. Head Tapers> They explain that they do not comment <c. Head talkative> about individual schools.

433
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.480
<c. Head Tapers> I have understood that it is not possible <c. Head talkative> to set similarity signs -

434
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.920
<c. Head Tapers> - Between Solvik <c.hhukhurstare> and other Waldorf schools.

435
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.800
<c. Head talkative> but still it is actually so -

436
00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:11.440
<c. Huvud Tapers> - that several of the Steiner books such as <c. Head Treaty> Inspired Pär and Solvik's teacher -

437
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.080
<c. Head Tapers> - Is Such <C. Head Tapers> that many Waldorflärs have read.

438
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:23.080
<c. Head Tapers> Books where karma and reincarnation <c.hhuvoretare> are included as part of pedagogy.

439
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.840
If you put your child at Waldorf school without really knowing what it is -

440
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.640
- So there may be a risk of misunderstanding, of course.

441
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:43.720
If the school claims to be a Waldorf school, it means to some extent-

442
00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.640
- That such ideologies are at the bottom, is basically.

443
00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.960
-Hello!
 -Hello.
 How's it going?

444
00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.160
- Should we sit outside?
 -We can do that.

445
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.040
But do you have to film?

446
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.960
Because ... there is something that is not quite fun.

447
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:12.320
People call and think you are looking to steal the entire Waldor's movement.

448
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.600
- That I want to steal the Waldor Movement?
 -Yes.

449
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:22.440
After all, the Waldor Movement has to do with anthroposophy.
 That connection is there.

450
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.000
- You can't remove it.
 - not either.

451
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.280
But why are you affected by it?
 You are not sitting with them.

452
00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:35.400
No, but it calls people and says, "Beware, don't talk to Jasper there."

453
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.600
- "Beware what you say now."
 - Yes, I understand.

454
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.000
And then I think, "But help!"

455
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:53.120
I have a question that has grown during this time, to you.

456
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.880
And it is: Do you really know what you do?

457
00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.960
Are you thinking about what happens to school?

458
00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.520
- You know, I shit in it.
 - Sen, afterwards.

459
00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.400
- For example, if it goes down.
 - I'm not going to take responsibility for that.

460
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.680
The loyalty that I knew towards my school-

461
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.840
- Where I grew up, I don't feel as strong anymore.

462
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.320
- Because you heard all the stories?
 - I've met so many now ...

463
00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:30.080
Those who have been good as well as bad.
 I don't feel that loyalty.

464
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.920
- Then you are freed in some way.
 - Yes, I would say.

465
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.720
<c. Head Tapers> My School was a lottery, <c. Head Treaty> with many victims.

466
00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.400
<c. Head Tapers> But I also see how such <c. Head Tapers> who had a good school time -

467
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:06.000
<c. Head Tapers> - Has difficult to find <c.hhuvatare> his place in society.

468
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:12.080
It feels like you are a tourist in ... I always feel different.

469
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.240
It's like something that doesn't ...

470
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:23.680
Yes, maybe almost like you have to pretend a little to fit in.

471
00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:31.040
I'm not really sure it's honest.

472
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.320
Yes, but Pär, there are a lot of people who do not feel that they find their place -

473
00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.920
- Ute in this community.

474
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.640
It may happen that I have a blind page there.

475
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.760
I think they should have changed society instead.

476
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.160
That's my meaning.

477
00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:53.880
<c. Head Tapers> I have met Pär <C. HOVE TRAPER> So many times in the past year.

478
00:47:54.040 --> 00:48:00.640
<c.huvudaret> He still does not seem to understand <c.hhuvatare> What consequences his ideas have had.

479
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:05.280
<c. Head Tapers> But one day in November <c. Head Treaty> So something happens that changes it.

480
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.760
I have to pull, my mom is dying.

481
00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:19.360
I have to leave.
 I'm sorry, I have to tag.

482
00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.840
- But you want a car?
 - Yes, gladly, if it goes.

483
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.680
- Do I have the car keys?
 -Yes you have.

484
00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.640
I can talk about whatever -

485
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.840
-But a spot or a sound reminiscent of her ...

486
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:14.880
So when I'm alone here, I cry all the time.

487
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:24.440
In itself insanely interesting, this condition.

488
00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:33.600
<c. Head Tapers> After a long fight against the cancer, <c. Head Treaty> So Pär's wife Karin dies.

489
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:42.400
I've never mourned before.
 Never in my entire life.

490
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.960
And I have not understood how strange it is until now.

491
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.240
Dad has ...

492
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:57.960
I have never seen him have shame, feel guilt, show empathy.

493
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:03.440
I've never seen him feel someone else's pain, almost.

494
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.520
It's like this grief opened a small, small passage -

495
00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:14.440
- To some kind of empathy.

496
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:24.360
One of the first times I was there so I also told him ...

497
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:29.120
Or I said straight out: "You have these problems."

498
00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:36.200
It's a real ignition with me.
 I've had a real diagnosis -

499
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:42.760
- So I actually haven't noticed how other people are doing.

500
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:50.520
Elsa at least-

501
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:55.640
- That, even if it is late, can change.

502
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.800
And I think I experience it.

503
00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:04.880
That at the last minute I might start to grasp the canter.

504
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.760
I have been a kind of dictator.
 I have been a kind of authority -

505
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:22.400
- which was a bit unreasonable.
 And that made me a little gone.

506
00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.800
I never got to know really.
 And that was my own fault, that is.

507
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:32.800
I drove over everyone in every way, without having a clue about it.

508
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.640
Yes, I have created a kingdom that says:

509
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:43.000
"This is true, outside is not true. Don't believe it outside."

510
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:48.080
Turned on a sect.
 Turned on a sect.

511
00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:52.560
It just had to be that I had been really snapped -

512
00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:57.480
- So damn what people had started to put up with.

513
00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.440
I forced people to adapt.

514
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:10.000
Those who did not want to adapt, they then became hostile or bad.

515
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:15.200
And those who adapted received reward.

516
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.600
Thus, they were accepted.

517
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.080
And that can be disgusting.

518
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.200
I know how much it can affect a human being -

519
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.480
- To have attended this school.

520
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:51.480
How difficult it is to get out of it, build up their knowledge bank ...

521
00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:58.160
... and heal all the trauma that you have been exposed to.

522
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:09.120
I have the hope that my position here and now -

523
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:14.520
- For myself, it was not my fault.

524
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:24.800
What is freedom?
 Is freedom to run around with muddy boots -

525
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.240
–And swing high up in the air?
 Is it freedom?

526
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:36.400
Or is freedom to learn for real, if you want it now?

527
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:44.960
Children who may want to learn to count and read when they are seven years -

528
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.480
- That they may do it may be freedom for them.

529
00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:56.480
<c. Head Tapers> It has been a bit of painful <c. Head Tapers> Travel, Back in My Past -

530
00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:02.160
<c. Head Tapers> - There my romanticized image <C. Head Treaty> of the school went into ruins.

531
00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:06.920
<c. Head Tapers> I try to find the words to <c.huvudare> summarize what we have been through.

532
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:11.200
<c. Head Tapers> But I realize that a person <c. Head talkative> already 40 years ago understood -

533
00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.760
<c. Head Tapers> - What was at stake <c. Head Treaty> in this experiment:

534
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:21.160
<c. Head Tapers> Employment Teacher Ulla, who wrote a <c. Head Treaty> Report on the newly started Solvik School.

535
00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:25.320
"We have such different values and so different methods" -

536
00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:30.120
- "Despite the fact that the basic material, the children and the final goals" -

537
00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:35.240
- "The good and independent citizen, is the same."

538
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:40.040
"Do we work in elementary school wrong and Waldorflärna right?"

539
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.000
"Or is it the other way around? The answer is in the future."

540
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.560
"The saddest thing about the trials is only" -

541
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.840
- "That we have such a precious experimental material."

542
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.360
Stairway to Hell - this hill.

543
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.520
-Hey!
 -Are you hungry?

544
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:21.480
-Is it good?
 - I am joking.
 - Hello!

545
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.160
-Did you get a haircut?
 - Yes, I had a full beard.

546
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:34.600
Now I have ... Related.

547
00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.840
- Are you done with the grief process?
 -No no no.

548
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.880
I was gone too much all the time.

549
00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:01.800
- I literally mean gone.
 - Yes, both.

550
00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:09.560
- Yes, it's hard that it was so.
 - I just think like this, so ...

551
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:15.080
Had someone given my kid an ear file and cut the football with a knife ...

552
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.240
That person had never taken another step.

553
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:24.320
- But I have no idea.
 -Yes!
 I ran home afterwards.

554
00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.800
In any case, he could build and stuff.

555
00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:32.400
Yes, it's great.
 That's what you had as a thought here, right?

556
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:38.040
Only you are good at building and painting, the personality does not matter.

557
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.720
Then you are welcome, whether you are a pedophile or child abuser ...

558
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.040
The only thing they were not allowed to be, it was a trained teacher.

559
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.600
Isn't it completely screwed up?

560
00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.880
This is a place that no one has insight into, that is the problem.

561
00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.600
Here, anything can happen, and no one knows.

562
00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.520
Not even the parents know what happened to their children.

563
00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:06.760
That's what I always tried to say:

564
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:11.920
You have favored and categorized children.

565
00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:16.360
I prioritized everyone who jumped and painted and so on.

566
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:20.760
- And the others they bumped out.
 -Yes it's true.
 It is so.

567
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:28.160
It's just to regret that we were bad.
 We were bad teachers.

568
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:36.160
I can only say that now I know how you feel.

569
00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.000
Do you know that?
 How do I feel, then?

570
00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.360
Right now quite disappointed and cursed.

571
00:57:53.880 --> 00:58:00.440
What I like about you, I like that, not because you are my son.

572
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:06.800
I also love you because you are my son, but it is quite fresh.

573
00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:11.600
- For a year ago, then I didn't say so.
 - You never said so.

574
00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:16.200
But maybe it was nice?
 Because it had been a fucking lie.

575
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:23.000
I can't knock on the door for 23 years and then all of a sudden it opens.

576
00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:28.240
- Then maybe I don't want to go in.
 - No, I have ... okay.

577
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:33.400
- It happens to others ... - you should try.

578
00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.680
