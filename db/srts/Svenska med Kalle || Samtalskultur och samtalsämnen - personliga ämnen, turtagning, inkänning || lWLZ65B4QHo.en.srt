00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:01,255
Hello

2
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:04,695
I go on on this

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,900
Social theme

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,555
The theme about

5
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:11,355
cultural differences, to get in touch with

6
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:13,975
with people and talk

7
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,515
In a new language in a new country

8
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,905
and i text the movie

9
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:21,980
So put on

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,700
the subtitles

11
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:27,285
on your mobile or your computer

12
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:31,065
so can you read what I say at the same time

13
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,475
and

14
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,845
I constantly think that this is

15
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39,845
a language training focus, the question is

16
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:41,445
How we should

17
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:45,545
train in Swedish to get better

18
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,435
And to communicate

19
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:48,935
but to

20
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,525
Lift your eyes a little

21
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:54,705
Look a little bigger and a little further

22
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,785
than only on words and grammar

23
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:02,315
and I think I will use

24
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,875
some slightly more difficult words

25
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:08,365
When I talk and sometimes I explain them

26
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:11,085
so you get a chance to

27
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:15,125
expand, build on

28
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:16,765
your vocabulary

29
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:21,055
And you can always ask in the comments

30
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,195
If you wonder about any expression I use

31
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:26,865
Yes

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,520
And now I'm going to try to take up

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,840
Two little

34
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,935
Different but

35
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,525
Subjects ... two questions, two points

36
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:41,735
that is a little different but connected to each other

37
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:44,655
and I think both are

38
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:46,145
Relevant

39
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:49,475
= they are important to

40
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:50,475
Language training

41
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,580
and that is

42
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,400
conversation topics

43
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:59,015
So what one is talking about

44
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,280
and that is

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,140
Cultural culture

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
I think I start with

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,140
conversation topics

48
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,855
For I think we

49
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:15,035
should talk more about it

50
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:16,755
in other words

51
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,495
When you want to start talking more Swedish

52
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:22,125
in everyday life

53
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,365
What to talk about?

54
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:29,575
And then I want to make a comparison

55
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:32,255
With Somali as I work out orally

56
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,845
At work the most

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,600
For I can talk pretty much

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,755
and can understand some

59
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:43,775
and I feel that one

60
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:46,805
an obstacle for me

61
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,525
or a challenge, something that

62
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:52,545
I would have to work a lot with if I want to

63
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:55,605
get better at talking to people in everyday life

64
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:59,020
It is to understand which conversation topics

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,080
that works and as I said, conversation topics are,

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,100
what you are talking about

67
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:06,525
What things can you talk about

68
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:10,085
and I believe that

69
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,425
I think

70
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:16,035
This may be something that differs quite a lot

71
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:19,075
from different cultures, I don't know

72
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,865
But my feeling is it anyway that

73
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:25,495
that what one is talking about or maybe a little how

74
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:27,825
one is talking about certain things

75
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:29,215
can differ quite a bit

76
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:32,975
And I think that if you think a little about it

77
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,280
Well we take a very simple example

78
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,615
Many people say we talk about the weather

79
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:43,025
In Sweden, okay, that might be true, I don't know

80
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:47,355
So then you can think a little about

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,100
How can I get better at

82
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,440
to talk about the weather

83
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,365
I'm pretty sure of

84
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,865
that if you learn some more words and learn to talk

85
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:59,755
a bit more like Swedes talk about the weather

86
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,885
then it will create a little

87
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:06,135
nicer and better contact

88
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,095
with new people when you do

89
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:13,115
it can work anyway, it depends very much on

90
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:16,595
other things, how is the person you are talking to

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,220
And how are you yourself?

92
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,280
How are you perceived?

93
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:25,085
perceived - how are you perceived?

94
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,975
So: What do others think about you when they meet you?

95
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:30,485
It is very different how

96
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:33,395
people think about us, we are different as people

97
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,395
Some are lucky enough to be

98
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:38,675
nice and charming and happy

99
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:41,485
everyone likes them directly

100
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:44,635
Although they talk, for example, very bad Swedish

101
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,545
Others have a little harder

102
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:51,745
But in any case, everyone can win at

103
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:54,525
to improve one's ability to, for example

104
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:55,865
Talk about the weather

105
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:00,155
But honestly, it is very boring to

106
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:03,295
Talk about the weather.
 Maybe you can do for five minutes

107
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:04,295
in the best case

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,920
So, of course, maybe it can

109
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,580
break the ice

110
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,140
Thus: Break the silence,

111
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,060
break the first little uncomfortable

112
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:17,285
the moment before man

113
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:20,425
find something to talk about - break the ice

114
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,395
maybe the weather can do

115
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,980
But then I think it would be interesting

116
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,360
For everyone to start thinking about

117
00:05:30,405 --> 00:05:33,325
What could we talk about more

118
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,325
What subjects could I take up, what subjects

119
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:39,265
may others be interested in

120
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:42,035
so that it becomes one

121
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:44,505
exchange, that it is not just becoming

122
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:46,745
I tell you something and the other is not answering

123
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:51,485
I have no finished recipe for this

124
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,515
I just think

125
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,995
all who learn a new language

126
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:58,215
especially if you come from a culture that is quite different

127
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,300
so i think there is a lot to gain on

128
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,880
think through

129
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:07,635
what subjects you want to be able to talk about and then work out

130
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:10,485
themselves on it and look for words and expressions

131
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:13,255
I think absolutely

132
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:17,405
and let me ... I have to comment on a thing

133
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:20,045
As I have heard a few times

134
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,775
lately

135
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:25,635
and as myself .... it's like a big question mark for me

136
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,635
I don't understand this

137
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,205
For people say that Swedes

138
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:32,515
not want to be personal and not

139
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:35,225
enjoy personal questions

140
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,625
And I just

141
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:38,115
huh ???

142
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:41,635
Who doesn't?
 They are certainly available

143
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,695
there is certainly something in this

144
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,085
But I think there is also a lot of misunderstanding in this

145
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:51,425
I would even, just as an example now

146
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:54,545
take this with a pinch of salt

147
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:57,865
Don't believe I mean this 100%

148
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:01,415
But I would like to reverse the generalization

149
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,405
and say that almost all

150
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06,625
Immigrants I meet does not seem

151
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,345
be interested in talking about

152
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,455
personal belongings

153
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:14,065
It is extremely rare as someone I meet

154
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,845
at work anyway or who contact me

155
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,945
on chat or like this, it's very unusual

156
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:21,075
to those people

157
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,240
Shows any interest

158
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,800
for something more personal

159
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:29,225
there are exceptions, that is not true (always)

160
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:32,475
And I know I meet people in the role of teacher

161
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,155
so it might make people feel like

162
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:40,555
shy or uncomfortable with that

163
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:41,555
more

164
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,295
contact me personally or take up

165
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:47,645
personal things, but my feeling is to

166
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:51,015
many people are not so interested too

167
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:53,965
or not know how to ask

168
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:56,575
But maybe it's like this, maybe it's like this

169
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,395
This prejudice that no Swedes

170
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,585
want to take up something more personal

171
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05,705
lies in the way

172
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08,715
And it's a shame because I think many of my friends

173
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:09,715
in all cases

174
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:12,785
gladly could answer more

175
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:13,785
personal questions

176
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:16,745
Then maybe you have to build up

177
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:20,045
a trust or

178
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,805
take up the subject in the correct manner

179
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:26,045
and it can be a bridge in

180
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:28,765
So talk about it properly

181
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:31,925
It can be a bridge into conversation culture

182
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,505
So I mentioned for example in a video

183
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,275
on instagram that it is better to ask me

184
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:41,265
Why have you just raised a child

185
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:44,275
than to say

186
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:47,245
you should get a sibling to your lonely son

187
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,375
Poor he, it's like a very

188
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,995
in Swedish culture, at least

189
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:56,635
in my opinion and among my friends, I don't know

190
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:59,775
there are certainly different, but I think

191
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:02,825
Generally in Swedish culture it is very uninvited

192
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:05,665
and disrespectful to directly express

193
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08,895
views on another person's life choice

194
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:12,235
and as well as lay in

195
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,315
How many children that person has acquired for example

196
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:16,675
so that

197
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:20,395
I'm a little used to, I work at SFI so I have

198
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,425
understanding, but at the same time I see after all

199
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:26,535
how person by person, who comes from a more

200
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:29,165
It is great to have many children-culture

201
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:32,365
such a culture that they miss the chance to

202
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:35,065
learn something about how I think by the fact that

203
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:37,595
immediately give in to more comment

204
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:41,055
and in relation to

205
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,965
The person Kalle So it closes the discussion

206
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:45,865
I just get a little like this

207
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:47,315
Tiring

208
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,080
and trying to get out of there

209
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
However, had a person asked a personal question

210
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:56,895
To me so I would have liked to try to explain

211
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59,635
how I think and why

212
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:01,065
My life is like my life is

213
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:04,455
Then of course it can be sensitive for different reasons

214
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:07,545
Ask why someone just has

215
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:10,445
a child for example but

216
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:13,455
For me it had no problem

217
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:16,505
to explain it, but then I have to get an open question

218
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:19,355
I can't get a comment

219
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,595
about how I should do

220
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:23,165
And I meet that pretty much I can say

221
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,995
So there I think there may be such a cultural difference

222
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:29,465
what might actually be meant as a joke

223
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,955
or as just small talk

224
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:34,835
gets in my world

225
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,145
something that closes the door

226
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:40,175
and I don't get the desire to continue that call

227
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:41,075
null

228
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,525
and it's just one example

229
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:45,215
but

230
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:48,125
I want to take another example that maybe

231
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,205
End of this with conversation culture

232
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,425
Because it was very interesting

233
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:57,485
my friend Josefin who has a

234
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,995
Instagram account called "Swedish with Josefin"

235
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:03,215
and that are teachers

236
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:06,255
But she is also the one that helps people in their spare time and so

237
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:09,345
she came and greeted me

238
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:11,335
at work and

239
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:14,955
We sat in the cafe and cooked and there sat

240
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:17,995
a bunch of Arabic -speaking men above all

241
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:20,125
it was probably one

242
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,055
little gang gang sitting there talking

243
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:26,055
and they became very curious and also very happy

244
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:28,955
When Josefin showed that she can talk

245
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:32,215
some Arabic and understand some Arabic

246
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:35,485
and it became a very lively

247
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:38,235
And loud conversation

248
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:41,315
where people interrupted each other and everyone wanted

249
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:44,675
say their opinion and what was interesting was to

250
00:11:45,695 --> 00:11:48,715
I looked at Josefin that she thought it

251
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,745
was great fun, she really liked

252
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:52,745
with the

253
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,655
she was like, one says

254
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:57,395
in its proper element

255
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,425
in its proper element, that means that

256
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,645
that situation suited her

257
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:05,645
perfect

258
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:09,415
I, on the other hand, in one such

259
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:12,865
In such a call

260
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,905
In such a conversation culture where one speaks loudly

261
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:18,805
and talking a lot and everyone seems to be interested

262
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,975
of telling their opinion

263
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:23,785
But not so interested in listening

264
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,395
So it feels to me anyway

265
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,325
I really want to go from there

266
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:32,555
I don't think it's funny and

267
00:12:34,235 --> 00:12:36,305
I have to exert myself

268
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:39,195
So I have to say so go outside

269
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:41,975
that which feels comfortable for me

270
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:44,835
and I can do it, it's not

271
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:48,215
it is like a workout for me too to adapt to different

272
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,615
people's ways

273
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:53,125
to talk and interact and communicate

274
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:54,705
but

275
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,855
I still believe that many would agree

276
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:00,725
that it might be a little smaller

277
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:04,085
common in Swedish conversation culture

278
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:07,335
that seven people (= people) sit and fight

279
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:10,695
about the conversation space and talking in mouth on each other

280
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:14,475
I saw a little movie with an American

281
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,735
person, a man who lives in Sweden and he

282
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:20,705
It described that difference

283
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:23,925
Americans speak louder and more in their mouths

284
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:26,875
on each other and Swedes are a little more

285
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:28,045
Silent

286
00:13:28,395 --> 00:13:31,105
And maybe a little more waiting

287
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,515
Now it's my turn, now it's your turn

288
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:37,065
Lucky, who is talking

289
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,435
now i talk later

290
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:42,565
Is it your turn and you talk

291
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:44,315
It is called the take -off

292
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,845
How to take tours in a call

293
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:50,855
And I think that is

294
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:53,845
such a thing one can study

295
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:57,175
If one wants to be better at communicating in a new language

296
00:13:57,175 --> 00:14:00,215
How to take tours

297
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,215
In this language

298
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:05,635
both which sentences one uses

299
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:08,395
to take the word and hand over the word

300
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:10,425
And also a little

301
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,675
How to make it more social

302
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,125
If you interrupt each other much or

303
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,815
Is it more that one hands over the word

304
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,055
and get it back a bit like this

305
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:23,935
And as I said, I am Swedish and Josefin is Swedish

306
00:14:23,935 --> 00:14:24,935
null

307
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:28,075
We experience this very different

308
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,475
We talked about it afterwards

309
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:33,025
So it's also about ...

310
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:35,295
Here will probably the last expression I want to

311
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:39,435
sell in, it's about knowing (a particle verb)

312
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:42,365
know, a particle verb

313
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:45,035
to know the one you are talking to

314
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,385
and

315
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:51,745
So you talk to Josefin for example, then it's just

316
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:54,265
to drive on

317
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:57,785
And she will think it's great fun, it will be a good contact

318
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,765
If you talk to me then it is

319
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:04,605
or a person who is like me

320
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:08,035
then it is better to be a little more cautious, ask a little

321
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,115
Tell a little, so to take some more

322
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,300
responsibility for

323
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,000
The take -off in the conversation

324
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:18,555
it would, so to speak, work much better because

325
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,185
Get a contact with a person like me that is a bit more shy

326
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:23,315
And a little more cautious

327
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:25,485
and so on

328
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:28,875
But there we have a little different things if I try

329
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,940
repeat, yes but we have

330
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,760
Call cultures there

331
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:37,295
one can speak higher or lower

332
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:40,335
one can cancel more, ie that

333
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:42,365
you take the word from the other

334
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:46,175
one can cancel more or cancel less

335
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:48,465
We have the take

336
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,720
Do you talk a lot yourself or try to ask the other

337
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,620
We have this to know

338
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,620
We have the big question mark

339
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,935
Want Swedes to be personal

340
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:04,765
Or don't they want it?

341
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:08,865
can it be about how to

342
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,775
Takes up more personal subjects?

343
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,975
perhaps

344
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:15,765
How is it where you come from

345
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:19,005
How is it in your culture, in what way is man

346
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:21,225
Personalized with you

347
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:25,695
was that maybe it me

348
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,735
Just that .... and really think about this with the topics of conversation

349
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:31,415
conversation topics can be quite

350
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,865
important to get a call to

351
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:36,435
flower

352
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:39,775
For example, if I take myself again

353
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:43,185
Do you start talking about music on a curious

354
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:45,955
interacting manner

355
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:48,335
so you will probably get my attention

356
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:49,685
I love music

357
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:52,185
Do you start talking about politics

358
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,435
so it won't work as well

359
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,645
it depends a little but i can't be able to keep up with

360
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:01,495
so much so i'm a little bit

361
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:05,335
If you start talking about like this, what happens in the government

362
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,915
or what is happening

363
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,615
In something like this trade agreement between

364
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:12,425
China and Russia

365
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:15,385
it won't work so well on me because i can't so much about it

366
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:18,465
But with another person so maybe it really is

367
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:21,045
The best tip

368
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:23,535
Talk about things you read in the newspaper

369
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:26,595
so will you really find a lot to discuss

370
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,405
I definitely know such people

371
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:31,225
who might think it's the most fun to talk about

372
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:34,725
so it is different and there must be but

373
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:37,365
be curious and feel in

374
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,300
and as well as try a little

375
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,900
What can work with this person?

376
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:45,685
and sometimes you fail and sometimes you succeed

377
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:50,445
and that said for me

378
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,240
is this really

379
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,920
a matter of learning a new language

380
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:58,975
one can go down to word level and

381
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:01,805
What a grammar and

382
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:05,125
which phrases you use to get a call better

383
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:08,415
But it is constantly linked to these larger ones

384
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:11,355
perspectives, what are we talking about

385
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:12,735
and how

386
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:14,095
We talk

387
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,235
in different contexts and how differ

388
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:19,505
between cultures

389
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,585
And between people

390
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:23,655
okay

391
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:27,765
I hope this was useful and useful

392
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:28,765
and

393
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:32,175
all reflections and comments

394
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:33,805
are welcome and I

395
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:37,345
My goal is to answer all the comments

396
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,345
as

397
00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:41,425
have some kind of content but sometimes

398
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:45,205
it takes some time before I can go through

399
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,965
But I try to answer all that

400
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:51,505
I am thankful for thoughts and comments and questions

401
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:55,295
Hope to see you again soon

402
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:59,005
and have it so good, hello hello
