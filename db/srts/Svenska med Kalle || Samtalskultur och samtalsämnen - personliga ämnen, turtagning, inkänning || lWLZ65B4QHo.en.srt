00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:01.255
Hello

2
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:04.695
I go on on this

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,900
Social theme

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08.555
The theme about

5
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:11,355
cultural differences, to get in touch with

6
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:13,975
with people and talk

7
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16.515
In a new language in a new country

8
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,905
and i text the movie

9
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:21,980
So put on

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,700
the subtitles

11
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:27,285
on your mobile or your computer

12
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:31,065
so can you read what I say at the same time

13
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,475
and

14
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,845
I constantly think that this is

15
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39.845
a language training focus, the question is

16
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:41,445
How we should

17
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:45.545
train in Swedish to get better

18
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,435
And to communicate

19
00:00:47,935 --> 00:00:48,935
but to

20
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:51,525
Lift your eyes a little

21
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:54,705
Look a little bigger and a little further

22
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,785
than only on words and grammar

23
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:02.315
and I think I will use

24
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,875
some slightly more difficult words

25
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:08.365
When I talk and sometimes I explain them

26
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:11,085
so you get a chance to

27
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:15,125
expand, build on

28
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:16,765
your vocabulary

29
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:21,055
And you can always ask in the comments

30
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,195
If you wonder about any expression I use

31
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:26,865
Yes

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,520
And now I'm going to try to take up

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,840
Two little

34
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,935
Different but

35
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,525
Subjects ... two questions, two points

36
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:41,735
that is a little different but connected to each other

37
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:44,655
and I think both are

38
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:46,145
Relevant

39
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:49,475
= they are important to

40
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:50,475
Language training

41
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,580
and that is

42
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,400
conversation topics

43
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:59,015
So what one is talking about

44
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,280
and that is

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,140
Cultural culture

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
I think I start with

47
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,140
conversation topics

48
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,855
For I think we

49
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:15,035
should talk more about it

50
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:16,755
in other words

51
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,495
When you want to start talking more Swedish

52
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:22,125
in everyday life

53
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,365
What to talk about?

54
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:29,575
And then I want to make a comparison

55
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:32,255
With Somali as I work out orally

56
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,845
At work the most

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,600
For I can talk pretty much

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,755
and can understand some

59
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:43,775
and I feel that one

60
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:46.805
an obstacle for me

61
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,525
or a challenge, something that

62
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:52.545
I would have to work a lot with if I want to

63
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:55.605
get better at talking to people in everyday life

64
00:02:55,605 --> 00:02:59.020
It is to understand which conversation topics

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02.080
that works and as I said, conversation topics are,

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,100
what you are talking about

67
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:06,525
What things can you talk about

68
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:10,085
and I believe that

69
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,425
I think

70
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:16,035
This may be something that differs quite a lot

71
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:19,075
from different cultures, I don't know

72
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,865
But my feeling is it anyway that

73
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:25,495
that what one is talking about or maybe a little how

74
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:27,825
one is talking about certain things

75
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:29,215
can differ quite a bit

76
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:32,975
And I think that if you think a little about it

77
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,280
Well we take a very simple example

78
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39.615
Many people say we talk about the weather

79
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:43,025
In Sweden, okay, that might be true, I don't know

80
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:47,355
So then you can think a little about

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,100
How can I get better at

82
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,440
to talk about the weather

83
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,365
I'm pretty sure of

84
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56.865
that if you learn some more words and learn to talk

85
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:59.755
a bit more like Swedes talk about the weather

86
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02.885
then it will create a little

87
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:06,135
nicer and better contact

88
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,095
with new people when you do

89
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:13,115
it can work anyway, it depends very much on

90
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:16,595
other things, how is the person you are talking to

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,220
And how are you yourself?

92
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,280
How are you perceived?

93
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:25,085
perceived - how are you perceived?

94
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,975
So: What do others think about you when they meet you?

95
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:30,485
It is very different how

96
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:33,395
people think about us, we are different as people

97
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,395
Some are lucky enough to be

98
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:38,675
nice and charming and happy

99
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:41,485
everyone likes them directly

100
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:44,635
Although they talk, for example, very bad Swedish

101
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47.545
Others have a little harder

102
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:51,745
But in any case, everyone can win at

103
00:04:51,745 --> 00:04:54,525
to improve one's ability to, for example

104
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:55.865
Talk about the weather

105
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:00.155
But honestly, it is very boring to

106
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:03,295
Talk about the weather. Maybe you can do for five minutes

107
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:04,295
in the best case

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,920
So, of course, maybe it can

109
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,580
break the ice

110
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,140
Thus: Break the silence,

111
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,060
break the first little uncomfortable

112
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:17,285
the moment before man

113
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:20,425
find something to talk about - break the ice

114
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,395
maybe the weather can do

115
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,980
But then I think it would be interesting

116
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,360
For everyone to start thinking about

117
00:05:30,405 --> 00:05:33,325
What could we talk about more

118
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,325
What subjects could I take up, what subjects

119
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:39.265
may others be interested in

120
00:05:39,265 --> 00:05:42.035
so that it becomes one

121
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:44.505
exchange, that it is not just becoming

122
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:46,745
I tell you something and the other is not answering

123
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:51,485
I have no finished recipe for this

124
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52.515
I just think

125
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,995
all who learn a new language

126
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:58,215
especially if you come from a culture that is quite different

127
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,300
so i think there is a lot to gain on

128
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,880
think through

129
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:07.635
what subjects you want to be able to talk about and then work out

130
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:10,485
themselves on it and look for words and expressions

131
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:13,255
I think absolutely

132
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:17,405
and let me ... I have to comment on a thing

133
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:20,045
As I have heard a few times

134
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,775
lately

135
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:25,635
and as myself .... it's like a big question mark for me

136
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,635
I don't understand this

137
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:30,205
For people say that Swedes

138
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:32.515
not want to be personal and not

139
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:35,225
enjoy personal questions

140
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,625
And I just

141
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:38,115
huh ???

142
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:41,635
Who doesn't? They are certainly available

143
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,695
there is certainly something in this

144
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:48,085
But I think there is also a lot of misunderstanding in this

145
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:51,425
I would even, just as an example now

146
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:54,545
take this with a pinch of salt

147
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:57.865
Don't believe I mean this 100%

148
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:01,415
But I would like to reverse the generalization

149
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03.405
and say that almost all

150
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06.625
Immigrants I meet does not seem

151
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09.345
be interested in talking about

152
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,455
personal belongings

153
00:07:10,855 --> 00:07:14,065
It is extremely rare as someone I meet

154
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,845
at work anyway or who contact me

155
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,945
on chat or like this, it's very unusual

156
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:21,075
to those people

157
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,240
Shows any interest

158
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,800
for something more personal

159
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:29,225
there are exceptions, that is not true (always)

160
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:32,475
And I know I meet people in the role of teacher

161
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,155
so it might make people feel like

162
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:40,555
shy or uncomfortable with that

163
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:41,555
more

164
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,295
contact me personally or take up

165
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:47,645
personal things, but my feeling is to

166
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:51.015
many people are not so interested too

167
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:53,965
or not know how to ask

168
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:56,575
But maybe it's like this, maybe it's like this

169
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,395
This prejudice that no Swedes

170
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,585
want to take up something more personal

171
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05.705
lies in the way

172
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08.715
And it's a shame because I think many of my friends

173
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:09.715
in all cases

174
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:12,785
gladly could answer more

175
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:13,785
personal questions

176
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:16,745
Then maybe you have to build up

177
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:20,045
a trust or

178
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:21,805
take up the subject in the correct manner

179
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:26,045
and it can be a bridge in

180
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:28,765
So talk about it properly

181
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:31,925
It can be a bridge into conversation culture

182
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35.505
So I mentioned for example in a video

183
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,275
on instagram that it is better to ask me

184
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:41,265
Why have you just raised a child

185
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:44,275
than to say

186
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:47,245
you should get a sibling to your lonely son

187
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,375
Poor he, it's like a very

188
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:52,995
in Swedish culture, at least

189
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:56,635
in my opinion and among my friends, I don't know

190
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:59,775
there are certainly different, but I think

191
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:02.825
Generally in Swedish culture it is very uninvited

192
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:05.665
and disrespectful to directly express

193
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08.895
views on another person's life choice

194
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:12,235
and as well as lay in

195
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,315
How many children that person has acquired for example

196
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:16,675
so that

197
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:20,395
I'm a little used to, I work at SFI so I have

198
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,425
understanding, but at the same time I see after all

199
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:26.535
how person by person, who comes from a more

200
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:29,165
It is great to have many children-culture

201
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:32,365
such a culture that they miss the chance to

202
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:35.065
learn something about how I think by the fact that

203
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:37,595
immediately give in to more comment

204
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:41,055
and in relation to

205
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,965
The person Kalle So it closes the discussion

206
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:45.865
I just get a little like this

207
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:47,315
Tiring

208
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,080
and trying to get out of there

209
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
However, had a person asked a personal question

210
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:56,895
To me so I would have liked to try to explain

211
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59.635
how I think and why

212
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:01.065
My life is like my life is

213
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:04,455
Then of course it can be sensitive for different reasons

214
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:07.545
Ask why someone just has

215
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:10,445
a child for example but

216
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:13,455
For me it had no problem

217
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:16,505
to explain it, but then I have to get an open question

218
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:19,355
I can't get a comment

219
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,595
about how I should do

220
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:23,165
And I meet that pretty much I can say

221
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,995
So there I think there may be such a cultural difference

222
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:29,465
what might actually be meant as a joke

223
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,955
or as just small talk

224
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:34,835
gets in my world

225
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,145
something that closes the door

226
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:40,175
and I don't get the desire to continue that call
