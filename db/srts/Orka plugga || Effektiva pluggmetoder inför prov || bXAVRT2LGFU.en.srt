STUDYING EFFICIENTLY

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,120
Time for national or other exams?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,280
Perhaps you have a lot of studying to do
and not much time.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,480
Here are three methods
to help you study more efficiently.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,160
The blurting method is an efficient way
to find out what you know or don't know.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,920
Start reading a chapter or a few pages.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,080
Put the text aside and write down
what you remember on a piece of paper.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,240
Either as a mind map or short phrases.
It doesn't have to be a finished text.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,800
Then compare it to the book.
What did you include or miss out?

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,680
This will tell you
what you need to study more.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,440
This method activates your brain and
helps you recall what you remember.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,040
What you've learned sticks, and you'll
remember it better during your exam.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Explain using simple words. This is
an efficient way to learn something new-

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,960
-or to understand something better.

15
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,520
Write an explanation in simple words-

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,480
-as if you're telling someone who
knows nothing about it, like a child.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,240
Read it through
and try to simplify it even more.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
The more you know, the easier it is
to explain in simple words.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,960
Try telling someone
about what you just learnt.

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,920
If you can explain in a simple way-

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,280
-that means you know
what you're talking about.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,040
Actively retelling and repeating
what you've learnt-

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,400
-helps you remember it longer.

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Test yourself. Answering questions
on what you've just learnt-

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,120
-helps you remember better
and learn faster.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,280
Instead of reading a text several times
and trying to cram it in-

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,440
-try testing yourself
every now and again.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,800
Read a few pages and write
some questions on what you read.

29
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Put the text aside and answer
your questions without looking.

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Then check your answers.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,360
Now you know what you remember
and what you need to study more.

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,920
Next time, start by checking if you
remember the answers to the questions.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,280
Studying like this
improves your memory-

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,040
-and helps knowledge stick better-

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,200
-since you're forcing your brain to
immediately recall what you've learnt.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,360
So, note down what you remember
after having read a passage.

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,280
Explain to someone else
using simple words.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,160
Write questions and test yourself
on what you've learnt. Good luck!
