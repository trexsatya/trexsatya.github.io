00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,760
Most of us feel stress
and find it difficult to deal with.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,760
Why is that? How does it affect
the body? What is stress?

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,920
Stress is a natural reaction
that all animals and people have.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,160
It is the body's way
of preparing us for a challenge.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,160
For example, if you are competing
or speaking in public.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,240
The body is strengthened
for these challenges.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,640
You should know that stress
isn't a bad thing.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,400
Short-term stress is good.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:44,480
Stress only becomes a problem if it
is long-term and the body can't relax.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,280
Short and long-term stress
is very different.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,880
Short-term stress
strengthens the immune system.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,880
Long-term stress, however,
breaks down the immune system.

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,600
When stress becomes long-term,
cortisol is released in the brain.

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,240
We get too much of it, which may
affect the brain in a negative way.

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,360
In our modern society, it isn't always
clear when a threat has passed.

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,440
A bear is dangerous. I run.
Then the danger has passed.

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,800
Since we live more in our heads,
stress can be caused just by thinking.

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,960
"I wrote such an embarrassing thing."
"I'm never going to pass that test."

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,160
This way of thinking triggers
the same physical response as a bear.

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,960
It is a challenge to rest and relax-

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,960
-and not stress by thinking.

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,440
Not to trigger a stress response
by thinking too much.

23
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,880
Short-term stress isn't bad.
But long-term stress-

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,480
-weakens the immune system
and we get too much cortisol.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,760
That's why it's important to let the body
relax so that you can recuperate.
