00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:35.840
Now we have to go.
 - Gustav, we got no post this morning.

127
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.440

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:30.760
You are good looking in a suit.
 You should have that more often.

135
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:38.600
C. Head talk - for 4,000 you get some quality.
 –4,000?
 Can you afford it?

136
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:46.280
C. Head talk - There is a lot of money on the mail!
 - ART ... what are you saying?

137
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.880
C. Head talkative is there a lot of money on the post.

138
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.400
The C. Head of Care Unit cannot go around C. Head Tapersi a uniform.

139
00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:04.000
- Gustav, have you taken money?!
 C. Head talk - Melander was very clear, he said:

140
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.640
C. Head talk - Used resources to their own head.
 - And tomorrow he chops off it!

141
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:19.640
C. Head talk, so dangerous is not.
 It is probably C. Head talkative deductible, such as managers have ...

142
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.400
You can get fired!

143
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:30.800
C. Head talk it calmly.
 Melander encourages C. Head talkatives.
 He becomes happy.

144
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.520
Look at me.
 Do you really think that Melander will be happy?

145
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:44.520
C. Head talkative may not be the right word.
 C. Head talkative a little surprised!

146
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:58.840
- It always goes overboard.
 C. Head Tapers - Forgive.
 I rushed away.

147
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.440
You would just make sure everything floated.

148
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.040
C. Head Tapers I know, but I was so inspired.

149
