1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.802
The climate goals require conversion, and the state invests hundreds of billions in green investments.

2
00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:18.524
Can and should - policy control the business community?

3
00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:20.773
Promote the green transition.

4
00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:26.973
What do the results of the state investments historically

5
00:00:26.973 --> 00:00:34.673
and what happens to a society where the state is trying to control the economy

6
00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:36.673
We are in the world front.

7
00:00:36.673 --> 00:00:44.673
I address these questions in this week's video about "green planning economy".

8
00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:57.248
I am not financed through colossal state credit guarantees, and are therefore entirely dependent on your voluntary donations.

9
00:00:57.248 --> 00:01:01.857
If you appreciate my movies you help me therefore be able to continue making them

10
00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:11.657
If you support me through any of the payment options below - then a big, big thank you to all of you who contribute

11
00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:20.857
Today I talk about climate, capital and control.
 come along

12
00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:41.184
Planning economics is an economic system where the means of production is owned by the state

13
00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:48.884
And where everything from prices to production goals is governed by a central planning authority.

14
00:01:48.884 --> 00:02:00.484
This differs from market economy systems, where supply and demand are regulated by private companies and consumers.

15
00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:09.984
The problem with centralizing financial decisions is that the decision -making burden quickly becomes impossible to manage,

16
00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:17.084
which gradually leads to an increasing miscalling of capital.

17
00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:23.884
Practically this means that a centralized authority simply cannot be able to predict

18
00:02:23.884 --> 00:02:31.884
How many patches, millet clites and tractors that society will need during a five -year plan,

19
00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:42.284
Something that was expressed with hair -raising clarity through the constant lack of basic goods of the former eastern states.

20
00:02:42.284 --> 00:02:49.573
Because of this, the democratic states of the Western world rejected the planning of authoritarian socialism,

21
00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:56.673
And instead built their prosperity in free markets that served free people.

22
00:02:56.673 --> 00:03:03.173
However, the ambition to try to control the economy politically has in no way ceased

23
00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:10.273
And today is expressed most clearly in connection with different types of climate initiatives.

24
00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:18.026
Promote the green transition.
 To reach this transition.
 It is important to make this green transition.

25
00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:24.226
And the whole transition that takes place in our society.
 The transition in the transport sector.
 The transition of the flight.

26
00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:28.026
To succeed in the transition, everyone must pull in the same direction.

27
00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:39.926
The notion that an ongoing climate crisis can only be resolved through large -scale, collective investments where "everyone pulls in the same direction"

28
00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:46.426
is a powerful emotional message that created great support among voters

29
00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:58.026
At the same time as the person who questions the effectiveness of the investments is often portrayed as an enemy to the climate itself.

30
00:03:58.026 --> 00:04:03.626
On this line, left -wing economist Mariana Mazzucato has for several years

31
00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:13.726
Published leading literature focused on how the state can and should control the social economy in different ways.

32
00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:25.026
In short, Mazzucato believes that the state should formulate “assignments” and initiate large programs, which mobilize the entire community.

33
00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:30.364
This mobilization is then assumed to provide economic rings on the water,

34
00:04:30.364 --> 00:04:40.164
which in turn drives the general prosperity development in symbiosis with the state -controlled command economy.

35
00:04:40.164 --> 00:04:45.764
This vision of the state as an economic client has

36
00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:52.864
Unsurprisingly, very positively received by politicians and bureaucrats throughout the Western world.

37
00:04:52.864 --> 00:05:00.391
In fact, the Swedish support authority Vinnova, whose task is to promote growth and sustainability in Sweden,

38
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:00.400
Very recently, a book entitled "Designing Mission" in fact is that the Swedish support authority Vinnova, whose task is to promote growth and sustainability in Sweden,

39
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.500
Very recently, a book entitled "Designing Mission" published

40
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.300
In which Mazzucato personally praises the authority's progressive initiative,

41
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:22.700
And besides, perform an equally surprising as speaking tribute to the million program!

42
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:32.755
“However, it is not every country that has a 'Vinnova' [...] Life here is permeated by the memory of the Million Program,

43
00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:41.055
Zero tolerance target [...] and several decades of progressive social measures for justice. "

44
00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:47.555
The book then continues to under the heading “Learning from the Million Program”

45
00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:53.755
Compare Sweden's million programs with the moon landing:

46
00:05:53.755 --> 00:06:03.255
“The assignment was largely successful, and 1,006,000 homes were built until 1974. [...]

47
00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:10.055
The results of the million program are deserved to be seen in the same light as the Apollo program.

48
00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:19.255
The housing policy terrain of social policy is just as complicated as space trips ”

49
00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:26.408
Thus, for those who do not remember, the million program was the housing -based equivalent of Swedish social democracy

50
00:06:26.408 --> 00:06:30.208
To Mao Tse Tung's "big leap".

51
00:06:30.208 --> 00:06:39.108
However, large -scale government assignments of this type rarely produce the results that its architects hope for.

52
00:06:39.108 --> 00:06:45.608
In China, the "big leap" resulted in starvation and economic collapse,

53
00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:52.408
And in Sweden, the Million Program resulted in segregation, ghettone and aspiration

54
00:06:52.408 --> 00:07:00.708
Because everyone who could afford avoided the Social Democrats' depressing new concrete complexes.

55
00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:07.448
The social engineering or what to call it has, after all, in many people's eyes sentenced.

56
00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:16.348
Yes.
 ... as very unsuccessful.
 Is it the unsuccessful?
 - Yes.
 Almost actually it is very difficult to love.

57
00:07:16.348 --> 00:07:28.848
In the article "How could it go so badly" from 1977, the Swedish master architect Sture Lindström summarized the Million Program in the following words:

58
00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:37.148
“Instead, it became legislation, control and power to the politicians for almost the entire slant.

59
00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:44.548
Result: A newly built slum of previously never seen scope.

60
00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:56.748
A slum that, through its existence, also makes the planning and housing policy of the future a difficult swamp. "

61
00:07:56.748 --> 00:08:03.537
That the Swedish innovation support authority Vinnova together with left -wing economist Mariana Mazzucato

62
00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:08.237
Instead, chooses to highlight the million program as a great success

63
00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:19.837
testifies to how this Great Statural Command ideology not only exaggerates the politically controlled missions what people actually want

64
00:08:19.837 --> 00:08:26.937
but also about how to ignore what actually works.

65
00:08:26.937 --> 00:08:35.837
For work, do virtually no state assignments at all.

66
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:52.420
The same year that the Million Program was completed, the Social Democrats initiated Sweden's largest industrial policy investment ever,

67
00:08:52.420 --> 00:09:02.820
and invested the equivalent of SEK 12 billion in a colossal industrial policy project called “Steelverk 80”.

68
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:15.020
The assignment was to ten -level production of iron in Norrbotten to 1980, to increase the population by over 5000 inhabitants.

69
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:22.720
The then chairman of the Industry Committee Ingvar Svanberg justified the investment in the following words:

70
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:32.520
“I see this investment as extremely valuable to our entire country that we will be further refining such raw material as ore,

71
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:40.220
That we create employment opportunities and I see it as very valuable to Norrbotten. "

72
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:51.820
However, the initiative, which would have become a social democratic parade project, was canceled already after three years because the steel industry ended up in crisis

73
00:09:51.820 --> 00:10:05.520
But before that, large parts of Luleå's city center had already been demolished and built several large -scale residential areas that were now empty.

74
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:15.620
In the book “Stålverk 80 Ekonomi & amp;
 Politics ”summarizes the three researchers Erik Ruist, Ingemar Ståhl and Lars Wohlin

75
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:21.220
The criticism of the project in the following words:

76
00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:27.431
“In fact, one cannot make any proper cost estimates before the procurement is completed

77
00:10:27.431 --> 00:10:33.331
suggests an overly light -hearted approach to the need for calculations ”

78
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:39.231
“In the case of steel mills 80, financing is largely done with tax assets.
 [...]

79
00:10:39.231 --> 00:10:50.231
In this case, those who made the decision have very small pros and cons linked to the final financial outcome of the project. "

80
00:10:50.231 --> 00:10:59.731
"In summary, we have found the profitability information presented in the bill to be extremely optimistic."

81
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:08.031
This is the typical outcome when investments are driven by the state.

82
00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:22.293
In the early 2000s, billions were invested in Norrland to lead the world's climate change

83
00:11:22.293 --> 00:11:27.293
through the production of the green fuel ethanol.

84
00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:36.328
In 2006, a new law was driven through that forced all the sandwiches over a certain size to install pumps for ethanol,

85
00:11:36.328 --> 00:11:43.706
Development of new brand new engine types was subsidized and in 2007 the environmental car premium came,

86
00:11:43.706 --> 00:11:50.506
which also subsidized all purchases of ethanol cars with SEK 10,000.

87
00:11:50.506 --> 00:11:59.406
The then Prime Minister Göran Persson motivated these billion initiatives with Sweden being a pioneering country.

88
00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:08.606
Environmental cars are increasing sharply, we get a new infrastructure for this, it is produced in Sweden.
 We develop new engines, we are in the world front.

89
00:12:08.606 --> 00:12:14.806
And this is precisely this that we are ahead of others shows that a country can go ahead.

90
00:12:14.806 --> 00:12:21.606
The state's generous support meant that the ethanol initiatives became increasingly feverish.

91
00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:29.006
In just four years, the Swedish vehicle market went from 2 to 80 ethanol car types,

92
00:12:29.006 --> 00:12:38.506
And in 2008, 20 percent of all newly registered vehicles in Sweden were adapted for ethanol operation.

93
00:12:38.506 --> 00:12:53.106
A few years later, the ethanol project was silently phased out, since it was discovered that the ethanol simply did not keep the measure as a fuel.

94
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:59.306
This led to the demand for both ethanol and ethanol cars collapsed

95
00:12:59.306 --> 00:13:08.506
with an overall calculated socio -economic cost of at least SEK 30 billion.

96
00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:17.106
This is the typical outcome when investments are driven by the state.

97
00:13:23.688 --> 00:13:32.704
It is important to emphasize that the questioning of today's state change initiatives

98
00:13:32.704 --> 00:13:45.804
is not a criticism of sustainability work in itself, but only a questioning of the likelihood that the investments can achieve the goals that are hoped.

99
00:13:45.804 --> 00:13:57.404
It is also important to remember that all of Sweden's failed investments have historically been motivated by exactly the same argument:

100
00:13:57.404 --> 00:14:07.804
"We go ahead", "We create progressive new jobs" and "We create a profitable new super economy".

101
00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:13.704
This place is at the very forefront of the green transition.

102
00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:25.304
However, the cluster of investments that are currently being forced in the name of the transition will have all previous efforts to fade

103
00:14:25.304 --> 00:14:31.804
For the assignments to simultaneously electrify Sweden with renewable energy sources,

104
00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:41.304
to switch over to large -scale production and storage of hydrogen and switch to the manufacture of so -called green steel

105
00:14:41.304 --> 00:14:49.604
is to such an extent that there are no comparable examples.

106
00:14:55.884 --> 00:15:04.386
More and more, for example, the state attempts to force more wind power create great losses.

107
00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:14.186
Already in 2020, the municipal -owned company Skellefteå Kraft was forced, for example, to write down over half a billion SEK in fixed assets

108
00:15:14.186 --> 00:15:20.386
because the municipality has made major investments in unprofitable wind power.

109
00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:26.453
Recently, Markbygden also applied one, one of Sweden's largest wind farms,

110
00:15:26.453 --> 00:15:32.353
About reconstruction after having been with great losses for several years.

111
00:15:32.353 --> 00:15:39.608
I think it's about trying to get money out of a company that is bankrupt.

112
00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:49.013
Similarly, Siemens Energy recently reported to be affected by $ 2.4 billion higher costs for operation

113
00:15:49.013 --> 00:15:52.513
by one of the world's largest wind farms.

114
00:15:52.513 --> 00:15:56.613
Siemens Energy Shares Tumbled as much as Seven Percent on Monday.

115
00:15:56.613 --> 00:16:03.113
That After Its Said Problems at its Wind Turbine Unit would cost it 2.4 Billion Dollars in Charges.

116
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.573
IT FACES PROBLEMS INCLUDING LOSMAKING CONTRACTS ON OFFSHORE Turbines.

117
00:16:07.573 --> 00:16:14.302
The Firm Also Faces Quality Problems With Some Models Including Wrinkles in Blades and Faulty Gears.

118
00:16:14.302 --> 00:16:19.902
The Turbine Problems Would See Its Net Loss Rise More Than Sixfold in 2023.

119
00:16:19.902 --> 00:16:27.602
When asked whether the wind farm is to be sold or closed down, Siemens Energy's CEO Christian Bruch replied

120
00:16:27.602 --> 00:16:39.802
That you are currently "investigating all options, with very open eyes.
 [Wind power is important but] it is of the utmost importance that the business is profitable,

121
00:16:39.802 --> 00:16:44.202
Something that you failed in recent years. "

122
00:16:44.202 --> 00:16:51.302
In a similar way, the disputed reduction obligation proved to be severely inflation -driven,

123
00:16:51.302 --> 00:16:58.402
And also led to Sweden being forced to vacuum the world market on slaughterhouses

124
00:16:58.402 --> 00:17:03.402
To put together the bioethanol that the dilution required.

125
00:17:03.402 --> 00:17:09.902
At the same time, the cherished "green steel" still lacks basic energy supply,

126
00:17:09.902 --> 00:17:17.902
And how the investment need of 150 to 400 billion is to be covered is unreported.

127
00:17:32.782 --> 00:17:40.484
Neither does the politics expectations of hydrogen gas do not seem to be proportionate to what is physically possible.

128
00:17:40.484 --> 00:17:49.684
More than 95 percent of the hydrogen used today is produced from fossil sources such as natural gas and oil

129
00:17:49.684 --> 00:18:00.084
And producing green hydrogen through electrolysis requires between three and five times more energy.

130
00:18:00.084 --> 00:18:10.484
Energy that is thus not even close to being able to be produced and in particular not with wind power.

131
00:18:10.484 --> 00:18:21.184
Let me once again repeat: This is no criticism of either climate or sustainability work,

132
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:35.180
Without merely finding that government assignments, ambitions and climate goals do not change the underlying reality.

133
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:41.297
Of course, it is attractive for politicians to be able to present nominal action

134
00:18:41.297 --> 00:18:48.997
By setting ambitious goals and then generously fertilizing these goals with honest people's tax money,

135
00:18:48.997 --> 00:18:58.197
But this usually only means that the tax funds are abolished without the goals being achieved.

136
00:18:58.197 --> 00:19:07.697
In addition, the state assignments are at risk of mistaken so large amounts of capital that competition is distorted

137
00:19:07.697 --> 00:19:17.197
And companies adapt to get part of the support money instead of conducting real innovation work.

138
00:19:17.197 --> 00:19:24.297
Because of this, the large government assignments not only risk wasting money,

139
00:19:24.297 --> 00:19:34.397
Without also inhibiting the technological development that could have really helped to solve the climate problems.

140
00:19:34.397 --> 00:19:41.797
This is exactly what caused Eastern Europe's planning economies to stagnate

141
00:19:41.797 --> 00:19:47.397
For whatever command economists as Vinnova and Mazzucato consider,

142
00:19:47.397 --> 00:20:02.897
So does not mean a decision on large -scale state -funded assignments that the goals are only achieved that the state chooses the way at the expense of all others.

143
00:20:02.897 --> 00:20:08.197
For as an ancient Jewish proverb resigned states:

144
00:20:08.197 --> 00:20:20.397
"Man plans but God laughs."
 Especially when it comes to financial plans.

145
00:20:23.573 --> 00:20:27.946
Want to know more about the problems with a mission -driven economy

146
00:20:27.946 --> 00:20:35.046
May I recommend the book "Moonshots and the New Industrial Policy Questioning the Mission Economy".

147
00:20:35.046 --> 00:20:41.546
This book provides historical examples of unsuccessful government initiatives worldwide.
