00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07.519
My name is Ulrika and I work as a lawyer at Försäkringskassan.

2
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:10,920
One of the reasons I was looking for here

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,800
be to work with qualified and fun tasks,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,880
Because it is very important for me to feel that I am developing in my work.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,559
Today I work with overall regulations, administrative law, public and confidentiality and IT law.

6
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,199
I also often participate as a legal expert in various development projects and working groups,

7
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:35,840
And it's great fun.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,480
A major challenge with the job is, of course, to understand and analyze complex legal issues,

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:51,280
But also to be able to express themselves well, because we lawyers deliver clear evidence with high quality

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,880
It is the very prerequisite for the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's employees to be able to make accurate decisions.

11
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02.800
When I came here, I was struck by how high the competence is, by how many skilled

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,679
And well -qualified people who work here.

13
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08.840
It is a very nice and helpful atmosphere,

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12.559
And a good working climate where we get a lot of appreciation internally.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,079
Yes, I think the Social Insurance Office is a fantastic environment to get into.
