1
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,257
Hello!
 My name is Olof Osterman.

2
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:25,222
I work on the National Bibliography at the Royal Library, and I am the one to do this instructional film over

3
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:31,061
How to catalog a translated book.

4
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,560
How to primarily catalogs a translated book I should say.

5
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:48,928
Some of these fields in this presentation are dealt with a little more clearly because they comply with the fields that

6
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:54,597
has been explained in an instructional film called Cataloging of Monography.

7
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:04,157
So many of the fields come back in this moment, or this movie so I just take them a little more clear.

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,583
And the book that we should start from is a book called Endurance by Alex Hutchinson.

9
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:22,814
When you catalog a book, of course, it is important that you are really sure that the book is not cataloged before

10
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:26,769
Because then you should use that item instead.

11
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:36,865
So it is always important that you actually do a search first, both on ISBN numbers and on the author and some pregnant word in the title.

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,168
So that you can really know that this book is not cataloged before.

13
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:51,020
But since this is an exercise, we pretend as if this book is not cataloged before.

14
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:59,507
When we catalogs we start from a template and then we have these headings here.

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,392
And then I click here at Create New.

16
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,768
And then I'll use this template.
 The book template.

17
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
So I click on it.

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
And then I get this template.

19
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,544
It is the same template as in the second instructional film.

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,176
I do the same thing that I fold in the instance of works here.

21
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
I will also say, as I said in the second instructional film, that the entry is divided into three parts.

22
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,505
On the one hand, it is the instance of works since then it is the body itself that comes down here.

23
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:48,823
And then we have admin metadata there.
 But I fill in the instance part first.
 What is the manifestation.

24
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:59,973
And then we will start by filling in the ISBN number which is the first field in the body part.

25
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,808
And it is below identifier.

26
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:13,257
And ISBN is the most common identifier for printed books.

27
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:29,920
That's how.
 And the next field is distinctive addition and it is not a nuclear element so it

28
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,016
You do not need to fill in if you do not want to.
 But if one thinks that

29
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
You need it so you can fill it in and we at NB fill in this field.

30
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:46,304
We can fill in that this book is hardcover

31
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
That's how.

32
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,496
If it had been stapled, we would have written a booklet instead.

33
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:05,302
And then there will be three fields that are just standard fields that we don't care about.

34
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:09,810
They are always in bibliographic items for printed books.

35
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:21,184
Then we have the title and there we will fill in the title itself and then we look at what it looks like on the title page.

36
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:25,983
The title page is the primary source so it is the one you should always start from.

37
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
So I fill in what is here.

38
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:37,549
And then there is endurance.
 It is the title of this book.

39
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:48,030
And then we have another field, other title information, and here you can fill in the subtitle which is also in this book.

40
00:04:48,767 --> 00:05:01,748
And then we have the subtitle the stretchable boundaries for your physical ability.

41
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,894
And you follow the title page as it looks.
 You also describe the title page.
 It is important.

42
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,879
And the next field is the copy of the.

43
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:26,463
And then we have the author written on the title page and we enter Alex Hutchinson, like that.

44
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,543
Since this is a translated book, we also want to include the translator's name.

45
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:44,749
And usually the translator usually participates in the title page.
 It is the most common, but in this case we embrace the translator's name on the back of the title page.

46
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,668
So we specify the task as it is on the back of the title page.

47
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,559
And we also do this in this field of origin.

48
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:02,930
But since these two people have two different functions, the first, Alex Hutchinson, is a writer and the second

49
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:10,546
If translators are then we want to be special these two with an ISBD intersection.

50
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:19,380
If this other origin task had been in another field, we would not have had to do so.
 Then it could have been created automatically.

51
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:27,282
But now we have to do it because they are the same field.
 So we put in an ISBD internal point that is semicolon here.

52
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,703
And so we enter as it says on the back of the title page,

53
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:40,449
Translation: Lars Ahlström.

54
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,551
So, and then there were no other tasks that we wanted more from there.

55
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
So it's these two that are enough for it.

56
00:06:52,671 --> 00:07:01,566
Then the origin is completed there and then the next task will be a paving task and then we have to look here in the book again.

57
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,031
Then we see here on the back of the title page that it says the first edition, the first print.

58
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,431
And then we want to include this circulation task, the first edition, so we enter this.

59
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
That's how.

60
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,439
But we skip the task of the first print.

61
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:35,584
It is not really a circulation task, although in this case it is related to a comma, but only the "first edition" here.

62
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,543
The next task is publishing.

63
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:51,540
And then we put this in during primary publication and we have already stated country.

64
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,879
And that's right so it's just there.

65
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:02,681
And then we have space and here the publisher's publishing site will be located.

66
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:10,392
And then we look for here in the book.
 There is nothing on the title page.

67
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,871
And on the back of the title page we also have no publishing site.

68
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:24,293
Stockholm is mentioned in a copyright task but it is another type of task so we cannot take the task from there.

69
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:34,070
However, we can see that Nature & Culture, which is about here, belongs in Stockholm.

70
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:41,109
So then we know that we will enter Stockholm here in the place of publication.

71
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:48,869
But since there is no actual publishing site, we must cling Stockholm.

72
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:59,135
This is a nuclear element so you have to have a place of publication.

73
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,047
We add the publisher's name in agent - term.

74
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:16,623
And since the title page is the primary source, we start from it.
 There it says Nature & Culture and we write as it says.

75
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,735
So, then we got that task.

76
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:30,367
And then the next task is year and date.

77
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,023
And in the first field you specify the year in numeric form.

78
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,695
And we probably have no real publishing year here.

79
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:51,130
But I can see that it is printed in 2019 and it is copyright 2019 also so then we know it is released in 2019.

80
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
So we put in that one

81
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:02,551
And then there was no real publishing year so we have to base our publishing year on the print year instead, 2019.

82
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
But we have to cling to this one then.

83
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
That's how

84
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:23,785
And since we base the release year on the print year, we also want to include it in the post.
 Then we only write in 2019 here during manufacture.

85
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:29,503
The copyright year that comes next we will skip.

86
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:38,528
Scope, where you specify how many pages there are in the book.
 It was 275 pages.

87
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,664
And then we have measured.

88
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:52,849
It is not a nuclear element so it is not something you have to add, but we at NB usually add it.

89
00:10:53,311 --> 00:11:01,527
24 cm was the book, and what applies is that you always round up.

90
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,063
Other physical details.

91
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:12,924
The book contains no illustrations so you don't have to fill in anything here.

92
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,351
We can just leave it and it will disappear later.

93
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,655
Serial membership.

94
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,311
The book is not included in any series so we can skip that task.

95
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,735
The next task, or field, is note.

96
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,759
Notes are not needed either.
 We don't have any remarks so we need to add it regarding this book

97
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:47,163
Without being content with the information we have received through the bibliographic information.

98
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:54,694
So there.
 Then we are done with the instance itself.
 The manifestation itself.

99
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,250
Then we can go up again to the instance of works.

100
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,919
And unfold this.

101
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,274
Here under participation and function, authors are specified in authorized form.

102
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:16,282
Or the form they should have in index for authors.
 Often in inverted form.

103
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:26,251
The book has a writer listed on the title page so it is the person who becomes primary participation here.

104
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:35,137
And what we do then is that we click on the plus here and search for his name and see if he is authorized.
 And if he is

105
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:39,398
Should we link to that form.

106
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:46,207
Hutchinson Alex.
 And here we get no results.

107
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:57,273
Had this been a Swedish person, we would have made an authority post on him and then linked to the person.

108
00:12:57,273 --> 00:13:04,418
But when it comes to foreign names, we do not care about making authority posts on them.

109
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Each country is allowed to take care of its own writers.

110
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,623
We will just put him in as a local entity here.

111
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,459
Then we have to go down here instead to create local entity here.

112
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,583
And then we just click here.

113
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,380
And then these options come up and we choose a person.

114
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
Then we get some fields that we can fill in.

115
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:48,653
So we fill in Hutchinson here on surname and Alex on the first name.
 Then we settle for that.

116
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:52,767
They may be non-authorized here in the mail.

117
00:13:53,535 --> 00:14:02,927
And the function.
 There is a standard value already here Author, ie writers, and that is true so it must remain.

118
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:14,059
But then we had another person.
 We had a translator named Lars Ahlström

119
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:28,235
And when it comes to professional books, you do not have to enter any translator, but we are content with just the description in the instance for writers.

120
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:42,344
But if the translator were to be authorized, you can do so.
 Then you can add him to the mail.
 But he must be authorized.

121
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:51,545
If you need to add any translator, Swedish translator, who is not authorized, then you have to authorize the person first.

122
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:53,524
Then add him.

123
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
We can check if he is here, Lars Ahlström.

124
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
So we do the same thing here.

125
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
Click on the plus here under participation.

126
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
Ahlström Lars

127
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,647
And then we get these people up.

128
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:24,457
There are three people, one of whom is called Lars G Ahlström with the topic of fishing here, so we can probably forget about him right away.

129
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,463
So then we have two left here

130
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:36,191
Then we have Lars Ahlström, born in 1949, and where there is no direct information about him.

131
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:47,351
Then we also have a Lars Ahlström, born in 1963, who is a translator.
 He is described as a translator so probably he is.

132
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:58,548
And then you can right -click and open the authority post in a new tab.

133
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:08,222
And then we can look for if there is more information in the authority post about which books he has translated.

134
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,496
So if I change to this tab instead, I have entered the authority post.

135
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:21,576
And if I click on participation I see what books he has translated

136
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:27,135
And can see that he has translated some books from English.

137
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,999
And some from Norwegian and you may have done that too.

138
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,095
In any case, I think it's this person.

139
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,497
So I click it there and I choose him here.
 So there.

140
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,113
And then we'll add a feature to him

141
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,737
And then we click here and he was a translator so you can only write translators.

142
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,727
And then we add this one, so we got him in there.

143
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,559
But as I said, you don't have to add translators to professional books.

144
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,614
This is a translated book so there are some fields that we have to add.

145
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:25,830
Which is not in this template but then we must click here on property.

146
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,111
And then we will add preferred title.

147
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:39,709
And when it comes to modern works, the preferred title is almost always original title.

148
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,399
There are usually no strange things with it.

149
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,994
We will add that field, so we click on properties.

150
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
That's how

151
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,175
Then we write "have title".

152
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
So.
 And it comes up there.

153
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,879
Then I click it there and then I get this up again.

154
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:13,028
The instance of works here.
 And then we can remove that window there by pressing ESC and it just disappears.

155
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,704
And we have to choose the title.

156
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
And then we get these fields to fill in.

157
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:32,370
Then we can look for in the book what is there.
 If there are any weirdness or if it is actually standing there.
 Yes, the title of the original is included, Endure.

158
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,647
Then we enter Endure here.

159
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:48,596
Here there is also a subtitle, ie any other title information, but when it comes to preferred title, which we put in here

160
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,142
If you always put in the main title itself and skip the subtitles.

161
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
So we are content with Endure.

162
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:12,750
But if it is so uncertain about the preferred title, or the title of the original, then you can look at the different national bibliographies

163
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:20,256
What this title looks like in the original if you suspect it was something strange about it.

164
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:30,645
And this is a book that has been published in the UK from the beginning so maybe you should look at British Library first,

165
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:37,886
And see if it is there.
 Otherwise, there are other catalogs too, e.g.
 Classify.

166
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,415
But we are content with just endure here.

167
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:47,014
And then we will add another field that has to do with this being a translation.

168
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:56,444
And the next field is language.
 Here is a language already.
 But since it is the Swedish translation we catalog

169
00:19:56,444 --> 00:20:01,476
Should this post have language: Swedish.

170
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:08,208
But we want to tell you that it is translated from English and that is what we should do now.

171
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:15,231
And then we do the same thing here as we did before that we click on properties.

172
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
So.

173
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,607
Here we want a field called translation of.

174
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,311
Then we get it there and then we click it in the mail.

175
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
So.

176
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:37,339
And then we have to click on here.
 on this plus.

177
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:51,067
Plus there and here you should not do any search.
 Here you should choose to create local entity and works.

178
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
You get it up there.

179
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,959
Then you get several fields here.

180
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,383
But, what we should do here it is just that we should add the language English.
 That it is translated from English.

181
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,711
So this is where we will click.

182
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,551
And here we enter English.

183
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,952
And then we click that one.

184
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:26,641
So now we have added the original title, preferred title and that it is translated from English.

185
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:32,613
And we don't care about these other fields here, in this catalog post.

186
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,500
Then we are done with these two fields needed to describe that this is a translation.

187
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,832
Such, but if we move on here.

188
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:51,232
Genre/form can also be added if you wish.

189
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,608
Then you can add that there is fiction here.

190
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,216
That's how.

191
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,336
Then we come to classification.

192
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,736
And here in the template we have DDK and SAB that we can fill in.

193
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:20,168
And since this is a translated book, we should have the same classification as the original.

194
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,848
It is very rare that we deviate from how the original is classified.

195
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:35,901
So what you do then is to look for in the different countries' national bibliographies.
 In this case, we would look at British Library what it looks like there.

196
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:46,251
And choose that class.
 Do not question it but take that class if it would not be completely wrong.

197
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:54,033
And that classification is 613.71

198
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:03,810
And this means that it is a medical classification under physical fitness.

199
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,032
And it is written from that aspect so it will be good.

200
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:13,664
Then we have SAB rating if we want to add someone there.

201
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,408
Then you also start here from the English or from the DEWEY rating.

202
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:22,624
As it has received here in British Library.

203
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:32,509
And choose something similar to that, and we have a SAB rating, rag, which means exercise.

204
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,378
So then we have added the classifications there and then we come to the next, subject.

205
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:47,617
And then you also start from the original, or the original, and look for what it looks like in that post.

206
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:53,065
What subject words are there?
 This is how you put on similar subject words.

207
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:59,232
And in this post we have chosen to add Swedish subject words:

208
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,096
Physical exercise, physical fitness and mental exercise.

209
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:13,595
So we click on the plus here and then we enter physical exercise

210
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
There we have it.

211
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,504
And the next will be physical fitness.

212
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,392
That's how.

213
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:34,304
And you see here that it is SAO.
 In this string.

214
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:43,807
Then we also wanted mental training and then we are happy with it.

215
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:52,224
You don't have to enter the whole word either, it is enough to just write like that.

216
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:01,510
And here you have to be a little ... really check that you click in right.

217
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:08,815
Here, the word of children came up before the SAO subject word.
 This is the one we should have here.

218
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
That's how

219
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:18,336
Content type is just a default value and this one we don't care either.

220
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,944
It then disappears when you save the mail.

221
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:28,320
Then we were done with the instance of works.

222
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,696
Then only admin metadata is left.

223
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:43,818
And is it that you are that librarios that catalog at the library level,

224
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:53,225
And you are primarily cataloging, then the values that are in admin metadata are okay.

225
00:25:53,225 --> 00:26:02,982
There is nothing you need to go in and change.
 One has all the values, that it is described at library level, that we used RDA

226
00:26:02,982 --> 00:26:10,752
And that it is a Libris library that has cataloged it.

227
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:16,024
So you don't have to touch the admin meta at all.

228
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,520
If you are a libir library.

229
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:27,773
If you want to know more about these values located in adminmetadata

230
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112
So we refer to the instructional film Cataloging of Monograph.

231
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,208
There I go through these fields.

232
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:48,403
Then this instructional film was finished, or I will save the post first, of course.

233
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:55,517
So I click here on Create Post here in the toolbar.

234
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
That's how.

235
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:08,608
And if you want, you can look through the mail a little quickly and see if everything is ok here.

236
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:19,104
It was an instruction on how to make a catalog of a translated book.

237
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,752
Then I thank me.
