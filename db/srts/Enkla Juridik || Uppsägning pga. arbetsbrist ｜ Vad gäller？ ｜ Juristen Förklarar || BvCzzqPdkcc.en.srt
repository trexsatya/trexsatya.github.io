 lack of work or personal reasons.

2
00:00:10.457 --> 00:00:13.683
This video will be about termination due to.
 Lack of work.

3
00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:18.969
We go through how it goes and what applies according to the labor law.

4
00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:24.000
This video is useful for both you as an employee and you as an employer.

5
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:26.148
What is a lack of work

6
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.377
Lack of work is a reason for termination.

7
00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:38.503
It is actualized when the employer must terminate certain employees for economic, organizational or similar reasons.

8
00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.668
The concept of lack of work is a collective concept.

9
00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:49.054
The term encompasses all situations where a dismissal does not depend on the employee as a person.

10
00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:57.408
If there is a lack of work in a workplace, there are factual reasons for an employer to terminate one or more workers.

11
00:00:57.845 --> 00:00:59.984
Some examples of lack of work are:

12
00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:02.647
1. Lack of tasks.

13
00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:07.568
2. Lack of liquidity, ie
 that wages cannot be paid out.

14
00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:12.396
3. Transliness as a result of a reorganization.

15
00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:15.483
4. Other business change.

16
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:20.866
For example.
 A change in the business that can lead to a certain competence being no longer necessary.

17
00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:28.766
A dismissal is not objectively based if the employer can offer the employee any other work with him.

18
00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.732
It is called the employer's relocation obligation.

19
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:38.986
If the employer does not examine the relocation possibilities before a dismissal,

20
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.700
there is no factual reason for the dismissal.

21
00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:47.565
Notice that it is not that the employer must create a new job for the employee.

22
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:55.948
Thus, there is no right for an employee to be relocated if the employer is not able to do so.

23
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:59.886
Termination due to a lack of work takes place in accordance with a turnaround.

24
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:04.775
The turnaround is based on the employee's period of employment with the employer.

25
00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:12.231
Employees with longer periods of employment have priority over workers with shorter periods of employment.

26
00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:16.086
It is called "Last in the principle".

27
00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:21.359
Note that there may be exceptions to your workplace.

28
00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:28.814
With the new Employment Protection Act, all companies can exempt 3 people from the turnaround rules.

29
00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:34.081
This means that employers with factual reasons may terminate 3 people

30
00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:39.407
Without taking into account how long the employees have worked at the company.

31
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.494
This applies whether it is a small or large company.

32
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.279
But what happens if the employer is wrong, the employee may then claim damages

33
00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.489
If employers terminate staff without factual reasons, breach of the turnaround rules

34
00:02:56.702 --> 00:03:04.134
or does not comply with the rules on preferential rights for re -employment, the employee may claim the employer for damages.

35
00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:12.162
The general damages in the event of an incorrect termination normally amount to approximately SEK 100,000

36
00:03:12.975 --> 00:03:14.363
