1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04.940
This project is the train luggage you never did when you were 25.

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,159
This is the luxury version of train winding.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,769
Hello Hello! Hello!

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:17,110
How does the owners learn? It is just fine.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,879
A little cold today.

6
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:19,809
Although it is good weather.

7
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:22,989
It is plus degrees and sun so then you are satisfied.

8
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:25,430
You are doing something strange.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,030
I'm going to build a camper and do it with a little different approach.

10
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:32,750
Like to be a little inventor and generally crazy

11
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:35,619
So I've gone all in on crazy ideas.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,760
Yes indeed.

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,240
I have taken a truck driver's license in September.

14
00:00:42,349 --> 00:00:44,720
Then I was down in Germany and hand picked a truck

15
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:47,470
as I wanted a light truck and it I hold

16
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:49,639
on rebuilding now to a stealth rv.

17
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:55,520
The reason is that I want it so white, boring and neutral that just goes

18
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58.909
because I park in the middle of central big cities

19
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01.840
in the middle of Berlin without attracting attention.

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04.430
No windows.

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08.860
Nothing. A white, boring van.

22
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,970
That is the purpose of everything, get it as boring as possible.

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,739
What kind of experience do you have to build?

24
00:01:15,839 --> 00:01:18,959
I have built a house.

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,000
I am in soul and heart inventors, like crazy ideas and generally handy.

26
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,720
Just because I can't do it with poking in most areas.

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,680
I have a hate love for cars.

28
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:40,089
Have always been engine geek, but I have not liked to screw,

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,599
Change gearboxes and other things without I read and I like cars.

30
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,589
But for the past 20 years I have been snowing in electric cars.

31
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:54,720
Only only electric vehicles apply to me now.

32
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,290
So I sold my Tesla and bought a diesel Renault instead.

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03.849
That is exactly the opposite to what I really want.

34
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:08,000
There are very few electric motorhomes so far,

35
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11.309
So it will be the next project to build one.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,500
Renault says you are.

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,659
A rather unusual model.

38
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,569
It's a Renault Midlum.

39
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,389
Much of spare parts for Volvo FL.

40
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,279
A collaboration they had there in 2010.

41
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,339
The right model for me.

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,429
Just the equipment I wanted and pretty good condition on it

43
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,970
So it has only gone 25,000 miles.

44
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,460
So the engine is truck in terms of truck, it is just run -in.

45
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:39,160
Many miles left to deliver.

46
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:41,489
Six switched manual box.

47
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:44,770
You have AC, you have cruise control.

48
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,869
You have air suspension.

49
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,970
Should you rebuild here too?.

50
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,039
Do not rebuild, but it will be partially.

51
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,139
I will build my own center console.

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,440
Cooling box for cold drinks and stuff.

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,910
But above all, I will get 360 camera systems.

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,549
I will bring that with double screens.

55
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:10,089
So you have cameras around the entire truck.

56
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:13,279
Partly to more easily maneuver it but also then

57
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,649
Will I have a secondary screen inside the box.

58
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,639
It's not a huge truck.

59
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,970
No, it's a 7.5 tone so it's C1 driver's license you use

60
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:29,410
And it is used as distribution in cars inside the cities.

61
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:33,660
So it is a real truck even though it is a size smaller.

62
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,789
Good size and easy to handle.

63
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,349
What is important is also the height of the roof.

64
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:46,679
Then I will cover from edge to edge with solar panels and with the solar panels.

65
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:52,190
Building height is exactly 3.5 meters, 3500 millimeters

66
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:59,789
And the standard height in Europe without labeling, without signs.

67
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:05,979
It's four meters so you don't have too high a truck.

68
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09.039
One of the reason I chose this car

69
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,289
is that it has a very low cab and it is

70
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:17,449
because I will build a fiberglass spoiler covering five centimeters

71
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,839
Above the roof and it is to cover the solar panels.

72
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,669
And of course it also that in this spoiler

73
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:26,820
Will I fold in a starlink.

74
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,070
I have placed an order on a starlike and it is released

75
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,200
Not until the beginning of 2022.

76
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,579
SpaceX Internet -based or satellite -based Internet systems.

77
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,699
It is to be able to do anywhere on earth, in the Sahara desert

78
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:48,209
or in the middle of the Pacific have access to the Internet

79
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,220
And it is an important part of it too.

80
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,479
But what kind of ramp do you have built here at the back?

81
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:54,339
Shouldn't it be so close?

82
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,579
What was it called.

83
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,750
Last ramp just sat in one on when I bought it?

84
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:04,769
I have no need to lift up a tons pallets with stuff

85
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:09.470
Without what I have done is that I have torn away all that device

86
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:11,709
In terms of weight and it is for me iron scrap.

87
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:18,369
When I removed it and the refrigeration plant sitting on originally

88
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:21,549
So light the weight of the truck with 800 kilos.

89
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,979
And this one is both bigger and easier for it

90
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,079
Should look rough.

91
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:33,829
Industrial but is bent, 1.2 millimeters plate,

92
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,380
50 millimeters frigolite.

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,670
XPS is named the blue frigolite that is glued

94
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
on 1.2 millimeter plate as a lid.

95
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,070
It makes you get a very lightly baked lift

96
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,170
And it is still very twisted.

97
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,699
On the outside it is very rough and on the inside becomes

98
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:54,649
When you fold it down.

99
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,079
The top is a teak copy that you created yourself.

100
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:05.639
A six square meter balcony here is the normal height

101
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:09.989
on behind the lift, but I have lowered it 50 centimeters

102
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,529
So that when you fold it down it is just height to step up on it.

103
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:20,829
Plus, here under the truck at the back you can build two elongated boxes.

104
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,679
The far away is with tools and "good to have" stuff.

105
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:28,179
Here I will pull out and then it will be the stairs up.

106
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,529
A built -in staircase throughout the solution.

107
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,639
You can take it too.

108
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:40,639
I have done the drawings and handed them in and not received back.

109
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:45,079
But if I made boxes after the entire page so I will cover the bottom

110
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:48,070
On the truck with white boxes.

111
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,510
What should you have in the boxes?

112
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,919
The primary one becomes the battery pack so I have again with hydraulic cylinders

113
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:01.630
that opens it up and so I have a 48 volt system

114
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:07.699
As the solar panels charge and I have again ordered it.

115
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:13,470
But in customs as long as I have not received it, it is very advanced battery pack

116
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,290
Which I am very curious about.

117
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,790
There are 12 volt batteries, four of course that are

118
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,709
in 300 ampere hours and they are in size

119
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:28,119
Like a regular car battery and weighs 30 kilos each.

120
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,850
You have 4-5 times as much energy in them, but it has the same volume

121
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,290
and weight as a common standard battery.

122
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:44,429
In addition to those they will contain excess energy.

123
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:45,970
What is this box?

124
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,250
It is a measure of exactly the same dimensions as the motorhome,

125
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,250
But it's just a box that I've thrown together.

126
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,649
Quality as you see 20 centimeters of insulation

127
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,769
And therefore needs the shed that is rain cover that it is.

128
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08.049
But it is not insulated so that press training on the roof and so on.

129
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,339
The only purpose of it is to have the right dimensions and internally.

130
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,329
Is this a prototype?

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:24,329
Yes, I call it version 1.0 for what I have drawn.

132
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,440
I have drawn the floor plan on paper and thought through,

133
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,250
But it is still not three -dimensional

134
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,150
And it is not to live in you for real.

135
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,010
So what I have done is that I have built together

136
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:43,100
The floor plan measured in terms of exactly as I want it,

137
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
But definitely not quality.

138
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,950
So it is only to be able to be able to test nest in it

139
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:52,770
And learn what works and doesn't work.

140
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,420
What works I can easily transfer to the camper

141
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,170
And what doesn't work you have the opportunity to change.

142
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,299
Therefore, it will be version 1.0 and 2.0.

143
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07.440
So now we are in the box that I call it.

144
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:08,670
Here it was warm and nice.

145
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:14,849
Yes, when there are minus degrees out there and keep on, you get cold.

146
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,430
Therefore, it is nice to be able to come in and warm up at the right temperature.

147
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:24,940
So it's very simple

148
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:25,630
Together.

149
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:31,890
It is very rough, but it is very important.

150
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,229
What we have is a high bed with a garage below.

151
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,680
I started with 120.

152
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,180
I didn't think I got room with anymore but I discover now

153
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43.630
That a 140 bed works just fine.

154
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:47,640
140 wide and still only 60 centimeters.

155
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,369
You get a larger garage and you get a more spacious bed.

156
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,470
We have shelves by page that are quite narrow

157
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,539
and that the time between is still space

158
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02.119
To be able to touch it.

159
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:08,650
We have the raised floor and with storage underneath.

160
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,690
This is no storage.

161
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:15,100
A large fixed table and you have the kitchen.

162
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,710
You have toilet and shower.

163
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:21,860
You have the whole arrangement just like the camper.

164
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,219
What we also see is a flat TV.

165
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,960
This is an old one that I had lying in the basement.

166
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,250
What I will get is a very much bigger plan

167
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,349
when I have.

168
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:39,220
80 "?. 80" TV on.

169
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,989
This is why I think this is the most important factor

170
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:49,710
In order not to get it claustrophobic and trapped to have a huge TV

171
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,849
Which is also very good quality.

172
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,059
I will have a GoPro with 4K.

173
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:00.090
It creates such a realistic picture of the outside that you are deceiving oneself

174
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,110
To think it's a window.

175
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06.659
It is important and in the same way important about the cloud ceiling modules.

176
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:12.090
That they may be included in the interior also to create a volume feel.

177
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,080
This is the principle.

178
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:17,750
I have here some old ones that I had lying down because I had one.

179
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,650
I made an attempt ten years ago to start a company around it,

180
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,570
But I was way too early.

181
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,059
So ten years ago the LED modules were swindling

182
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,320
And it was very difficult to sell.

183
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:37,340
I sold them to hospitals and health care institutions.

184
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,250
And since the things you have waiting rooms when you have no windows

185
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:42,400
and so on.

186
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,800
So there is a need and it is a good product.

187
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,690
But I was out too early so these are some broken

188
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:52,890
As I have just lying down and it has done now.

189
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:57,419
Now there is much better and much higher quality on them

190
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,400
So I have ordered three modules in the hallway

191
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,670
and six modules in the kitchen part from Germany

192
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,770
that is on the way up.

193
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,030
Those modules together with the TV I think will do

194
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:13,169
That it becomes an airy feeling.

195
00:12:13,739 --> 00:12:17,480
In here it is just a standard toilet so it's just the feature

196
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm looking for.

197
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,030
But the shower I have built separately in another place

198
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,380
Because it will be a hybrid solution.

199
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:31,770
So I have a recycling than a shower where you reuse

200
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:34,630
the water. Then it becomes a very small volume

201
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:37,869
So I have calculated it to about two liters.

202
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:41,910
So if you have been out somewhere and freeze for example

203
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,820
So you can take and shower warm water for 15-20 minutes.

204
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:49,099
It is the same water that you reuse.

205
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,930
Then they soap it in with shampoo and rinse it off after

206
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,170
Has rinsed off it.

207
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,630
Then it empties the amount of water and replenishes two liters of water

208
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,580
Which means you have six liters, 3 two liters.

209
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,700
So on six liters you have as long hot shower as you want.

210
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,090
Just make about six liters of water.

211
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,240
The real ones you've gone another step and that is that you have carbon filters

212
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,480
and UV filter and recycle the same water again

213
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,050
And again and again.

214
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,239
And I don't feel fresh even if it works.

215
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,400
I don't believe it but have made a compromise,

216
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:32,969
So I use it.

217
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:37,020
During a shower occasion and then pour it out,

218
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,099
But there is still skinny consumption of the amount of water.

219
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:43,450
The kitchen is also a prototype?

220
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45.549
Yes absolutely.

221
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,859
Micron is the one I bought to evaluate.

222
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,710
The refrigerator is an example.

223
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:56,000
I bought it cheap standard refrigerator but I discovered it.

224
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,230
It's too small.

225
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,930
I can have a bigger better refrigerator for version two point zero.

226
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,489
Already got the other refrigerator that is better.

227
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:08,030
The induction hob I am very pleased with so I will move it over.

228
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:12,100
It will be fixed on the disc and disc in itself

229
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,850
You fold into the wall.

230
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,410
It may accompany the camper.

231
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,140
Same with micron.

232
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,520
Works great.

233
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:23,669
One disadvantage when you have two versions you are doing at the same time.

234
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,980
I have the sink that I found then, but if I want to use it it works well.

235
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,950
So I have to use it now in the camper which does

236
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:36,719
That I have no sink in where I live.

237
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:40,440
So it must be a bucket instead so that one a little provisional

238
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42.609
Moves the stuff back and forth.

239
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,619
But that is a transient problem.

240
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,240
Right size of the table?

241
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,030
Yes, it is generously increased, but it is all right for me.

242
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,119
So time, what is allowed to control.

243
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,300
The bed is important.

244
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00.539
It is many hours a day you use so it should be stuck.

245
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,520
I don't mind those who make other solutions,

246
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,650
But for me it is a matter of course that it should be stuck.

247
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:11,350
Same with the table you have, both eating there

248
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,289
And that you work with the computer and sit a lot at the table.

249
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:21,340
The table must be a solid it is a laser cut chipboard

250
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:25,010
with hidden suspension so it will be very stable

251
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:27.109
But no table legs.

252
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:29,539
This table is a central part.

253
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:34,909
You also have a large screen that can fold forward

254
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,159
So when you sit and work with it you have a generous screen to work with.

255
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,930
But if you sit and jaw dinner and you may have visits

256
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,940
Then the screen just folds into the wall so that it disappears and then you have a visit.

257
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,719
Folds down a sit device out of the wall as well.

258
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:53,869
What kind of stuff hangs on the wall?

259
00:15:53,969 --> 00:16:00,150
Wall covering becomes 3D cork, a product I found in Poland

260
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,730
Which is a modern cork plate so it gets a softer sound.

261
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,330
You get sound insulation of the cork plus it is pretty cool design on it.

262
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:16,590
You buy loose plates and you can assemble them as you like.

263
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:22,100
So either you have a smooth simple repeating pattern

264
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:28,460
or if you lay lay like a puzzle so you can create your own designer

265
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,320
on it so that the whole wall and the whole double wall

266
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,410
will be covered with the third cork.

267
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,510
But how do you find those stuff in Poland?

268
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:40,340
Looked for different wall covering.

269
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,080
They were not cheap.

270
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,640
And I think exactly what are they?

271
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:46,690
Cheap? I thought they were really nice.

272
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:50,489
But yes, it is SEK 1,000 square meters.

273
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:51,950
Oops.

274
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:54,590
That is the advantage when you have a small motorhome.

275
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,830
You can break on pretty much because there are so small volumes,

276
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:01,929
So small to work with.

277
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05.949
So here are internal dimensions that I work with

278
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,239
And that's something I didn't know.

279
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,229
By the way. You have 250 in the maximum width of trucks

280
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,119
But cooling containers have disputes due to thick insulation

281
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,700
So I do not want to lose the width inside.

282
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,359
Received exemption for 255 so that the width is 255 and internal

283
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,560
is 246, 225 in ceiling height and 620.

284
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,020
That volume is exactly what I need to fit

285
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,810
With what I want with me.

286
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:40,859
Then I have a big shower toilet but the shower toilet

287
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,000
using a couple of times a day for a few minutes

288
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,660
And then you don't have much benefit from that volume.

289
00:17:49,339 --> 00:17:54,339
So what I did instead is that you have a wardrobe device

290
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,439
which is generously grown.

291
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:01,020
I will build with slide so you pull out the entire closet

292
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,790
And it works like a door out there.

293
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,770
It has room for the shower and the equivalent we have at the kitchen

294
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:14,219
have in the refrigerator and in the refrigerator so that the whole modules go out

295
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,880
And there both toilet and shower have available.

296
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,510
But, as I said only for 5 minutes, four times a day

297
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,359
About then you press it.

298
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:28,270
Have very much space for the rest of the time.

299
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:32,319
Everything should have at least two functions to get.

300
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,119
Follow.

301
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,969
I don't like when it just has it dead space

302
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:38,089
that I don't use.

303
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:39,570
It's like Tetris,

304
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,400
Yes Russian dolls.

305
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,859
A thing and a thing.

306
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:43,459
Another thing.

307
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:48,250
There are a lot of clarity that you want to get along.

308
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,619
There are clarity so I won't have one.

309
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,630
I won't have a water tank in the truck either

310
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:59,449
Without me, I will have a rough water tank of 100 liters.

311
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,550
Instead I have an air air heat pump and with the insulated

312
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,390
The box and go down in Europe so I have the opportunity

313
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,650
Being able to have AC a perfect temperature and can sleep in even heat

314
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,540
If it gets cold.

315
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:23,329
But as a side effect it has condensation water and this condensation water

316
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:27,810
Will I use in everyday life.

317
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,880
I will drink and cook all that bit

318
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,910
So I create my own water continuously.

319
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:39,810
Can you drink like that?

320
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,630
Yes I submit it for water analysis and result

321
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:48,180
is that it is an absolute drinkable water.

322
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
It's good anyway.

323
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,250
I have been drinking it now in to and from a couple of months

324
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:55,890
To test if I get sick with something.

325
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,599
Absolutely nothing.

326
00:19:57,699 --> 00:20:02,660
I don't even have any bit of a taste and nothing is fully functioning water

327
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,410
Manufacturing system.

328
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:07,979
With that for large motorhomes I can have both 100

329
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,359
And 200 300 liter thoughts so you save a lot of weight on it.

330
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,650
But what does the whole idea come from?

331
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,280
I like compact living.

332
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:21,219
I like challenges

333
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:26,820
and I like travel so that my life situation

334
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,839
Now has been a perfect storm.

335
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:35,280
What keeps me here in Småland without the plan

336
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,699
is to move down in Europe for a couple of years

337
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,969
And then travel around and discover Europe.

338
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,839
I think it is the Cornona situation that has aroused it.

339
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:53,510
I don't think I'm alone in missing travel.

340
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:55,700
And when this project is complete?.

341
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:02,170
I have a soft deadline on May 1st, so this spring it should be finished

342
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:08,420
And the plan is to go through Norway, over Finland

343
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
And then on.

344
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:13,549
The idea is that it is quite close to Sweden.

345
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:19,349
If I lived in it for two months and discover that deficiencies and errors are corrected

346
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:24,260
So it is quite easy to find back to Sweden and fix it.

347
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:27.609
Works everything as it is intended then I just move on

348
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:30,530
Through Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and all of Europe.

349
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:37,630
So May is leaving me from here and so the plan is that I am gone for a couple of years

350
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,310
So we'll see where it lands somewhere.

351
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,500
I have nothing that keeps me here in Sweden.

352
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,890
Either settle in Poland or in Portugal or whatever it will be.

353
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:50,180
But you band all that you do too.

354
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:56,290
Yes, I have started a Youtube channel for step one

355
00:21:56,579 --> 00:21:58,500
And follow the building.

356
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:01.699
Step two is when finished and goes out in Europe.

357
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05.660
The content will change and become a travel report.

358
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,829
And the goal is a bit like you do and that is to find interesting,

359
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15.709
odd characters with local knowledge.

360
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,570
I'm not interested in the big Eiffel Tower

361
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,540
and the big tourist magnets without i want to see the back streets

362
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,160
And the interesting people in places I visit.

363
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,859
I hope my channel can make it possible

364
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:35,290
Getting to know new interesting people while I travel.

365
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,489
That is my goal and that is what will be interesting.

366
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:44,489
The funny thing for us is that we should be able to follow this trip,

367
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,839
So I will look by here several times

368
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:48,540
So we'll see how things are going for you.

369
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,839
I intend to do that, because there is more left to show not.

370
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:57,349
You are so welcome to it.

371
00:22:57,849 --> 00:22:59.849
We may say on recycled.

372
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,010
We hear, we do.

373
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:01.609
Bye!
