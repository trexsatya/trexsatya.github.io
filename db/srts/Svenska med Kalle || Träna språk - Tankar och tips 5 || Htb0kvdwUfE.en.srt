00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,780
Hello everyone. Good evening

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,780
I'll keep trying to talk a little about.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,520
How to train yourself to speak Swedish

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,760
and I will try to give a tip

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,540
for a little more advanced

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,300
Swedish teacher

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,420
My first thought is to try to see this with learning language

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,620
and to practice talking like a practical problem

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,300
thus something, a problem that you should try to solve

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,280
By finding roads, finding methods

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,240
that works for you

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,400
and that you are trying to make

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,480
so to say, make harder and harder things

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02.760
But at a decent pace for you

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,260
and to give oneself tasks

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,000
to give oneself things to train on

17
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,400
I think it's important to try to find good and just great tasks

18
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,200
So, for example, to think like this

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,020
I will learn to speak perfectly Swedish

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,980
It is a very big and very unclear task

21
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,760
I think it's good to try to split up

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,280
Language training in small and clear tasks

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,080
For example: I will learn to order coffee at a cafe

24
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,460
It is much easier to train on it than to train to become perfect in Swedish

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,380
You can practice asking about the price in a deal

26
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07.220
You can practice asking what someone has done on the weekend

27
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,920
So here comes a suggestion if you are a little more advanced and that is to

28
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,600
look at that city or the place where you live on

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,760
If there are lectures on something that you are interested in or that you think is quite interesting

30
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,940
thus a lecture is a person or more persons

31
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,200
talking about a special subject for an hour or a few hours

32
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:42,960
There may also be more a call for audience where some people meet and talk about a particular subject

33
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
and people can get there and listen

34
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,140
For example, there may be writers talking about their books

35
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,680
It can be people who are researching about something interesting

36
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,100
There can be lots of different subjects. It can be the environment. It can be culture

37
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02.940
It can be society. It can be technology

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07.420
There are lectures on many different subjects

39
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,640
So the best thing is if you find a topic that you are interested in

40
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,060
And usually you can too

41
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,500
Check out and read a little about the one to talk before

42
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,500
So that way you can prepare for the subject person will talk about

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,700
such as read the introduction to

44
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,540
a website or on the information sheet available for the lecture

45
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,160
But you might also read an article by this person

46
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47.840
If it is a famous person you can certainly find something this person has written with the help of Google

47
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,360
okay

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Already this, already there you have two very practical steps you can do to train yourself to listen to Swedish

49
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
Find a topic that interests you

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01.880
Find a lecture where you can go and listen

51
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,980
and prepare yourself by reading a little about that subject

52
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09.740
so that you know a little more words, that you can a little

53
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,440
sentences and understand the context slightly

54
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,360
It may even be that the person you are going to listen with is on Youtube

55
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,980
so that you can listen to a lecture with the person before

56
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,780
And then when you go to the lecture you have already heard how this person is talking

57
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,380
and can understand some of the subject before

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,860
If you want the chance then say you come to the lecture and you feel brave

59
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,400
and you want to try to talk a little

60
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,100
If you know the subject a little before

61
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,520
so can you be prepared with one or a few questions

62
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,200
As you can set to the person or persons

63
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,960
At the end of the lecture when you almost always have a question time

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06.720
So it may not be that you say so much but it still becomes that you dare to talk in Swedish

65
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09.300
in front of many people

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,260
and you will get an answer too

67
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:22,060
maybe if you have a good day you ask something, you get an answer and you can ask back once to

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,880
What may be the advantage is that if you dare

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,160
get up, maybe even talk in a microphone

70
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,000
or if it is a smaller room talk before a group

71
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,200
Then people will have seen you

72
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,040
You can even look here; People understand that if you express yourself in a language

73
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,380
that you are not so used to expressing yourself so you can say that

74
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,040
Excuse me, I would like to ask a question. I'm a little unsure of Swedish but I still want to try

75
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00.260
Here's my question

76
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02.660
Okay, then people have seen you

77
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,320
and they've heard you

78
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09.140
And if you are lucky there is someone there, someone else in the audience

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,580
who thinks: This seemed to be an interesting person or that was an interesting question

80
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,920
So you are lucky then maybe someone will come and talk to you afterwards

81
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,000
And say, yes, it was a good question, yeah what exciting ...

82
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,560
What brave of you that you dared to talk even though you don't have Swedish as your native language

83
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,860
Do you understand, there are no guarantees. I can't promise it will happen but

84
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,640
If you should have the chance to meet people and talk to people

85
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42.820
So you have to go to racks

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
where there are other people

87
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,520
and at least give people the chance to come up and talk to you

88
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,660
so you just got a little luck

89
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:01.660
So there is any person there who comes to you and maybe at least want to switch a few words

90
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07.640
and I think so to say that if you are this person who wants to train you to talk o

91
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12.560
and want to train you to understand and want to train you to interact

92
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,440
so it is like: every minute counts

93
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,240
every situation where you become safer

94
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,020
every situation where you know a little better how you can answer

95
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,620
How you can ask

96
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,240
what different sentences the other will say to you

97
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,640
The better you will be talking, the better you will be understanding and the way ...

98
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,280
the more confident you will be and the greater the chance that you

99
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,220
Looking up situations where you get to talk

100
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,160
Ok i'm gonna stop there

101
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,660
Hope it is possible to understand how I think

102
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,420
And that you have been able to listen to the whole video because it was a bit far now

103
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02.460
And I will continue to think and think and I would like feedback

104
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,700
I would like to have your comments, questions, own ideas

105
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,960
and then I will soon record a new movie where I give someone

106
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,840
some new tip, pondering a new situation and how you could do to

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Get the chance to speak more Swedish

108
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,860
Thanks for tonight. See you again soon. Have a good one!
