1
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:21,480
Rapidly and with a high level of operational security, 

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,280
we have gathered a number of accessible units with preparedness 

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,520
to conduct operational transportation to northern Sweden. 

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,560
To conduct joint training. 

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,560
To prepare to cross the border to Finland. 

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,040
And then exercise together with Finnish 

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,160
and British units. 

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,760
The order to conduct the readiness check 

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,280
was given on a regular day at work. 

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,320
A peaceful day 

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,120
that suddenly turned into action. 

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,040
Our squadron, platoon and every individual soldier were put 

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,000
to the test to see how quickly we could deploy and organize our materiel. 

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,480
It is also great that we are able to exercise with our neighbours. 

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,000
To create a stronger unity in the
Nordic region. 

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,840
To create enhanced capability to protect what is ours. 

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,240
The exercise is mainly aimed at joint training 

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,720
with Finnish and Swedish units. 

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,480
But also at testing the 

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,520
long-standing cooperation between Sweden and Finland. 

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,200
Testing our plans and seeing that our 

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
concepts can be put into practice. 

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,480
This increases security for our countries   

24
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,160
and obviously the region as a whole.  

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,680
We are here with the Swedish army 

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
exercising in teams. 

27
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:08,448
I think it is important if there is a war, 

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,920
that we can help each other. 

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,440
We are stronger together. 

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,160
It feels good to be in Finland right now 

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,400
and operating under Finnish command feels safe, 

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,400
since our countries are able to exercise together. 

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,720
In times such as these, 

34
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,440
it is important that we reinforce the Nordic defence, 

35
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,000
not only within our countries but 

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,760
but also together.
