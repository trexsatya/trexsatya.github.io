1
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:10,000
You've probably heard that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In this video we will go through how to diversify your portfolio.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now it's the same basket, but it's still important to have several assets in your basket.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Got checked on a snickers...

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Alright, let's go then.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In this video, we will go through five good tips that I wish I had received when I started investing.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I have seen an awful lot of mistakes by beginners who totally failed when investing.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we're going to go through diversifications in this video.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is important that you spread your risk so that you do not lose money on the stock market.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For example, that you invest all your money in a company, or that you may be all into cryptocurrencies or something else.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It can have big consequences for your portfolio and your money.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Trust me, I've learned the hard way.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So what does it mean to diversify your portfolio?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, it simply means that you are protecting yourself against your own stupidity simply among your investments.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you have all your money in one company?

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, then it is the case that if the company goes bankrupt, you will lose all your money.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, for example, the seat belt, we don't wear it because we're going to crash, but it's if we crash.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You never know if it will go to hell. So it's just as well to be safe than sorry.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,791
Drive, moron! Drive!

20
00:01:56,195 --> 00:02:03,855
The first tip when it comes to diversifying your portfolio is to remember that you don't just have to have stocks or mutual funds in your portfolio.

21
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:10,807
Sure, when you're new then it might work, but when you start to get a little more money in your portfolio then you might be wise to have several asset classes.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,791
Yes, you can have art, you can have watches, you can have wine, you can have real estate.

23
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:24,000
There are a bunch of other investments that also go up over time to spread the risk in your portfolio.

24
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:27,388
Tip 2 - diversify among several industries

25
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:32,000
Now, for example, when interest rates have risen so much, real estate shares have had it pretty tough.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And I'm sitting on some real estate shares, so it's been tough for me too.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,081
So it is important to spread out among more industries.

28
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:45,000
And a simple tip there can be to think that you have a maximum of maybe 25% of the portfolio in a single industry.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And then max. Feel free to look at more different industries.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,226
Because that's the way it is, if a certain industry is affected, then it could be that your entire portfolio goes down.

31
00:02:57,226 --> 00:03:01,000
And, for example, American stocks have been doing very well recently.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Many buy global funds and American tech companies.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So think about not having too much of your entire portfolio in a certain industry or niche.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,694
Point number three. Diversify among several countries.

35
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:25,000
The same applies to countries and regions.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,516
This year, for example, the US stock market has performed very strongly.

37
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:29,581
And what happens then?

38
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:34,355
Well, all the newbies rush into US tech stocks like Nvidia and similar.

39
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:40,403
And not only do you take a country risk here in case the country does poorly, but also a currency risk.

40
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:45,307
If it goes the other way, for example that the Swedish krona now becomes stronger against the dollar,

41
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:48,678
yes, then maybe there is a 20% downside there. We don't know that.

42
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:52,000
But the big risk here is of course the individual country.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
For example, if you only buy Chinese shares, then you are taking a very big political risk.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,920
But yes, if the country goes bad, well, then your whole portfolio goes to shit, of course.

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,000
And I, for example, have had a lot of Sweden in my portfolio.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And yes, then you have to take the hit that the Swedish currency has gone badly

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and that you have missed a lot of upswing in the USA.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I do have a little USA in the portfolio, but it's still good to think about having more countries and regions in your portfolio.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So feel free to mix Swedish, American, maybe a little European and then maybe spice it up with a little growth countries.

50
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,872
Tip number four, invest in more assets than just stocks and mutual funds.

51
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:40,132
After all, I am very focused on mostly stocks and funds.

52
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,600
But what many people don't know is that I have a lot more investment assets in the portfolio than that.

53
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,423
For example, I have peer-to-peer loans, I have cryptocurrencies,

54
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:52,134
I have cash in the portfolio and some other miscellaneous investments.

55
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,134
This year for example, not many people think about it,

56
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:57,457
but bitcoin has gone up almost 90% in kroner terms.

57
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:59,732
It can be a fun spice to one's portfolio.

58
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,183
Certainly it is a client comfort for me now that the stock market has gone so extremely badly,

59
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:08,178
but it's still nice to feel that you have another asset in a portfolio that has done well.

60
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:13,178
At the same time as having some money in a savings account with interest today, you get 3-4% on a savings account.

61
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:18,019
Maybe some peer-to-peer lending as well, which was good last year for example, is quite nice.

62
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,762
And we get into cryptocurrencies and things like bitcoin.

63
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:23,019
Yes, it is an extremely high risk!

64
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:29,099
But a suggestion there could be to have a maximum of 5-10% of your total portfolio against cryptocurrencies.

65
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:33,040
Some others advocate gold, silver and other precious metals,

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,019
but digital currencies, well, they've actually historically given a pretty nice return over time.

67
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,099
But as I said, think about the high risk.

68
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,000
And speaking of bitcoin and ethereum, we quite naturally come to XBT Provider,

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
who is the sponsor of today's video.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,904
Through XBT, for example Bitcoin-XBT, Ethereum-XBT, you can gain exposure to cryptocurrencies

71
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:58,645
in a very simple way through, for example, Avanza and Nordnet.

72
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:01,000
It is very easy to buy them only when the stock exchange is open,

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and you have them on the side of your shares and mutual funds in your completely normal investment account.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,613
For example in an investment savings account (ISK) or capital insurance (KF)

75
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:13,000
which means that you don't have to keep declaring if you buy cryptocurrencies in a normal way,

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
because it can be a bit difficult.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So it's easier to buy them there, for example, than to do it yourself over an exchange

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
where it can be a bit problematic to get the money out and stuff like that.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
XBT Provider was the first in Europe to launch a bitcoin certificate like this.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They are regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority and you can access their Proof of Reserves yourself

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and see their full transparency.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,887
In addition, their main company Coinshares is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm.

83
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:41,904

00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:44,904
below the video in the description and comments section.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,162
Thanks to XBT for sponsoring this video.

86
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:49,855
Tip number five. Invest regularly.

87
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,484
What many do on the stock market when one's investments go badly

88
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:56,597
is that you bury your head in the sand and do nothing.

89
00:06:56,597 --> 00:07:01,226
You might be waiting for it to just turn around and for it to look good when you log in three months later,

90
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:05,307
but the best purchases are usually made in the worst of times.

91
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:09,629
So make sure to invest all the time, i.e. buy a little bit all the time.

92
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,920
And my tip is usually to always have a fund saving every month

93
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,436
so that you always buy a little bit all the time when things go up and down.

94
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,339
But the same also applies to shares.

95
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:24,000
What many people do, myself included, is that you tend to buy stocks at highs

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
when everyone is talking about the stock market and it is at its hottest.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But it is now when perhaps no one is talking about shares and the stock market

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
as it might be time to buy some.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then it depends on which company, of course.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But instead of investing all the money into stocks at once,

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
therefore make sure to spread out the purchases and buy a little all the time.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you have 10,000 to invest in stocks, maybe split it into smaller portions,

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
maybe a thousand kroner at a time, so that you buy a little when it goes up and a little when it goes down.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,549
Because over time you get a good average price, yes, which is better for you in the end.

105
00:07:56,549 --> 00:08:01,000
And then you also reduce the risk of buying at a peak and selling at a bottom.

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So do you have any tips on how best to diversify one's portfolio?

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000

HI!
