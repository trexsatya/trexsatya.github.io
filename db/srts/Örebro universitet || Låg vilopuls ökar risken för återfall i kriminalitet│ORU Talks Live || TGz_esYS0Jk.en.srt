00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:23,522
Hello everyone and welcome to this section of Oru Talks -

2
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,608
Here at ... from Örebro University.

3
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:28,715
My name is Anna-Karin and I have ...

4
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:32,130
... today with me Sofi Oskarsson. Welcome Sofi.

5
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:33,663
Thanks! - How's it going?

6
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35.575
It is good. - Who are you?

7
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:38,082
Who am I? Sofi Oskarsson as I said.

8
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:41,415
I am a doctoral student here at Örebro University I -

9
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:44,755
Criminology, although I have been in psychology in the past -

10
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:48.862
Then I am on Wednesday's doctoral student in criminology. It's great fun.

11
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:51,102
Fun! Congratulations on it. - Thanks!

12
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:54.028
Before we start, we have to talk a little about that -

13
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:57,335
This is not your first live broadcast this week?

14
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,349
No, that's right.

15
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01.902
Without? - My other.

16
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:06,760
Which one was the first? - Yesterday I was on TV4 News Morning -

17
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09.273
And got to talk a little about my research, -

18
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:11,860
Which was great fun. - Yes I understand that. Exciting.

19
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:14,933
Of course, I also saw it and I think that in TV contexts -

20
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,080
so is four minutes for quite some time, but when to talk about -

21
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:22,387
This type of research so it felt like a short while, -

22
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,627
Which also felt great that we had this today -

23
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:28,260
Where we talk a little more about your research.

24
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:31,788
Yes exactly. - Tell us about your study that you have.

25
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:35,986
Low resting heart rate and the risk of relapse in crime.

26
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:42,970
Yes ... I published an article earlier this year -

27
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,139
which is about low resting heart rate increasing the risk -

28
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:48,951
For relapse in crime, just as you mentioned.

29
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:53,245
And this in itself, low resting heart rate, ie the session between low resting hearts -

30
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:56,932
And crime is nothing new, -

31
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:00.019
Without it, we have known for a long time for many years.

32
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:04,954
But it's not quite as much studied at just -

33
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,379
Low resting heart rate and relapse in crime.

34
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:10,879
So I felt this is probably the next step to -

35
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:14,645
Know a little more about resting heart rate in relation to kimiminality -

36
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:17,065
And how we can think about this.

37
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:19,219
Just that, it's a register study. - Yes exactly.

38
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:21,499
Yes, and how does a register study work?

39
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:24.545
A register study works like ...

40
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:27,352
We have many different registers in Sweden,

41
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:29,759
Among other things in Sweden, but there are also registers in -

42
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:34,399
Many other Nordic countries, which is a fantastic asset ...

43
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:36,718
... for research context -

44
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:39,432
And above all, epidemiological studies.

45
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,865
But in my case I have looked at the pattern register, -

46
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,779
which contains those that have patterned.

47
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,465
And during the pattern you measure, among other things, resting hearts -

48
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:53.705
And blood pressure and ... lots of different things.

49
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:56,232
But resting heart rate is one thing you measure there.

50
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,732
And by linking it to the criminal record -

51
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:02,552
So we can look at resting heart rate in relation to crime.

52
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,779
Right. How many have you looked at?

53
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,259
How big is the ground?

54
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:11,852
We look at all men who have been convicted of at least one crime.

55
00:08:12,112 --> 00:08:16,459
That was the starting point. And which of those who patterned -

56
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:20,599
And who have registered the rest of rest in the pattern register.

57
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:24,525
And a little over 400,000 men are included in this study.

58
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:27,505
There are very many. - There are very many.

59
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30.305
And what is low resting heart rate?

60
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:32,659
What do you define as a low resting heart rate?

61
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:34,779
Yes, then ...

62
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:36,799
As you have done before in register studies -

63
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:39.305
When you look at resting heart rate is that you let data control -

64
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,859
With how to divide into categories.

65
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:44,972
But as it has fallen out, we look at -

66
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:47.012
Those who have the lowest resting heart rate and then you are somewhere -

67
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,019
between 35 and 60 beats per minute.

68
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,932
And then compared to those who have high resting hearts -

69
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:56,212
And then you are up to 85 to 140-145 beats per minute.

70
00:08:56,226 --> 00:09:00,779
Right. Then I also think spontaneously that you have taken into account -

71
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:03.019
These well -trained people. I heard that ...

72
00:09:03,032 --> 00:09:06.052
On TV4 yesterday, they referred to Gunde Svan. He's - after all -

73
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,739
Known for its low resting pulse, but ...

74
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,972
... These are factors that you have counted on then?

75
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:14,219
Yes exactly. Because we know that affects, just as you say.

76
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:19,099
The same thing as length and weight can also affect what we have for resting heart rate.

77
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:24,432
So you put it into the analysis and adjust for.

78
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,094
So we have thought about that. - Right. Now you said "we", -

79
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:31,000
who are we"? Because it is not you who did the study yourself?

80
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:34,427
No, I have a collaboration with many other researchers, -

81
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,280
which can be found here at Örebro University, my supervisors.

82
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,454
And also at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, but also in the USA -

83
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:45,747
in Florida and Upenn. - Right.

84
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:49,087
It is exciting that it is an international cooperation as well.

85
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:53,040
What ... is it as big ...

86
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:58,360
... Impact even in the US and in these other places where you have ...

87
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00.987
... where you have your partners?

88
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:04,314
It was actually a colleague from Upenn -

89
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:08,580
that encouraged me to talk about this and make a press release, -

90
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:11,287
that "these are interesting research results", -

91
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:15,540
Because they had been on him to make a press release.

92
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:18,414
So it has been noticed there too.

93
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:22,627
To what extent I do not know. - No, exactly.

94
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,460
But you ... before this talk we talked before a little neighbor -

95
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,907
And then we talked about something called physiopsy ...

96
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:34,407
... psychophysiological responses! It is a whole new concept for me.

97
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,540
Can you tell us a little what it is for something, -

98
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:38,867
Because I think we need to clarify that for our viewers -

99
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:42,067
before we go into the connection. - Exactly.

100
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:44,907
Yes, but psychophysiology ...

101
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:48,514
... is such a word that you easily stumble on when to pronounce.

102
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:52,874
Psychophysiology can be said to be the interaction between -

103
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:56,374
What happens around us, our brain and our body.

104
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:59,820
I usually exemplify this with that -

105
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:03,376
If anyone loses anything in the floor that we are not prepared for, -

106
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05.747
And it melts loudly, then comes our brain -

107
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:09.827
automatically orientate us against the sound. We will register the event -

108
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:13,094
And then we will also be affected in our body by this.

109
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:17,774
We are afraid that there is something we have not prepared for.

110
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,967
So we might start to sweat a little in our hands. The pulse might go up a bit -

111
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:27,127
And we react physiologically to what is happening outside us.

112
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:30,474
- Right. It can be said to be psychophysiology.

113
00:11:30,627 --> 00:11:33,794
So the joint between the brain, body and what is happening around us.

114
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:37,247
Right. And how is this related to your study?

115
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:42,580
Vilacule is a psychophysiological ... a psychophysiological measure.

116
00:11:42,954 --> 00:11:45,927
We think that resting heart rate ...

117
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,160
When we talk about resting hearts, you might think of that -

118
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:51,594
“I lie and rest, we measure the pulse.

119
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:55,220
I am calm and at home in my sofa. ” -

120
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:57,787
Or "I lie in bed and just take it easy".

121
00:11:58,054 --> 00:12:00.894
So it is not really with the resting heart rate -

122
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:03,680
As we think about it in a research context, -

123
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:08,074
But then we think about it as a situation there ...

124
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:11,927
... the person who gets his heart rate measured -

125
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:16,534
is perhaps in a hospital environment or in a pattern environment -

126
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,940
Or in a lab environment, or wherever you are.

127
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:23,900
An environment that is not at home. Someone else measures the pulse on one.

128
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:28,434
So it's a pretty strange situation in many ways.

129
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,427
So that's why we think that then you should react a little -

130
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:34,700
On this stimuli that is around us, that we become ...

131
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,800
... maybe nervous or that we think it's unpleasant -

132
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:43,220
Or yes, a little stressed you are theoretically in such a situation.

133
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:46,640
So that is why it is then thought that the people who have low resting hearts -

134
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:51.605
Despite such a context, the ability to keep the nerves in check.

135
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:54,985
You are not quite as influenced by what is happening around one.

136
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:58.831
And there would then be a connection between the low resting heart rate -

137
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:02.451
And the risk of falling into crime? - Exactly.

138
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,824
What would that connection look like?

139
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:09.645
Yes, as I said we have studied ... or "we" ...

140
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:15,098
Other researchers have studied low resting heart rate in relation to crime for a long time.

141
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,131
But usually you do it in a controlled lab environment, -

142
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:20,738
which makes it a lot of time -

143
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:24.805
And so that is behind such a study, so there are quite a few people -

144
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:26,818
which participates in such a study.

145
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:29,871
So the first study that was published -

146
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:33,558
on a much larger selection in the pattern register.

147
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:38,458
It was published in 2015 and was the first large -scale study to be ...

148
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:40,898
... studied this association.

149
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:44,091
Then you saw that low resting heart rate actually increases the risk of crime -

150
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:46,378
And now also relapse for crime.

151
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,185
And then you may wonder why it is so.

152
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:52,138
Yes, that was my next question! Why is it like that?

153
00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:54,985
Why is it like that? A small background was needed ...

154
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57.945
But it is good. - Yes, - -

155
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01.958
Although it is so well studied, we still know very little about -

156
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:05.571
The mechanisms behind this association.

157
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:10,145
But there are two main tracks, theoretical main tracks, -

158
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:13,025
As one usually talks about when one -

159
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:16,385
Talking about precisely the association between low resting heart rate and crime.

160
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:20,418
It is either a theory that is about fear -

161
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:24,278
And that you then ... So you have a low resting heart rate -

162
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,845
So maybe you are not as afraid of -

163
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:31.305
The consequences that one's actions can have. One is not really afraid, -

164
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:34,505
"If I do this then maybe it will be like this".

165
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:36,911
You don't have it ...

166
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:41,245
You are not afraid of it, but you think it will solve enough.

167
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:44,405
It's been a way to look at this.

168
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,238
The second way that one has thought about is about that -

169
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:54,283
If you have low resting heart rate and it is regulated by the autonomic nervous system -

170
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,050
And there is something that happens automatically in our body.

171
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,916
We don't have to think about us ...

172
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:03,683
... have a pulse, but it is there. The body takes care of it itself.

173
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:07,163
If you then have a low resting heart then you may have -

174
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,883
A little imbalance in the body, that you feel ...

175
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,956
I don't know if "discomfort" is the correct word -

176
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:16,436
But there is no really good equivalent in Swedish that -

177
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:18,443
Talk about it in a different way.

178
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:21,116
You feel that you have some discomfort in the body, -

179
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:23,450
You are a little restless maybe.

180
00:15:23,743 --> 00:15:25,850
Not always, but in some situations, -

181
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:29,936
And you feel that you need to look out and search for some form of kick -

182
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:33,956
So that you get stimulated and get this one ...

183
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:38,270
... level in the body to a more optimal level -

184
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:41,290
Where you feel that "now it feels good".

185
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:44,316
So it's been another way to look at it.

186
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,410
One is either scared ... or you are not afraid -

187
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:49,550
The consequences rather, you are not afraid.

188
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:53,330
Or you seek stimulation through kicks ...

189
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:58,810
... where crime is one thing you think you can do.

190
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:03,243
While we are still in that with looking for a kick in some way ...

191
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05.883
Because one had also seen that low resting hearts -

192
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:11,896
is common in other types of professions or in other persons that are not -

193
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,153
criminals, without any other risk ... - yes, but exactly, -

194
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,380
And it may mean that this theory that you are looking for stimulation and kicks -

195
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:26,133
Feels a little more ... maybe it's wherever we should ...

196
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,940
In the circles we should think, just because ...

197
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:33,100
I have seen that one has written about -

198
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:36,067
low resting heart rate in people who work as bomb dear, -

199
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,707
A very specific occupation. But there may also require that you have -

200
00:16:40,714 --> 00:16:43,493
the ability to keep your nerves under control.

201
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,680
One cannot go into a situation where one should disarm a bomb -

202
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:52,360
and think about the consequences and fear them that way, -

203
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,180
Without you having to calm down.

204
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:58,060
The same thing as ...

205
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:01.047
... people jumping parachute or bungy jump -

206
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03,787
or is doing extreme sports ...

207
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,767
... also has a low resting heart rate. Not all of course, but it occurs.

208
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:12.560
Exactly, and then you have taught me that it is called prosocial behavior.

209
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:16,200
Right? When you do something good about it, -

210
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:19,960
Instead of anti -social behavior such as crime would be in that case.

211
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,580
Exactly, I think it could be.

212
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,027
But that's how I've speculated on this.

213
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:32,347
And prosocial is, as you say, you might be involved in -

214
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:35,287
activities that are not harmful to anyone else, -

215
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:40,727
Without looking for kicks in a more socially accepted manner, -

216
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,147
While anti -social behavior is more about crime -

217
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:46,614
and to make bus.

218
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,874
Could one imagine sitting in a live broadcast -

219
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,572
Is a prosocial behavior to seek a kick?

220
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:55,638
Yes, but maybe. - Based on my own feeling ...

221
00:17:56,406 --> 00:18:00,232
It may sound a bit simplified to say that low resting hearts have a connection -

222
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:03,992
with relapse in crime. There must be other factors as well -

223
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:07,485
which records for that recidivism risk.

224
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,125
How do you look at it and how do the thoughts go there?

225
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:15,018
Yes, but it is very important to bring in -

226
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,745
The thoughts and reasoning about this, that although we see that -

227
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,063
It is an increased risk if you have a low resting heart rate, -

228
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,750
So it is not the only thing, so we have not discovered "The Holy Grail", - -

229
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:28,510
Without you need to look at other things too.

230
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:30,650
But as I have reasoned about this -

231
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:34,170
Is that we know ...

232
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:39,343
We can assess the relapse of crime with what we have now, -

233
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:41,196
thus with the risk assessment instruments available -

234
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,536
and the risk factors we know from previous research -

235
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,550
Increases the risk of relapse in crime.

236
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:50,043
But what can we add as ...

237
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:54,123
... makes us better at risk assessing?

238
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56.803
Can we bring in another type of measure, -

239
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:59,489
some other type of risk factor that can add something -

240
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:04,736
Beyond what we already know? That has been my thought about this.

241
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,356
And so I think, it will too ...

242
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,070
Thus, the care of those who -

243
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:16,330
Sitting detained today. Could it be a part of -

244
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:18,543
The preventive care for them?

245
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,896
Thus, long -term, yes, and had one asked some of -

246
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:25,941
My co -authors for this article they had said "yes, absolutely".

247
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:29,735
I ... I don't really know.

248
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:33,668
But it is not a completely foreign thought that we -

249
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:39,468
maybe eventually bring resting pulse as part of -

250
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:41,668
the assessment for relapse, -

251
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:45,988
Just because it is quite specific with low resting hearts, -

252
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:51,341
Too low resting heart rate is associated with antisocial behavior, -

253
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:55,648
While high resting heart rate is assisted with many other things.

254
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:59,121
So it is not as specific with high resting heart rate as it is with low resting heart rate.

255
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:03,735
Therefore, it becomes an appealing factor to include in the equation.

256
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:06.648
And it is also relatively easy to measure, -

257
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:10,308
It is not invasive in any way, but it is ...

258
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:13,915
One can count the pulse in a very simple way -

259
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:16,928
And it also makes it appealing.

260
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:21,595
Yes, just because then my next question also becomes: What do we do now?

261
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:25,169
What do you do now with this knowledge and with this one -

262
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:28,842
The discovery, so to speak? What is the next step in this?

263
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:34,222
Yes, the next step, what I am doing and do, that I am curious about ...

264
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:37,522
Now we know that this applies to men, -

265
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,109
And most studies have been predominantly on men -

266
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:42,582
Just because we know that men are over -represented in -

267
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,315
Crime statistics, we have a hard time coming out.

268
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:49,389
But there are also indications that low resting hearts -

269
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,322
Can also increase the risk of committing crimes in women.

270
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,402
So I really want to continue to investigate it -

271
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:58,222
and see if we see similar associations -

272
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:01,542
between resting and crime in women.

273
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,675
Or does it differ in any way?

274
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:07.662
But theoretically, it shouldn't, but ...

275
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:11,762
And what we know since previous research should look about the same.

276
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:18,189
But we also know that women have a higher resting heart rate on average -

277
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:20,895
than men have, and this is already seen ...

278
00:21:20,922 --> 00:21:22,815
... when the kids are young. So at the age of three -

279
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:25,869
So you can see that girls have about six beats per minute, -

280
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:28,255
higher pulse than boys have.

281
00:21:28,816 --> 00:21:31,935
And this has been a way to think about ...

282
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:35,089
Could it be one of the explanations for why men commit more crime -

283
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:37,895
than women because they have a lower resting heart rate?

284
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:42,249
I'll just say that, that you have to ask questions in the chat here -

285
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:45,109
To Sofi if you come on something during the way.

286
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,529
Now we have talked for about a quarter.

287
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,909
But I also think it is important to study such studies -

288
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:54,455
And this kind of research will benefit society in some way.

289
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:58,795
And this might be a huge question to one like you, -

290
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:02.302
But where do you see this taking us, say in 10 years, -

291
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:06.409
What have we done to this study and this type of research then?

292
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:11,849
Yes, so as I would describe psychophysiological research, -

293
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,541
So I would say that it is primarily basic research.

294
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:16,635
Basic research is ...

295
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:19,461
... a type of research where we ...

296
00:22:19,475 --> 00:22:23,721
... maybe find out one of the building blocks as to why -

297
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:25,728
Some commit crimes and others do not, -

298
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:28,855
and maybe not primarily research results -

299
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:33,808
Who comes out in practice and does something fantastic upset there.

300
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:37,108
But basic research should also lead to other research -

301
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:41,835
that is more practically laid and who also answer questions -

302
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:46,421
That gives us guidance on how we can work with this in practice.

303
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:49,288
So a hope is, of course, that we know more -

304
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:52,135
About low resting heart rate and crime.

305
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:56,095
What is it in what we can use in practice?

306
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,648
Is there anything we can use in practice?

307
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:03,208
Does it make us better at risk assessing relapses in crime?

308
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:10,501
Just. We will see if we have received any questions in the chat. We have not received that.

309
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:18,469
If we move on ... We also talked about this with bio feedback.

310
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,322
If we get back to it, because we talked about too -

311
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:24,129
If you can train your resting heart rate ...

312
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,509
... and keep it in check.

313
00:23:27,849 --> 00:23:32,882
When I have lectured on psychophysiology for students, I usually ...

314
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:37,342
To understand what is happening in a lab environment, -

315
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:41,069
So I usually talk about, and this is my supervisor who has taught me ...

316
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,949
One can talk about lie detector tests, because everyone knows what it is -

317
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,342
from American television series and movies.

318
00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:49,082
So you can think about it that it is a bit so it works.

319
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:53.302
We measure hand sweat and pulse in situations there -

320
00:23:53,316 --> 00:23:56,968
People are exposed to different things to see how they react.

321
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:02.835
And then you can, you have noticed, exercise.

322
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:06,002
Although this autonomous nervous system works independently -

323
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:11,328
and low resting heart rate is part of the autonomous nervous system, -

324
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:15,182
So you can still learn to control this a little neighbor.

325
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:18,668
And those in Navy Seals in the United States for example are very -

326
00:24:18,696 --> 00:24:22,615
Hardly teased to be able to regulate their responses in the body.

327
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:27.302
And there is also a line of research that trades bio feedback -

328
00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:29.862
which is also applied in practice in different ways, -

329
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:35,342
Where you can follow your responses to different stimuli in real time.

330
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,449
For example, if one has anxiety or phobias -

331
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:45,055
So maybe in a lab environment you will be exposed to what you are afraid of -

332
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:48,949
While seeing how to react in the body, -

333
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:53,435
and then by practicing handling the feeling and reaction in the body -

334
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:57.062
So you can learn to control this a little neighbor.

335
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:01,149
So it's definitely an appealing thought.

336
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,786
Could this be something that can be applied to resting heart rate and crime?

337
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08.892
I don't know, but ... - But maybe you know in a few years.

338
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:11,066
In 10 years we may know a little more. - Yes, but exactly.

339
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,112
But if I'm sitting at home now watching this call -

340
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:17,586
And I have low resting hearts, I need to be afraid that I -

341
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:20,152
will commit any crimes, right?

342
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:23,879
No I do not think so.

343
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:27,832
This with the association between low pulse and crime -

344
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,279
Is at group level. And i usually see -

345
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:32,866
When I talk about this for students, that many are sneaking down -

346
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:36,319
And take the pulse of themselves while I talk.

347
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:40,319
But no, it's not at the individual level, but we see it at group level -

348
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:43,079
And of course, many have low resting hearts -

349
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:45,159
that will never commit crimes.

350
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:48,392
Maybe you are looking for some other type of kick, possibly, -

351
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,112
But it is not that one will commit crimes -

352
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,759
Just because you have a low resting heart rate. - No, just that.

353
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:57,699
Very important to mention. - Yes, but it is very important.

354
00:25:57,706 --> 00:26:00,386
I think that, just as you say, you directly -

355
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:04,499
checks their own resting heart rate or pulse at this time.

356
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:07.161
Is there anything more that you want to add this -

357
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:10,152
As you think we have not touched on during this call, -

358
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,959
Which would like to tell us and our viewers?

359
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:18,385
So I could talk about this for a very long time, but ...

360
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:22,960
No, but I feel pretty satisfied. I think we have touched it -

361
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:26,511
which is essential and important to bring their from this ...

362
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:29,291
... I think. - Yes, what fun.

363
00:26:29.305 --> 00:26:31,903
Big thanks for coming here today, Sofi.

364
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:36,405
And we will see you again in a new section of Oru Talks here in the future.

365
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,430
Have a good one!
