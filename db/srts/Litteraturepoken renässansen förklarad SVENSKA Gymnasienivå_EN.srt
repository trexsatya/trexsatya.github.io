1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,800
Before the year 1450, virtually all books are made by hand.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,720
One writes by the works words for word-

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,680
-Side for page and chapter for chapter.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,320
Most often it is monks that do it and it can take a year to get a book.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,480
This means, in addition to cramps in the hands, that books are rare and expensive.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,960
It is said that the King of Portugal in 1400 has only nine books.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,560
He is not close to filling a bookshelf.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,520
But after years of attempts inventing the German Johannes Gutenberg-

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,240
-A technology for printing books.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,320
He uses loose lead types that can be joined into text lines.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
Now books from rare go to mass -produced.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,680
The art of letterpress was an invention that changed the whole story-

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
-and and humanity's way of being.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
Texts and ideas can spread on a new way-

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,440
-In the period called the Renaissance.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,000
It is a time when you look both back and forward.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,680
What did you write and read at the time-

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,600
-Then literature suddenly could reach many more.

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,560
The Renaissance is a period that can be difficult to put on a timeline-

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,960
-But it takes over after the Middle Ages and continues until the end of the 17th century.

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,760
"Renaissance" means "rebirth" and one rediscovered the ideal of antiquity-

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,400
-When you thought had been forgotten during the dark Middle Ages.

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,600
Renaissance is a restoration or look back to the ever-

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,040
-In this case to antiquity.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,480
You want to return to what you thought of as the cradle of civilization.

26
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,960
You not only rediscover the old one but also discover new things.

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,040
Europeans are going for them new parts of the world-

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,400
-while you conquer and colonize-

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,360
-And you look out for the first time into space.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
However, the discoveries do not protect against illness.

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Nearly one -third of Europe's population dies in the deaths.

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,280
Everyday life was for most people just like before.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,560
They lived mainly as a farmer.

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,840
They followed this year's bicycle quite a lot with the seasons-

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,920
-And devoted itself to sowing and harvesting.

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,440
As the Center for the Renaissance you usually place Italy and Florence.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,680
During the 1300s, the ideas and ideals of the Renaissance are emerging here.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,200
From there they spread across Europe, sometimes quite slowly.

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,040
In Sweden, it takes two hundred years before the thoughts are attached.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
The Renaissance ideas move forward and backward.

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
Forward and away from the dark medieval-

42
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,920
-And back towards the Greek and Roman antiquity that one idolizes.

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,960
You literally hunt for old texts.

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,480
You root antique texts that you have not read before.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,440
You study classical Greek and translate texts.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,760
They also try to imitate. One thinks that the human soul educated-

47
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,680
-The forms and realizes through the study of the texts.

48
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,280
The interest does not only concern the texts. Antiquity's view of man is obtained.

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,360
It is the individual, not God, who is to be at the center.

50
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,120
You pay tribute to the creative ability and we get the concept of "Renaissance man"--

51
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,840
-The someone who is good at several different things.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,520
One stops seeing artists as craftsmen-

53
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,840
-and start talking about creative geniuses.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,960
The new human view and ideals are picked up by the rulers.

55
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,640
It contributes to challenging the power of the church.

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,640
Now Reformation-

57
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,160
-The church is divided into a Catholic and a Protestant part.

58
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,760
Previously, they had a uniform view of religion.

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,480
There was a church that had been around for a long time.

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,480
The split allows one to question religious truths.

61
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,680
The Renaissance man does not want to think about life after this, as in the Middle Ages.

62
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,680
Almost everything from the Middle Ages is seen as goofy.

63
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,840
There will be a book that in many ways is a parody-

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,120
-To what was the coolest during the Middle Ages: the knights.

65
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,000
The book is "The Brilliant Knight Don Quijote by La Mancha"-

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,800
-When the full title reads.

67
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,040
It is written by this man: Miguel Cervantes.

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,000
It is difficult to describe Cervantes, because you know so little about his life.

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,160
You know he had different professions and did not have it easy in life.

70
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,640
He did not live on his authorship but had administrative job-

71
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,320
-And was a soldier in the military.

72
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,480
He dropped an arm in one of the many wars he was involved in.

73
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,120
Although he is not a full-time writer writes cervantes-

74
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,920
-The called the first modern novel.

75
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,760
Book poiler: "Don Quijote".

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,760
The protagonist is a small-minded nobleman who has carried on knight novels-

77
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,480
-and cannot distinguish between imagination and reality.

78
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,360
He calls himself the knight Don Quijote-

79
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,840
-and in rusty armor he makes a confused journey in Spain-

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,280
-with his gunman Sancho Panza.

81
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,040
He is looking for adventure and evil to fight-

82
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,000
-But there will only be developments and trouble against imagined enemies.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,200
He goes to attack on windmills, in the belief that they are giant-

84
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,040
-What he finally returns home.

85
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,720
There he falls asleep. When he wakes up, he realizes that he has behaved snapped.

86
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,040
Don Quijote is crazy, that thing is clear. But who is not crazy?

87
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,600
That's what I think is one of the great features-

88
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,320
-When this fictional person has.

89
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:05,920
Madness is something you laugh at, and so it was when the work came out-

90
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,440
-But then you understand that the madness is another way of looking at things.

91
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,320
That's what lives on.

92
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,800
Typical of renaissance literature-

93
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,160
-As the humanistic idea of man at the center.

94
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,680
The characters think about themselves and their actions.

95
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,440
They also develop and change. There is also something new.

96
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,160
Previously, literary characters have retained their traits through the story.

97
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,640
Humanism is important during the Renaissance time.

98
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,520
What humanism implies in the first hand-

99
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,040
-As that it is man who is in focus.

100
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,400
It is about man in his great complexity.

101
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,200
"Don Quijote" is written in Spanish. The language is rich.

102
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,400
The two main characters, Don Quijote and Sancho Panza, talk completely different:

103
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,280
-The one solemn and made, and the other with ordinary spoken language.

104
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,160
We hear the famous part about the windmills.

105
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,960
"Then they saw the windmills, up to forty in the middle of the plain."

106
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,000
"When Don Quijote saw them, he said to his armor:"

107
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,400
"'Happiness leads us better than we could wish.' '

108
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,080
"'Just look, dear Sancho, there are thirty hideous giants'"-

109
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,600
-"'that I will trap the last man.'"

110
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,720
"'With the change we base our wealth. It is a godly pleasant deed' '--

111
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,920
-'' to eradicate the rice from the world's surface. ''

112
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,640
"'What giants?' Sancho wondered. ”

113
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,360
The language of "Don Quijote" feels pretty old-fashioned

114
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,960
-With many old words and concepts, but you immediately notice that it is comedy.

115
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,440
The narrative voice has its own views-

116
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,000
-And jokes at Don Quijote's expense.

117
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,040
The action is quite easy to understand. There are no difficulties.

118
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,760
The difficulty comes when referring to things that require pre-knowledge-

119
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,800
-As name, places and stories.

120
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,920
The hard thing about the language was the old-fashioned expressions-

121
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,240
-But it was easy to google the words and expressions to understand them.

122
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,840
What Don Quijote lacks is Sancho's perception of reality.

123
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,760
He has seen more. Don Quijote thinks there is adventure everywhere.

124
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,440
Do you remember the renaissance complain that everything medieval is bad?

125
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,000
But a thing they started with in the Middle Ages they still want to take advantage of:

126
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Writing books in the language you speak.

127
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,240
This whole period is a period when man-

128
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,760
-The interests and loves the language. It is believed that it is important.

129
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,720
If you write with everyday words you can develop the language and take out the turns.

130
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,560
In Sweden, the poet Georg Stiernhielm did it.

131
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Here you see him, with something similar to a tablecloth around his neck.

132
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,520
He wrote one of Sweden's most important Renaissance works, the poem "Hercules".

133
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,840
In Renaissance, he was inspired by ancient times.

134
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,040
Hercules is a hero in Roman mythology-

135
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,800
-But at Stiernhielm he is a young nobleman who will choose a path in life.

136
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,080
He loved the language, obviously. He wanted to experiment with it.

137
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,800
He also looked for the inner secrets of the language.

138
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,200
What about the sounds really? Do they have any inherent meaning?

139
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,920
With your own language you can be playful, even in what is not written.

140
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:26,360
"The eye has no light, and the ear has nothing heard."

141
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,000
"Where is all our desire"-

142
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,840
-"When body and soul are divorced?"

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,640
"In the dark, eternal silent!"

144
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,640
He does not make the verse-

145
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,880
-Why it gets quiet for real!

146
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,960
Looking in the book-

147
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,600
-So you see that it is only white in the black text mass.

148
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,640
It is a reminder of that with death.

149
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,040
It is strong, but also very playful.

150
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:11,240
The poems have typical renaissance features: the blink to antique-

151
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,360
-The reflecting the main character and the innovative language.

152
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:24,400
But we have not mentioned the Renaissance's perhaps most famous writer.

153
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,360
"To be, or not to be?"

154
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,560
We're talking about the man with the high hairline, William Shakespeare-

155
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,480
-dramatic, poet and actor, born in 1564 in England-

156
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,760
-And perhaps the world's foremost playwright.

157
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,680
He is responsible for men in puffs who talk dramatically with skulls.

158
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,720
Stina Ekblad has held roles in more than ten Shakespeare sets.

159
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,600
William Shakespeare was the biggest writer who existed, I think.

160
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,920
An author who renewed the English language.

161
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:15,040
A writer who wrote about just about all imaginable human-

162
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
-Runally, seriously ...

163
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,360
... poetic, wild ...

164
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Yes, all you can imagine!

165
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,880
Shakespeare wrote many well -known pieces. They can be divided into four categories.

166
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,280
Comedies: Stories with happy ending.

167
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,120
Tragedies: where it ends unhappily, as for these two. They die.

168
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,240
Historical dramas, which are based on things that have happened ...

169
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,840
... and sago games, which have the sagas and are more dreamy.

170
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,960
One reason for his popularity is that he creates complex characters.

171
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,800
They often wrestle with internal conflicts and do things that they later regret.

172
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,280
They are very human - just like you and me.

173
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,240
I could shut myself in a nutskal-

174
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,760
-and feel like king over infinite space-

175
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,560
-If I didn't have such nasty dreams.

176
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,160
It is so easy to recognize in what he writes om-

177
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,320
-And how he describes people, behaviors, relationships and meetings.

178
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,400
It must be themselves "it" with him, that there is life in the texts-

179
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,000
-And a depiction of man's vomits and war with himself.

180
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,880
It is death of course, and friendship. He describes it absolutely incredible!

181
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,480
At the same time, he is also fun.

182
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:55,200
In the middle of everything when it is at its most, there will be a laugh or a song.

183
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,280
What Shakespeare writes should be performed in front of the audience.

184
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,760
Theater is popular again, because it is taken from antiquity.

185
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,640
Here comes all the strata of life.

186
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,600
Shakespeare mixes high and low, to satisfy everyone.

187
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,040
A solemn monologue can be mixed with a joke.

188
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,600
A recurring theme is death.

189
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,200
You know the famous scene from Hamlet? "To be or not to be?"

190
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,320
It's about living or not living.

191
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,240
As many as 74 of Shakespeare's characters die on stage.

192
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,160
The most common is to be killed.

193
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,720
He describes it as no one else.

194
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:44,800
"Golden Lads and Girls All Must, As Chimney-Sweepers, Come to Dust."

195
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,040
It is always present there, that ...

196
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,960
Remember that you are going to die, and that's it.

197
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,120
While the British gather to see Shakespeare's play-

198
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,520
-and the local Mediterranean culture shelved-

199
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,280
-Is not the same thing in the world's colonies.

200
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,200
Colonialism makes European culture, religion and language-

201
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,480
-Forced on those who have not asked for it.

202
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,760
The worldview formulated from the 16th century forward-

203
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,800
-SEs Europe as the center-

204
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:27,280
-And the place where the universal truths and faith are located.

205
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,040
The rest of the world will in different ways adapt and reshape Sig-

206
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,840
-After that formulated in Europe.

207
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,400
It also means that life-

208
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,040
-As the indigenous population has understood it, is put to an end.

209
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,840
To be subordinate, enslaved, sat in unpaid work-

210
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,920
-Bli departed their tradition-

211
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:01,280
-Bli deprived of their culture, her costume, all in principle!

212
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,720
Man forces them new languages, new religion - Christianity-

213
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,640
-and new ways of living.

214
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,560
The art of letterpress in Europe has been allowed to spread ideas-

215
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,800
-But here helps effectively push away the culture that exists.

216
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,640
It's not just about killing people bodily and exercising violence-

217
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:30,000
-Or also on cultural violence, which thus kills people spiritually.

218
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,800
We also see the consequences of it today.

219
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,640
It is about one's own identity and culture.

220
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:46,400
Many people have been able to rebuild some, even buildings-

221
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:52,120
-But the power relations between them and the rest of the world have remained-

222
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,360
-Near the same, in some cases.

223
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,280
Today we can see that the character of the letterpress art on the Renaissance-

224
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,480
-then single books became the whole library-

225
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,080
-There is reminiscent of the digital revolution.

226
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,720
The thing we experience now-

227
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,000
-with to have access to almost the entire world's knowledge in our mobile phone-

228
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,200
-It's a kind of step two in this development-

229
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,360
-What the large libraries and access to many tanks-

230
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,400
-When you had five hundred years ago.

231
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,680
It should be remembered that very often, in the 1400s to the 16th century and today-

232
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,960
-When communication is used to make us think one or the other.

233
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:50,280
Propaganda writings in the 17th century say which king should decide.

234
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,120
Today it is "fake news" or whatever it is month.

235
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,920
Compared to other literary eras, the Renaissance's tracks are less clear now-

236
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,800
-But without it probably the legacy of antiquity would not be as alive today.

237
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,440
Shakespeare's work is still set up-

238
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,680
-And is the basis for new stories, both on stage and on film.

239
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,280
But above all, we probably carry the idea of modern man:

240
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,920
That as Shakespeare and Cervantes portray characters with different pages.

241
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
