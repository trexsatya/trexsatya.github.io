00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:05.973
The Matfors factory may be one of Leader Mittland Plus completed projects

2
00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:09.944
But continues to burst with creativity and ingenuity.

3
00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:15.449
The history of the mill, ingenuity and creativity permeates the old factory premises,

4
00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.053
which has become an important meeting place in the countryside.

5
00:00:19.053 --> 00:00:23.557
The idea of creating the meeting place that Matforsfabriken is today took Form 2017.

6
00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:29.530
The project group made a trip down to Skåne, where they looked at an interactive castle

7
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.934
And got fun ideas and spreads for the factory premises' design.

8
00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:37.905
Recycling was the key word when the Matfors factory was developed.

9
00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:42.676
Lena Schmidt, project participants tell us more about the wealth of invention.

10
00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:50.250
The idea of this mobile café part Here you should get a feeling that you are sitting inside a house

11
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.223
and here the feeling should be on the outside of a house

12
00:00:56.223 --> 00:01:04.031
Here you walk like a street, with fences and numbers on the houses.
 That's what the idea is.

13
00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:13.974
Creativity is bursting inside the room.
 It is possible to have a snack at Götas Café but also look into

14
00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:15.974
Röhman's old business that used to be in Matfors.

15
00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:22.149
One should also take the opportunity to open the door to the artistically decorated toilet.

16
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.920
It is not possible to miss the fact that the Matfors factory attracts visits.

17
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.894
Sigrid Lehman and Marianne Näsvik appreciate creativity and think it is a nice tourist destination.

18
00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:42.836
It was interesting what was indoors, flea ice cream and there was play corner and playing corner,

19
00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:47.808
And I think about this if you have children and grandchildren with them so they can do things inside

20
00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:50.777
Or they can do things outside.

21
00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:56.750
And so you should visit the toilet, because it is very worth seeing,

22
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.723
Even if you do not need, you can wash your hands just you can go in there and so and look a little around.

23
00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:06.560
Yes, fully agree.

24
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:18.038
That it was Röhman's old business.
 I remember.
 You have been there and traded.
 Very nice initiative this.

25
00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:23.743
Lena Schmidt tells us more about what Leader meant for the project.

26
00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:30.283
If we had not received this support from Leader, the Matfors factory would not have been lost.

27
00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:35.255
Because we didn't have the financial muscles to do this ourselves, simply.

28
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:44.864
The project is completed, but the Matfors factory continues to be innovative and there are many plans for the future.

29
00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.201
We at Leader Mittland Plus can't help but agree

30
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:54.841
That creativity is bursting at the factory and understands that it attracts many visits.
