1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,803
We're going to travel back in time.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,672
- You get completely spinning.
 - You get full.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,850
Do not you want it?

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,677
Do not understand what her problem with Grandma is.

5
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:16,013
Oh my God!

6
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:27,392
Hello Hello!

7
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:30,825
We have started a family club!

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,827
- Yes!
 - Yeah.

9
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:35,095
Swedish Family Club.

10
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:36,096
Yes!

11
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:38,164
We told you about it ...

12
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:43,802
- I am with.
 - Yes, you are a member.
 And a little tired.

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:44,840
Yes.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,675
We talked about the club in our last vlog and we already have several thousand members.

15
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:53,209
So fun!

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,279
- Membership is free.
 - Totally free.

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:07,087
And in the club, as a member, you get lots of good offers and discounts on fun and necessary stuff.

18
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:08,555
Yes.

19
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:10,490
And things you want to do!

20
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:12,280
Yes exactly.

21
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:16,895
We have received some questions.
 For example, "Do you have to be a family to join?"

22
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:17,629
No.

23
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:22,579
- No, of course not.
 - You absolutely do not have to have children to be a member.

24
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:30,272
- No, you can find good and fun things anyway.
 - Yes, and everyone is welcome members.

25
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:30,872
Yes.

26
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:35,476
Now we will do something that we have never done before.

27
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:40,880
We will travel back in time to a fun place.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,283
A place we have been and visited a couple of months ago.

29
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:45,351
- Yes.
 - Yes.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,753
- a place ... - (Laura screams)

31
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,887
Oh!

32
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:52,490
A place that has an offer in the club.

33
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:53,157
Yes!

34
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,092
- Are you ready?
 - Here we go!

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,779
Laura!

36
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:58,428
1, 2 ...

37
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:00,896
So there!

38
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:07,868
Now we are on Sergelgatan in Stockholm, more specifically at the subway.

39
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:09,870
And what is here?

40
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,405
Paradox Museum!

41
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,476
- And we should have that place completely for ourselves.
 - Yeah.

42
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,860
It will be very exciting.
 We will show you the visit.

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,949
But then you go down here in the subway.
 I turn around and follow you.

44
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:26,635
Yes.

45
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,822
- Look there!
 - "Yes!"

46
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:38,626
- It's a little secret entrance into the subway.
 - Exactly.

47
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,495
But now they run!
 They are so peppy.

48
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,697
Here it is!

49
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,401
Wow.

50
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:53,004
- Wow!
 - Exactly.
 "Wow!"

51
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:57,675
!
 "Oh my gosh."

52
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,344
- huh?
 - Wait, it was really weird.

53
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:04,347
It looks like it's moving.

54
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:09,217
- do they stand out or in?
 - Yes exactly.
 Do they stand out or in?

55
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:13,354
Laura went really close, so she sees.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,823
But what you see is something else from there, right?

57
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,624
Yes.

58
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,445
- Look!
 - Yes.
 It's moving.

59
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:29,366
- What is it under the table, then?
 - If someone goes from the other side, we can see.

60
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:41,609
- You have no body, Alma.
 - You'll eat me.

61
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:44,612
The head of the plate, just ... "Nam, Nam, Nam!"

62
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,280
"Say Cheese."

63
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,020
Check.
 Laura is ready to eat Alma.

64
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,266
Let's see.

65
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,201
Oh no.
 (laugh)

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,562
!

67
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:08,921
"Oh my gosh!"

68
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,335
"Trippy."
 I kind of lose balance.

69
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:18,405
- Laura!
 Laura!
 - Waaaao!

70
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:23,342
- Aaah, Laura.
 You roll.
 - It feels like you roll.

71
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:29,014
- You get completely spinning.
 - You get full.

72
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:32,516
It feels like you just ...

73
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:36,086
This is super scary after all.

74
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,156
What is going on?

75
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:43,025
It's "Disappearing Dots."

76
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:50,164
... which makes you kind of see just that dot that disappears, and you see that it is in a different color.

77
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:55,068
It's a little scary.
 You should stand and check for 30 seconds.

78
00:04:56,535 --> 00:05:02,006
And here we have eyes that follow one as you go.

79
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:13,034
- "Oh my God!"
 - sh*t, you just want to ...

80
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,817
You get really spinning in here!

81
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:19,354
- Wear me, mom.
 - Should I carry you?

82
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:25,495
Now I carry you.
 Oh what it's wrong!
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

83
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,028
The whole room spins!

84
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,698
- Here.
 - Yes, we will go here.

85
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,268
- She got a little worried.
 - Yes.

86
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,469
- The.
 - Yes, you want to go in here and look.

87
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,738
Yes we do.
 Come!

88
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,360
!

89
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:49,678
- Oh yeah, this is going a little too ... - fast.

90
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:52,480
So it is a flickering light, and ...

91
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:58,952
But that's the wrong pace for the camera.
 What do you say?
 It goes at the wrong pace.
 It just gets crazy disco.

92
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:01,954
Well.
 What a shame.
 We can see if we can film with Gopron.

93
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:07,492
Here you can film.
 "Oh my God!"
 Here I get completely dizzy.

94
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,693
Mom came!

95
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:18,116
- Where should I come?
 Back here?
 - Hit.
 With the camera.
 It's great to do this.

96
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,737
Right.
 Do you want to take a card on yourself?

97
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:24,563
Certainly.

98
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,222
This is such an Instagram -friendly museum.

99
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,353
Great!

100
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,694
Nice, the gang!

101
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:59,500
Compared to a lot of insects, we kind of see nothing.

102
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:04,270
They see something called ultraspectrate.
 They see type 3 \ hilmins more colors.

103
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:08,970
- Sit on the couch.
 - Do you want to go and sit on the couch?
 Yes do it.

104
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:15,104
Alma and Harry met Love, who work here.
 He shows them a little, so you can sit on the couch.

105
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:19,290
And this is probably no ordinary sofa, Laura.

106
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:23,372
Check this out.
 It's a hole on the sofa.

107
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:26,021
And one more hole on the sofa!

108
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:36,362
You should sit with someone, so you can take a very cuddly picture.

109
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,198
Do not you want it?

110
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,033
Nah.

111
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:51,674
Don't check, because there may be nothing there.

112
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,012
- Oh, scary.
 - It's a little scary, that is.

113
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:02,216
Now I missed what you got to learn about.
 Was it exciting?

114
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,017
Yes, it's exciting.

115
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:11,423
Is about light that we humans cannot see, but as there are lots of animals that can see.

116
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:17,962
So there may be lots of things and other animals and things that we humans do not know anything about.

117
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:22,098
- "uaua" sit there, mom.
 (Laura) - Do you want to sit there?
 You can do that.

118
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,634
- That's a microscope, right?
 - Yes.

119
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,171
- What do you usually do with a microscope?
 - See things.
 Oh, it's a face ...

120
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:37,677
How good you are, Laura!
 That went really well.
 There you can sit for a while.

121
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:40,880
It is kind of a fraudulent face.

122
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:47,840
The camera does not look.
 Only you see!

123
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,080
"Superpowers!"
 (Super powers)

124
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,024
There you go.

125
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,628
- So!
 And then I put some pillows on you here now.
 - Okay.

126
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:04,532
Laura, move you so I can take a good card.

127
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,337
Hello there!

128
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:12,872
Hello there!

129
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,607
How are you in there?

130
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,475
How are you in there?

131
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:21,345
- How should I come out?
 - We have to pull you out, like this.

132
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:42,857
- What do you see?
 - We see lots of faces.

133
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:45,631
God, what many Harrys it was there!

134
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:50,802
- And what do you see here, then?
 Do you see lots of Lauras?
 - Yes.
 Lots of small hands.

135
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:53,137
- Gosh!
 - "Hello!"
 (Hello!)

136
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:57,207
Laura has fimmed her shoes, as usual.

137
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,011
It is fortunate that we are ourselves in here, so that no one tramples her on her toes.

138
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:06,614
Here is a fun thing.
 Which one of these two is the longest?
 Almis?

139
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:11,352
- (Laura screams) - Nämen!
 Do you also want to join in and guess?

140
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:12,619
Okay!

141
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:15,888
- Which one of these two is the biggest?
 - It!

142
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,890
- It?
 - Yes.

143
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,761
I know this is a lurking and that both are the same size indeed.

144
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,631
It's just an illusion, because it fits both.

145
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:29,699
Wow.

146
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:33,402
Want to meet "Uanu", Mom.
 (Grandmother)

147
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:37,472
- Do you want to meet Grandma?
 - Yes!
 Yes!

148
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:42,143
Maybe we can do that after this, now that we are in Stockholm and everything.

149
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,677
YES!

150
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:51,016
- I don't understand what her grandmother's problem is.
 - She likes Grandma.

151
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:56,020
Now this is the shortest, because it is at the top.

152
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,326
And now it's the longest.

153
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:04,440
- Illusion, illusion!
 - Illusion.

154
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,699
- Who is winning?
 - I.
 I win.

155
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,336
Who has the most "poker face"?

156
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,676
I.
 I win.

157
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:11,680
- Should we go in here and check?
 - Yes.
 I want to be big, you have to be small.

158
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,278
- Are you small when standing here?
 - Yes.

159
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:20,747
- Oh no!
 - Oh, what a snappy it looks.

160
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,364
Laura, you have to go away.
 You destroy the optical illusion.

161
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:30,162
If I insert the camera like this ...

162
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:34,698
Gosh!
 Laura!
 Stand with Alma or with Dad.

163
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:37,034
- Come to me, Laura.
 - Do you want to be small or big?

164
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:38,201
Sit down a bit.

165
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:42,471
Obviously she wants to be big!
 Oh, what cool!

166
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:46,630
Do you hear the subway, by the way?
 It thunders by.

167
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,010
Laura, we're just as big!

168
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:57,283
Fun, of course!
 Can I be the biggest once?

169
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,685
You will be huge.

170
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,354
"Oh my God!"

171
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,523
Laura, can't you go to Alma?

172
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,291
- Go to Alma once.
 - Laura, come!

173
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:10,702
- She is very difficult to direct.
 - Yes.

174
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:16,899
Check out, do you see there?
 You can be very cute and small.
 Come!

175
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:21,330
- Laura thinks it is fun to ride a slide.
 - Yes, but exactly.

176
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,504
Fun!

177
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,473
So this is ames room.

178
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,675
Now I'm very big.

179
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:34,946
And it is because it is low in ceilings here, and it is higher up.

180
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:38,349
And then you go down ... then it's high in ceilings.

181
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:43,153
And if you move in here where the walls go together, you look small.

182
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,155
And you who stood here, you can see there.

183
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:49,424
Or yes, I'm also here now.
 Hello!

184
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:53,220
Oh!
 Now they play piano.
 Come!

185
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,700
(Harry) ping pong!

186
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:10,007
"Oh my God!"
 A talking piano.

187
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,676
- Yes, it talks!
 - Hello Hello!

188
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,616
Wait, Laura.

189
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,680
!

190
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:25,686
Wait.

191
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:35,227
"It will be an unforgettable conversation."
 Yes, you can really say that.
 Lovely finish here.

192
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:38,697
Yes indeed!
 Cool!

193
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:55,410
What a cool place, corner.

194
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,346
- Yeah sure!
 - Right?

195
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,616
So cool, and so much exciting optical illusions and stuff.

196
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,284
And mirrors.

197
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:09,170
Fun place to go with the family, or with friends.

198
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,690
- Or with the family.
 - Yes, if you want to take new family pictures.

199
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:13,691
Yes.

200
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:17,694
We were here an hour before opening and we had to go through everything.

201
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:22,459
Has it stuck any small piece of tape there on you?
 Where did it come from, then?

202
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,305
What was the bus?

203
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:30,404
Thus, children of Laura's age, they are a little too small for this.

204
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,339
Yes, she is a little scared.

205
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:36,276
But at the same time she has said, "Busy dad, mischievous dad."
 So she thought it was fun too.

206
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:36,876
Yes.

207
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:39,478
- But I think it's better for your age.
 - Yes.

208
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:44,482
And as I said, it took us for an hour.
 It may take a little more time when there are people in the museum.

209
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:48,085
- Yes.
 - But just fine fun to do.

210
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:50,153
Highly recommended.

211
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,156
- Should we move on?
 - Yes!

212
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:59,894
- We are back in the present in Lisbon.
 - "Yes."

213
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:08,001
