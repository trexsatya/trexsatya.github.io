1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,803
We are going to travel back in time.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,672
- You get so dizzy.
- Super dizzy.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,850
You don't want that?

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,677
I don't get what her problem with grandma is.

5
00:00:14,178 --> 00:00:16,013
Oh my God!

6
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:27,392
Hey, hey!

7
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:30,825
We have started a family club!

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,827
- Yes!
- Yep.

9
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:35,095
Swedish Family Club.

10
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:36,096
Yes!

11
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:38,164
We told you about it...

12
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:43,802
- I'm in it.
- Yes, you're a member. And a little tired.

13
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:44,840
Yes.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,675
We told you about the club in our last vlog,
and we already have several thousand members.

15
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:53,209
So fun!

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,279
- The membership is free.
- Totally free.

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:07,087
And in the club, as a member, you get a lot of good offers
and discounts on fun and necessary stuff.

18
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:08,555
Yes.

19
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:10,490
And things you want to do!

20
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:12,280
Yes, exactly.

21
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:16,895
We have received some questions.
For example, "Do you have to be a family to join?"

22
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:17,629
No.

23
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:22,579
- No, of course not.
- You absolutely don't have to have children to be a member.

24
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:30,272
- No, it's still possible to find good and fun things.
- Yes, and everyone is welcome to become a member.

25
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:30,872
Yes.

26
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:35,476
Now we will do something
that we have never done before.

27
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:40,880
We will travel back in time to a fun place.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,283
A place we have been and visited
a couple of months ago.

29
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:45,351
- Yes.
- Yes.

30
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,686
A place...

31
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,887
Oh!

32
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:52,490
A place that has an offer in the club.

33
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:53,157
Yes!

34
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,092
- Are you ready?
- Here we go!

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,779
Laura!

36
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:58,428
1, 2...

37
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:00,896
There we go!

38
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:07,868
Now we're on Sergelgatan in Stockholm.
More specifically, at the subway entrance.

39
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:09,870
And what's here?

40
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,405
Paradox Museum!

41
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,476
- And we will have that place all to ourselves.
- Yep.

42
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,860
It will be very exciting.
We will show you the visit.

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,949
So, you go down here in the subway.
I'll turn it around and follow you.

44
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:26,635
Yes.

45
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:32,822
- Look there!
- Yes!

46
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:38,626
- It's a bit of a secret entrance down into the subway.
- Exactly.

47
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:41,495
Now they're running!
They're so excited.

48
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,697
Here it is!

49
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,401
Wow.

50
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:53,004
- WOW!
- Exactly. "Wow!"

51
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:57,675
No!
Oh my Gosh.

52
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,344
- What?
- Wait, that's really weird.

53
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:04,347
It looks like it's moving.

54
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:09,217
- Do they stick out or in?
- Yes, exactly. Do they stick out or in?

55
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:13,354
Laura got really close, so she sees.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,557
- But you see something else from over there, right?
- Yes.

57
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:22,445
- Look!
- Yes. It's moving.

58
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:29,366
- What's under the table, then?
- If someone goes from the other side, we can see.

59
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:41,609
- You don't have a body, Alma.
- You will eat me.

60
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:44,612
Head on a plate, like... "Yum, yum, yum!"

61
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,280
Say cheese.

62
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,020
Look. Laura is ready to eat Alma.

63
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,266
Let me see.

64
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,201
Oh no.

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,562
No!

66
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:08,921
Oh my gosh!

67
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:13,335
Trippy.
I'm, like, losing my balance.

68
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:18,405
- Laura! Laura!
- Wow!

69
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,342
- Laura... You're falling.
- It feels like you're falling.

70
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:29,014
- You get so dizzy.
- Super dizzy.

71
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:32,516
It feels like you're, like...

72
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:36,086
This is super scary.

73
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,156
What's going on?

74
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:43,025
It's Disappearing Dots.

75
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:50,164
It makes you only see this dot that disappears,
and you see that it's in a different color.

76
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:55,068
It's a little scary.
You should look at it for 30 seconds.

77
00:04:56,535 --> 00:05:02,006
And here we have eyes
that follow you when you walk.

78
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:13,034
- Oh my God!
- Sh*t, you just want to...

79
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,817
You get really dizzy in here!

80
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:19,687
- Carry me, mommy.
- Shall I carry you?

81
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:25,358
Now I'm carrying you.
Oh, it's so slanted!

82
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,028
The whole room is spinning!

83
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,698
- This way.
- Yes, we're going this way.

84
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,268
- She got a little worried.
- Yes.

85
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,469
- That one.
- Yes, you want to go in here and have a look.

86
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,738
Let's do it. Come!

87
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:43,360
No!

88
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:49,678
- Oh, wow. This is a bit too...
- Fast.

89
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:52,480
It's a flickering light, and...

90
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:58,952
But it's the wrong pace for the camera. What do you say?
It's going at the wrong pace. It's just a crazy disco.

91
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:01,954
Oh, what a shame.
Maybe we can film it with the GoPro.

92
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:07,492
You can film this one.
Oh my God! This one's making me really dizzy.

93
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,693
Mommy, come!

94
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:18,116
- Where should I come? Back here?
- Here. With the camera. This is really fun.

95
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,737
Right.
Do you want to take a picture of yourself?

96
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:24,563
Sure.

97
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,222
This is such an Instagram-friendly museum.

98
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,353
Nice!

99
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,694
Nice, guys!

100
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:59,500
Compared to many insects,
we see basically nothing.

101
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:04,270
They see something called the ultra-spectrum.
They see, like, 3 million more colors.

102
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:08,970
- Sit on the sofa.
- Do you want to go and sit on the sofa? Sure.

103
00:07:09,174 --> 00:07:15,104
Alma and Harry met Love, who works here.
He's showing them some things, so you can sit on the sofa.

104
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:19,290
And this is probably no ordinary sofa, Laura.

105
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:23,372
Check this out.
There's a hole in the sofa.

106
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:26,021
And another hole in the sofa!

107
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:36,362
If you sit with someone,
you can take a really goofy picture.

108
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:40,198
You don't want that?

109
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,033
Nah.

110
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:51,674
Don't look, because there might not be anything there.

111
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,012
- Oh, scary.
- It's a bit scary.

112
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:02,216
Now I missed what you got to learn about.
Was it exciting?

113
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,017
Yes, it's exciting.

114
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:11,423
About light that we humans cannot see,
but lots of animals can see it.

115
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:17,962
So maybe there are lots of things and other animals
and stuff like that which we humans know nothing about.

116
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:22,098
- "Uaua" sit there, mommy. (Laura)
- Do you want to sit there? Sure.

117
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:24,634
- That's a microscope, right?
- Yes.

118
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,171
- What do you usually do with a microscope?
- See things. Oops, there's some face…

119
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:37,677
Well done, Laura! That went great.
You can sit there for a bit.

120
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:40,880
It's, like, a really disgusting face.

121
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:47,840
The camera doesn't see it.
Only you see it!

122
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,080
Superpowers!

123
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:59,628
- There you go. Now I'm putting some pillows on you.
- Okay.

124
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:04,532
Laura, move and I can take a good picture.

125
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,337
Hello there!

126
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:12,872
Hello there!

127
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,607
How are you doing in there?

128
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,475
How are you doing in there?

129
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:21,345
- How do I get out?
- We can drag you out, like this.

130
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:42,857
- What do you see?
- We see lots of faces.

131
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:45,631
God, so many Harrys!

132
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:50,802
- And what do you see here? Do you see lots of Lauras?
- Yes. Lots of little hands.

133
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,137
Hello!

134
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:57,207
Laura has kicked off her shoes, as usual.

135
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,011
Good thing we're alone in here,
so that no one steps on her toes.

136
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:06,614
Here's a fun thing.
Which of these two is the longest? Almis?

137
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:12,553
- Gosh! Do you also want to guess?
- Okay!

138
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:15,888
- Which of these two is bigger?
- That one!

139
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,890
- That one?
- Yes.

140
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,761
I know this is a tricky one
and that both are actually the same size.

141
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,631
It's just an illusion, because it fits both.

142
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:29,699
Wow.

143
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:33,402
I want to go see "uanu", mommy. (Grandma)

144
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:37,472
- Do you want to go see grandma?
- Yes! Yes!

145
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:42,143
Maybe we can do that after this,
now that we're in Stockholm and all.

146
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,677
YES!

147
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:51,016
- I don't get what her problem with grandma is.
- She likes grandma.

148
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:56,020
Now this one is the shortest, because it's at the top.

149
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,326
And now it's the longest.

150
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:04,440
- Illusion, illusion!
- Illusion.

151
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,699
- Who's winning?
- Me. I'm winning.

152
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,336
Who has the most poker face?

153
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,676
Me. I'm winning.

154
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:11,680
- Shall we go in here and look?
- Yes. I want to be big, you can be small.

155
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,278
- Are you small when you stand here?
- Yes.

156
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:20,747
- Oh no!
- Oh, it looks so crazy.

157
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,364
Laura, you have to move.
You're ruining the optical illusion.

158
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:30,162
If I stick the camera in like this…

159
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:34,698
Gosh! Laura!
Go stand with Alma or with daddy.

160
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:37,034
- Come to me, Laura.
- Do you want to be small or big?

161
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:38,201
Sit down for a bit.

162
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:42,471
Of course she wants to be big!
Oh, how cool!

163
00:12:42,538 --> 00:12:46,630
Do you hear the subway, by the way?
It's rumbling past.

164
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,010
Laura, we're the same size!

165
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:57,283
Fun!
Can I be the big one now?

166
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,685
You'll look huge.

167
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,354
Oh my God!

168
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,523
Laura, can't you go to Alma?

169
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,291
- Go to Alma.
- Laura, come!

170
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:10,702
- She's very difficult to direct.
- Yes.

171
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:16,899
Look, look on the screen up there.
You can be very cute and small. Come!

172
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:21,330
- Laura thinks it's more fun to slide down the floor.
- So true.

173
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,504
Fun!

174
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,473
So, this is the Ames Room.

175
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,675
Now I'm very big.

176
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:34,946
And that's because the ceiling is low here,
and it's higher up.

177
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:38,349
And then you go down here,
and the ceiling is high.

178
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:43,153
And if you go back here where the walls meet,
you look small.

179
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:49,357
And you who stood here, you could see there.
Well, I'm also standing here now. Hello!

180
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:53,220
Oh! They're playing the piano. Come!

181
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:10,007
Oh my God!
A talking piano.

182
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,676
- Yes, it talks!
- Hey, hey!

183
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,616
Wait, Laura.

184
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,680
Amogus!

185
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:25,686
Wait.

186
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:35,227
"It will be an unforgettable conversation."
Yes, you can really say that. Nice ending here.

187
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:38,697
Yes, indeed! Cool!

188
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:55,410
What a cool place, guys.

189
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,346
- For sure!
- Right?

190
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,616
So cool, and so many exciting
optical illusions and stuff.

191
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,284
And mirrors.

192
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:09,170
A fun place to go with family, or with friends.

193
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,690
- Or with the relatives.
- Yes, if you want to take new family photos.

194
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:13,691
Yes.

195
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:17,694
We were here an hour before opening,
and we managed to go through everything.

196
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:22,459
Got a little piece of tape stuck on you?
Where did it come from?

197
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,305
What kind of mischief was that?

198
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:30,404
Kids Laura's age are a little too small for this.

199
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,339
Yes, she was a little scared.

200
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:36,276
But she also said, "Mischievous daddy, mischievous daddy."
so she thought it was fun too.

201
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:36,876
Yes.

202
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:39,478
- But I think it's better for your age.
- Yes.

203
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:44,482
And as I said, it took us an hour.
It might take a little more time when there are people in the museum.

204
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:48,085
- Yes.
- But just the right amount of fun activity to do.

205
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:50,153
We highly recommend this.

206
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,156
- Shall we move on?
- Yes!

207
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:59,894
- We are back in the present in Lisbon.
- Yes.

208
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:08,001
