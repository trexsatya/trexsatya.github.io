ASSOCIATING

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,040
In order to remember maths concepts,
I use a memory strategy.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,120
I invent a story to remember the word.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,680
This is useful in all subjects. I use it
in maths to remember the concepts.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,640
I think about the word. What does it
really mean? What does it sound like?

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,360
To do this, I must do something first:
I have to close my eyes.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:35,000
<i>Pythagoras' theorem.</i>				
				<i>Pytha... Python... Yes, a python!</i>

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,920
<i>Pythagoras' theorem is a python.</i>

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,080
<i>Is that snake long or short?</i>				
				<i>How would I know?</i>

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:50,400
<i>Pythagoras. That's when you calculate</i>				
				<i>the sides... The sides of what?</i>

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,400
<i>Pythagoras</i>				
				<i>sort of rhymes with 'grimace'.</i>

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,920
<i>A cat's face when it makes a grimace!</i>				
				<i>The face looks like a triangle.</i>

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,880
<i>By thinking of a python</i>				
				<i>and a cat's face-</i>

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,520
<i>-I remember</i>				
				<i>what Pythagoras' theorem is.</i>

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,320
<i>Cylinder. Bike wheel.</i>				
				<i>A rotating wheel.</i>

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,760
<i>A hamster wheel. It's round.</i>

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,400
<i>Cylinder, that sounds like 'hinder'.</i>				
				<i>Sanitary pads hinder the blood flow.</i>

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,440
<i>I put them in an empty toilet paper</i>				
				<i>roll, which is shaped like a cylinder.</i>

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,640
<i>Now I won't forget it.</i>				
				<i>I put my sanitary pads in a cylinder.</i>

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,960
<i>Now I'll never forget</i>				
				<i>what a cylinder is!</i>

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,800
CONE

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,720
<i>What rhymes with 'cone'? 'Telephone'?</i>

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,320
<i>'Cony...'</i>				
				<i>'Conny', that's my guinea pig.</i>

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,800
<i>He likes a good crayfish party.</i>				
				<i>That's when you put on those silly hats.</i>

25
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,680
<i>They're shaped like cones!</i>				
				<i>My guinea pig...</i>

26
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,880
<i>I only need to think of Conny</i>				
				<i>to remember what a cone is.</i>

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,160
That's what I do
to remember different concepts.

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,960
Everyone can make up their own stories.
There's no right or wrong.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,880
By associating words and making up
a story, it's easier to remember.

30
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
Images are often easier
to remember than names.

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,640
Give it a try! The crazier, the better.
