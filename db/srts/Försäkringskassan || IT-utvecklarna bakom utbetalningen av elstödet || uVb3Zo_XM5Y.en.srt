1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,720
Several million people have received their electricity support and it feels

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,760
powerful that the e-service that I and my team have developed were of importance

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,480
For so many.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,440
As always when a new IT service is to be developed, it is important to me as

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,800
UX designer to work closely with the developers

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,640
So that the solution looks and works as intended.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,520
In order for the Social Insurance Office to be able to pay out money, we have developed a

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,720
e-service where electricity grid companies can enter

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,360
And enter information about their customers.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,640
An important thing to think about was, for example, traceability so that we have

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,400
Opportunity to help the electricity grid companies if any problem arises.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,160
We got free hands to

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,520
Create this service, but didn't have to start from scratch.

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,360
We have design systems with components and features

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,360
Like input fields and buttons that we could reuse.

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,200
It was a bit like picking up different legobits, part of a building

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,800
Which made it possible for us to pay out SEK 17.5 billion in electricity support.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,280
We'll find out

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
the needs of users, in this case the electricity grid companies, and which

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,160
Technical possibilities that exist.

21
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
It should be easy for the user to do

22
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,400
Right and difficult to make mistakes.

23
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,120
Several million people have received their support and it feels powerful

24
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
that the service that I and my team have developed

25
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,000
Meaning for so many.

26
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,400
Several million people have received their VR support and it feels powerful to

27
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,240
The e-service that I and my team have developed have become important to so many.

28
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,080
As always when new in service is to be produced, it is important

29
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,800
for me as a designer to work closely with the developers to

30
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,880
The solution should look like

31
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,120
And function as it is intended.

32
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,280
We'll find out the users' needs, in this

33
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,160
the case of the electricity grid companies, and what technical possibilities exist.

34
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,800
It should be easy to make right and difficult to make mistakes.

35
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,960
Creating this e-service was a bit like that

36
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,520
Pick up different lego pieces.

37
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,280
Part of a building that made it

38
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,040
possible for us to pay out SEK 17 and a half billion in support.
