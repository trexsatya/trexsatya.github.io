1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,480
<i>The first academic journal
was published in 1665.</i>

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,960
<i>Prior to that,
research results were mostly disseminated</i>

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,880
<i>through personal communication
and handwritten material.</i>

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,840
<i>Disseminating research results
through journals</i>

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,520
<i>has become an important part
of the academic system.</i>

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,240
<i>Over the years, tens of thousands
of academic journals have been started.</i>

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,120
<i>Until the advent of digitalization,
publishers and printing houses</i>

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,280
<i>were needed primarily for packaging
and distributing the journals.</i>

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,560
<i>Eventually, the researchers' need to
disseminate and quality-assure their results</i>

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,680
<i>grew into a market.</i>

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,600
<i>From the 1960s and onwards,
large publicly-listed companies</i>

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,440
<i>began buying up smaller publishers.</i>

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,600
<i>Since then, the market has increasingly
become an oligopoly,</i>

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,520
<i>dominated by a few large publishers.</i>

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,280
<i>The process of digitalization
began at the end of the 1990s.</i>

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,120
<i>Academic journals
are now primarily e-resources,</i>

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,600
<i>that readers can access by being enrolled
or employed at higher education institutes</i>

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,120
<i>that subscribe to these journals.</i>

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000
<i>The prevailing system
for publishing research results</i>

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
<i>and making them available,
involves researchers</i>

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,520
<i>submitting their articles to publishers
who are responsible for editing them</i>

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,400
<i>and publishing them in academic journals.</i>

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,760
<i>Publishers generally do not pay any
financial compensation to the article authors</i>

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,560
<i>or to the researchers
in charge of peer-reviewing the articles.</i>

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,720
<i>The publishers have then
marketed access to the journals</i>

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,600
<i>to libraries and higher education institutions
through subscriptions.</i>

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,720
<i>Simultaneously, with the market's
development into an oligopoly,</i>

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,520
<i>and with the digitalization of publication,</i>

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,320
<i>the prices for subscriptions
have increased,</i>

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,520
<i>with profit margins as high as 40%
in some cases.</i>

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,040
<i>Owing to these developments,
many higher education institutions</i>

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,640
<i>can no longer afford to pay
the high subscription fees.</i>

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,400
<i>Consequently,
researchers in various parts of the world</i>

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,040
<i>lack access to the information they need,</i>

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,240
<i>and society is unable to benefit
from the knowledge produced.</i>

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,280
<i>This is the background to the emergence
of the need for a new system</i>

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,160
<i>for publishing research results.</i>
