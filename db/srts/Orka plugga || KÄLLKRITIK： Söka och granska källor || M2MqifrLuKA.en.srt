00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,360
A source is something where information comes from.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,240
But how do you know which sources make sense and which ones are not?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,440
There are some things you can think of.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,600
If you search for healthcare for example ...

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,480
And comes into this page ...

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
How do you know that what is there is right?

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,720
Well, if we check who is behind the page ...

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,120
Okay, here it was kind of impossible to see who is behind it.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,960
It can be advertising, politics or whatever.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,160
Therefore, that source may not be trusted.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,840
Because we don't know what they want.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,240
But if we go into the care guide instead.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,160
So we see that it is the authorities, which take care of the health care, which is behind the page.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,960
Thus, that source can be trusted.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
For healthcare wants to provide good care.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,160
So if you can't quickly see who is behind and for what purpose -

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,920
Skip that page and move on!

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,960
In addition to being able to get help from a teacher or a parent, so can

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01.080
You get it from a librarian. - Right?

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02.560
- You can get that!

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05.040
- Can you trust what is in books?

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,920
- When it comes to fact -based books, the books have usually gone through

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,440
An editor or other researchers reading to do a look at.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,800
Then it is also a lot about why the author has screaming white book.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,120
Is that to get a political message, get their views

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,880
about something or is it more for entertainment?

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,280
I can ask these!

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,400
- Hi, excuse. Do you know what a source is?

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,560
- No.

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,200
- Do you know what a source is?

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,120
- A source ... to what? To happiness or?

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49.840
- Either do you mean a person who is a source of something that has happened

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
Or that sit on information.

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,920
Or it's that little nice water source.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,640
The ones that answered now are primary sources.

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,200
That is, the information comes directly from the origin and

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02.720
have not gone through any filter.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05.600
Besides, they are oral - thus not written down.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
But if I now take a small clip out of what they say and have with

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
In this program. Then it becomes a secondary source.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,920
Because I have filtered in what they say as I have removed things.

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
So this with sources need not be so complicated.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,880
To know if a source is something to use, you can check who is behind.

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,960
And what do they want with the information, is it opinion or facts?

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,640
Is it an original source that you have found or is it just a reference?

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,480
It is usually a good idea to check out the basic source!

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,800
But remember that you can always take help from your teacher!

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,760
Good luck!
