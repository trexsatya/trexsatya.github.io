1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,440
If you were to choose a cultural work at random-

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,280
-A fiction book, a movie, a poem or a song-

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,880
-Is the chance that something in it can be tracked all the way back to antiquity.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,200
We often see antiquity as the starting point for our modern history-

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,480
-Where democracy, science and Western culture arise.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,880
But man has been around for over 200,000 years.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,360
How was it that happened around the Mediterranean a few thousand years late-

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,640
-So important that we often see it as a beginning?

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,920
Ancient Greece is special because we know so much about it.

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,080
There is a lot of text and literature.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,720
By there are preserved-

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,080
-Have it affected the Western cultural heritage like nothing else.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,200
This series on the history of literary is about what is preserved.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,320
Books, poems and plays.

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,040
Although human history is longer than antique-

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,160
-Is this we start our Western literary history.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,000
What did you write and read when everything started?

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,360
Antiquity ranges approximately from 700 BC. to 500 AD

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,640
It is divided into a Greek and a Roman era-

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,640
-As a long time coexist in the middle.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,000
The first 500 years counted as Greek antiquity golden age-

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,240
-And this is where most literary breakthroughs happen.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,680
Geographically the ancient Greek culture is divided

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,120
-And consists of several hundred city states.

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,840
One would like to know how to experience it in place-

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,520
-for example. How it smelled.

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,280
We can only speculate, but it must have smelled very and bad.

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,320
In addition to the bad smell, the city states are bound together by two things.

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,560
The common language, Greek, and the common gods.

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,480
The Greek gods looked like and behaved like human beings.

31
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,120
They slept, ate, drank, danced, had sex, struggled and slandered each other-

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,720
-and could be pretty small. They were no moral role models.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
There are twelve gods and they live on the mountain Olympos.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,080
In addition to them, there are local gods and half -gods.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,800
The gods could young with ordinary people.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,720
With the common faith came a common view of life.

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,920
The ancient Greeks have clear ideas on how to behave.

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,400
It can be seen in the stories you tell.

39
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,280
A red thread through the Greek literature is to think about:

40
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,600
"How does it look?" "Will people remember me?"

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,160
The worst thing you can do in antiquity is getting hybris.

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,080
Not to be moderate but believe that you are as good as the gods.

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,840
Then you suffer from nemesis, punishment from above. Punishment is never fun.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
As guidance you have the myths-

45
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,760
-Som with their stories explain the world.

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,600
One of the myth's functions is to answer these big questions.

47
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,800
Where does everything come from? What is the meaning of everything?

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,600
How is the universe interconnected, the world of gods and people?

49
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,560
A variety of issues of this kind are dealt with in the myths.

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,440
They can also be used to amuse. These are fantastic stories.

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,520
When you read them today you are still taken by them.

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,080
One of them is the starting point for our Western literature - the Iliad.

53
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:20,160
Where does literature start? It always starts with the Iliad.

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,840
The Iliad is an epic, a longer story written in verse.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Together with the Odyssey, it contains 28,000 verses.

56
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,120
An epic takes place in the past tid-

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,520
-and the Iliad attracts during the Trojan War in the 13th century BC-

58
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,240
-Sid before the time we count as antiquity.

59
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,000
It is usually said that it is written down by Homer in the 7th century BC.

60
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,760
Book Poiler Iliad:

61
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,800
The Iliad takes place during the tenth and last year of the Trojan war.

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,720
The Greeks have besieged the city of Troja. We meet people as well as gods.

63
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,560
The best fighter of the Greeks, Achilles, comes into trouble with agamemnon-

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,240
-and gets so angry that he refuses to fight-

65
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,960
-Ag until Hektor, the prince of Troja, kills one of Achille's best friends.

66
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,720
Then he takes to weapons again and chases Hektor around the city walls-

67
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
-What he kills him.

68
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,080
Achilles brings with him and violates the body of the dead prince.

69
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,640
After a little bang, the corpse is returned to Troja.

70
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,120
The story ends with hectoral funeral.

71
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,280
The iliad is important because it is so old-

72
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,160
-and has been with so long-time-

73
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,840
-And framed the entire ancient culture.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,880
What do we know about Homer who stands as a writer?

75
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,200
He has been called literature's forefather - no bad nickname.

76
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
But we know almost nothing about him.

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,200
He might be blind, he might not be.

78
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
Here we see how he is led by a young good looking.

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,440
There are even An expression - the Homeric question ...

80
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,640
... who is wondering if there may have been a single man ...

81
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,960
... who have written two such influential books.

82
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,840
The story in the Iliad, how real is it?

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,640
The Iliad takes place in a real time but also in a mythological time.

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,080
It is a fantasy product "based on a true story".

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,920
The Iliad does not depict the beginning or the end of the Trojan war.

86
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,360
It also does not have the exciting story of the Trojan horse.

87
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,120
Instead, the Iliad has another theme - Achilles and his anger.

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,240
Here we see Brad Pitt as Achilles. He doesn't look so a little angry.

89
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,400
I interpret the Iliad as a problematization of a world-

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,360
-which is filled with war and rape-

91
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,080
-And as an illustration of how unsustainable it is as a social form.

92
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,400
Ancient Greece was a society where violence was constantly present.

93
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,400
The vast majority of adult men could count with-

94
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,040
-To sometime in one's life get meat down someone else-

95
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,960
-or stand next to someone who was meat down.

96
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,400
Furthermore, the Iliad is orally passed.

97
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,080
Only when it has been told for hundreds of years is it written down.

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,280
We see this clear imprints in the written text.

99
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,600
When we read, we often appreciate variation.

100
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,040
But when something is to be remembered, we put more value on repetition.

101
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,800
The Iliad was long live.

102
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,520
It was singers who could, what we could call a language-

103
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,080
-Arch consisting of word combinations that they could put in a solid rhythm.

104
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,720
We call that rhythm hexameter.

105
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,840
You could be asked to sing about Achilles.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,520
So one began to put, in the hexameter's space-

107
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,720
-stories that one combines live in the actual conduct-

108
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,240
-ur The huge storage room you have of these rhythm combinations.

109
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,120
Having the same rhythm combination through a whole work is called a bound verse.

110
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,680
So it is with the hexameter of the Iliad. Here the first verse.

111
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,680
Notice that we already here hear about Achilles and his anger.

112
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Sing, o goddess about the wrath that burned with Peliden Achilles.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,920
Do you hear the rhythm? It goes like this.

114
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,560
Women Didi Women Didi Dam Didi Dame Didi Dam Didi Dam.

115
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,400
So it should sound, over and over again in over 28,000 verses.

116
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,200
The Iliad also contains so -called epithetic

117
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,240
-Where you tell about the characters' traits before their name.

118
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,680
"The fast -footed Achilles." "The Helmet Bronze Hector."

119
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,680
"The arrow -loving artemis."

120
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,880
The standing epithets helped the listener and singer to remember-

121
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,680
-What character traits the different people had.

122
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,920
This hexameter ...

123
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,000
It was new to me. I don't usually read that.

124
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,600
But I didn't think the language was difficult.

125
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:46,080
I had never read a piece written in hexameter.

126
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,920
It was special. A little difficult at first. A challenge.

127
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,320
But it was fun. You had to focus a little extra.

128
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,760
There are imagery, metaphors and parables.

129
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,880
There were many different types of writing in a text.

130
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,520
It was exciting.

131
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,080
The epic as the Iliad is often told by so -called Rapsodes.

132
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,960
They go around in ancient Greece and tell stories for payment.

133
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,320
Each time a poet tells a story-

134
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,600
-cent audience roughly what applies-

135
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,520
-But are prepared for the author to tell in a new way.

136
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,360
It is a big deal to spoil a story.

137
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,000
You must not say how it ends.

138
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,720
But in ancient Greece everyone always knew how it ended.

139
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,840
The important thing was how you told the story.

140
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,840
From the Greek word for action, "drama", comes two important concepts.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,240
Through the philosopher Aristotle we get "dramaturgy"-

142
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,760
-The knowledge of how a story should be built up to catch the audience.

143
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
Stories need a beginning, a middle and a final-

144
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,480
-and a red thread that goes through what you tell.

145
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,280
It may feel given today as part of what we read and look at-

146
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,280
-But then, for the ancient Greeks, it was brand new.

147
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,200
From the word "drama" also comes "drama".

148
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,880
The drama that emerges in the ancient aten-

149
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,400
-As the origin of today's theater.

150
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,120
You distinguish between tragedies and comedies - seriously and fun.

151
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,280
But the tragedies have the highest status.

152
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,520
These are the ones you play at the city festivals.

153
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,680
The drama is known through the tragedy.

154
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,040
The tragedy is this spectacle that is set up-

155
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,160
-At the annual festival in Athens the so -called. Dionysos Festival.

156
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,760
People come from all over the Greek island world, sometimes up to 30,000.

157
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,240
The ancient Greek theater takes place outdoors-

158
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,080
-and is built on a slope with the stage at the bottom-

159
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,600
-and the spectators in a semicircle.

160
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,040
One of the most famous tragedies played-

161
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,280
-As "Antigone" by the playwright Sofokles.

162
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,800
Think about how our father went abrasive and despised in ruin-

163
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,960
-and for his crime as himself he brought in the day-

164
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,360
-With your own hand drove their eyes out.

165
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,480
We have epic where our epic is included as developing into fiction.

166
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,880
The drama is the basis for theater, television and film.

167
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,520
In both, action is crucial.

168
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,640
It also comes a third form of literary design-

169
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,400
-What does not focus on events, but on a feeling.

170
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,040
We are talking about the lyric, the basis for poetry.

171
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,120
It is almost always presented to music and it has been named ...

172
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,080
... from this instrument - a lyre.

173
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,840
One of ancient great poets is Sapfo. Here we see her think.

174
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,120
She was active in the 500-600s before our time-

175
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,320
-And is one of the oldest poets we know and have poems from.

176
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,320
Sapfo lives on than Lesbos, a rich Handelsö in the Greek kingdom.

177
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,520
She herself belongs to the island's upper class.

178
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:51,600
What we have from SAPFO is completely unique because it is so extensive.

179
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,080
It gives us an insight we otherwise would not have-

180
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,920
-And that shows women's lives in antiquity.

181
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,360
Of course, they are also very beautiful.

182
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,520
"Who is it now I have to persuade?"

183
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,400
"Who is it now whose silence torment you, sapfo?"

184
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,800
"She's fleeing you now will be following."

185
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,960
"She who refuses now will want to."

186
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,080
"She who doesn't love should love whether she wants to or not."

187
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,600
Her style is often direct and clear-

188
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,840
-and the texts often revolve around desires, longing and beauty-

189
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,600
-For everything women's beauty.

190
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,640
Lesbos, the island she comes from, is the basis for the word "lesbian".

191
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,400
Although SAPFO had a great impact on the history of literary

192
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,280
-Found very little of her work preserved.

193
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,360
We must remember that it is over 2,500 years since she lived.

194
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,800
Her poems have no names but are usually called fragment-

195
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,160
-To they have been preserved as parts and loose pieces.

196
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:04,040
In modern times, many have liked it. You have liked the fragment style.

197
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,920
There is a lot of room to interpret and enter yourself.

198
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,560
It has probably contributed to the attraction.

199
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,600
There is room to project their own thoughts and dreams.

200
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,480
The lyric is the third and last leg next to the epic and drama-

201
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,920
-On the ancient pallet where much of today's literature rests.

202
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,280
Three basic genres that live on thousands of years later.

203
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,520
Today it may appear that everyone in the Greece-

204
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,680
-As writers, philosophers, heroes and gods, but that's not it.

205
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:51,920
Most people live simple lives and there are obviously back sides in history.

206
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,160
Given that the Greeks find the democracy, philosophy-

207
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,440
-and much of the literature we have today, so you disregard-

208
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,800
-Th a thing that enabled the production of culture and thought-

209
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,560
-Where that someone else did the hard job. It's the slaves.

210
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,280
The free men, atenna-

211
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,920
-has the opportunity to devote to philosophy and literature-

212
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,560
-This to have to go to work.

213
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,120
A culture that has slave-

214
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,120
-Builds on a human view where everyone is not equal.

215
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,520
Some people are like items that you can change and sell and buy-

216
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,920
-Preatic as with a chair, bicycle or sweater today.

217
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,520
It is also noticed in the literature that one is aware of the injustices.

218
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,520
Becoming a slave is something you worry about.

219
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,360
A recurring motive in literature is the fear of pre-

220
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,160
-As losing one's affiliation and being sold as a slave.

221
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,399
The fear that one can be sold as slave-

222
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,040
-Is perhaps difficult to relate to in day-

223
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,240
-But much in ancient literature is still relevant.

224
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,440
The myths are still told-

225
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,879
-And is not only used by playing Greek tragedies.

226
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
It is made movies-

227
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,840
-And we have popular culture and series that use this estate.

228
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,200
These are good stories.

229
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,600
They still grab us and still have something to say us.

230
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,080
