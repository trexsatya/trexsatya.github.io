00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,352
hi My name is Marcus &amp; I run SparaCash.se

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:10,496
VOICEOVER: In today's video I thought I would tell you why I started SparaCash

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,312
And how I started with stocks

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,968
I think you will find it interesting if it is so that you recognize it in what it is like to be

5
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
Beginner

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
And how you feel paralyzed and do not understand why you should invest

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Money and how stocks and mutual funds simply work

8
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,520
WHY I STARTED SPARACASH

9
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,288
The point of this video is to show you

10
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
Exactly how much more you will be able to learn after you have grasped to learn how it works

11
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088
Investments. Investments that I always nag about involve risk. But the risk is

12
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03,488
Another thing when talking about life is not about investing your money in equity funds

13
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
Without risk in general in life

14
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
And when we talk about risk

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
Then I want to back the band

16
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
Until the year 2013

17
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
The year is

18
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
2013

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
Jimmie Ã…kesson gets the same year

20
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
Cake in the face

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
Usain Bolt

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,176
Continues to run home gold

23
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
And I'm taking the student.

24
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,144
This summer I get a summer job at the post 'Okay what the hell is a horse here'

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,544
servant * laughs * What the hell

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
This money I saved

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
What would I do with them

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Already

29
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,880
I knew you could invest the money in some way

30
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
In stocks or mutual funds

31
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
But how does it really work?

32
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
I had no idea how it was

33
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Actually works

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
I had no one in my family

35
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Who could teach me about stocks and mutual funds

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
I was told

37
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
You could save the money in shares

38
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
But I had no one who could teach me how it actually is

39
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
Works

40
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
So

41
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
What do you have to do then

42
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
Grab yourself of course

43
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,040
And if you Google funds and shares Where do you end up then

44
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Of course on

45
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Flashback

46
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,536
And that's why I chose to invest in Avanza Zero

47
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
A free fund on Avanza

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
I create an account on Avanza and I have

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
No clue

50
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
What the hell

51
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
I was doing

52
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,520
And my point is to say it

53
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
It is not so important that

54
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
Know how it is

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Works without the important thing here

56
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
It is to actually put

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
In progress

58
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
And that's what I am

59
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
So happy

60
00:02:59,456 --> 00:02:59,968
Look back that I.

61
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
In fact, it did

62
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
That I actually dared to take that risk

63
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
To dare to invest my money

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,696
You do not have to be a brain surgeon to invest or save your money

65
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
So if so, you are

66
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
Just like I was

67
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
7 years ago

68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,472
You may be alone and you have no one in your family or relatives who can teach you how

69
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
It actually works with stocks and mutual funds

70
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
The Internet is yours

71
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Best friend

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
And that's why I started saving Cash

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
Because I want to

74
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
That you as a beginner

75
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Be able to find easy to read

76
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
and easy-to-understand information

77
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
And that's why I started with this one

78
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
the youtube channel so we do this in video format

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
So that you will more easily

80
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
Be able to understand how it goes when

81
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
invests their money

82
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
And why it is so incredibly important

83
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,960
I know this might be a little weird video and maybe not usually do but

84
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,824
I just need to say then I need some background on how I actually started

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
To

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
Not everyone is born with the knowledge of investing their money but even if you are a beginner so

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
Will you learn It only takes a little time

88
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
But dare to get started

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
Because otherwise I will never teach you.

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,744
Thank you so much for watching this video I hope to see you in the next one
