1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
Today I will try Sweden's highest paid job with a salary of a breathtaking 30 million a month.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,880
I will also test jobs with salary of 150,000, 75,000 and 40,000.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,200
But we start at the bottom with the job that gives Sweden's lowest monthly salary of 16,000 a month.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,080
Namely babysitter.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
- So tonight I'll work as a babysitter at ...

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,080
... Family Blom!

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,040
Have fun at the restaurant.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,280
- Thanks for that!

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,480
It will probably be nice. Have a good time, small children.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,160
Bye.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,040
- Yes.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,760
And now...

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,760
Now you are my responsibility.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
What do we do now?

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,360
What happens now?

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,400
What do you like to eat?

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
- Mussels and french fries.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,200
- So, Moules Fries?

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
- Yes, it. Yes, I mean moules fries.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,000
- Zacharias, is happy when I mention Moules Fries.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,960
- But the football training, is it soon?

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01.440
–And are you going to football training? –And Olof.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
- Are you twins? - No, this is my friend.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09.600
- You're not Edward Blom's children? How did you get here?

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,160
Me, Olof and Melchior go on football training and you take care of Zacharias.

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,880
- Is it okay for you? -Yes.

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,841
- Zacharias!

28
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,008
- Come on! Now we have to run.

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,120
I will book a taxi now.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,600
Jesper, you are a professor of economics. Why is a babysitter so poorly paid?

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,560
- It probably has the most to do with the fact that there are many who can do the job.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,840
When the range of people who can do something increases, then the salary usually goes down.

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,280
If you look at statistics, there are not many jobs where someone earns under 16,000 a month.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,800
- Then I leave you here. See you later. -Yes.

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Bye!

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,241
-Hello! How nice! And you draw?

37
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56.241
- Or I color.

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59.720
- It sounds almost like you speak Lundensian sometimes.

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01.840
- I'm speaking Scanian.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02.720
-Do you?

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03.560
-Yes.

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,160
- Why?

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05.960
- I do not know.

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,480
- Why do you speak Skåne? It's incredible.

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,080
Because I can't cook and all the least moules fries.

46
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,040
So I called in professional chef Sofia Henriksson, who wanted to come and save me.

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,961
- Mind poor man, you should not cry.

48
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,664
-What? It's just the onion.

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,240
- When you spent time with these scouts, how long did you hang?

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Because I think it is so fascinating that you have learned a whole dialect.

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,400
- We had a dinner there and then we were there playing.

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,680
- And you've learned a whole dialect?

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,520
- How long had you spoken Scanian now?

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,640
- Two to three months.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
- Is it true?

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,360
- Or three to four months.

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
- It's the best I've heard.

58
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,577
- Is it?

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
- I run away with Zacharias.

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
So you can girls take care of the cooking I was saying.

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02.800
You have control over the TV now.

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
- Yes.

63
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07.800
- Do you think we can check out ninja videos for your parents?

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08.800
- Yes.

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
- Are you sure about this?

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Are you absolutely sure?

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Okay.

68
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,400
So they commit the act of violence.

69
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
- Yes.

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
- Yes.

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,200
- Have you asked Edward if we can watch TV now?

72
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
- Yes.

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
- Do you have it?

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
And he said yes.

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
- Yes.

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
- And you called him on your phone.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
- On my toad.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,200
- On your toad you called your dad and he said we can check?

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
- Yes.

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
- Okay.

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Not 100% credible.

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
They drive ...

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
It is violence, it is violent.

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,920
- Yes.

85
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,761
- Is it okay for me to call your dad and just check so you called him?

86
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,356
- No

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,201
- Not call him?

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,480
- Now comes some mussels here. Do you want mussels?

89
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03.840
You like mussels? You are five years old and love mussels.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05.881
- How does the mussels taste the gang?

91
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:07.880
- I forgot to eat them.

92
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,040
- Do you say in a wonderful Scanian.

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,881
- When do you usually go to bed?

94
00:04:13,881 --> 00:04:15,881
-Eight o'clock.

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,840
- It's very much ... you really trust me.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,480
I think I am generous of you.

97
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,520
Cozy, the gang. Then I say good night.

98
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,280
- We thus step up some levels. We will soon test jobs for 75,000, 150,000 and 30 million.

99
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,880
But first we will try a job that is quite accurate on the Swedish average salary around 37,000.

100
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:51,120
- On the average salary we find ordinary professions such as advertisers, painters, aviation technicians and midwives.

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,920
So today I will release a child, what it seems.

102
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01.560
I really don't know who gave me permission for this. But now we drive.

103
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,240
- Many may wonder why not such a socially important job earns more.

104
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:15,000
The simple answer is that there is an established salary level for midwives set based on negotiations between trade unions and employers.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
However, if it would turn out in the long run that not enough people are willing to work to the salary-

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,760
-Then there will be a shortage of midwives and then you will have to increase your salary eventually.

107
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,160
- Hello!

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,240
- Paula huh?

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
- Yes, welcome.

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,320
- Nice. How long have you been working as a midwife?

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,840
- I've worked for 15 years.

112
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
- 15 years. Is it a fun job?

113
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,040
- Great fun.

114
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,840
- It feels incredibly exclusive to be here.

115
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
No one else has been allowed to go in and film here.

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
- But no! Honey, you are first.

117
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47.840
- Am I first, honey?

118
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
- Yes, you are.

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49.840
- How do we start?

120
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
- No, but then, you can take on that.

121
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52.840
- No.

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55.840
- I feel really tagged.

123
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
- Yes, but you should be.

124
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57.840
- Yes.

125
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59.840
- So it might be a little high water.

126
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01.840
No, that will be ...

127
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02.840
- That gets ...?

128
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03.840
- That gets ...

129
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04.840
- Point.

130
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05.840
- Point

131
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08.840
You're not like ...

132
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,780
- huh?

133
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,780
- Schh Schh

134
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
- Should I be quiet?

135
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
- We'll just measure.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
That thing will be good.

137
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
How sweet are you?

138
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Cute!

139
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Come on now we go.

140
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Do you know what to do now?

141
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
- No.

142
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
- We will weigh and measure a baby.

143
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
- huh?

144
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
- Yes.

145
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Come now.

146
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Have you ever kept a newborn baby?

147
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,840
- No, I've never met a newborn child.

148
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,440
- Have you met a child at all?

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,960
- Some have run into over the years.

150
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,120
- run into ...

151
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,320
- But not so small.

152
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,880
- No.

153
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,640
Is it okay for you to come in?

154
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
- Hello!

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,080
- They're not big.

156
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,320
- No.

157
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,240
- So gold.

158
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,800
- You kind of want to eat them.

159
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
51 centimeters.

160
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,440
- 36.5.

161
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,240
I usually say that is a very natural and great size.

162
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06.640
- Yes, it's perfect. You are actually very right in it.

163
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,640
- You may want to lift back and give to mom or dad?

164
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,920
- Are you...?

165
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,880
- It's going great.

166
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,520
- So we lift.

167
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,760
So you can bring her a little so against you.

168
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,000
- Now you should come back.

169
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,160
- Have a good time. Bye.

170
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,680
- I saw you on Youtube.

171
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
- Have you seen me on Youtube?

172
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
- Yes!

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
- Oh she has almost frozen.

174
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,680
- But heard the heart. Now it is like this. This is a birth bed.

175
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,680
So Mauri, now let's see here.

176
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
- What are you tanning about?

177
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Nothing. Do you think you ...

178
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Now I step up behind.

179
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
- Where are we going?

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00.680
Where are we going now?

181
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01.959
- Do not be afraid.

182
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,960
And then relax in your pelvis. Great.

183
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,480
And then we shake a little. Great, giant, giant ...

184
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,240
Now you have to practice a little on how to redeem a child.

185
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,080
She's really busy now.

186
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,160
- It's really like a body.

187
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,400
- You don't have gloves, for fucking.

188
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,080
- I've already poisoned this imaginary mother.

189
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,480
- Now it is starting to press with her.

190
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,320
- Now she feels she wants to poop.

191
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,559
- Bay?

192
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:31,800
- It is an intense feeling of poison.

193
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,920
- Is that what you know?

194
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
- Yes!

195
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,680
- They say so "now it will poop!". No, it's a baby.

196
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,680
- Oh!

197
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,440
- She can continue a bit. Tell her.

198
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,880
- You can continue. Oh!

199
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,080
What am I doing now?

200
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
Breathe! Breathe!

201
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,680
Quiet!

202
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,080
- Hold a hand on your head.

203
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Lift, lift, lift!

204
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
- Hello!

205
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Hello!

206
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Hello Hello hello HELLO!

207
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
- And they scream.

208
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
- Yes exactly.

209
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07.360
Can you scream like the baby?

210
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Calm, calm and nice.

211
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
No, there is no danger.

212
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,960
After that successful effort, Paula felt that I was now ready to participate in a real birth.

213
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,320
- Then we will go in here.

214
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,960
Then it is a caring who is open 5 cm that we should be able to take care of.

215
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
We are responsible, Mauri.

216
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,480
- Especially you.

217
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
- And above all you.

218
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
- Let's go.

219
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
- Hello!

220
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
- Hello!

221
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
- Really nitrous oxide, but she just laughs.

222
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
- Yes, but I know.

223
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
- You get nitrous oxide, is that why you are so happy?

224
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
- Yeah!

225
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,200
- And you should give birth pretty soon?

226
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
- I hope so.

227
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,240
- Paula, how do you make people feel safe in such a situation?

228
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm just trying ...

229
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
- Just think.

230
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Yes, but that is to be present.

231
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
And be like calm.

232
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
- Calm down!

233
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Only nitrous oxide can help you now.

234
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,240
And you have increased the dose three times since I came in.

235
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,240
She just sits and breathes in the square poor man.

236
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
- Do you need something to drink and so?

237
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Or have you got in the jaw and ...

238
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
- I can go to the Press Office.

239
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Do you need something there?

240
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
And you should know about me.

241
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
That if a pregnant woman is in distress-

242
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
-Then there are no heroic deeds.

243
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Big enough for Mauri Hermansson.

244
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
- Hello!

245
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Hello!

246
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
What do you want first?

247
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,240
- Trisslotten.

248
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
- The castle castle first.

249
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,240
You won nothing times one.

250
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,240
- Nothing time a haha.

251
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
- And a little nitrous oxide on it.

252
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
- Oh no.

253
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,240
- They are coming tight now.

254
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,240
- It is starting to feel more and more in the back as well.

255
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
- It may be that he paves his way down.

256
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
- How far is it left in there now?

257
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
- Oh, very difficult to say.

258
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
20 minutes to two hours.

259
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
- What happens now?

260
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,240
- 305! I go and watch. It may be that it is time for a small new world citizen.

261
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,000
- Now it seems that the baby is going on.

262
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,360
And come in here.

263
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,560
Warm welcome to the SM in salary negotiations.

264
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,320
We do this in paid cooperation with the trade union Handels.

265
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Today's competitors are Hugo and Julia who have salary under minimum wage.

266
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,360
There Hugo steps into the office at the manager.

267
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
- A great talent. Birth 02.

268
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,520
- There he asks the question.

269
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,040
- Clearly formulated.

270
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
- The question is out in the air, but the boss gestures denies!

271
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
There will be no increase in salary for Hugo.

272
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,920
- Healthy daring, but not the right tactics.

273
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,240
- Then we will see how it goes for his opponent Julia.

274
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,880
As in this now steps in.

275
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,560
But it will be a no from the manager.

276
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,160
But Julien picks up the phone. What happens?

277
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00.800
- Yes, she calls Handels.

278
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,280
- She calls Handels!

279
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,000
It is a bold move from the young Stockholmer.

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,280
That asks the question again.

281
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07.960
And get a yes from the boss!

282
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,160
And win! Julia wins the SM in salary negotiations and goes out with increased salary!

283
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,680
What was it we just saw?

284
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,560
- As a member of Handels, you get advice and support for salary negotiations.

285
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,000
This is exactly what we saw an example of here today.

286
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
- Sounds like doping?

287
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,720
- No, so everyone who works in stores, in stock, as a hairdresser or in the beauty industry-

288
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,920
-Can join Handels.

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,480
Get advice and support for salary negotiation with your schedule-

290
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,160
-and have trading on your page on work issues.

291
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
- It sounds absolutely fantastic.

292
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,800
Really. And if you become a member today you get a month free with direct debit.

293
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,240
- Do not miss it.

294
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Thanks so much for today.

295
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
- Thanks.

296
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
- Thanks.

297
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,800
It seems that the baby is about to come.

298
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Inside.

299
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,520
- Breathe now.

300
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,120
You press some more.

301
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
And so breathe now.

302
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
And so breathe now.

303
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Breathe breathe breathe.

304
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
- Now comes the baby.

305
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,320
- Where is he? Darling!

306
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Oh, mom!

307
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Darling!

308
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,794
- Suddenly just calls an alarm and now we have a new citizen.

309
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
- Oh God!

310
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
- What day!

311
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
- It's been so cozy to have you here.

312
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
- I'm glad I got to do it with you.

313
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Good!

314
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
- Now you are going home and pulling in.

315
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
At least three reds.

316
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
- Oh damn what a good thing!

317
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Yes easy.

318
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
- Four?

319
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
- No, then I will be giant choir and fall asleep.

320
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Three.

321
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
- Three.

322
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
- So you are among friends. We are friends now.

323
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
- Are we?

324
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
- Yes.

325
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,520
It is us.

326
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,520
- Damn what fun. What a good news.

327
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
- It sure is!

328
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
- Yes.

329
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,520
And as new friends, Paula and I went and some of the other midwives on a little AW.

330
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,520
If one day I become a dad, I already know who the midwife should be.

331
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,920
A blonde, wonderful girl who laughs a lot and makes bad imitations of babies.

332
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,720
However, we will continue to the next job of 75,000 in monthly salary.

333
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,320
A profession that requires tremendous responsibility but also high intelligence and simultaneous ability.

334
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09.920
It is a responsible job. It requires education and that education is quite demanding.

335
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,520
At the same time, it is a pretty niche job.

336
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,600
There is a fairly small group of people who can be considered.

337
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
They require specialized education and then the salary becomes high.

338
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,800
If you have ever been to an airplane, your life has been in their hands.

339
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
It should be about ...

340
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,840
- Airman!

341
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,640
Those who sit up there and direct the flights.

342
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,560
- These are some of the best paid in this country.

343
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,280
And I have been given an exclusive opportunity to work there today.

344
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,160
And now we stand here with Cornelia.

345
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,440
Up there you sit in the days.

346
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,520
And have so much responsibility.

347
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,320
- Yes I have.

348
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,520
You have an average salary of 70 to 75,000.

349
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,600
And the more I read about your job, the more I realize how difficult the job is.

350
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,480
- The idea is that you should not be able to train it, but that you should have it naturally.

351
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,080
So you do the tests once, you can't, then ...

352
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,480
- So you have a chance to become an air traffic controller?

353
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
So, you are the elite.

354
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,120
This is going to be fun.

355
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,520
I think we are going in and soon we will be up there.

356
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,760
- Before we go up, I think we should go to the simulator.

357
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,720
Then you get to test a little yourself what it is like to work.

358
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,080
We have some colleagues who sit in there and are pilots for us.

359
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
- Now we should be clarified to the viewers. So now we sit in the simulator.

360
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,520
Soon we will be up there for real. Of course, I must not land a plane myself.

361
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,240
You are not so nice.

362
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,600
- Good morning, Scandinavian 007. ESTABLISHED ON ILS. Runway, 01 left.

363
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,120
- Now someone is talking.

364
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,880
- He does not respond.

365
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,360
- Arlanda Tower, good morning. Scandinavian of N0007. Established on ils. Runway 01 Left.

366
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,320
- Hello, where are you going? Is arlanda here?

367
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48.560
- Scandinavia N0007, Say Again Please.

368
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,840
- Is he not sure what this air tower is doing right now?

369
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,120
- Approximately. Had this been the reality, they would probably have called later and asked what was happening.

370
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,640
- Is that so?

371
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,360
- Yes, yes, but they had.

372
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,800
- Tower Good Morning Air France 2063. Ils, Runway 01 Left.

373
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02.800
- So send it first.

374
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,120
- I love that he who is a pilot also offers some dialects.

375
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,280
Now he was French. Are you from French?

376
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,200
- oui, oui. We from from France.

377
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,840
- You from France!

378
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,400
- Scandinacia 2293, Yankee 6.

379
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,000
We have some problems with our landing gear. We are unnable to vacate the runway.

380
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,840
- huh? Is it dangerous?

381
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,400
- Yes, because then he stands on the track.

382
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,560
They don't have a lot of patience, pilots either.

383
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,720
- Scandinavia 006.

384
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,520
In sequence.

385
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,280
- Line up runway zero.

386
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,840
- Line Up, Line Away Zero, Left Turn Departure.

387
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,800
- No not yet. You can't start it because you have an airplane in front.

388
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,520
- Now he goes!?

389
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,120
- Yes, now it is very serious here.

390
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,680
- No, no, no, no, no, no! What is he doing?

391
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
- And you see that now you have one on the track too so now you have to ...

392
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
- Do not escape!

393
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,880
Scandinavian 006, do not fly!

394
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,280
No, no, no, no, no! Look at them!

395
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,560
There it is. No!

396
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:01,519
- Scandinavian 545 What Happened there?

397
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,278
- ehh you just crashed ...

398
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:05.751
- Oh

399
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08.001
- Hahah, oh.

400
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,260
Hello? Now they have stopped talking now are they gone or? They are dead?

401
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,900
- Ah but exactly. Unfortunately.

402
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,000
- Tower from Nordica 448, Can We Land Please?

403
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,600
- We are in a time of grief in the tower.

404
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Two planes just crashed and it is on me.

405
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,760
SP Please give me a moment to breathe, hello?

406
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,161
- Now the pilot does not know at all what to do.

407
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:35.570
- No, but he has to wait now.

408
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,960
Now I have found Frank who played pilot. You were very capable in French.

409
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,520
- Bonjour, Madame.

410
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,600
- Then you were German.

411
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,960
- Hallå, Luft Hansa. ESTABLISHED ILS 01 Left.

412
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,479
- And then came a Danish plan.

413
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,280
Yes the Established 01 Left.

414
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,201
- You were great!

415
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,273
- You were okay too.

416
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,800
- Thanks.

417
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,680
Now we are going up to the highest tower.

418
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,280
Up there now I have to calm myself down a bit.

419
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,040
- You talk calmly and quietly. You have a calm atmosphere.

420
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,240
- Welcome up the tower. - Jär.

421
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Mm.

422
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,440
- A kind of devotibility that prevails here.

423
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,040
- It's a little respect when you get up here. It is a calm that you come up to.

424
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
- Then you should now solve this guy?

425
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
- Exactly.

426
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
- I keep track of everything she takes over.

427
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,240
- I also have control so it goes right.

428
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,640
Now we stand here with Navid. You are a colleague of Cornelia.

429
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
- Yes it is true.

430
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,440
- It went as fast as we had been around all day and now she is just gone.

431
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,840
Don't even look at me anymore.

432
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,400
- You have to change quickly as an air traffic controller and get into your role.

433
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,200
She is responsible for all landings and is currently starting at Arlanda Airport.

434
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,160
- Is she? All the plans that start and land?

435
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Is it the girl who is in control of?

436
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
- That's right.

437
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06.600
- Lufthansa 1, Victor, November, Good Day, Wind 050 Degrees, 7 Knots, Runway 08, Left Hand Departure, Cleared for Takeoff.

438
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,360
- And now you should start working too and I have no longer anyone to talk to.

439
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,880
- No.

440
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,720
- So now I think I wish for the best of luck on your work day.

441
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,039
- Thank you for coming. Fun to have you here.

442
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:19,440
-Same. Or how is it?

443
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,201
- Can I wave goodbye to people?

444
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:23,201
- Yes, you get to wave.

445
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,120
Soon it is time to work with one of the richest people in the Nordic region.

446
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,320
But first we will visit a job with a monthly salary around 150,000.

447
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,440
At this level over 100,000, there is only one percent of Sweden's population -

448
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,240
-As you earn more than that. It is CEO, there are bank officials and a 19-year-old in Liljeholmen-

449
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,040
-As a few hours a day sits with his computer.

450
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:02.040
So this guy is called Neo. That you have been surrounded by a guy named Neo in this team.

451
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
So then you start to grow old.

452
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Hello!

453
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
- Well, neo. Nice.

454
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,040
- Mauri! Nice!

455
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
- Welcome.

456
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,960
- There are very few people who make so much money.

457
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,480
The reason for this is that he has found a gap in the system.

458
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,840
This does not contribute to anything in the social economy.

459
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,440
He makes money on a miscalculation.

460
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,400
–And this is it lives? - This is I live.

461
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,200
- So here it has looked. - And about what do you earn for a month?

462
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,240
- 150 ish.

463
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,640
- On sitting like that in your soft pants and just chilling.

464
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,600
- Short break for professions that earn worse than Neo.

465
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,920
Specialist doctors, managers within bank, managers in insurance,-

466
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,840
-Pilotes, brokers, ministers in the Swedish government ...

467
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
- It doesn't feel great.

468
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56.801
- Why doesn't it feel good?

469
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58.560
- Then it feels wrong in some way.

470
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,640
- No, do you get a bad conscience?

471
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04.560
- Here I sit and what do I do? I don't even have a high school diploma.

472
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09.840
- Now you are curious about exactly what you do.

473
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,480
- Bets on sports.

474
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,680
- But you don't play the same way people usually do.

475
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,840
That kind of gaming is idiotic and stupid.

476
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,640
- I'm looking at numbers. I don't bet on sports in principle.

477
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,160
- What neo does in a way has nothing to do with sports betting.

478
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,200
Without it is a complicated system that calculates the gaming companies' too high odds.

479
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,680
Neo tried to explain everything to me and used words like ...

480
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:48,680
I took about nothing, but now one of his bottoms has calculated that he will play on away profits in a second league in the Ivory Coast.

481
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
- Racing Club D'Abidjan

482
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
What do you want to put?

483
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
It's your money.

484
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
No, I'm just joking.

485
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,680
- But okay, and what should I put on this match then?

486
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
- Run 1500.

487
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,680
- What do the gaming companies think that you are constantly winning them?

488
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,320
- They don't like it. When you win, you become limited to minimum operations.

489
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,520
- But they do not shut down people who lose.

490
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,440
- No, that's why they are so damn disgusting.

491
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,000
So they are completely protected to do what the hell they want in principle.

492
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,240
- You become like a hero now for me.

493
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
After all, you take from the most evidence we have in society.

494
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,360
And you should have that thanks for that.

495
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,160
- Yes, but thank you. It warms, it does.

496
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,360
- And this is like an office.

497
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,720
Do you have breaks on your job? Can you take a coffee break?

498
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,080
- Absolutely. Shall we take a tea?

499
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,840
- Okay, a little coffee at Neo's job.

500
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
- Exactly.

501
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45.560
- You had a daim and tea, and the money just rolls into the accounts.

502
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,800
- It's a bit aggressive, but something in that style.

503
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,680
- But then we pull in.

504
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,440
Yes.

505
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,520
- Should I Go?

506
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,120
- And then it was time to look at who it was?

507
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,720
- Stade d'abidjan against Racing Club D'Abidjan.

508
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,320
The Racing Club D'A Abidjan you have played on here.

509
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
- It's a goal!

510
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
QUE GOLAZO!

511
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,320
1-0.

512
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Now we are well on our way.

513
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
- Who scored goals?

514
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,720
- We of course. Why do you think I'm celebrating?

515
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,920
Do you think I would celebrate if we let in?

516
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,520
- Then you have won the odds it looks now?

517
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,720
- If it lasts, yes exactly.

518
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,560
- This is just one of all the games you put.

519
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,320
I wanted to check out my own match.

520
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:35,200
Still, I think the wicked in watching the Ivorian league in football.

521
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
Nice.

522
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,641
- Otherwise, maybe.

523
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:41,760
- Thanks for spending an afternoon with you.

524
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,040
-Thanks. It was nice.

525
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,920
- The same

526
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,600
And with it is time to test the job at the top of the list.

527
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,600
- We should not meet anyone. We will meet one of those who make the most money in the entire Nordic region.

528
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Right now he is probably sitting at the top up there in his office and making huge sums of money.

529
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Thus in real time. They just come, they come, they come.

530
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
We will meet Petter Stordalen.

531
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
And here somewhere he will sit in his office.

532
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Look at that rich, rich man.

533
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
- There comes the star.

534
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,067
- There comes the star.

535
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Hello!

536
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Here we have him, multimillionaire Petter Stordalen.

537
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Which has built a global empire with 25,000 employees and 226 hotels around the Nordic countries.

538
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,440
He is valued at SEK 25 billion.

539
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,600
Which would mean an average salary of 69 million a month over 30 years.

540
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,640
But really, you can't count in his case.

541
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,200
- Those who earn the most in society do not make their money on salary.

542
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,800
They own companies that they participate in and develop.

543
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,040
If the company goes well, the company increases in value.

544
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,320
Then there is more money for them to collect in the company.

545
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09.600
- Mauri?

546
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
- Petter?

547
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,560
- You are one of those who earn best in the Nordic countries.

548
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,480
What do you do at work when you earn best in the Nordic countries?

549
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,160
- I'll show a thing.

550
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,960
- Are you going to show me something?

551
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,480
- Yes, I'll show something.

552
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,720
- You then get a document every morning on how the hotels have gone the day before.

553
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,200
- Yes.

554
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,600
- And there you see this ...

555
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,000
In Milan it was 100% fully occupied.

556
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,680
- Milan?

557
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,360
- It's Clarion Arlanda.

558
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,880
We jump a little back and forth in time.

559
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,480
We take care of it. You just need to go with.

560
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,960
Don't be afraid, Petter. No problem.

561
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45.560
- It is very good that you tell me ...

562
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,240
You are 27 years old and tell me that I'm not afraid.

563
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,840
As if this was my first rodeo.

564
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,800
- You invite you to get a little bus with you.

565
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,880
- I love it. I have no restrictions.

566
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,280
- No, it feels so.

567
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,000
- You can't resent me.

568
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,520
-Can not I? - No, it's not possible.

569
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,160
- Should I test? -Yes.

570
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09.080
- How is the weather down there? -It is quite good.

571
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,321
- It doesn't feel like I would go for me to make you sad.

572
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:15,200
- I cry lightly but it is for completely different reasons.

573
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,561
I can cry when I look at Love Actually.

574
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:19,561
- How many times have you seen it?

575
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,361
- Maybe ten.

576
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:23,361
- It's nine times too much.

577
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,161
–Wa? One of the world's best movies.

578
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,717
- Hahaha Petter.

579
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,440
With all respect, it is definitely not one of the world's best films.

580
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,880
- Then you come up with these Godfather and ...

581
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,480
- I think there are maybe a thousand movies that are better than Love Actually.

582
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,680
- huh?

583
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
- Yes!

584
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,480
Didn't you know about it? I can show you later.

585
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,080
- No.

586
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,800
- Love Actually. The world's best film of all time.

587
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,080
- Because ... but what?

588
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:56,880
Then the darkness lay over Gothenburg where Petter would inaugurate his new hotel Draken.

589
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00.800
- And we will be able to follow your entire work day tomorrow.

590
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02.800
- Completely to the dragon wakes up.

591
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
- Yes, I look forward to that.

592
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
- Yes me too.

593
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08.800
Sleep now.

594
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Sleep well, Mauri.

595
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
- Thanks, Petter.

596
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
And sleep well I did.

597
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
For exactly four hours.

598
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
- Good morning.

599
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Do you have a good morning?

600
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
- Fantastic.

601
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:36,080
- How can you be 60 years old? It is almost provocative to see your tight ass lie there five meters in front of me.

602
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,740
- Come on!

603
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,220
- Silent!

604
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,254
- Mauri?

605
00:28:53,254 --> 00:28:55,254
It is not possible.

606
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:59,694
But where is he? But did he really go back to the hotel?

607
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:03,734
He looks stronger than he is.

608
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:06.814
He has a great potential for improvement.

609
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:13,798
- Where have you been my friend?

610
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:16,438
- How fast you were, have you already eaten?

611
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:18,638
- Yes but, how difficult can it be to shower?

612
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:19,998
Turn on the shower,-

613
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
-washing hair, finished, out.

614
00:29:22,118 --> 00:29:22,879
- What does your schedule look like?

615
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,919
So how tight it is?

616
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:25,959
Oh!

617
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,959
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

618
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,559
Is it just today still?

619
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,120
- Yes.

620
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,399
- So the plan today, is it to inaugurate this new hotel in Gothenburg?

621
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,120
- Yes.

622
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
- And now you just go out and do a lot of pressure?

623
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,320
- Yes, should you keep up?

624
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,200
- All day!

625
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,240
- Take a puddle, stove puddle.

626
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,240
- It's no stress?

627
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,240
Then a ridiculously hectic morning began to shark up tonight's hotel inauguration.

628
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,880
Interview after interview on a running band with a 60 year old Norwegian who never seems to be tired.

629
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,320
- How many cups will there be in one day? So coffee.

630
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,680
- Ten maybe.

631
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
- Ten?

632
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
- Yes.

633
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,680
- How many do you drink?

634
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
- One.

635
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
- One?

636
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09.680
- Yes.

637
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,680
- There are few people who can be so scornful against one without having to say anything.

638
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Then a few more interviews before it was time to return home for lunch.

639
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:28,919
- Yes you can take one with you, it is for you.

640
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,760
- So is it just taking?

641
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,280
- Yes it's free.

642
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34.560
- Do you have more stuff here? What is included?

643
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,160
- The primary that it should take me from point A to point B.

644
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,080
That is the idea of a car.

645
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,641
-Are you mad?

646
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:43,738
-I'm happy.

647
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,120
- Now it's time for lunch with Petter Great Love Märta.

648
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,680
You have to be so tired of the question. But you have an unusually large age difference?

649
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
- 27 years.

650
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,480
- I had nothing more about it. It was just a listing.

651
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,360
- We note it.

652
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,000
- Take it with us.

653
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,840
- Think about it in the future.

654
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,720
- We bring this.

655
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,041
- Do you have more notes?

656
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,041
- No, I was probably done there.

657
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,760
- It is good.

658
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,280
- What is difficult ... what should you do if you fall in love?

659
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:34,720
I'm hugely in love. Just wake up and turn around, Märta is there.

660
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,320
It makes me happy. I am happy in myself.

661
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,280
- It feels so cozy to have a Petter Stordalen in his house, which goes around there.

662
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,120
You can pat a little, give him some macaroni and so he is happy.

663
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,400
- He's very cute. I often say that you are so cute. But I must not say that public.

664
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,840
He does not want to, because it is not so male.

665
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,320
- I would say you are cute.

666
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02.600
You're actually.

667
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05.921
- And then he should always tension when taking.

668
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:07.760
- Yes now he spans

669
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,040
- Märta, it's a little difficult to get a grip on exactly what his job is.

670
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,520
How would you describe it?

671
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,600
- I have no idea. He goes out through the door and comes back.

672
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,560
- He comes back with a bag of new money and puts in the porch.

673
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,880
- And then I sit like the mick in the sun side and fire them.

674
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,160
- It feels like you've just seen and heard how things are going so well for you.

675
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,720
Is there anything you are bad at? I want to see you fail.

676
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,640
- There are so many things I'm bad at. It is completely inconceivable.

677
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,440
But when I sit here and look at the painting there so draw and paint ...

678
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,400
I'm disastrously bad at that.

679
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53.041
- Do you push to do something you are bad at?

680
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,712
- I think is very fun.

681
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58.841
- Yes damn how should we save this?

682
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:01,276
- I hope so much.

683
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04.080
That yours becomes completely useless.

684
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,321
- Are you artistically placed, Petter?

685
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07.481
- Absolutely!

686
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,520
- Are you? But are you good at painting now?

687
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,440
You said you were not good. If you are good at this too ...

688
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,440
- With that I haven't said, I think, I took a painting course in Italy.

689
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,440
In what is called act painting in Norwegian.

690
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,201
- What have you gone for a three -week crocial painting course?

691
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:28,121
- Yes

692
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,560
- But the point here was that you would be bad at something.

693
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,240
Have you attended three weeks of training at Kroki in Italy?

694
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,241
- Now I'm mad at you ...

695
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:41,880
- Why?

696
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,600
- You're so fucking cocky now over there.

697
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,640
- Now I am ready.

698
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,282
- Okay, you're totally useless.

699
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:55,270
- But you thought I had been on such a course for three weeks in Italy?

700
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,722
You believed in it?

701
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:57,757
- I believed in it!

702
00:33:57,757 --> 00:33:59,929
- But why did you write fuck you, Petter?

703
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,960
- It was because I was so angry with you. When I thought you had been on a crockery course.

704
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07.840
I was really irritated.

705
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,120
- Great!

706
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09.880
It is very good.

707
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,480
I still want to say that I think yours is much better than mine.

708
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,920
- Thanks.

709
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,400
- But that's one thing I'm damn good at.

710
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,280
And that is to go on styls.

711
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,960
- huh?

712
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,600
- Walking on styls.

713
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,120
- Do we have styls?

714
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,520
Should we?

715
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Should we? Come!

716
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,280
- It feels like I can see the psychological reason why you like to walk on stilts.

717
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,680
- Why?

718
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,360
Oh no!

719
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,760
It was a blow under the belt.

720
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
- Was it?

721
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,600
And now it was time for the big inauguration of Petter's new hotels.

722
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,240
A grand show had been prepared for hundreds of invited guests.

723
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,640
But first Petter would go on the red carpet.

724
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,760
And he did it with a pale rush close behind.

725
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,120
- What should I say to pepper? What can I help you with?

726
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01.600
- You sat on the rope, what did you think?

727
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,240
- When you start driving it there, the second part of the song.

728
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,720
Then it's kind of goose bumps. And I mean it.

729
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
You are amazing.

730
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Out and do your thing.

731
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,440
When Petter goes out on a stage and gives speeches, he is not like everyone else.

732
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,600
- Here we are 2023!

733
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
In the city I love!

734
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,200
Gothenburg!

735
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,600
Glenn Stordalen is back, and he promises you ...

736
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Party in this city!

737
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Party in Gothenburg!

738
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Have just started!

739
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,200
Yes there is something about this guy.

740
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,800
First of all, he is probably not a hotel owner or CEO.

741
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,400
He is a seller.

742
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,800
Petter Stordalen could have been able to sell syphilis to you and you had still bought it.

743
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02.840
Above all, he is actually extremely charming, curious and in the name of honesty very cute.

744
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:09,160
He is also good at his job, however, it seems at least as strenuous and demanding to be a babysitter or midwife.

745
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Although they get about 2300 times less paid.
