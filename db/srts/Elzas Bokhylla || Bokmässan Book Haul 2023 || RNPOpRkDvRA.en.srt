00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi, Elza here from Elzas Bookshelf. I've been to the book fair and I've gone bananas. I have bought, I don't know, let me check, nine books.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's been a long time since I bought this many books. I think it's to compensate for being in a reading slump, because I console myself by buying books.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You know that buying books and reading books are two completely different hobbies and I love them both equally and I have them equally.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But now I'm going to show you the books I found at the book fair and it's a lot, so we'll get started at once.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The first book is a non-fiction that I have wanted to read for a long time and the author was standing there, I said hello and asked if I could have it signed and of course she did.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm talking about Mammorna by Alexandra Pascalidou. Very nice like that, the whole page. It was really nice to talk to her, really cool.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
She just came out with Papporna but I haven't read Mammorna yet so I thought I would.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I know it's available as an audiobook too but this is a paperback so it can be quite nice but it feels very good to own it.

9
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:26,505
I feel like I'm in a period where I'm starting to get hungry and glances at non-fiction.

10
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:36,000
So the second book I'm going to show is a book that I got because I bought the gold card and then you got a goody bag and in it there was a book.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a book that I've seen a bit everywhere, Songbirds by Christy Leftery nominated in 2022 for Årets Bok.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't really know what it's about. It's super nice anyway.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I haven't read, I know she has another book too which was pretty popular too. I have seen it here and there on bookstagram and on booktube.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I haven't read anything by her. I think this is so pretty so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it in the bag.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've said that I've kind of finished with Swedish detective story, but it's a writer that I...

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't follow many authors on Instagram, but I do follow her and I'm very curious about her books.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So I saw this and thought, okay, I'll give it a shot.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm talking about Anna Bågstam, Eyewitness.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is the first book in her series. I don't know, Brutal murder, Öresund.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It is a fast-paced and exciting detective story that takes place in the Öresund region.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Harriet.

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Honestly, this sounds like a classic Swedish detective story that I'm done with.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Like I don't want anything more and read anything more.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But, but, I like the author and I've only heard good things about this one.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So me and Swedish detective story are on a break but we are starting to flirting with each other again.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes, me and Anna.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then a book that I was overjoyed to see.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And there was no doubt that it would come home with me.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A short one, which I have seen a little here and there.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But as my favorite booktuber Books with Emily Fox.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She raves about this book, she thinks it's amazing.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I'm really curious about it.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I Who Have Never Known Men by Jacqueline Harpman.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Harpman maybe.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And this is apparently supposed to be some kind of dystopia, perhaps.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There are several women who are locked in the basement.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And then a lot of things happen.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Apparently you shouldn't know much more about this book than that.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That it should perhaps have some feminist touch, as socially critical in that way.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In addition to being insanely good-looking, it's cool.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And I've heard her rave about this book.

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So I think I have to give her a chance.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And it sounds like a book I would like.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,095
And I love it when people say they "you shouldn't know much about this book, Just know this and read".

45
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:28,000
Then I immediately become curious and gladly pick it up.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So this one had to come home with me.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I have a relatively new favorite author and horror.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And I've read a book by her, which I raved about a lot on this channel.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And then I read a collection of short stories.

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then I found another collection of short stories that I haven't read.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm talking about Mariana Enriquez and The Danger of Smoking in Bed.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
A small collection of short stories.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Maria Enriquez is the one who wrote Our share night.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I love that book.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The horror that is so fantastic.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh how good it is.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh my god it's so good.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I recommend everyone to read it, of course.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Although those who don't like horror can probably appreciate this one.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But it is incredibly unpleasant.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Trigger warning for a little most of the time.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But it is so, so well written and so good.

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And I have read a collection of short stories by her.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And now I own this one too.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The one I read was Things We Lost in the Fire.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And it is available in Swedish.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Things we lose in the fire, I think it's called in Swedish.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't know if this one is available in Swedish.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But I have it in English and I probably want to buy the other one as well.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The other short story collection that looks a bit like this one.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Fantastic.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm so excited for this one.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A bit nervous.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But I love Mariana Enriquez's way of writing.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And her way of setting the mood for things.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,252
I love her.

78
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:03,000
The second book I bought was also a bit of a gamble.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But I've seen it everywhere and want to read it.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I've been like this, should I, shouldn't I, shouldn't I.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But of course I will.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We are talking about The Seven Moons by Maali Almeida.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Shall we see.

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I apologize so terribly for butchering this name.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Fantastic name.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I apologize so terribly.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
At least this one.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Look how beautiful it is.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Look how beautiful it is.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And this is such a typical trope that I like.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We get to go with Maali.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I imagine this person dies pretty brutally.

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But ends up in the afterlife.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And there this person has, Maali has seven months.

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Seven days, seven months to go.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
To sort of get along with the people she loves the most.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He loves the most, I even think.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And yes, it is vague.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
As you know, vaguely.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think that's what it's about.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I read the back a little quickly.

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Got such a good feeling.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Magic realism.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The afterlife.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Feeling.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And thought that this was a book for me.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll take a chances.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then it says here that it's a book.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The Book Pricer 2022.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So this one won.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Book Pricer.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The price until 2022.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So why.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So why not anyway.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then check.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean check.

117
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,000
Another gamble

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A book that I thought sounded so funny.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I don't know.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I've said that I don't like cozy books.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,890
But I have started to like them, a little.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
At least this year.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So I found a book that seemed really cozy and great fun.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And it's called

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The Cat Who Caught a Killer.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
By LT Shearer.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know much more than that.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We are allowed to accompany a woman.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In all cases.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
A cat helps a woman solve a murder.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I mean the title says it all doesn't it.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So I think so.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think it looks so cozy.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And I enjoy reading.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Books with animals that.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Which has like one.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
At least animals I like.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And cats are cozy, I think.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I am both a cat and dog person.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And of course.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Must try.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay next book.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I bought for two reasons.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I like the idea itself.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The title itself.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You will understand.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And.

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The cover.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Look.

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
at this cover.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I died.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's how pretty it is.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Axie Oh.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh maybe.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Axie Oh.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Perhaps.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Sorry.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, I don't know anything about this book.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's fantasy.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,530
I hope it.

162
00:09:07,722 --> 00:09:10,000
You see some fish and whales.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Here are some whales.

164
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,492
another whale

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I mean, I'm already lost there.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,707
It feels like she's going to fall into the sea.

167
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:23,000
About the sea.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I do not know.

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It sounds like that.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll take a chance.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,353
Look how beautiful it is.

172
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,000
It's at that level.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I actually don't really know what this is about.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,637
More than that it is very stylish and I think it attracts me.

175
00:09:35,637 --> 00:09:40,890
A thing I don't like is that, Back text.

176
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,520
When it's just lots of quotes from people who like it. But what is it about? I do not know.

177
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:52,416
It says beautiful, she says this. Enchanting says this one.Tale of blah blah says this one.

178
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:58,734
But for me...What does it mean? And that's all it says. Don't chase fate. Let fate chase you.

179
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,712
What does it mean? Where are we anywhere in this story? Who is it about?

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,558
Who is it about? What happens? What should we solve? I do not know anything.

181
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:10,000
And it says nothing.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It says nothing.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And then you have to browse somewhere.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And find either the back or the front.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It says a lot of things.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But like I said, I don't know.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I do not care.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It is good looking.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The look attracts me.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It had to come home with me.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So.

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why do I have to explain myself?

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why do I buy books?

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,580
I bought it. It was nice. Let me be.

196
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:37,912
I have a another non-fiction that I really want to read and am curious about.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It is the Kurdspåret by Joakim Medin.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Sweden, Turkey and the price of NATO membership.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This whole NATO process when Sweden wants to join NATO and Turkey makes demands and says they have to extradite some of our citizens.

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And what happens there.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I am very curious about this.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
How could we do that?

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I thought better of us.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Sweden.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I just think this seems so interesting.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There is so much going on.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And I haven't heard much about this.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And he's dug into this.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The journalist.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So I got curious and thought I'd learn a little.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Just a little general education.

212
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,551
So listen.

213
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:25,000
There were quite a few books.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,833
I am super excited to read all of these and also very curious to read them.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And of course I'm curious about which of these books you like.

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Which ones are you curious about?

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Which ones have you read?

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And what do you think of them?

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Help me somehow find a way in.

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Which one should I start.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Figured I might show them off too.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So here you have them.

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I am of course, as usual, very curious about what you think of them here.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And if you have read any of them.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
See you in the comments section.

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
See you next Monday.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't forget to give me a thumbs up and feel free to subscribe to my channel.

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If you don't already.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Farewell.

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Bye!
