00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.040
C. Head Tapers!
 It is the duty of the parents.

Nämen ... I thought you had thrown the hippie jacket.

148
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:40.280
The C. Head talk is not a hippie jacket, C. The head talk is a wilderness garment!

149
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.480
- What do you have there?
 C. Head talk - Harpunen.

150
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.080
- I have food with.
 C. Head talk - think about a wolf!

151
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.880
Then we run!
 Was Petterson disappointed when we didn't take Styrbjörn?

152
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.960
C. Head talk - yes.
 He had intended to invite people home.
 - Now it's just us.

153
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.960
- It's like a second honeymoon.
 C. Head talkative - TrDe.

154
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.560
I don't count your aunt's hospital.

155
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:20.600
C. Huvudpratarevi got a weekend in Nässjö.
 C. Head talk and hospital food is not so stupid.

156
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.560
C. Head Tapers - Hi, Gubben!
 Are you going to ballet?
 - There will be no ballet.

157
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:35.520
Sofia is over.
 I'm going anyway.
 I go up and pack.

158
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:41.120
C. Head talk we directly stick C. Head talkatives he does not mark anything.

159
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.160
Max, stay.

160
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:53.680
-Is it safe?
 Why is it over?
 - She didn't sit with me in the dining room.

161
00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:00.560
C. Head talkative - usch then.
 What kind of food was that?
 - Max, tell us what happened.

162
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:09.120
Do not know.
 She said I was not allowed to go to the ballet and then we became enemies.

163
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.520
She might just be nervous about what you think.

164
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:22.320
C. Head talk here ... Mom is right.
 C. Head talk women can be so sometimes.

165
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.920
C. Head talk, you can almost believe C. Head talk they are stupid in the head ...

166
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.520
Sofia is good much smarter than you!

167
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:39.680
C. Head talk, I didn't mean that.
 C. Head talk outline now.

168
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.480
C. Head talkreSofia likes you.
 And then C. Head talk, you are afraid to do away with it.

169
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.200
C. Head talk can be made C. Head talkative against what you feel.

170
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:58.200
C. Head talk - man becomes uncertain and ... cursed.
 -Why?

171
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.800
C. Head talk of you ask!
 You do well ...

172
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.480
C. Head Tapers - Lena!
 - I would rather go with you to the cottage.

173
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.480
C. Head talk - There are fun things to do here.
 -Like what?

174
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:21.480
C. Head talkative - Puzzle you got from Grandma ... - Don't you want me to come along?

175
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.280
C. Head Taper Want Having the computer game ...?

176
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.160
Sofie will be very happy if you come.

177
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.080
-What did you do?
 - I called her.

178
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.800
It was as I suspected.
 She was nervous.

179
00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.800
- I invited her here for dinner ... C. Head talk - then so ... should we go?

180
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:55.400
- Be kind to Göran and Annika.
 C. Head talk - hold an eye on Lina and Marcus.

181
00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.400
C. Head talk - then we can talk about the computer game ... - kiss.

182
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.560
- Ni is the world's best parents.
 C. Head talk - What did you say?

183
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.160
You only say that one.
 Bye!

184
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.960
Oh ... now it is napping again.
 How exiting!

185
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:28.920
Oo!
 Nämen ... a tablet box!
 What it will be good!

186
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:36.120
- Something who wants to see if it paces?
 - Can you be silent, we watch TV.

187
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:43.640
- Pour the candy in a bowl.
 - What you are boring!
 - Start.

188
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.960
Immediately?
 Certainly.

189
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:54.200
-What should we do now?
 - Is it going night train to mom and dad?

190
00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:01.240
How fun it was to see the ballet.
 It was really ... different.

191
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:08.520
- Wasn't it boring then?
 - Lite eventless.
 What was its name?

192
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.320
"Sleeping stones" ...

193
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:19.920
- Tight to stand still for four hours!
 –Okay ... Time for tonight's highlight.

194
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.720
- Should you go home?
 -No.

195
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:30.040
- Do you know what this is?
 - A magic box, I'm afraid.

196
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.240
-Right!
 Do you know what this is?
 - A magic wand.

197
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.200
You are welcome.
 - I wanted to become the world's best magician.

198
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.920
- You became the worst in the world.
 - What should I conjure away?

199
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:59.120
-Yourself.
 -Come on!
 It's great fun.

200
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:04.120
I think we are too old for this.

201
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:11.320
We intend to make it nice for you, whether you want to or not!

202
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.880
- Can we not watch video?
 - You had a movie.

203
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.880
Yes, a romantic comedy ...

204
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.880
- "The avenger from hell."
 - You can't see!

205
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:34.400
I know, we have a disco!
 - Get our plates, and I'll clear away here.

206
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:42.000
-What then?
 Should I stop trolling?
 - This is needed!
 Chips and juice!

207
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.080
Dad!
 Tell Göran and Annika to go home.

208
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.440
- What are you doing at home already?
 C. Head talk - What do you mean?

209
00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
- You would come tomorrow night.
 C. Head talk - a day here or there ... it was enough.

210
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.600
I have to correct you.
 The line next to the cottage meant rail!

211
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:17.840
- The train passed by every five minutes!
 - Why didn't Pettersson have said anything?

212
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.640
The C. Head talkum we will find out.
 We are going to fix the C. Head talkative anesthesia gun for Styrbjörn ...
