1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,920
He can take over the Wagner Group after Prigozjin's death.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08.640
And Ukrainian drone attacks deep into Russia.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,720
New images show a rare insight into Mariupol.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,360
What does life look like behind the Russian occupation?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,320
A classic trick used at Stalin era when moving whole people.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,640
This is the war of the week -

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,480
- As every week, the latest news development in the Ukraine War deepens.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Here, Ukrainian drones fly over the Russian city of Smolensk -

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,480
- Cirka 30 miles from the Ukrainian border.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,560
Ukraine has recently invested in drone attacks on various goals in Russia.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,120
Many drones are built on your own. It is its own production.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59.040
The most important thing for the allies is -

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,320
- You don't use weapons that come from the Allies.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08.640
This is because Russia should not be able to say: "Now NATO shoots Russia."

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,840
It could lead to an escalation in the war.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,440
We move to the front, where there have been news in recent weeks -

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,360
- From the parts where Ukraine previously had success.

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,040
If you zoom out, it looks like it is pretty still at the front.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,680
At the same time, we have known that this is an offensive that will take a long time.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,760
It cannot be compared to previous offensives-

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,960
- There you quickly regain, for example. The chermen or the charkiv region.

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,440
Here Russia has had months of preparation for themselves -

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,360
- To build up their line of defense.

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,840
Along the eastern parts of the front -

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,480
- If Russian forces have been on the offensive lately.

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,280
SVT's team visited a mobile health center near the front during the week.

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:07.800
We hear that the Russians have increased the pressure here. The Ukrainians are pressed over here in the east.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,760
But the pressure is also hard here - at the small mobile health center.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,400
Everything works perfectly until the Russian terror begins again.

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,920
