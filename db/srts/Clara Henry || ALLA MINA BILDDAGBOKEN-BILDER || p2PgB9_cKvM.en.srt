1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,620
Hey!

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,640
Guess what I've done? I've downloaded all my old pictures from Bilddagboken ("Photo Diary"). ALL OF THEM.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,660
Holy ...

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,540
... cow.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,220
Sorry in advance that the lighting is shifting, there's a lot of cloud and sun going on.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,180
Those of you who are around my age, I'm 23,

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,120
you'll probably have very vivid memories of Bilddagboken.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,360
Those of you who are younger might not at all recognise the name Bilddagboken,

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,220
in that case "Dayviews" might ring a bell?

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,220
I used Bilddagboken between the years 2007-2010.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,700
Between the ages 12-16, ish.

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,100
I'd say that Bilddagboken was the instagram of the time.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,160
Except you weren't as picky with which photos you uploaded.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,140
It wasn't unusual to go to school, bring your camera,

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,980
take like fifty photos, go home and upload all of them to Bilddagboken.

16
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,480
You really had no shame. Or, perhaps that was because we were in seventh grade.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,660
Anyway: Bilddagboken, which nowadays is called Dayviews, is closing down.

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,200
Dayviews/Bilddagboken won't disappear any more.

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,200
Won't exist any more, I mean.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,740
So that's why I logged in and saved every single one of my photos, from 2007 to 2010.

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,440
And I thought we'd take a look at them today.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,420
So what do you say? I say let's get going.

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,340
Okay! First pic! Wooo!

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,260
Hi and welcome to my Bilddagboken!

25
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:27,240
From year... 2006! I lied to you. August 16th, 2006. I was 12 years old here!

26
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,480
Here's a hint of my magnificent taste in furnishing.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,640
When I was smaller, I had pink walls with big Peter Rabbit stickers along the sides.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,300
12-year-old Clara thought "No. That is baby wallpaper. I'm a big girl now. I want another wallpaper."

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,000
Look! Lime green wallpaper with big, pink flowers.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,260
HOLY SHIT

31
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,640
If you easily got carsick, you wouldn't wanna be in my room.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,920
On the other hand, lime green and pink were my favourite colours. I got to chose the new wallpapers myself.

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,920
My mum thought they were "groovy" and encouraged me to choose them.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm raised in a family without a lot of money, so the next time we could afford to change wallpapers, I was 18.

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,120
It WAS fun to bring home your cool high school classmates or a first crush.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,260
What more?

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,380
WOHOHOHO! Groovy glasses!

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,940
I'm 13 here, I've got long hair and I've started to get a lot of acne.

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,300
My whole forehead was like a bubble bath.

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,300
I remember a girl in class, and this is so mean, who said:

41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,000
- Errr, Clara, you've got something on your forehead?

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,700
And I thought to myself:

43
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,260
- Errrr, I know, unfortunately I just can't pick them off?

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,780
And I responded, out loud:

45
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,560
- I know. My cat scratched me.

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,700
Niieeeee :'(

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,900
Oooohhhhhhhhh.

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,280
Selfie session! I'm 13 here.

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
Without as much acne? Maybe it went up and down, I can't remember.

50
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,120
It's also my sister, Kimberly, who's 11.

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,860
I don't really know what to say about this photo. I don't know what we're looking at, either.

52
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,320
Back then, you couldn't see yourself in the camera while taking selfies.

53
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,860
Also, we're taking the picture and we're very aware of that...

54
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:01,995
It's a mystery.

55
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,440
I got a thing for Photoshop, too. And it's so badly done.

56
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,360
I also thought I did it pretty neat.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,280
I've made us a bit more tanned, Kimberly has got red hair and I've got brown,

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,840
we both have got brown eyes and we've also got some eyeliner each.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,880
I regret that I still don't now Photoshop. I could've learned...

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,900
What's.... ooooohhhhhh.

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,680
Awww! This is quite cute.

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,580
Gosh so small!!

63
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,380
This is the period where everybody were chavs. Except for me.

64
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,920
Everybody had bleached, teased, hairsprayed hair,

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,920
bronzer in their whole face, white lipstick,

66
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,520
remember those days? Ah god, I wasn't cool.

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,040
Here I'm on my way to an athletics competition, I did high jump and hurdles.

68
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,160
Yeah. Cute.

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,440
Ahhhhh, speaking of cute.

70
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,620
To all 13-year-olds out there: it gets better.

71
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,600
Puberty hit me like a frisbee.

72
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,520
In the back of my head. On a frisbee golf course. Ouch.

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,400
There are 13-year-olds today who wake up, do a full drag make-up and then go to school.

74
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,020
This girl did not. This girl had never even heard of hairspray.

75
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,600
I love not being a teen anymore.

76
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,880
AWWW

77
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,380
My sense and interest in/for fashion still hasn't kicked in.

78
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,520
A lime green winter jacket, which like I said was my favourite colour,

79
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,920
and let's match that with an Örgryte football team beanie.

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,320
Did I know who Örgryte football team were? Nope.

81
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,260
Did I even watch football? Nope.

82
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,160
Which team did I cheer for? SWEDEEEN

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,300
I tried. This is how cool I was.

84
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,640
Remember that I said that everybody else were chavs? They had teased hair, push up bra's and started drinking.

85
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
And I... did this.

86
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,220
Oh my god.... no, what is this?!

87
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,200
Charming.

88
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,600
Oh god. I think I was the definition of white trash when I was 13.

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,505
I mean, I was cute as a baby,

90
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:05,960
and I've been lucky in the genetic lottery as a grown up,

91
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,320
but the years in between..?

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,420
Can you see in the background, can you see what's approaching..?

93
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,060
It's PUBERTY. Like a fucking TRUCK.

94
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,720
Yeah. Good stuff.

95
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,820
Hey look! This is from one of my competitions!

96
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,280
Between the ages 12-18 I did high jumping, and I LOVED it.

97
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,820
I really did. Also, observe my little tongue over here.

98
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,840
I couldn't do a jump without doing this:

99
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,660
This is in Stockholm! It says "The Klara Grill" here, and there's a sign that says "Clara" here.

100
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,760
And my dad said "Clara. We must take a picture."

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,180
What else is there? Oh good god what is this.

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,180
I remember us playing with these IQ-test puzzles,

103
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,540
with all pieces looking different and you're supposed to put them together to a square?

104
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,880
I took them and threw them in the air, while my sister took the photo while they fell.

105
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
And I was supposed to look "funny".

106
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,560
I look like a five year old on crack.

107
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,040
Oh yeah, I had a dark phase as well.

108
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,280
I don't think I've ever talked about it, but I had quite a tough time in secondary school.

109
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,195
In short, me and my bestie had a fight, which escalated and became much bigger than it had to be.

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,680
Our parents started fighting and we broke our friendship.

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,900
And I realised that she was the only friend I had that I could hang out with,

112
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,360
like I had other friends in class but I never hung out with them.

113
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,600
And all of a sudden, I was just so lonely,

114
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,220
with no friends at all outside of school.

115
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,520
And then, I started taking these kind of photos, that I thought represented my feelings.

116
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,815
This was at that time when emo-pictures,

117
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,960
which were either too under-exposed or over-exposed, were trendy.

118
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,140
I really wanted to be part of the emo gang.

119
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,940
This is fun, this is from the day before I turned 15.

120
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,420
As we all know, the law says that you have to wear a helmet when you're bicycling if you're under 15.

121
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,420
This is a pretty accurate description of how much of a teen revolution I had.

122
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,880
None at all.

123
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
When I was 15, I thought it was fun to...

124
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,820
... wait, it's way to bright in here.

125
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,280
I thought it was kinda cool to take artsy photos.

126
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,380
The caption says "I don't know who I am".

127
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,180
"I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM BUT I KNOW I'M YOURS" (- Håkan Hellström)

128
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,920
Here I've made it to second and third place in the district finals.

129
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,180
I'd guess I've won silver in high jump and bronze in hurdles?

130
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:31,940
Wooo, here I cut my hair short! This is in the beginning of ninth grade, and I cut off my hair.

131
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,840
This was the first picture I took of my hair when I was on my way home from the hairdresser.

132
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
It really isn't the prettiest haircut.

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,480
Once again: styling products.

134
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,740
Have some dirt in the hair.

135
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,740
Because now, it's just hanging there, Clara, I'm just saying.

136
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,040
I think this is from the same day when I cut it. The side fringe was my best friend throughout secondary school.

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,780
I loved this haircut, it was my best decision as a 16-year-old.

138
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,380
Once again: artsy pic. Black and white.

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,260
This was back when you drew a mustache on your finger and was like

140
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,060
Bonjour! Sacre coeur! Je suis Française! Come over here and kiss my french lips!

141
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Isn't this the haircut that every art teacher has?

142
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,560
Awww, look..!

143
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,440
A haircut that's been growing for too long.

144
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,295
I can see the insecurity in my eyes.

145
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,840
I didn't like to be photographed. Little did I know that I'd make a living out of filming myself for the internet.

146
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,660
If I'd known, I would've got cardiac fibrallation.

147
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,780
Friends, those were all my photos!

148
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,860
I didn't show you every single photo because I have a LOT of boring pictures over there.

149
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,420
But these were the most interesting ones. Still fun though, how these have been out on the internet for anyone to see.

150
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,140
Okay guys, that's all for this time, thanks for watching!

151
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,980
Don't forget to write a comment, subscribe and share this video with your friends!

152
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,220
Take care and I'll see you as usual next Monday.

153
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,760
Bye!
