1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,640
A new school year and term 
can feel like getting a fresh start.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Similar to New Year's resolutions, 
many set new goals-

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,920
-to change or improve 
during the new school year.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,120
KEEP THE ENERGY UP ALL TERM

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,360
It's common to set new goals, 
but also to eventually lose motivation.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,040
It's hard to maintain the energy and drive 
you feel after a long break.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,360
But there are things you can do 
to make it easier.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,720
Improving your results 
requires effort and determination.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,400
So, think carefully 
about what you want to improve.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,240
Do you want to get in to a certain school-

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,800
-or maybe just prove to yourself 
what you're capable of?

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,920
Anyone who is good at something 
has invested a lot of time in it.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,320
That's true for everything, whether it's 
math, writing well, or running fast.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,840
To keep it up throughout the term, 
write down your goals and think about-

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,200
-why you want to achieve them.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,160
Just like everything else, 
motivation requires regular maintenance.

17
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,840
To reach your goals, you have to 
perform maintenance on your motivation.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,840
Write down what you want to achieve 
and what is important to you.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,880
Later on, when your 
drive and motivation are fading-

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,760
-you can revisit what you wrote.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,960
Write down the reasons behind your 
goals and what is important to you-

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,240
-in as much detail as possible, to help 
you access that feeling when revisiting it.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,280
You'll spend a lot of time at school 
with your classmates and teachers-

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,240
-so make a special effort 
to help create a pleasant environment.

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,440
You and your classmates 
might not have a lot in common-

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
-but always treat everyone with respect.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,720
Keeping your energy up is much easier 
if the classroom atmosphere is positive.

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,760
So do what you can to contribute 
to a pleasant atmosphere.

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,200
Remember: However easy or hard you 
find school, you can achieve your goals.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,160
That depends on your motivation, 
drive, and perseverance-

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,360
-rather than the talents 
you were born with.
