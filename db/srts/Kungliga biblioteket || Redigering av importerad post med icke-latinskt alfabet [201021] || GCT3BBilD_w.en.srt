00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,968
Hello! My name is Fatima Klanco Al Mulki. I work at the Royal Library.

2
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,832
I will now show how to edit an imported post with non-Latin alphabet.

3
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:33,363
The described approach applies to version 1.19 of Libris cataloging and may change.

4
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:43,764
I have chosen a book that is in Arabic. I have searched for the Arabic translation of August Strindbergs a dream game.

5
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,741
I start by looking at admin metadata and review it.

6
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:57,344
You do not have to follow that order, it is different how you usually edit your items. My way is to start with admin metadata.

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Here I check that the description level is included.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,090
In import, the description level automatically ends up at the minimum level if the system does not recognize the code from the database post is imported from.

9
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:17,574
I change it to library level.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:29,481
System technical note. There is already the property so I can duplicate that entity by clicking on these three dots

11
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:47,156
And manage and then duplicate the entity and replace that text with a note of transliteration schedule that we will use.

12
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:54,944
Within the Librian collective, we largely use the Library of Congress Romanization schedules when transferring

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,237
Text with non-Latin writing for Latin writing.

14
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:08,599
Exceptions to this are made for church writing. KB/LIBRIS practice is to Slavic and most non-Slavic works

15
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,430
With Cyrillic writing, it must be translit according to ISO 9: 1995.

16
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,859
The libraries that are in particular need it may instead choose to transcribe according to KR76 (Kjellberg)

17
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:37,815
And if necessary, supplement with AL-LC Romanization Table, Non-Slavic Languages (in Cyrillic Script) for the extra characters that may occur in non-Slavic languages.

18
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:47.741
Exceptions are made for Mongolian where the extra signs ө, ө are romanized as Swedish island, island and ү, ү as ü, ü.

19
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53.830
In addition, we have exceptions for Greek writing.

20
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:02,225
Works with Greek writing follow two different principles. Old Greek texts and newly texts.

21
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:15,911
Old Greek (from before 1454) follows transliteration schedule set for scientific libraries in Swedish cataloging rules 1980 (SK).

22
00:03:16,173 --> 00:03:27,777
Nygrecian texts (after 1453) follow transcription schedule stated for Swedish libraries following the library service practice for the public libraries.

23
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:35,069
You can find more detailed information including links to the various schedules in the Metadatabyrån.

24
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:42,000
The important thing is that in this field you specify which table you use.

25
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:59.835
This is how I write that we use the Library of Congress ... so there.

26
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:10,368
The importing library Sigel ends up at imports automatically in created by and we should not change that.

27
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:20.305
I see under cataloging rules that it is an RDA post and I will then remember to follow those rules as I continue with the editing.

28
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:28,842
Had the cataloging rules been others, I would not have had to change them to the RDA even though we primarily catalogize the RDA.

29
00:04:29,153 --> 00:04:35,967
The reason is that there are other libraries in the world that use other rules and we have said that we accept it.

30
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
The cataloging language I see here that it is Arabic.

31
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
And since it is an imported post I would not have had to change it as long as it is true but

32
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55.040
Here I know that the number of pages, for example, will stand in Arabic so to avoid

33
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00.465
Transliterate it also I choose to change here to Swedish.

34
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:20,384
In imported items it says that the library that imports the mail is what has created the post. We do not change it but instead we put in

35
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:27,861
Upgraded or imported by.

36
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
Like this

37
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,770
So we write our library's sigel here.

38
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
So, now it's time to insert information about modifications.

39
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:54.303
You use the plus sign here to the right.

40
00:05:57,764 --> 00:05:59,744
Like this

41
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:11,128
Add. And then you choose the one at the bottom: Non-Latin characters are available in both original and translated form.

42
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:22,754
But before I leave admin metadata, I need to add another property. Because I catalog for KB

43
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:29,184
And it is a translation of a Swedish work, I want it to be included in the Suecana collection,

44
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:35,387
Thus, the collection of foreign material with Swedish connection that KB preserves.

45
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:44,086
To do that, I will insert a new property by clicking on the plus sign in the right column and choosing bibliography.

46
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,518
So

47
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
And so I continue here.

48
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Create local entity

49
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:06,779
Although it stands out here, I do not write my library's sigel but write Suec instead.

50
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:12,461
So the name of the bibliography it should be on.

51
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,295
And now I'm done with the admin meta and switch to the instance.

52
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:30,815
I start by turning off to have a better overview.

53
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,234
And starts with the instance.

54
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,165
And I start with the description and see that it is true.

55
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:53,438
Now we check that the ISBN is correct. Publishing method: Monographic resource. It should always be monographic resource because we catalog a monograph.

56
00:07:53,438 --> 00:08:02.303
Media type, carrying type, that's correct. And there we see that they are in English. This means that when we save the mail they will be automatically linked

57
00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:08.447
Right to the Swedish variant.

58
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:18,106
Now we are at the title and here we see that the title is in the original writing.

59
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:31,143
According to Libris practice, we will use the original writing. We put the original title as a variant title as follows:

60
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:44,640
So. And I choose to move the original title to this box.

61
00:08:45,297 --> 00:08:54,434
In addition, because it is about a writing species written from right to left, I check that the direction of writing is correct by the

62
00:08:54,434 --> 00:09:00.385
Right -click and choose the right one. So.

63
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:08,773
As the main title, we enter the romanized form of the main title.

64
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:17,424
In this case, because it is about Arabic, we use LC's transliteration schedule.

65
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:26,271
And when we have translated the main title, it looks like this.

66
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
When we look at the origin information, we see that it is non-Llatinous writing.

67
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:42,000
Since transliteration is primarily to help the user group that is librarians, we need to translite the origin information as well.

68
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Here we write as it says on the title page fixed in transmitted form.

69
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:53,623
This is how it will look like this.

70
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:10,297
In imported items, the other title information may be incorrect in the capacity of the origin.

71
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
It can be extra difficult if you do not understand the language. A reminder only that you are attentive.

72
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:31,094
And to remedy it, you would move that information to other title information.

73
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:38,530
Like this. But that was not the case in my example.

74
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:50,860
Now we look at the release. We see that primary publication is correct

75
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53.567
The country is correct.

76
00:10:53,823 --> 00:11:07,673
We have to transmit a place and then we enter the translite form, and it will be like this.

77
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:35,261
I cling to the place because it is not in the publication but we know that this particular publisher is from this place.

78
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:43,756
Agent, ie the publisher, we also translabs.

79
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:54,239
During the publishing tasks, the year may be repeated very many times, which may seem confusing,

80
00:11:54,495 --> 00:12:00,000
But it is because the data is retrieved from different fields in the Marc21 format.

81
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,199
More information about this can be found in the help texts.

82
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:09.343
Our publishing details are correct so we don't change it.

83
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:18,122
We check the number of page and see that it is correct, but standing in Arabic, and we have changed

84
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:27,681
The cataloging language in admin metadata for Swedish so we write here in Swedish.

85
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:44,774
We see that the manifestation is part of a series. So we put the right information here too.

86
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:50.303
For more information about serial membership, read in the help texts.

87
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:58,667
Now we are done with the instance and move on to the instance of works.

88
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:04,204
You can click the Home button to get at the top.

89
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,000
Now we go here.

90
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:24,447
The title in instance of works should be the preferred title for the work and since this is a translation it should be the original title

91
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:29.003
And we must therefore check that it is in line with Swedish practice.

92
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:38,264
We see that it is not correct. It should be a dream game.

93
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,000
And there is also no filing value.

94
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54.303
It should be 4.

95
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
Now it follows translation of.

96
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:10,206
And this says that this is a translation from a Swedish original.

97
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:24,905
Then follows participation and function and we continue to check if there is an authorized and linked name form for the participating agents.

98
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,143
And I know here that it says August Strindberg so I check that there is a

99
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,525
Authorized mail, and it does, so I link to it instead of the Arabic form.

100
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:46,867
Function is in Arabic and I change ... it will not be linked to it but I have to choose

101
00:14:47,295 --> 00:15:00,737
I remove it and convert to writers.

102
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,540
Here we have the translator. The second participation.

103
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:22,665
Now we're going to make the translator and the easiest for me in this case is to make a new participation

104
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:32,008
Because I have to translite his information and so I choose a person.

105
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:42,956
And then I pick his name from here in translated form and write down ...

106
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,108
So.

107
00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:03,327
And the function is translator.

108
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:13,681
In this case, an authorized name form is missing and I choose not to "create and link entity"

109
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:19,929
Because it would create an entity where the content does not follow the instructions for authorized name form.

110
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:24,286
Instead, I do this way.

111
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,903
And links the right function.

112
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:36,000
Then follows a new language assignment that tells us that this is a book in Arabic.

113
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:43,529
And then we get the genre/form part.

114
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:55,408
Here we will add different codes as the literary genre, and genre/form terms.

115
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:10,698
And here I know we should choose drama.

116
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:24,000
And we should pay attention to lists. That we choose the right one.

117
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:33,834
I see here that we lack the subject so I will develop that property by clicking on ... here.

118
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,338
So there.

119
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:49,857
As for subject words, if they had already existed, we would have left them.

120
00:17:50,079 --> 00:18:01.824
But here I produce Swedish subject words according to the Swedish original.

121
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:11,548
To get only Swedish subject words, I end my search with SAO.

122
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,882
And then I get fewer hits and partly only those who are SAO meetings.

123
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,372
And here I have content type and it is correct, too.

124
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,936
And it is in English so it will be linked to Swedish when we save the post.

125
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:40,683
Now we are done with the editing and can click Create Post after a final check, here.

126
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:49,379
It remains to be posted on the mail and to see how to see the movie about stock registration.
