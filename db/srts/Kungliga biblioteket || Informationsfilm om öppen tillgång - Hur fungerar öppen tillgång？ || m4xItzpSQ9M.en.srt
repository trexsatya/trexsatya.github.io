1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,680
<i>An important aim of open access
is to make it possible, for anyone,</i>

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,320
<i>at no charge and in a simple way,</i>

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,560
<i>to find and reuse research results
by searching the internet.</i>

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,920
<i>There are a variety of methods
by which publications are made available.</i>

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,680
<i>The terms "golden road," "green road"
and "hybrid publishing"</i>

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,480
<i>are frequently used
to describe these various methods.</i>

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,840
<i>The "golden road" is where the researcher
publishes his or her article</i>

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,440
<i>in an open-access journal.
All articles published in the journal</i>

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,880
<i>are immediately accessible to,
and searchable by, everyone.</i>

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,000
<i>The publisher commonly bills
a publishing charge to the researcher,</i>

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,560
<i>referred to as an
"article processing charge," or APC.</i>

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,600
<i>In other words, this differs significantly
from the traditional system,</i>

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,640
<i>under which the publishing itself
is free of charge,</i>

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,720
<i>but the reader is required to pay
to access the article.</i>

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,560
<i>"Hybrid publishing" is where the researcher
publishes the article</i>

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,560
<i>in a traditional, subscription-based journal,</i>

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,360
<i>and the publisher bills a publishing charge
to the researcher,</i>

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,280
<i>in order to make the specific article
open access right away.</i>

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,760
<i>The "green road" is where the researcher
publishes the article</i>

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,200
<i>in a traditional, subscription-based journal.</i>

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,320
<i>After that, an earlier,
peer-reviewed version of the article</i>

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,800
<i>is published in a digital archive
for open access.</i>

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,240
<i>The publisher usually requires that the
open publication does not occur right away,</i>

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,320
<i>but that an interval of months must pass</i>

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,840
<i>between journal publication
and publication for open access.</i>

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,560
<i>This period is referred to
as the "embargo period,"</i>

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,680
<i>and is often between 6 and 12 months.</i>

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,920
<i>There is a trend toward
increasing embargo periods.</i>

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,960
<i>Within this method,
anyone who wants access</i>

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,280
<i>to the published version of the article</i>

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,640
<i>is still required to pay
high subscription fees to the publishers.</i>
