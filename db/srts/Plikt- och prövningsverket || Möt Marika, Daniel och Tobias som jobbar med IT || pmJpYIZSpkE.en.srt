1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,120
From having been doing very old technology, we have switched the past year

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,240
If and now we are at the forefront of development.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,240
So it's very exciting. The journey we are on.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,080
I don't want it to sound like a clichÃ©, but you make quite a lot of social benefits.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,760
Especially in today's situation as it has deteriorated.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,920
This to make social benefits,

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,640
It is evident when working at the duty of the duty.

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,520
With the duty process, most young people are around 18 years.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,320
This means that our technology maturity must be adapted to those in society that may be

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,600
At the front of technology.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,400
What is exciting is that we are on our way to a brand new

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,280
Reference architecture that is just micro service based.

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,960
This means we have a container platform,

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,200
Thus, a Kubernetes platform that we operate inside our walls.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,120
Since we work with the safety that we still do, we have, among other things, Air-Gapped environments

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,160
Thus, air -grated environments.

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,680
After all, we look at brand new frameworks both in backend and in Frontend.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,760
In addition to Frontend developers, we have also started using UX designers,

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,400
To find both new work methods and new ways of presenting information

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,720
To meet the needs of our young people.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,720
So it will be a lot more

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,680
modern interface from the Java Swing components that look like they come from

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,440
The 90's that they now do to something you recognize as any modern application.

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,320
This creates completely different forms of work, which has made us share teams

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,080
which has skills from all these areas.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,440
We work according to Devsecops, that is, we have system development,

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,200
We have techniques but also skills from the security area to cover all of these

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,280
The parts of our development chain.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,760
The Purchasing and Trials Agency has a good personnel policy there

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09.360
We actually strive to get a balance between working life and private life.

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14.560
We have paid training here which is very much appreciated by many of our colleagues

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
But since we also work team -based, it gets much better for

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,960
Individuals if you can actually collaborate with and solve the task.

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,080
You are not exposed in the same way, I feel as you may be if you work individually.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,560
Above all, the very nice atmosphere and it is all over the authority.

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,200
There is not a person here who does not greet when I meet them in the corridor.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,040
There is not a day that I do not think it is fun to cycle to work.

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:52.560
Otherwise, it is our fantastic wellness hours we have every week, and long holidays.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,240
As soon as you tell you where you work

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,520
Then people become curious. What, do you work there? Is it the defense?

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05.800
Is it security rated? This workplace it is surrounded by someone

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09.800
I don't want to say mystery, but it's something special.
