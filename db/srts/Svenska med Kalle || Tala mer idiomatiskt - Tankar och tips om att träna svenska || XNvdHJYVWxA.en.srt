00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,920
Hello Hello

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,720
In this movie.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,340
Should I talk about one thing that I think is important to think about

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,600
When learning a new language

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,340
and we use a little difficult word when we talk about this

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,620
and that word is idiomatic

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,380
It is similar to the word idiom

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,540
meaning expression

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,000
and it is related to each other

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,180
When you speak idiomatic

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,860
so does that mean you

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,220
Uses such words

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
And such expressions

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,200
As a Swedish person

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,200
a person with Swedish as a mother tongue

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,380
would choose in a particular situation

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,980
that you use words and expressions that fit

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,740
In a particular situation

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,940
and like

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,100
Sounds natural

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,020
that sounds like a Swede would say

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,380
and this is something you get to learn step by step

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,480
When learning a new language

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,280
for one cannot know

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,820
exactly which words fit and which expressions sound natural

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
When one begins to learn

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,020
But I think one should try

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,840
strive ..., make an effort, ... try

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,480
get closer to an idiomatic language

30
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,460
and as .... a very simple example

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,020
can i hear students say to me sometimes

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,780
"I have stress"

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
"I have stress"

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
And to say "I have stress"

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,060
It's not really wrong

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,000
I would say it's grammatically right

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,600
But the problem is that no Swedish person

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,180
as I know

39
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,620
says “I have stress”

40
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,460
We say instead "I'm stressed"

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,160
So to say "I'm stressed"

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,900
is more idiomatic than saying "I have stress"

43
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,720
Another example is that

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,860
Many people learn and ask "How are you?"
 in order to greet

45
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,700
How are you?

46
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,380
And this might be a little different

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,780
Because I know Swedes who greet

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,700
for example in the morning

49
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,420
with "How are you?"

50
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,580
But I would never do it

51
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,060
And I always think it feels ... It's a bit strange to greet that way.

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,780
To me it doesn't feel so idiomatic

53
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
It doesn't feel so natural

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,900
to use "how are you?"
 as a greeting

55
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,920
Without I may say "how is it?"
 or "is it good?"

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,800
or how is the situation?

57
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,000
To me they feel the expressions

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,940
the ways of greeting

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
More idiomatic

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,400
more natural, they sound more Swedish to me

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
And here, after all, a problem that ...

62
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,180
There's not a ...

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
There is not a rule

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,240
or rules.
 There is not an exact way

65
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,760
to say what is idiomatic

66
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,140
For people will not think exactly the same

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,340
about what is suitable for saying and not fitting

68
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,180
But quite a lot of things

69
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,300
would at least many Swedes agree on

70
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,820
that this sounds Swedish

71
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,580
This does not sound Swedish.

72
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,620
For example, I think no one

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Think it sounds especially good to say: "I have stress"

74
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,340
Although it is (what is it called) grammatically right to say so

75
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,340
right

76
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,540
and I think that

77
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,140
This is important for many different reasons

78
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,420
To find idiomatic expressions

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,900
An important reason is the social

80
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,700
the function.
 The social part of the language

81
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,720
That if you express yourself more naturally

82
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,240
on one that is suitable for the situation

83
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,940
With expressions that Swedes would use

84
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,340
so you will more easily be accepted

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,200
easier to get closer to people

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,180
We work so ...

87
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Psychological we humans

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,620
that about someone

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
seems to be like us

90
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
So it is faster to get to know each other, to accept each other

91
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
So I think you have a lot to win socially by ...

92
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,780
Start using more idiomatic, more natural expressions

93
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Then I don't think you should be afraid that ....

94
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
The most important thing is to communicate

95
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,920
If it gets wrong or sounds a bit strange

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It can also be fun and ...

97
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,580
Only you understand is usually okay

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,680
But if you want to reach a high level of your Swedish

99
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
that's how it is

100
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,040
An advantage, the more idiomatic you speak.

101
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
There will also be, in some way, more relaxed

102
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
For those who have Swedish as their mother tongue to listen to you.

103
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,280
So at least that's the most important advantage I think

104
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
When you talk anyway

105
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
that you come so to speak

106
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
You will get it easier social

107
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
If you use more natural expressions

108
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,540
And how do you learn this then?

109
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,520
I think the most important thing is simply to listen

110
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
On when Swedes talk to each other

111
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
And of course you can learn a lot of idiomatic Swedish ...

112
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,140
By listening to

113
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
TV programs and radio programs

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
where they talk to each other

115
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,380
in everyday situations

116
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
So I would think that for example

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,640
a documentary or a docus soap there ...

118
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,000
people more are social with each other

119
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
In an informal way

120
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
I think you will learn more

121
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,680
Everyday Swedish.
 More spoken language.

122
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,300
From such a program

123
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,220
than if you watch a movie

124
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,160
or maybe the news or something

125
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,940
For the most natural speech language

126
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
We have that when we just talk to each other.

127
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Of course everything ...

128
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,420
that you listen to and watch will help you.

129
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,580
And then you can of course ask ..

130
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,000
Ask very much

131
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,160
How do you say in such a situation?

132
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,400
How do you express yourself if you want to say this.

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,280
How to greet?
 How do you say goodbye?

134
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,800
How do you say Merry Christmas?

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
How to answer?
 How to ask?

136
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,800
Ask your teacher.

137
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,440
Ask your Swedish friends.
 Ask at Language Café.

138
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,180
You can learn a lot by just asking people ...

139
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,200
About how they talk in different situations.

140
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Maybe it got pretty far this ...

141
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,620
But I think this is an important topic

142
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,220
And I would like to hear your comments.

143
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,760
Or if you have any questions.

144
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
This word idiomatic ...

145
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,560
And the idea that it is important to find ...

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
A natural language

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,780
It's something we should talk more about

148
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,080
Within SFI teaching and at all

149
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
When we learn a language

150
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,340
So I think this is an important part that we must not forget

151
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,860
And then this word thinks idiomatic

152
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,800
Is so good, because it ....

153
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Exactly describes

154
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
What it is we want to access.

155
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,160
We want to find expressions and words ...

156
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,160
that sounds like a mother tongue speaker

157
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,220
It sounds like a native language speaker would say

158
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
That's what we mean by idiomatic

159
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
So please learn that word

160
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:06,440
And think about how you can train so that your Swedish becomes more idiomatic

161
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,760
Have a good evening and then we will see you again soon.

162
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
Thanks so much.
 Bye!
