1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04.219
A car that I do without tinsel is not a car of me, that's just it.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08.009
They have actually claimed at highlights that I am the biggest consumer

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.369
of glitter spray.

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:10,520
I think that is a merit.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,670
Tjena Kenneth!

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,709
Hello Hello!

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,940
How's it going? It's good, it's full roll.

8
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:24,631
Much that is happening now. Yes it is.

9
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,030
Where are we somewhere?

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30.049
Now we are at Söder, at Medborgarplatsen, at Björn's garden,

11
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:31,869
at a store called highlights.

12
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,440
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,819
It is always the one that I take advantage of everything I can, their colors and pens

14
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:39.880
And a little else like that.

15
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:43,889
You have a project that will be in one or two parts.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,510
Yes, we will see how many parts there are.

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,680
Yes, maybe a road trip part.

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53.230
What is the thing we should do?

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,150
It started well with someone commenting on your feature with the hyge.

20
00:00:57,371 --> 00:01:01,259
Yes, after the episode, there was a viewer who heard.

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02.909
And I thought I recognized the name.

22
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,529
And then you answer to that guy I chase him

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,599
And he has a Volvo 140.

24
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:13,419
Could it be something more iconic than even the right piece as well.

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,750
It is higher front and lower rear.

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,379
So the plan is for you and me to go to him

27
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:20,110
Yeah! And it's far away.

28
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:22,139
It's a good bit.

29
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,959
Yes, and there we will go into this, among other things.

30
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,770
But at least you should paint this car.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,069
Will probably put you some work too.

32
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:31,209
Yes maybe.

33
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,819
But to paint it you need some color.

34
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:36,368
Yes, that is why we are at this deal now.

35
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:38,660
What was its name? Highlights.

36
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,310
And then we will go in there and then we will see if we can find any color.

37
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,400
Yes.

38
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,190
Now I'm out in deep water.

39
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,564
Yes now you are out in deep water.

40
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,250
I have no idea. What to do in here?

41
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,410
Here there are lots of different colors, different types

42
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57.930
And everything from airbrush to pens to spray cans.

43
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,220
Clothes are even available.

44
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01.540
They have everything here.

45
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04.457
Everything for street art, you can sum it up with that.

46
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08.319
The street art as an artist material. But what do we need then?

47
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,159
We need spray cans, tape.

48
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,579
We need mouth protection.

49
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,069
A little such things.

50
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,039
Then it's just hello and hey, now we drive!

51
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,410
I've been here for many years now. That over ten years I think.

52
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,179
The most fun thing is when people ask if I have put vinyl on it.

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,899
No, I have sprayed it with a spray can.

54
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:25,759
People think it's wrapped.

55
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,849
So I have done it for real.

56
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29.709
There is nothing wrong with wrapping.

57
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:33,080
But for me this is a bit more art in some way than

58
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:36,080
That you wrap and press it immediately.

59
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,339
So here it is for real.

60
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,849
Have you decided which colors should have?

61
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,029
Yes, I have in my head.

62
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,000
Since then I have written a list.

63
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,820
We need green in different shades.

64
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,169
We need gray, we need marbling spray,

65
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,129
We need crackling spray.

66
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,089
Of course, we need glitter.

67
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,189
You sent glitter.

68
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,289
I didn't take anything. What glitter?

69
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:03,989
Glitter color! It is clear varnish with a gentleman's

70
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:06.049
Lots of glitter is never wrong.

71
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:10,770
I have pretty much everything I do should have at least something with glitter.

72
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,759
He will paint the car ate. He knows about what you ...

73
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,579
No I haven't said anything about what to do.

74
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:21,740
He put in some requests if there would be a little military piece,

75
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,070
But it will be with my twist.

76
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,439
I like like when it starts to shine a little like this.

77
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,753
This is nice too.

78
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,289
But it has something else.

79
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,123
But that is the schyst I think,

80
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:38,429
These are damn cool also these colors.

81
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:41,449
Then it's fluo and this I have actually learned.

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,529
Luminous in uv light these four.

83
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,899
It is very much Villhöver.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,520
Villhöver Vilhöver the factor is extremely high.

85
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:51,209
It is.

86
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:53,369
Yes, there is little to choose from.

87
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55.569
There must be 2000 colors here.

88
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,199
There are probably more than 2000 colors here I think.

89
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:03,229
If you are going to count on all other colors over there too.

90
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,500
So there are probably as much colors as possible.

91
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07.319
It never ends.

92
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:08.419
But we start to go and check then.

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,050
I will get help from a guy, Christoffer.

94
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:13,899
That's probably it.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Can tell you better than I do. I have no idea.

96
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,820
I need.

97
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,839
I have a list here.

98
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,355
Like I have done.

99
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:28,190
That one list has two lists.

100
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:31,750
Patina Crackle effect.

101
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,960
Should i have green, squirrel and traffic black

102
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,919
And then as clear as Montana Rust effect.

103
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,079
After all, you have painted the whole heap in.

104
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,589
Two of each.

105
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,549
Every there and not a spider but I want.

106
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,412
Two large with marbel instead. Yes, two large marbel black.

107
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,600
Same as you have on the car out there. It was great.

108
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,769
This is best if you sit and watch first.

109
00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:55,299
You know so you don't stand and look confused

110
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,690
And takes an unnecessarily long time.

111
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59.660
Enjoy being effective.

112
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00.559
You have been so effective.

113
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,500
I think you have messed up 15 times with different shopping lists here.

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05.609
Yes, I still take two.

115
00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:07.630
Maybe some different versions.

116
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09.729
I can agree with that.

117
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:12.053
But here it is Montana Gold that applies.

118
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,299
But how long do these colors last?

119
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,389
We have had cars that have lasted for several years and are

120
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:19,809
So that the color starts to flake in some way.

121
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,919
But then it is just putting on again.

122
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,619
After all, it's not more difficult than that.

123
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,910
I'm not looking to get a car that should be super shiny as well.

124
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:31,814
If one does not now put on a lot of clear lacquer

125
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,420
That's another thing. Now things are starting to happen.

126
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,359
It was a racker that was missing.

127
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:40,959
Okay, rust the effect, lighter variant.

128
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,009
The green?

129
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,779
No.

130
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,010
Well, the lighter of Rust and I can have an extra can.

131
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,100
Yes, but then we can residate it.

132
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,000
And. You can send it.

133
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Want to look at Crackle the colors again.

134
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,739
Yes, I don't have that.

135
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,739
Then the green is not.

136
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02.570
Should double check.

137
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07.761
What else do you have? They are those yes.

138
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09.059
It fits best.

139
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:11,709
Then it is definitely the green that would be the best.

140
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,190
Think it sounds like you are choosing Ben & Jerry Glass.

141
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,579
Yes there are slightly different flavors you can have.

142
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,940
There we have it.

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,809
Now it's green crackle.

144
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,579
Should we look gray and black, one of each.

145
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,190
For the green crack, I have the hint of the rims.

146
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,239
It is yellow to base and then i put the green over

147
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,070
And it was really nice to have a black and a gray.

148
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,679
Then we come to the usual colors.

149
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:44.813
Yes, two ketchup. Yeah.

150
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:47,156
Ketchup?! Yes.

151
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:53,778
Four green, something ordinary white and two blacks.

152
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,220
I like the name ketchup.

153
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,820
But there are many fun names on the colors here.

154
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,559
Poisen Green and lots of different fun names are the most fun name?

155
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:11,261
So different, Miss Piggy of course. It is really pink in other words

156
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:14,609
Next time, write down the numbers on a note like that.

157
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,350
Yes.

158
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,540
You usually do that.

159
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Yes okay, then.

160
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:20,759
I get some stuff that you have thought of.

161
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,720
So we can tell loud is that if you are going to choose silver

162
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,850
so you choose a matte silver and not chrome

163
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:29.565
Because it is overpowerable. Yes I know.

164
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:32,919
It is nice to work in the same shade.

165
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,019
Yes several shifts to make

166
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,669
Shadows and stuff.

167
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,769
So I thought about some caps too.

168
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,479
Yes, absolutely, that.

169
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,760
You have to have, otherwise no one will be good.

170
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:48,299
It is great with those with the usual caps, but they are not good for everything.

171
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,200
Talking to nozzles? Yes nozzles, ie caps.

172
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,459
There it was all kinds of different.

173
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,190
A jungle.

174
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,279
I have started to learn this.

175
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,869
Are you kidding me?

176
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01.109
I thought there was a nozzle.

177
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03.211
It doesn't.

178
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:05,170
If you are wrong then it will be wrong I can promise.

179
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:07.410
It should be a small line so you get a large circle

180
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09.910
So it is suddenly from 30 centimeters.

181
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,100
So it's good to think about those stuff for the caps are almost

182
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,329
As important as the color to gain control over it.

183
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,359
Here are some favorites.

184
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,883
Level 1 One of the best -selling sharp caps.

185
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,609
The second cap for pill and details.

186
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,000
Low pressure.

187
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,239
Blue Soft, if you are going to make Fades and soft transitions

188
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,820
And also wants a low pressure that makes the color last for quite a while.

189
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:40,000
Orange Fat Cap a little larger with higher pressure if you want to color large areas.

190
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:43,359
This is pure Greek for me this.

191
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:48,130
I think it was a spray can where you would print some color.

192
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49.840
Yes, it depends on what you go and shop somewhere.

193
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,220
There is a place where roughly it can be half the amount

194
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,380
with color pigment in and you have to pay more so it is better to go somewhere

195
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,369
Where you really get things you talk about.

196
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:02.760
Exactly.

197
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:04,340
Do we have everything we need?

198
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06.440
Now we have everything you need.

199
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,480
Jump in the car and go ...

200
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,479
Jump into a car and go 35 miles to a guy I've never met.

201
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,479
I've seen his car in the picture.

202
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:18,979
He doesn't know what to do.

203
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,820
This is fun.

204
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21.309
And he trusts you?

205
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:24,510
Obviously, he is in Rat Bastard Crew Sweden at least.

206
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,010
He knows what I do.

207
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,200
Yes, it's fun. It's great fun.

208
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:33,820
Coming out with ketchup and Poison Dark.

209
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,240
You will like that.

210
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,360
This is going to be great.

211
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,460
So we have something in the cash register.

212
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,220
They are so nice willing to sponsor you on this.

213
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,979
Yes, because they want to spread the art ....

214
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:51,799
That you can use this color for cars too,

215
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,190
to vehicles, cars and everything possible.

216
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,450
Don't just stand and chew on walls and make big works of art.

217
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:02,280
For example, I have been to the Beast Festival in Snösätra every year.

218
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05.669
And then I almost always painted one or more cars,

219
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:08,900
So I was the only one who did it too.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How long will it take?

221
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:14,489
After all, we tentatively count for two days.

222
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,059
Two days?

223
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,989
Yes it goes away and I will be quite over.

224
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,470
Pimp My Volvo will be now.

225
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,410
Just.

226
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,119
Yes, you Kenneth now we are in Lidköping.

227
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:34,460
Yes, now we just wait for Andreas to show up with his 140

228
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,100
So we can kick off.

229
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,090
Yes, we had a plan now for us to go here, in common,

230
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,390
But since we live in different cities, it will be.

231
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:45,369
Yes, it is a bit between our starting positions so to speak.

232
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,530
Has a fooltry there.

233
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,140
But then when we meet up here, the hyge is no longer the heap.

234
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56.609
No, not really so it is still the hell but another version.

235
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,580
It's version four or five now I think.

236
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,670
What you saw was probably version two maybe when we had the last report,

237
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,950
But now it's four or five.

238
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,369
It depends on how you see it.

239
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:10,000
Now it is not only brown, now brown and green and a little black

240
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:12,900
And a little white and a little else.

241
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,159
You mumbled something for me that you should do something with the bumper forward.

242
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah, there I went loose with hole saw so i thought it looked a little

243
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,090
More fun when you did.

244
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,059
So it is as usual Walle's fault.

245
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,990
It was in Walle's garage that I found that hole saw

246
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,710
And then I ask if I can borrow it?

247
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:32.809
Then I started.

248
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,970
I never had to drive the rear end.

249
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,919
It should probably be a little back on the back there as well.

250
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,580
Have you painted anything else?

251
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,680
Yeah but it is possible to hole

252
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,450
There, too, in one place I think. There is a little skull now.

253
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:46,869
But then you had this with.

254
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,739
You said it would have been Indian pattern.

255
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:51,100
When it was Thai.

256
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,100
But it wasn't that much.

257
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,020
It had been more Killi.

258
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:55,360
Killi is not so into that.

259
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,300
Make just thai pattern.

260
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00.519
He is more into your killi designs i have come to

261
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02.710
And I think that almost more fun than anything else.

262
00:12:02.809 --> 00:12:04.809
So he has painted

263
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:10,330
Door sides and dashboard and everything possible with the help of me.

264
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,010
But he has done a lot himself.

265
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:15,119
So the whole interior is in.

266
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,580
Many, many, many different colors.

267
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,580
As many colors as I have pens.

268
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:23,640
The tank lid? Yes, it became a special you can say.

269
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,580
There was a rocket that goes into the fuel cap and then I had on melt glue

270
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,380
And so I did as it almost looked organic.

271
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:36,210
And then I paint over that and then I paint that little grenade

272
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:39,229
And so there so it looks like a grenade in the fuel lid.

273
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:42,570
My feeling for this with gasoline prices and stuff.

274
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,640
Hello Hello! How's it going? Yes it is good

275
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,159
Welcome to Lidköping, the city where it always blows headwinds.

276
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:57,479
Both I and Kenneth you think have a very fun car.

277
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,380
Yes, an old Volvo 142a.

278
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:04.909
And it is not in original condition you could say.

279
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,760
No, you probably can't say it's probably a mason

280
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:11,849
And not a car sheet metal is the one on this one.

281
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,650
It started with seeing Doc down at Elmia really

282
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22.309
The first contact I got with Kenneth's work

283
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:26,600
And then have seen and followed on Facebook and Youtube a little neighbor

284
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,330
and it has made me think it's fucking fucking

285
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,840
That he comes here. Shit fun!

286
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,920
What do you think Kenneth?

287
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,726
Yes, here it is windy.

288
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:37,720
Are there three walls and it blows straight in here

289
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,960
So there will be color everywhere.

290
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:43,590
Now we will start where we will start with a little dark green.

291
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,719
Put on the skis and then we'll go over to another shade

292
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,520
And further and further.

293
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:53,169
Damn, now I'm so excited to start.
