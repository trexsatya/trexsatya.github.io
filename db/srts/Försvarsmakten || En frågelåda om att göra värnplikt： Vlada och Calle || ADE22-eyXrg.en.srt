00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,320
Hi, my name is Vlada and I did my military duty as a sea surveillance operator.

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,560
And my name is Calle and I did my military duty as a wagon manager at Grenadeklarspluton.

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,360
What does a sea surveillance operator do?

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,560
A sea surveillance operator is located either in a central that I did.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,040
Or on a vessel and lake monitors Sweden's borders.

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:42,960
And ensures that no unauthorized, vessels border on our Swedish waters.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,160
What does a grenade thrower do?

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,840
The grenade launcher pluton do -

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,680
- Is we shoot grenades at longer distances.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,440
No short hand grenade.

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,840
So it's grenade launcher in a tube.

12
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,560
As a carriage manager-then that system is on a 90-wagon.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,440
And then I decide where to go and take care of the crew.

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,160
So I'm the manager of the carriage.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,040
Today we will answer some questions.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,560
And for that we have an iPad to help.

17
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:28,585
"Is there any trait that many people think you have to have but that is not really that important?"

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,400
Here, the cliché will be big, strong, bite.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,320
But you don't have to be so big and strong.

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,400
Nah.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,760
For most positions I would say.

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:50,280
Yes, so I still think that some kind of fitness and want you probably need to have the foundation to cope with it.

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,880
Because it gets tough.
 - Yes, it gets pretty physical.

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,760
But you don't have to be the biggest and strongest.
 You don't have to be an elite athlete.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,920
Well, and you're there too to learn all those things.

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,932
"What is your best and worst memory from military service?"

27
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,560
Oh.

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,880
The worst is probably then when I went to and from the garage, over and over again.

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,120
But it is for a longer period.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,920
The best thing was when I was at a shooting exercise in Älvdalen.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,120
Then it was brilliant sunshine, completely crispy outside.

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,720
So we went up to a small height with pretty good views, and then we stood and shot there for several hours.

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,880
It was nice.
 Drinking coffee and had gotten thread.

34
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,480
Luxurious anyway.
 Being able to have it as an everyday life sometimes.

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,120
-And you?

36
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:52,971
I've been thinking about that question quite a few times.

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:01,280
The toughest thing is probably still the last exercise "never give up", is it called?

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
Type a form of basket test?
 Or?
 - Yes ... but you can say.

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,000
It was a type of end exercise you can say that would show whether you are a worthy soldier or not.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
The cold ...

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,440
This motion all the time.
 The uncertainty.

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,840
Exactly, the stress that came.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,320
Yes, for everyone.
 You learn to work well so early in the morning.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,640
- Yes.
 - Or the night.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,240
I got a similar one.
 Early up.
 Tinges.
 We slept type in water.

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,520
Everything was wet and then you would go with your shoes.
 It was almost no idea to almost put on your boots.

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,440
Where did you have many of your exercises.
 Pure geographically?

48
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,720
Älvdalen, then it was Skåne and Skövde.

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,040
Great question.

50
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm from the army so I wear green.
 It fits great in the forest.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,760
I am blue like the sea, so the Navy I come from.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,480
And that's where I did my military duty too.
 Then the Navy is quite scattered.

53
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,440
And the Navy also has green uniform.
 Especially in the field.

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,880
And I had that during the first few months.

55
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,160
Yes, everyone has, I think.

56
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,192
Now it rang.

57
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:28,635
"Is there any difference in the requirements or tasks for men and women under the military duty?"

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
Nah.
 I wouldn't say that.

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,760
According to the duty and testing authority, this is the same requirement.
 It doesn't matter if you are a guy or a girl.

60
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,160
Everyone is the same, it's just that everyone is different individuals.
 That's really what you see.

61
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,720
Yes, but really.

62
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:47,774
One more, really.

63
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,400
"What happens when you have mucked? Am I free then or what do I have obligations afterwards?"

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,960
Muck is kind of like a student after high school.

65
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,320
Yes, an end.

66
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:08,040
And you get to meet commanders a little more civil, like ordinary people.

67
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,200
But what you do afterwards is a bit up to yourself.

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,960
But you are placed in war!
 - Yes, everyone is placed in war.

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,520
And then you can choose to continue within the Armed Forces, or you go out civil.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:38,680
Yes, you usually say ... For me it was kind of every other weekend.

71
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,720
Yes, so it was for me.
 Some weekend you could choose to stay.

72
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,200
Then you had to stay with their polishes on the regiment.

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,120
It was pretty fun.

74
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,040
But otherwise it was every other weekend that I had to come home.

75
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,880
Then it can actually vary from band to bandage.

76
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,400
I had quite a lot of weekly leave.

77
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,240
We were out for a longer period and then we were vacant for a longer period.

78
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,840
It sounds pretty luxurious.
 Or?

79
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,520
Yes, it was pretty good.
 You work intensively for maybe a month -

80
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,240
- And then you were free for a longer period after that.

81
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:28,040
So, I think ... I had my friends a phone call away.

82
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,120
And you had some home time so you could talk to them.

83
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,840
But otherwise I think the pace of military service went in one.

84
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,440
So that's how you could hardly miss either.

85
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,560
You forgot it a little when you were in the business.

86
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,880
Because that's a pretty high tempo.

87
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,880
You think of something else in the meantime.

88
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,040
When it gets a little slower pace sometimes, some night when you don't have much to do.

89
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,760
Then it may be that you long for home.

90
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,560
But you have your friends there.
 Then it becomes that you find something with them.

91
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,880
And it becomes a bit like a new family you get.

92
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,640
Yes, it's a bit like you go away as well, somewhere.

93
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:19,120
But the friends were really there and I still have quite a lot of contact with my polishes from the military duty.

94
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,840
I don't think so personally.

95
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,680
But was it too when you were going on the shooting range for the first time?

96
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,120
Ah, you were nervous.
 It was a bit like this ... I'm not going to fail.

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,440
There are so many people watching.

98
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,760
There is a lot of commander.

99
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,360
The commanders were very very good.

100
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
They came up next to it.

101
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
Be with the first shots.

102
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,360
Continuously.
 You felt safe.

103
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,000
And then it became a routine to learn to shoot.

104
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,280
It became like dramatized.

105
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,760
It feels like it in the beginning.

106
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,720
You probably play the bigger one at that time than it was.

107
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,640
Now that I think back on it, maybe there wasn't much screams.

108
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,240
Maybe it was just because you were nervous yourself.

109
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,800
But the sum of the cardamom is really that it is awesome how so many different people

110
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,000
can provide such a stable and secure community.

111
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,560
Thanks!
 - Thanks!
