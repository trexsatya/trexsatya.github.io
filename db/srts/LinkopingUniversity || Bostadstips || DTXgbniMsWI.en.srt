00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You raised this with a home. It can be difficult in many student cities.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you have any special tips on how to easily get housing and what you can do to facilitate.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I was lucky enough to get housing by calling around to private landlords.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,040
At first, none of those had, but a few days later there was a woman who sought someone to rent out in the second place.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,040
So she had got my number and contacted me. So that's a tip.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,040
Good, to lie on a little yourself and not be too scared.

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,040
Yes, to rent in the second place.

8
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,477
Has it worked well then? Have you had the same home all the time?

9
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:53,766
No I have not. I've moved too. But it was a good way in.

10
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:58,332
Right. Alexander what do you say? You mentioned the housing queue.

11
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:04,102
Yes, to queue early at time, at student housing

12
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:14,600
At my education, the medical program we have superfather.

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:24,600
They have many tips on private landlords, how to go about it.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,294
There are also Facebook groups such as housing in LinkÃ¶ping.

15
00:01:28,294 --> 00:01:32,960
And in the Fabook groups of the program there are often older courses

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,966
Which may take. A year abroad and post advertisements, etc., so it usually resolves for most people.

17
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:44.609
So that social media can be a tip. Maja do you have something special?

18
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:56,000
I stood in a residential queue as soon as I could. But my partner and I got our apartment via the block, so you can look there.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So we looked first, but found nothing and then posted our own ad that we got an answer to.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,153
It was pretty smooth.

21
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:15,000
There were many good tips. You can call around yourself, or post your own ads on the block or social media.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can also make your own contacts when you come here.
