1
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:07,834
We are moving towards a future where we will strengthen the cyber defense -

2
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:10,074
- And it is also pronounced at all levels.

3
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:13,198
As all parts of our everyday lives become more digitized -

4
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:17,804
- So cyber automatically becomes an integral part of all different domains.

5
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:22,331
You will not be able to defend themselves without cyber - in the future

6
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:25,131
- Over what it is you are doing within the Armed Forces.

7
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:31,051
Cyber defense is a military means of power that is most commonly used together -

8
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,611
- With other combat forces, when carrying out military operations.

9
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:43,614
Actually, anyone can search and become a cyber soldier -

10
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:48,094
- Just man is a Swedish citizen and is between 18-44 years.

11
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:51,103
We direct our application and the ones we take in -

12
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:54,983
- They are usually logically placed, so you want to solve problems.

13
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:57,119
One should be interested in IT.

14
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:03,000
One should have a basic technical background and understanding of computers in general.

15
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:05,211
One should have the ability to cooperate -

16
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:09,691
- And you should have the ability to give the little extra when needed.

17
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,359
Becoming a cyber soldier means that you will be tested in different ways -

18
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,479
–And in the end, when you have matched the requirements profile that we are looking for -

19
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,479
- So we do extra tests.

20
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,959
You are considered suitable at the duty and testing plant-

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,079
- Then you will have to make an extra pattern, as we call it, an extended pattern.

22
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,579
What we try, it is partly theoretical knowledge -

23
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:35,979
- And then we talk logic among other things.

24
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:38,926
The second is professional knowledge.

25
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:42,486
How much knowledge do you have about what is cyber before you start?

26
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:49,692
When one starts with your education to a cyber soldier -

27
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,652
- Then you carry out a general military part.

28
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:59,284
It is a big change to go from being a private individual-

29
00:01:59,284 --> 00:02:02,084
- To a compound pluton.

30
00:02:04,545 --> 00:02:08,057
The first thing that happens during GMU is that you have to step into a new world -

31
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:09,000
- In the military world.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,393
And learn how to act at all stages as a military.

33
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:19,849
You learn to defend your place with weapons.

34
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,381
You learn to survive in the forest.

35
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:27,000
And you learn all the soldier skills -

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,240
- As everyone in the Armed Forces should have.

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Honestly, this is a lot of fun, but I also long for -

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,600
- Get to put me with a computer and take it too.

39
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,328
It's "Best of Both World".

40
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:41,711
It's fun to shoot, it's fun to scream -

41
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,951
- And it's fun to be quiet in front of the computer too.

42
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,951
That works for me.

43
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:52,609
When this day is over, the military undergraduate training - ends

44
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,609
- And we are going into the next stage.

45
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,689
The next stage, is the job training.

46
00:02:57,785 --> 00:03:00,385
As before, we work in groups.

47
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:03,305
It will require much of your group.

48
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,207
It will also require much of the platoon.

49
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,500
We do this in common.

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,841
You are here because you can.

51
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,876
As of having gone to living in tent-

52
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:18,467
–To be in the woods and shoot weapons -

53
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:22,107
-So you go into a high-intensity IT education--

54
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:26,947
with the foundation of one of Sweden's foremost university courses.

55
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,929
Cyber soldier training is an academic education.

56
00:03:29,929 --> 00:03:34,529
It contains four KTH college courses-

57
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:37,529
- Which in itself corresponds to 30 higher education credits.

58
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:42,739
One starts with a basic understanding within computer networks as we call it

59
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:45,938
Then you move on to computer systems -

60
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:47,978
—While the second course - is

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,320
- And then it is data security.

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,360
In common with reading the three courses -

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,960
- So you will also read it, as many may recognize - -

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,590
- As is the ethical hacking.

65
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,840
Which is about getting into different systems.

66
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:02,385
It is extremely mentally demanding.

67
00:04:02,385 --> 00:04:07,345
It's long days and there is a lot to take in.

68
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:12,094
By the fact that the community and then of course also the Armed Forces -

69
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:16,454
-Digitalized much more, so cyber domain - will

70
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:20,414
- To be a larger attack surface for a potential opponent.

71
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,286
Therefore, cyber defense is really needed everywhere.

72
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:29,606
Cyber defense is an actor or a nation's overall ability ...

73
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:34,326
... that through offensive and defensive methods -

74
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:37,046
- Defend a critical system.

75
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:41,420
Actually, you can say that basically very similar skills - are needed -

76
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,801
- For offensive and defensive cyber operations.

77
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:47,543
A defensive ability it is the -

78
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:51,956
- As we almost always use.
 It's about monitoring -

79
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:54,283
- And discover intrusion into our systems.

80
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:58,606
Offensive cyber operations are about obtaining information -

81
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:02,046
–If the attacking system, or to make it difficult for the attacker -

82
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:04,566
- to use their systems, which in turn -

83
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:08,286
- is a defense measure, because it prevents these attacks.

84
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:13,653
The cyber defense is needed everywhere in the Armed Forces -

85
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:19,157
-And here we got the chance to deepen our knowledge a little -

86
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:22,900
- In how different associations work with their cyber defense.

87
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:26,991
What happens is that you are placed somewhere in the Armed Forces.

88
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:30,525
It could be, for example, in the Air Force.

89
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:35,765
And so the Air Force will further educate the cyber soldiers reading towards the Air Force -

90
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:40,722
–And really take what is general and do it specifically -

91
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:42,722
- Against their system, for example.

92
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,658
This competence to be cybers soldier -

93
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:48,058
- Is very important to the Armed Forces.

94
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:52,306
It allows us to expand our endurance and capacity.

95
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:57,137
We have the ability today and we have management bands -

96
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:01,274
-And IT defense associations, which know this ability very well today.

97
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:05,083
But with the cyber soldier training and the establishment -

98
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,747
- So we really increase our capacity.

99
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:11,118
When you finish your military duty, it's really two roads -

100
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:13,838
- If you want to continue your involvement in the Armed Forces.

101
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:16,783
One is if one is looking for employment as a soldier -

102
00:06:16,783 --> 00:06:20,623
- In any of the organizational units, or within the Armed Forces.

103
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:24,000
The second it is if you want to become an officer.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,640
There we have developed an education, which is focused on cyber.

105
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:33,046
If you have been completing the Cyber Soldier Training for Eleven Months -

106
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:37,086
- So you have a great opportunity both within the Armed Forces -

107
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,686
- Going on, but also out in the community.

108
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,015
You see it from the parliamentary and government decisions-

109
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:48,695
- Where you place great power and weight and point out the importance of the cyber defense.

110
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:51,876
Not least, you also see it in our immediate area.

111
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:54,422
If we look at what is happening in Europe -

112
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:56,734
- And if we look at what is happening in the world in general.

113
00:06:56,734 --> 00:07:00,214
Cyber defense is an equally natural part of the war -

114
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:04,245
- As the other battlefields, that is, land, lake or air.
