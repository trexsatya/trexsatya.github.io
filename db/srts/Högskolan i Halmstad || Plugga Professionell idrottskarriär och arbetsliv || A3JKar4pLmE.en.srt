00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:07.633
My name is Simon Andersson and I read-

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,300
-Froofessional sports career and working life (PICK) at Halmstad-

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,033
-And right now we are in one of our elite environments.

4
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:19,567
I chose to study because I am an elite golfer-

5
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:25,067
-and have wanted to study further at college but not know-

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,300
-Richly what I want to do. So this opportunity showed up.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,467
I found out that you can read sports science at Halmstad University

8
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:36,167
-At the same time you can conduct a golf venture alongside.

9
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:40,567
The best thing about studying here is that everyone who comes to the program is-

10
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:44,933
-otally interested in sports in general and perhaps primarily-

11
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:48.033
-The sport they are doing.

12
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:53.833
This means that we as students both learn to take part of-

13
00:00:53,833 --> 00:01:00.67
-Howing history within the sports and thus can learn-

14
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:05.067
-To work on our own sports. Although the sports differ

15
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:09.633
-If especially the mental part is very similar in most sports.

16
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:15,833
We have a lot of like -minded people to bump ideas and the like with.

17
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:19,100
It also makes it very positive in the study-

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,267
-What you have many like -minded people to spend a lot of time with.

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,833
The arrangement on the Pika is that we read at 75 percent study act-

20
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,133
-and that is because one besides their studies-

21
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:34,833
-As to be able to conduct their sports investment.

22
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:41,533
A regular school week for a pika student consists of we have two to three days-

23
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:49,600
-In the school and two days, roughly, for golf training or physical training.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,567
There are extremely good conditions-

25
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,500
-be able to fully conduct their sports investment.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00.600
In the future, I feel that I first and foremost want to continue to conduct-

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,200
-My own golf venture. My dreams are to become a professional golfer.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08.920
If I would not succeed in that I am sure I want to work-

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,080
-with something in sports and this program has made me see that it-

30
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:20,200
-There are opportunities to work in sports in other ways other than just practicing it.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,067
A tip that I think many of us pika students would agree

32
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:28,367
-Is to take hold of the studies on time. To do with their sport is fun-

33
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,633
-I think so too.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,200
To grab the studies on time and get clear everything fast and in a good way-

35
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:38,967
-make you can do your sport significantly more-

36
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,800
-And with greater freedom as well.
