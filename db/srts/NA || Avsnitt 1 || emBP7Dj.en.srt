1
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.160
You are all welcome to the elevator.
 I'll sing some earrings.

2
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.760
We start with "The Girl and the Kråkan" by Mikael Wiehe.

3
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.920
  I saw a picture of a girl with a damaged crow in her arms

4
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.040
  She ran with crow ... the crow ... runs ...

5
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.040
Drum sound

6
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.480
Please, I'm trying to sleep.

7
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.240
Hello.

8
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.440
Hello!

9
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.000
Yes ... yes ...

10
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.800
- What the hell are you doing?!
 -Hey sweetie.

11
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.360
This is Christer Broström.
 - Christer.
 Frida.

12
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.520
- Yeah?!
 - He is one of our most important customers.

13
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.680
The sauna at work was clumsy.
 - Where were we?
 Yes exactly!

14
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.840
I have the annual report in the computer.

15
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So.
 - Honey, do you fix some cuts?

16
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.360
- You haven't kissed in the bath?
 -Yes.

17
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.840
The Only Way to Happiness is to find your Inner Landscape ...

18
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.480
... and then you travel there, and then you stay there.

19
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.720
Listen to your inner voice.
 Let's make a sound.

20
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.120
Oum ...

21
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.160
A Sound?

22
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.320
Yes, Your Inner Voice, Your Inner Sound.
 Oum ...

23
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.160
Eh ...

24
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.080
Mööö!

25
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.280
Bars

26
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.240
What is feminist self -defense?
 You will soon know that.

27
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.400
My name is Rebecka, but I am called Robin.

28
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.240
We will go through effective ways to defend against an attacking man.

29
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.400
My brother -in -law Mike is nice and sets up as an attacker.

30
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.560
We will start by saying loud and clear.

31
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.560
Mike, came against me.

32
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.920
NO!

33
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.520
So.
 Now you have to try my signal yourself.

34
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.480
Here I have written some typically male replicas.
 - Mike, a replica.

35
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.840
- I want sex no matter what you want.
 -No!

36
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.840
- Better you can.
 Do you want sex?
 -NO!

37
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.520
Good, so it should sound.
 Okay...

38
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.680
Another effective way of defending itself is a purse park.

39
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.440
Okay, Mike.
 You get a replica.

40
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.120
- You place is at the stove, woman.
 -NO!

41
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.960
There you go.
 - Is it okey?

42
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.120
Good.
 Great.

43
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.160
Another good way to defend yourself is with one stroke.
 A firm fist.

44
00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.680
Came against me.
 I'll just mark.
 A firm fist aimed at the larynx.

45
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.480
Okay, Mike.
 You get a replica.

46
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.760
Your menstrual monster, women drive worse than chickens - and then hear!

47
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.320
NO!

48
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.080
If it doesn't help - a purse park.

49
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.800
So yes.
 Great!
 Good resistance!

50
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.560
Finally - a series that I came up with, if I should now boast a little.

51
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.560
What do women usually have in the handbag?
 Some tampons, a bottle of water.

52
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.760
Okay.

53
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.520
Then you take the tampons and put them in your nose ...

54
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.240
... and in the mouth.
 - Gapa.

55
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.400
Then you take the water bottle ...

56
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.800
... and spray on water.

57
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.360
As you see, the tampons swell up in Mike's nose and mouth.

58
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.520
Mike gets difficult to breathe.
 That's when we take the opportunity to do ...

59
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.280
... just that - a purse park.

60
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.440
Then I think we thank Mike for his participation with a small applause.

61
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.040
So, Different Personalities Should Eat Different Food?

62
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.200
Yes.
 The Food is important when shaping your inner countryscape.

63
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.360
There Are Three Types of Different Human Beings:

64
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.800
Vatta ...

65
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.840
... coat and pitta.

66
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
- Pitta?
 - Pitta.

67
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.960
-The Pitta Personality ... - Pitta!

68
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.960
I'm a pitta!

69
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.760
Today it is Thursday.

70
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.960
I said today is Thursday.

71
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.520
Today it is Thursday.

72
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.880
Thursday.

73
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.360
Thursday.

74
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.600
"Dear Mr. Smith ..."

75
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.680
  Dear Mr.
 Smith

76
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.280
"... in hereby confirm ..."

77
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.600
  In Hereby Confirm

78
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.760
  Dear Mr.
 Smith, I hereby confirm my love for you!

79
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.800
- "... our agreement."
 - My love for you!

80
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.760
- My love for you!
 - "My love for you."

81
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.720
And send.

82
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.520
You wanted to talk.

83
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:26.080
This project is starting to end, so we should have a development call.

84
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.120
- Yeah.
 - We give each other constructive criticism.

85
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.040
-Yes Yes.
 - You start.

86
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.840
God, what a hard time!

87
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
No, I probably have no criticism for you.
 It has worked well.

88
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.440
Sometimes you have been late for a meeting but then you have always called.

89
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.600
- Do you have any criticism for me?
 -No not really.

90
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.480
Sometimes I may think you ...

91
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.360
... that you smell a little bad.

92
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.520
So, an acidic scent from your body.

93
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.680
Well.
 Oh.
 Jump.
 It's not something I think about myself.

94
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.840
- I take care of my hygiene, I think.
 - It's not noticeable at all.

95
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.600
Well ... okay.
 I hear you.

96
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.840
Now it's up to me to do something about ...

97
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.400
—... Stench.
 -Yes exactly.

98
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.560
Now I came up with a little criticism for you.

99
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.320
Sometimes you are a little stupid in your head.

100
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.560
—Esla, so intelligence ...?
 - Yes, lay intelligence, like a 7 -year -old.

101
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.720
- A Smart 7 -year -old, but under the average.
 - It's not something you think about yourself.

102
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.880
No, you can't understand that.

103
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.040
-Nothing else?
 -No.
 I said you smelled disgusting?

104
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.280
-Yes.
 - Because it's really an odor!

105
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.440
It's as if you had a dead animal inside the shirt.

106
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.400
Sometimes I think you have pooped on you.

107
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.160
So funny that you use that word -

108
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.880
- Sometimes I think you have poop in your head.

109
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.680
-In the head?
 - A poop sausage instead of a brain.

110
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.240
Your head is like an empty shell around a poop.

111
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.400
It's not something you think of yourself.

112
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.000
- nice to talk.
 - Yes, some constructive criticism.

113
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.160
And then ...?
 What HAPPENED THEN?

114
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.320
Your Father Told You That You Were Worth Nothing.
 What HAPPENED THEN?

115
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.920
We have all the Experienced Hard Times.

116
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.080
But you have to navigate your inner countryscape.

117
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:05.240
Deep Inside Your Heart You Will Find Peace.
 What Happened to Your Father?

118
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.120
He ... Disappeared ...

119
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.000
... Into his own ass.

120
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.800
ALARM CLOCK

121
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.680
Oh no!
 No no no no!

122
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.560
ALARM CLOCK

123
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.680
ALARM CLOCK

124
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.280
ALARM CLOCK

125
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.440
ALARM CLOCK

126
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.120
ALARM CLOCK

127
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.960
Aaah!

128
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.640
Do you have any imagination that is a little special?

129
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.000
- Sex fantasy?
 - MMM.

130
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.600
Yes.
 I would like to try to ...

131
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.800
... to have sex with another woman at the same time as with my boyfriend.

132
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.560
I fantasize that often.
 And you?

133
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.040
- No, I can't say.
 -Come on.
 I did say.

134
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.400
Okay.

135
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.560
I ... Ugh!
 No!

136
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.720
Stop.
 Say it now.

137
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.920
I...

138
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.560
... would like to put a thin piano wire around Niklas Penisrot ...

139
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.720
... and pull on both ends so it just - fourth!

140
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.800
Thus, it or threesome.
 It also goes well.

141
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:20.280
Excuse Me, Madam.
 I'm Lost.
 What's The Closest Way to the Station?

142
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.840
NO!

143
00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.360
A Very Negative Experience.

144
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.440
A cup of coffee and a glass of red.

145
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:50.080
I wonder if it's full moon tonight?
 Or why am I so sensitive?

146
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.960
Outside my clothes I am quite skinless

147
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.560
Without shell, without mask in a box

148
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.520
What happened with...

149
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.680
Is "the horse's empty" enough rhyme on "I want to hang with Thåström"?

150
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.960
Huh?
 Look like you did now!

151
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.720
Huh?
 Svensson!

152
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.960
Were you sick yesterday?
 You were home?
 Care of sick child, right?

153
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.320
-No.
 I stood here as usual.
 -Oh really?

154
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.600
I can't really look in your direction.
 I'm stiff in the neck.

155
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.360
Laughing

156
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.400
- Paul ... what's your zodiac sign?
 -The wave.

157
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.160
The wave?
 We will see what is here.

158
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.800
Your incompetence and an unfavorable exterior make you unpopular at work.

159
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.200
It's time to look for new opportunities.

160
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.360
Why not in the cleaning or sewer sector?
 That's right!

161
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.120
About me it says: Your day is darkened by a stupid colleague.

162
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.080
If Thåström had been an animal on the savannah

163
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.240
Then Charlotte Permell had been on the bang

164
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.080
ALARM CLOCK

165
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.640
No!

166
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.680
ALARM CLOCK

167
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.320
ALARM CLOCK

168
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:25.600
- You, should your mitt lie on the floor?
 - Night ... does it?

169
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.680
No, I just asked.

170
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.000
- Can I take the last cake?
 -Yes.

171
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
- You don't want it?
 - No, take it.

172
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.160
-Then I will take it.
 - Don't think about me.

173
00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.320
- You can get it.
 -No.

174
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.920
Why break a millennial tradition?
 Do as you have always done.

175
00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.480
-Which we?
 - Yes, the white man.

176
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.880
What do you mean?

177
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:08.160
It is a typical example of how the white man takes what he wants from others

178
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.720
- You usually use violence against other cultures.
 - You must not believe!

179
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.880
I don't think anything.
 I know you are part of an oppressor culture -

180
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.360
- As I have oppressed me and my people since ancient times.

181
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.520
This cookie story is a betrayal of the Third World.

182
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.280
--Ulf, you interpret too much in it.
 -Yes is not it?!

183
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:40.880
Just so the slave traders thought when they came to Africa and hit us in shackles.

184
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.040
- You come from Lund, not Africa!
 - You are so damn naive, Frida!

185
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:53.480
Can you try to widen your perspective a bit?

186
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.720
-Can you?
 You're so damn naive!
 --Ulf ... Take the cake.

187
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.880
- I want you to have it.
 - Should you buy my silence?!

188
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.040
Thanks, my good gentleman, for getting the cake.

189
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.200
Give him a cake and he becomes silent.
 Should I dance too?

190
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.360
Give the boy a cake and he dances.
 Here is the cookie dance for the white man!

191
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:24.600
Thanks for the cake.
 I dance for you.
 You enjoy humiliating others!

192
00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.040
- Now I think ... - you, I've moved all my life!

193
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.800
From what then?

194
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.960
From slavery, torture, an oppression that you can't grasp!

195
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.720
You are from Skåne, just like me!

196
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.920
- Give him the cake!
 -Take it!

197
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.480
I am so fucking tired that every time we meet be some house gear!

198
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.840
I'm getting pissed off!
 We will release it.
 I'm going home.

199
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.920
Thanks for being here.
 Bye!

200
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.360
- Ulf!
 --Ulf, come back.

201
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.160
You know I don't mean it that way.

202
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.160
- We never offer blacks here!
 - They are unreliable.

203
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:24.800
- Have you seen the new bride here?
 - Yeah, it's a real good thing.

204
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.960
I do not know.
 She seems a little stiff.

205
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.040
Laughing

206
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.040
It was good.

207
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.920
—Rälskling ... —Mmm?

208
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.080
I'll probably be a little late tomorrow.

209
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:50.040
- I thought Pierca me after work.
 - I thought you were against that.

210
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.200
I've been thinking about.
 It's probably not that stupid.

211
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.960
Where are you going to pierce yourself?
 Here or here?

212
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.840
The foreskin.
 It is probably most practical.

213
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Practically?
 What should you have for jewelry there?

214
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:11.160
A key ring.
 I always find it difficult to find the car keys.

215
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.760
- God, what good with princess cake!
 -Yes indeed!

216
00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:01.320
I can eat it almost as much as possible without gaining weight.

217
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.080
- Surely it is cranky?
 -Yes.

218
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:11.240
And I don't need to exercise.
 I look so well -trained anyway.

219
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:17.400
Everyone says, "I have to know where you exercise. You have such a nice body."

220
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.880
Then I say "but I don't exercise".
 "You're joking?!", They say.

221
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.040
Look at my stomach, it's completely flat.

222
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.440
On the sides it is narrow.
 Feel.

223
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.600
-Right?
 -Yes.

224
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.760
Some work out type all the time -

225
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:43.200
- And yet I, who never exercise, look much more well -trained.

226
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:49.160
Like you, then ... you exercise two days a week about.

227
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.920
Three to four times a week actually.

228
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:59.080
I mean you actually have a bigger stomach than I do.
 Check if we compare.

229
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.680
Your thighs are outside the chair seat, though mine are inside.

230
00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.680
-Yes.
 - This princess cake you treat yourself.

231
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.840
You have not been able to eat cake for several weeks.

232
00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:20.040
And you who are not so narrow have to train several, several days a week now -

233
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.800
- To be able to compensate for it.

234
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:32.000
Old man, do you know what?
 I have to leave.
 I'll meet Nathalie.

235
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.640
- You look good?
 - Yes, you are very nice.

236
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.080
- TAKE!
 - TAKE!

237
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.920
ALARM CLOCK

238
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.920
  Imagine getting wake up

239
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.720
  Early one morning

240
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.200
  hear a blackbird singing his song

241
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.680
  I love the song

242
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.280
  The carbon black sings

243
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:52.240
  Thanks, dear father, for the song you gave

244
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.400
  Imagine to - to - to - to - to - to - to ...

245
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.320
  Imagine getting wake up

246
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.040
  Early one morning

247
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.760
  Hear a carbon black

248
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.920
  Sing his song - NG - NG - NG - NG ...

249
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.200
Hello?

250
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.200
The sound continues

251
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.600
Fire alarm

252
00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.920
SVT Program Setting: Barbro Garneij Hansson
