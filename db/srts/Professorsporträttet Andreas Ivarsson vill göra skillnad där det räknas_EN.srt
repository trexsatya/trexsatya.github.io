Read something.

Can you have both?

12
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:41,700
Hi, my name is Andreas Ivarsson and I am a professor of psychology.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,933
The best thing about becoming a professor is that, I think anyway, is yet -

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,567
freer to shape research issues, research groups -

15
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:57,500
And lead the research in a different way than you did before.

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,767
When I applied to college, the only thing that was important was that I would be able to read -

17
00:01:03,767 --> 00:01:08,567
Something with sports. The ambition to stay at the university was not-

18
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:13,467
so strong for the first years, but from the time I became-

19
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:18,167
employee and then started my postgraduate education so have a goal -

20
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:27,267
been to reach professor title, and I have achieved that now.

21
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:31,667
But it has been a process to come up with that -

22
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,000
actually be a goal.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The continued goal of my research is about -

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,500
To try to make a difference in reality.

25
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,100
  We have already

26
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,333
A number of different collaborations with, for example, different sports associations.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,767
The ambition is to further try to deepen that kind of collaboration for -

28
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:59,200
Being able to make a difference where it actually counts.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,033
Being senior researchers means to a large extent that one becomes involved-

30
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:08,433
in different processes, both linked to tutorial as the main supervisor for-

31
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:14,167
doctoral students, and also in different bodies at the university.

32
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,500
It is very fun to-

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,567
have the opportunity to join in and take responsibility and-

34
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:27,867
be involved in different types of processes that develop both individuals -

35
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:30,867
And also the organization.
