1
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.400
<c. Head Treaty> This is Järna.

2
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.440
<c. Head Tapers> A bit into the forest, at the end of <c. Head Treaty> A Dirt Road, lies Solvikskolan.

3
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.840
<c. Head Treaty> My Old School.

4
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.440
<c. Head Tapers> A very different school, <c. Head Treaty> where freedom was everything.

5
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400
<c. Head Tapers> I have many warm memories <c.hhuktaret> from my time at Solvik.

6
00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.440
<c. Head Tapers> But it turned out that my image <c. Huvudpratare> of the school would be challenged.

7
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.120
<c. Head Tapers> It all started with I started <c. Head Tapers> A group on Facebook -

8
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.440
<c. Head Tapers> - To make contact <c. Head Tapers> with others who went to school.

9
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.200
<c. Head Tapers> In just a few days <C. Head Tapers>, the group exploded.

10
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.920
<C. Head Tapers> Hundreds of members wrote.

11
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.960
Did you think you would suddenly get a whole world in your lap?

12
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.240
<c. Head Tapers> I decided on <c. Head Treaty> to contact those who have written.

13
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.320
- We were 15 when we last saw?
 -Yes.
 You were little, I was little.

14
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.000
Which project you have started.
 Shit, what a frame it was.

15
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.840
It's so hard to tell this story to someone else.

16
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.960
- It's so strange.
 - Yes, is it?

17
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.120
I have been called mythomaniac.

18
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.480
<c. Head Tapers> They had raised so many questions in me, <c. Head Tapers> that I couldn't release.

19
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.720
You stir in a very deep stew.

20
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.400
It gets a little cold.

21
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.480
It really is the best and the worst in one place.

22
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.560
It is, so to speak, ungraced soil.

23
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.960
It felt like an experiment.
 I felt very experimented with.

24
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.840
And so the teacher held too.

25
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.760
No one was interested in hearing that there were things going on there.

26
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.960
There is a very beautiful surface.

27
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.720
And under that, some kind of porridge just bubbles.

28
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.360
"Look, what she said. Look, what he was with."

29
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.080
It is to look in a trash can.

30
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.360
I have to know the truth.

31
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.280
It's like you puncture something when you say this.
 Like a balloon.

32
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.080
Where there is a lot of light, there are sharp shadows.

33
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.320
<c.huvudaret> What was it really that we had been <c.hhuktaret> with about, we children at Solvikskolan?

34
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.520
<c.sang> up through the air

35
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.480
<c.sang> away over the ocean

36
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.280
<c.Sang> over the earth

37
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.760
<c.sang> in a staggering journey!

38
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.000
<c.sang> the queen of the morning

39
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.680
<c.sang> with the rosy rod

40
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.000
<c.sang> waving us out

41
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.480
<c.sang> against a waking world

42
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.000
<c. Head Tapers> This painting <c. Head Treaty> You probably recognize.

43
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.760
<c. Head Tapers> Faces that breathe <c. Head Tapers> Hopelessness and Sadness.

44
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.920
<c. Head Tapers> who will soon be entering the squirrel wheel, where <c. Head talkative> they are expected to be a simple Kugge -

45
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.680
<c. Head Treaty> - In the Great Social Machine.

46
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.920
<c.huvudaret> Many of you may recognize <c. Head talkators> Your own schooling in this picture.

47
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.560
<c. Head talkative> School as a storage place, <c.hhuvoretare> A place where dreams disappear.

48
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.280
<C. Head Tapers> and so the girl here.

49
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.360
<c. Head Tapers> The only one in the class that looks through the <c. Head Treaty> window and dreams of something else.

50
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.720
<c. Head talkative> I imagine that the Solvik School <C. Head Treaty> was created just for this girl.

51
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.680
They have started schools in Sweden in many places, so -called.
 Waldorf schools.

52
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.440
There is an increased interest in this kind of alternative thinking.

53
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.440
The queues for the Waldorf schools ...

54
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.840
<c. Head talkative> It was 1984.

55
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.560
<c. Head talkative> I belonged to one of the first <c. Head talkators> student hills at Solvikskolan.

56
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.080
<c. Head Tapers> Everything was about <c. Head Treaty> Play, Freedom and Art.

57
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.680
Art, chaos ...

58
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.240
An incredibly creative place creates incredibly creative people -

59
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.160
- Both in the art world and higher office -

60
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.320
- At the same time as it is a very different place.

61
00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.040
You couldn't imagine it was a school, more that it was a fool's house.

62
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.600
It is so incredibly unique and different.

63
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.640
It's like another planet with completely different norms.

64
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.800
It's up to us, and then we'll see what it gets, kind of.

65
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.280
<c. Head Treaty> Solvikskolan is a Waldorf School.

66
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.320
<c. Huvud Tapers> Waldorf School is known <c. Huvudpratare> to give students more freedom -

67
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.480
<c. Head talkative> –And to put the art <c.hhuktaret> in the center.

68
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.120
<c. Head Treaty> But Solvik School took that <c. Head Treaty> much, much longer.

69
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:48.160
We did not read a single book throughout my school in nine years.

70
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.440
Lessons could be: "Now we'll go out into the woods and talk history."

71
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.320
"We sit down by a tree and draw flowers."

72
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.680
Teaching ... no, it wasn't much, that is.

73
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.720
It was mostly play, actually.

74
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.560
God ... so ...

75
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.920
The dragon game.

76
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.800
Talk about Lajvspel!

77
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.000
The antelope dance.

78
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.880
You did not know what would happen in school.

79
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.040
The spirit falls on: "We run 'the carpet'!"

80
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.800
Everyone throws themselves on the carpet and tries to put out each other.

81
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.880
We went an incredible amount of balance, back and forth.

82
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.680
That's what a school day could look like.

83
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.800
Wrestling, and then go on that wood.

84
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.360
<c. Head Tapers> I've always had the feeling of <c. Head Tapers> that we were part of something big -

85
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.360
<c. Head Treaty> - Something Important.
 <c. Head talkative> The question is just: What?

86
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:07.960
They went to school, without really asking what was the idea.

87
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.840
I've probably never really asked myself what the idea was.

88
00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.120
/Caller tone/

89
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.240
- Hi, Jasper!
 -Hello.
 Do you remember me?

90
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.800
Yes, a little easy.
 It was a long time, and memories nowadays ...

91
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.040
<c. Head Tapers> I am on my way to Erik Norlin, <C. Head Treaty> One of the few teachers from my school time -

92
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.360
<c. Head Tapers> - which was included in the discussions <c.hhuktaret> on Facebook.

93
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.800
I have heard that you put up with fucking life in Solvikskolan.

94
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.080
- You mean in the group?
 -Yes.

95
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.800
Hi, what it went.

96
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.000
-Hello!
 -Hello!

97
00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:01.320
The school is a total waste of life at all.

98
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:08.720
A student in regular school goes about 12,000 hours during his school hours.

99
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.000
It is said that 6,500 hours are spent waiting for the teacher.

100
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.560
Should we remove the cat rack?

101
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:25.520
<c. Head Tapers> Erik was not just one of the teachers.
 <c. Head talkative> He was co -founded by school.

102
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.480
There was a strong initiative -

103
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.680
- Create a more artistic, experimental, testing pedagogy.

104
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:46.040
It was a whole bunch of young teachers who wanted to try the boundaries -

105
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.440
–And that felt that the usual school -

106
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.120
- Not taken advantage of the children's artistic potential.

107
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.840
If you let children dance for an hour every day, sing an hour every day -

108
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.040
–And make intelligent plays an hour every day -

109
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.880
- So they still have time with all other subjects, because of the bonus they receive.

110
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.320
It is clear that they do not lose any knowledge.
 We knew that.

111
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.160
<c. Head Treaty> Solvik School was <c. Huvudpratare> an exciting alternative in a time -

112
00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:28.280
<c. Head Tapers> - Then many people applied to Järna <c. Head Treaty> in search of what was different.

113
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.320
<c. Head talkative> teacher and dedicated parents <c.hhuvoretare> built the school together.

114
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.080
<c. Head Tapers> Many children had some relative as <c.hhuvatare> worked at the school.
 The same for me.

115
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.400
<c. Head talkative> We were like a single big family.

116
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.480
I see it as a continuation of the 68 movement in a way.

117
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.520
They broke with the old bourgeois system and entered something -

118
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.840
- which was more ... anarchist.

119
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.560
It was about breaking out of the compelling form of the old school system.

120
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:13.360
Finding new ways for how to be together and how to learn.

121
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:21.480
What they get in this school, they get nowhere else.

122
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.760
<c. Head Tapers> At Solvikskolan there was no <c. Head Treaty> Rector and no pronounced hierarchy.

123
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.520
<c. Head Tapers> Here everyone's voice <c. Head Tapers> would be equally worthwhile.

124
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.800
That it was different and not at all like any other school -

125
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.200
- As I ever encountered, I understood it as soon as I got there.

126
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:54.280
I came to this place, and there were not many houses at that time.

127
00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.240
But in one of the houses that existed then, it was music lesson.

128
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.200
In a room lay and put children of different ages-

129
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.480
—To all school, embracing each other -

130
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:16.040
- And sang the Allegretto from Beethoven's seven, five -part!

131
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.280
So there ... / she hums / it should be very light.

132
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:29.560
<c.sang> up through the air, away over the ocean

133
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:35.480
<c.Sang> over the earth in a staggering journey!

134
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.400
I was kind of beaten by that.

135
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.520
It was an incredible experience.
 It was magical!

136
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.000
I decided, "Here's my child going!"

137
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.440
Then everything else comes in.
 It is the overstamp, which goes even brighter.

138
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.600
The idea with the Solvik School was -

139
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.640
–Do you through the art and the game open a landscape -

140
00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.280
- That means that one day you want to seek knowledge yourself.

141
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.640
This is something we really, really want together.

142
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.880
It was absolutely wonderful.

143
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.960
<c. Head Tapers> What if it is possible to learn the same <c. Head Treaty> things as in the regular school -

144
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.840
<c. Head Tapers> - But in a much more fun way.

145
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.760
We know students who are not allowed to go to school until in seven, eight -

146
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.840
- And then suddenly everything learns in two years, because they have a hunger.

147
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.640
That the authorities did not know what we were doing was another matter.

148
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.120
What you can be involved in old days!
 I had never dreamed of this.

149
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.320
<c. Head Tapers> When Solvik School started <C. Head Tapers>, free schools were very unusual.

150
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.360
Yes exactly.
 1982.

151
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.880
<c. Head Tapers> The politicians wanted insight into <c. Head talkative> what was going on out there in the woods.

152
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.360
"... on behalf of the school board in a teacher group" -

153
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.960
- "Follow the teaching at the Waldorf schools in Järna."

154
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.320
That was my job.

155
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.280
The Social Democrats were not lovers of a free school.

156
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.360
Everyone would learn just as much.
 Two pancakes were, for all children.

157
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.680
It was a foreign world that I ended up in.

158
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.800
The National Agency for Education came there several times actually.

159
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.800
We normally had no books in school.

160
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.280
Then we have to make a good impression.

161
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.560
I understood that otherwise the school could be bad.

162
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.600
"And that's why you will have books tomorrow."

163
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.200
"And you'll have pens. We'll simply play school."

164
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.160
And ... we pretended to have a lesson, simply.

165
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.160
"And then we'll raise our hand!"

166
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.760
Then it almost became like you became a little patriotic for the school.

167
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.760
You wanted to stand on the school side, against these hawks that came.

168
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:58.080
So it was no more than right that we cheated them.

169
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.640
<c. Head talkative> We were rebels, and we loved it!

170
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.960
<c. Head talkative> But the authorities called the bluff.

171
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.800
"If by school you mean a place where students are taught" -

172
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.200
- "So you become doubtful about what to believe."

173
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.960
That style did not suit me, that you could lie under a bench and listen.

174
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.280
It was not the same pli on the kids in school.

175
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:32.360
They had no curriculum, where it said: "Do so and so in that grade."

176
00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.520
There was nothing like that.

177
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.400
Children need to learn things.

178
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.640
You can't just do this and think it works.

179
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.600
It was a bit flum.
 It was without a doubt.

180
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.120
<c. Head talkative> To survive, the school was forced <c.hhuvatare> into increasingly advanced maneuvers.

181
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:04.080
Every year they wrote a report to the National Agency for Education: "We have done this."

182
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.080
It came so to speak a rescue angel once a year and fixed the paper.

183
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.000
So, cheated?
 Can you say so?

184
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.320
Yes you could say that.

185
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.000
But it is important to cheat properly.

186
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.120
"She gave what the emperor would have, and to God what God needed."

187
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.360
<c. Head talkative> We managed to get away with the authorities.

188
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.160
<c. Head Tapers> For Erik and the others at the school <C. HOVA PREPRAPER> it was a victory.

189
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.200
<c. Head Tapers> They were able to continue to fight <c. Head Treaty> for their vision.

190
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.400
The idea is nice, and I certainly think there is a lot in it.

191
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:57.000
But if you have no book to read in high school, it will still be difficult.

192
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.280
You can't just take it through the air.
 You still have to have something.

193
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.400
Everything was very individual.

194
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.960
For some, free schooling worked very well.

195
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.120
For others, it didn't work at all.

196
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.800
It resulted in a bunch of kids -

197
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:29.080
- Which did not fit in anywhere and did not learn enough.

198
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.400
I didn't understand how bad it was -

199
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.600
- I started looking for jobs and education.

200
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.360
It was very difficult, because I couldn't write.

201
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.160
If I were to look for a job and sit at the checkout ... Main count does not work.

202
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.360
The grades say that I have VG in math, which is not true.

203
00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.680
I can't math.

204
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:16.640
There is a reason to learn the subjects that are in regular school.

205
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.840
I was very able to have them.

206
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
It is missing tremendously in adult life.

207
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.280
I will always end up.

208
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.520
<c. Head talkative> Nemi and Iduna are far from <c.hhuktaret> alone about their experience.

209
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.160
<c. Head Tapers> Facebook group is full <c.hhuvoretare> of similar stories.

210
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.320
I felt stolen in an education.

211
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.280
It doesn't feel like I've been taught anything.

212
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.600
It is still true that you cannot read and write -

213
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.600
- Then you are handicapped.

214
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.280
<c. Head Tapers> It now strikes me what risk <c. Head Tapers> Those who founded the school had taken.

215
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I'm curious about how your thinking went -

216
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.440
- When you created such a radical school.

217
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.160
It was probably so radical, but it was probably also so -

218
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.800
- That we were looking to try new roads all the time.

219
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.240
There was no syllabus.

220
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.320
There was a creative creative void.

221
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.360
You have to think more of a chaos but a creative chaos-

222
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.280
- As eventually arranges.

223
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.800
There was no plan.

224
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:50.840
–And how ... okay ... - Yes, we can keep going.

225
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.040
I just get a little barred, so I understand.

226
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.160
If you need to take a break, you will get.

227
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.200
So there was no plan?
 Can we agree on that?

228
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.360
Yes is not it?
 It's a little scary.

229
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.480
It is, so to speak, ungraced land.

230
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:15.240
That was what was the plan, that there was no plan.

231
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.040
Do you get it?
 A little?

232
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.440
<c. Head talkative> It's a worrying thought.

233
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:37.160
<c.huvudtaret> Had everything been an experiment, <c.hhuhuktare> with our future as an effort?

234
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.560
<c. Head Tapers> There is only one way <c. Head Tapers> to find out.

235
00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.280
Here we went the bus.
 784.

236
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.480
<c. Head Tapers> I have to go back to my school-

237
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.000
<c. Head Treaty> - There is a person <c. Head talkative> who should be able to answer.

238
00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:00.760
Do I understand you right, that you, Ivar and Pär were the founders of this new?

239
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.240
It was Pär Ahlbom above all.

240
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.720
<c. Head talkative> I have to meet Pär Ahlbom.

241
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.160
Pär is a person ...

242
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.600
How to describe charisma?

243
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.160
I would say that Pär was more of a spiritual leader, or guru.

244
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.760
A magician.

245
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.400
Erik: Pär Ahlbom, he is a crazy devil.

246
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.920
There is a lot I am pissed at him for.

247
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.120
Pear's words have probably been a team.

248
00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.880
Erik: But he did this anyway.

249
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.560
<c.hoe -Catcher> If there is any <c. Head Treaty> who can describe the school's vision -

250
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.640
<c. Head Tapers> - and what we have been through as a child, <C. Head Tapers> So it's Pär.

251
00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.000
- Now Pär comes!
 -Hello.

252
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.520
-Hello!
 Long time no see.
 - No, it really wasn't yesterday.

253
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.360
-Do you remember me?
 -Yes.
 We'll see what this is going to be.

254
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.920
Common teaching is fatal.

255
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.720
A lot of dates with different wars and things that I got to learn.

256
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.880
Full shit just.
 What the hell am I going to have a lot of years?

257
00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.560
I can list Halland's rivers in a row.

258
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.920
Ätran, Viskan, Nissan, Lagan, blah, blah, blah.

259
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.920
Like a dog.
 The dog knows when I say "Come!"
 That it should come and not go.

260
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.920
And I say "Fy!"
 So it feels ...

261
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.080
It's dressage, for hell.

262
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:18.320
For a child, this is so crazy, so it can't even understand it.

263
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.280
Hello.

264
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.840
What was the vision in the beginning?

265
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.840
It is not possible to remove school, so you do a school that removes school.

266
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.960
What did you think about that?

267
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.280
Not to moralize, not to force.

268
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:43.160
I have never met a child who does not want to.
 Never.

269
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:49.560
I have only met children who want to learn more than I can teach them.

270
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.400
<c. Head Treaty> Pär lives right next to the school.
 He <c.huvudtaret> no longer has the same central role -

271
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.560
<c. Head Tapers> - But he is still a mentor <c. Huvudpratare> to several teachers at Solvik.

272
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:12.600
I have known children for 50 years.
 It's sunbathing.

273
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.520
I have not met an only child who wants what they do then.

274
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.040
In, out, in, out ...

275
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.880
They want to live and change things.

276
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:33.400
And then, 20 years later, they sit and drink coffee and talk shit.

277
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.640
I call that murder.

278
00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.720
You have shit in handling the cleaning.

279
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.840
And then it flows along the house, and the foundation gets damage.

280
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.320
- We follow in.
 - It's fun to watch.

281
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.440
<c. Head Tapers> There is something with Pär.

282
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:04.640
<c. Head Tapers> When I listen to him, I understand <c. Head Precate> I how he could captivate people.

283
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:11.200
The children should not live a wise life and learn to become poor people.

284
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.560
They should not be adapted to society, they should change society.

285
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.520
<c. Head talkative> What he says is controversial.

286
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:26.160
<c.huvudaret> Yet it sounds as obvious, <c. Head talkative> like he's sitting on the fact.

287
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.600
Dance!
 Sing!
 Paint!
 Play!

288
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.640
Shit in the second!

289
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.280
It comes back by itself.
 Math, geography and spelling.

290
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:45.760
You can calmly flush this for 25 years.

291
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.240
Then you would see fuck.

292
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.040
<c. Head Tapers> There was a plan, after all.

293
00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:02.800
<c. Head Tapers> We would never learn <c. Head Tapers> The same things as in regular school.

294
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.080
That line has meant a lot.

295
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:15.440
<c. Head Tapers> My adult I cannot turn a blind eye to <c. Head talkative> that that plan had consequences.

296
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.640
<c. Head Tapers> Is there not a risk that the students <c. Head talkative> will not learn anything at all?

297
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:26.800
No, I can promise that risk, it is not on the map.

298
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:33.320
But they learn something other than I want them to learn.
 Something completely different.

299
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.120
<c. Head Treaty> My first years at Solvik School -

300
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.680
<c. Head Tapers> - I stated <c. Head Treaty> almost exclusively in nature.

301
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.040
<c. Head Tapers> I plunched in the river, caught vipers <C. Head Tapers> and played Pyroman.

302
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200
Hello!

303
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.680
I have warm and fond memories of you.

304
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:07.360
A little mischievous, fun, noisy from time to time - a little wild.
 We were all kind of.

305
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:15.200
We went to the same class, so we have had some projects.

306
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.160
When we fired in the reeds ... You were completely sweaty.
 It just said "woof".

307
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:27.120
<c. Head talkative> Sure it could go wrong sometimes.
 <c. Head talkative> But how else should you learn?

308
00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.480
I think it's good.

309
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.200
The lack of being exposed creates people without understanding.

310
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.560
<c. Head Tapers> We would not be <c. Head Tapers> Futtish people.

311
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:45.280
They probably wanted the world to change radically.
 That was the dream.

312
00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.640
<c. Head Tapers> We would not be adapted <c. Head Treaty> to society.

313
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.320
<c. Head talkative> We would change society.

314
00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.000
I definitely have predominantly positive from it.

315
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:07.120
But I can see how negative it has hit many others.

316
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:16.720
It was crazy, free, cool.
 I had not wanted another schooling.

317
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.600
But it was still tough, it was still a hard atmosphere.

318
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.880
In all the beautiful, there was always some back.

319
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:35.760
The difference between being left in peace and being left in the knit -

320
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.920
- It is very delicate really.

321
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:47.080
It looks like the students are given freedom - in fact you shit in them.

322
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.200
Children need strong frames, and in a class where there were no frames -

323
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.480
- So it was the children who had to set the boundaries and do the structure.

324
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:06.760
It became a bit like the "Lord of the Flies".
 So, it became ...

325
00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.440
A lot of bullying.

326
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.360
Much vulnerability.

327
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.880
Between the children it was a lot of violence.

328
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.920
My first three years were such years where much has disappeared in oblivion -

329
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.160
- Very black.

330
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:34.200
I have some memories of being locked up in a room ...

331
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.280
... maybe beaten, I don't know.

332
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.720
One gets thrown into some form of freedom -

333
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.720
- There is the strong thing so clearly wins.

334
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.120
And then it becomes strongest at the top and weakest at the bottom.

335
00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.760
You had to blame yourself if you couldn't do it.

336
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.800
I ran through the forest and tried to get into the classroom first ...

337
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.960
... to hide.

338
00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.640
My hiding place was at the top of the stove.
 I stacked benches -

339
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.960
- climbed up and settled at the top, because no one else dared to come.

340
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.400
There I could lie for pretty much all day.

341
00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.240
Those who wanted to bully me had free hunting season.

342
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.720
Everyone had to do what they wanted.

343
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.440
So a lot of days I just sat up in the forest waiting for -

344
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.440
- That the school day would be over, so I could go home again.

345
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:09.080
No, you have to ... Yes, you see.
 You have to wiggle.

346
00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.560
Here is unusually little bullying.

347
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.160
So, now it went.

348
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.120
They were safe.

349
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.880
Here there is less student bullying than elsewhere.

350
00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:31.080
So it's crap, I would say.

351
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.640
Let's see.

352
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.840
There are different newspaper clips, and this is me.

353
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.120
Where.
 Solvik.

354
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.000
It is about a school where bullying does not exist.

355
00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.800
It was so called.
 "At our school we have no bullying."

356
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.400
"No, we haven't. We have no bullying."
 So it was called all the time.

357
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.400
"There is no bullying here. This is the bullying -free school."

358
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.440
It was so.

359
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:20.480
At the same time, I and absolutely others were bullied for many, many years.

360
00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.800
Beware now.

361
00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.000
You can do better and better.

362
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:35.800
<c. Head Tapers> We have been in the same place <c. Head Treaty> at the same time.

363
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.040
<c. Head Tapers> Yet we have in some way completely different <c. Head talkators> experiences of what has happened.

364
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.200
<c. Head Tapers> Several say they believe that <c. Head Tapers> There was more bullying at Solvik -

365
00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.360
<c. Head Treaty> —En at other schools.

366
00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.600
Those who were brave climbed all the way up -

367
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.960
- And jumped down.
 Right like bungy jump.

368
00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:14.440
<c. Head talkative> but many describe that there were <c.hoe -Catcher> a way to get out of vulnerability.

369
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.640
Yes, speed up, then!

370
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:28.000
One was a hundred times better if one dared to jump between trees -

371
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.440
- Climb at the top or do dangerous things.

372
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.800
It was good to be crazy and try the boundaries.

373
00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.960
"The most important thing for man is mobility and courage."

374
00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:46.320
"Anyone who is physically brave in his childhood becomes mental in his life."

375
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.680
In the four, I started jumping from the tree.

376
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:57.240
I had a great need to feel that I was doing after my first three years.

377
00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:03.280
The teachers saw me more.
 I was hooked on jumping when I felt seen.

378
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:14.360
I loved swinging and throwing myself out of there and doing volts.

379
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.320
I dared everything and got so much praise for it.

380
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.080
You could lift a child in some form of spotlight.

381
00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.160
An extremely light, like.

382
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.880
Josef: There were incredible opportunities to ... yes, kind of die.

383
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.560
I had done that trick a hundred times.

384
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.440
And then I go out and swing, make a volt in the air -

385
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.640
-To throw myself up-and-down.

386
00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.560
And it was fantastic in the air!
 It was like flying.
 I loved it.

387
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:09.120
So don't be the rope there.
 And then I fell on the ground.

388
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.480
I have crushed a lot of the spine.

389
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.320
It changed my life pretty much.
 From being a "daredevil" -

390
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.880
- To not even be able to run and definitely not climb.

391
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:51.560
<c. Head Tapers> When I was little, Children <c. Head Tapers> from the swing time and time again.

392
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.800
<c. Head Tapers> Several were allowed to go ambulance helicopter <C. Head talkative> to the emergency room.

393
00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:08.440
That the children have done badly and so, has it been worth it?

394
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.280
Yes, it is disappearing few who have done badly.

395
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.200
They hurt when they run and fall and scrub their knees.

396
00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.840
Much worse than when they fall down from the rope.

397
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.680
<c. Head talkative> you may remember <c.hhuktaret> what you want to remember.

398
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.400
<c. Head Tapers> But may it really have been <c. Head Treaty> a bullying culture at my school -

399
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.880
<c. Head Tapers> - As Drive some to turn in and out of <c. Head Treaty> on themselves to be seen?

400
00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:59.120
<c. Head Tapers> and if it really was so, <c. Head talkative> Why didn't I see this?

401
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.280
/Caller tone/

402
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.640
-Yes?
 -Hello!
 Is it Merete?

403
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.800
-Yes.
 - Hi, it's Jasper Lake.

404
00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.720
But hi!
 Hello there!

405
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:22.600
<c. Head Tapers> Especially a person has become symbol <c.hhuvatare> for what Solvik meant to me:

406
00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.200
<c. Head talkative> My former teacher Merete.

407
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:32.240
<c. Head Tapers> Her influence on my life <c. Head Treaty> has been huge.

408
00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:41.040
<c. Head Tapers> She was not only my teacher, <c. Head Practer> She is also one of the school's founder -

409
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.280
<c. Head Tapers> –And must be able to help me understand <c. Head talkative> How these two worlds are interconnected.

410
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.200
Yes, hello.
 Here she is.

411
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.400
-Hello!
 - Longer than you thought, right?

412
00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.560
-Yes.
 What nice to see you.
 -The same.

413
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.720
Nämen, please someone.
 Here you have become a big man.

414
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.000
Bearded...

415
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.240
-Come in!
 -Thanks.

416
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.480
It's so fun to see you.
 Very special.

417
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.560
- You are so important to me.
 -I know.

418
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:31.720
My best picture of you is when you get away over the ice home.

419
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:38.240
Do you remember?
 It was fatal.
 I saw you like a black dot there.

420
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.440
-Why?
 - It was so dramatic all the time.

421
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:51.120
It was just full speed, as well.
 That's what it was.

422
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.880
It's so fun to get an adult perspective on something -

423
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:05.600
- Which has been one's life as a child.
 You didn't really know ...

424
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:13.480
No, you know, the whole thing with being a teacher -

425
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:20.040
- It is to get to a life where you notice -

426
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:27.040
- It will be fun for the kids to go to school.

427
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.680
For me it has always been a school-

428
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.440
- Where you have to become a capable person.

429
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:40.680
I have never been opposed to education.

430
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:48.320
We had talked a lot about which schools we went to and how sad it was.

431
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.840
And so it was just: "Then we don't."

432
00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.760
Yes, all these thoughts ...

433
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.760
They have to fall.
 They have to fight when they are unlucky.

434
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.200
So.
 Yes.

435
00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.960
If you fall and hit, then you get a patch.

436
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.000
<c. Head Tapers> It is a dear reunion <c. Huvudpratare> to meet Merete after all the years.

437
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:26.000
-Oops.
 -Hello.

438
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.960
<c. Head talkative> but at the same time it is something <c.hhuktaret> that disturbs me.

439
00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:37.120
<c. Head Tapers> The words that used to feel so important and <c. Head talkative> big, suddenly feels pretty empty.

440
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.600
Without the parents, it would not have gone.

441
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:48.200
They were, as I remember it, very positive.
 Very happy.

442
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:54.360
It came home children who were happy, who thought life was fun.

443
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.200
<c. Head Tapers> Merete was an adult, a teacher -

444
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.880
<c. Head Tapers> –And just seems to have <c. Head Tapers> Positive Memories of School.

445
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.680
<c. Head Tapers> Could she really have missed <c. Head Tapers> Everything else that happened?

446
00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.200
<c. Head Tapers> all that wasn't good?

447
00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.640
Sigrid's situation, can you talk about it?

448
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.640
Her situation at school?
 Yes...

449
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.800
I just have to take some water or something.

450
00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.240
I can not...

451
00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.120
One of my daughters was severely bullied.

452
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.800
One of the most special people I ever met.

453
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:59.440
Extremely intelligent, and at the same time incredibly unaware of the outside world.

454
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:13.320
Some students did not feel that they were valuable.

455
00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:20.040
There were some who were not in principle attributed to any human value.

456
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.520
And then ... you could drive with them.

457
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.320
And it was often on teachers' initiative.

458
00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:41.640
<c. Head Tapers> Sigrid must thus have been bullied <c. Head Treaty> for many years.

459
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.880
<c. Head Tapers> but not only by students, <c. Head Treaty> but also by their teacher.

460
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:54.280
She just had this that she attacked in her own group.

461
00:44:54.440 --> 00:45:01.040
When she took over the class that Sigrid went in, she attacked her.

462
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.400
We got structure.
 She came in with structure and proper lessons.

463
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.080
I began to learn stuff.
 It was awesome.

464
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:16.000
She also came in with bullying, especially against some students.

465
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.840
And Sigrid was ... I want to remember that Sigrid was pretty exposed.

466
00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:29.200
Instead of helping her, she came with glitches that hurt.

467
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.440
In the end, it was so awful that I said:

468
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.680
"I will not release you until you tell you."

469
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.640
And then it crawled how terribly exposed she had been.

470
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.680
I called the class teacher and said:

471
00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:57.920
"She won't come to school until this is resolved."

472
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:08.800
Two three.
 /Multiply French Renaissance song/

473
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:19.720
<c. Head Tapers> Helena is still a teacher <c.hhuktaret> at Solvik.

474
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.200
I understand that I have to bite in a sour apple.

475
00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.760
I have to take this, because that's the shadow pages.

476
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.080
<c. Head talkative> She is aware of the accusations <c. Head Treaty> that is directed at her.

477
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:43.120
<c. Head Tapers> She has nevertheless chosen to meet me, <c. Huvudpratare> to give her picture of what has happened.

478
00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:47.040
I can say the wrong things sometimes, it slips out of me.

479
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:53.280
But it can be loose from its context, I do not know.

480
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.640
It's sad, and I can't feel in me -

481
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.960
- That I needed to attack her, because she did not disturb.

482
00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:07.040
She was one that one would be afraid of.
 Honestly, it feels -

483
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:12.520
- As you have to find a scapegoat because she didn't feel good.

484
00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:18.080
She was special.
 She had speech difficulties and an eye that hung.

485
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:23.360
But she had friends.
 It wasn't bad for her, what I saw.

486
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:28.520
It would have been much worse in another school, I think.

487
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.520
She had a speech error and was a little clumsy in her movements and so on.

488
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:46.320
At Solvik you would like to be graceful and beautiful and move nicely.

489
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.320
It wasn't her strong side.

490
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:55.640
But the really unpleasant - and I don't understand it - when we talked ...

491
00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:02.040
I was in the college.
 The consequence was that she would change -

492
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:07.840
- Not that the school would address a very serious problem.

493
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.320
The blame ended up on her.
 "Clearly she gets bullied, she is who she is."

494
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:26.160
She struggled through the last three years.
 I can't say too much -

495
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.640
- Because she's no longer here.
 It's really her story.

496
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:40.720
<c. Head Tapers> Sigrid died in a traffic accident <c.hhuvoretare> when she was 20 years old.

497
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.880
<c. Head Tapers> I remember her well -

498
00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:47.840
<c. Head Tapers> - But she was so bullied <C. Head Precatee> Sadly, I had passed me by.

499
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.960
She never got any redress -

500
00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:55.360
- And I'm ashamed that I didn't make sure she got it.

501
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.120
It was a really wise.
 Embarrassing.

502
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:06.040
It is difficult as hell, that is, when it comes to Sigrid.

503
00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.280
Yes, ush.

504
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:26.400
<c. Head Tapers> According to Kerstin, the blame on <c. Head Treaty> Sigrid was because she was who she was.

505
00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.960
<c.hoe Catcher> But this is not just <c.hhuktaret> about Sigrid.

506
00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:37.600
<c. Head Tapers> So many of those I met, <c. Huvudpratare> who wrote in the Facebook Group -

507
00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:42.040
<c. Head Tapers> - Describes similar experiences <c.hhuktaret> with other teachers.

508
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:51.440
There are certainly former students who have been ill -

509
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.160
–And chooses to see it so too.

510
00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:02.840
Pär: It's a garbage can.
 "Look, what she said, and what he was with."

511
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.120
It is to look in a trash can.
 That's it.

512
00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.200
It's a trash can.
 Or a skiing, even.

513
00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:17.040
The stool should end up somewhere.
 What the hell...!

514
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.200
I don't believe in those memories.

515
00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:24.240
Bullying we have always taken very seriously.

516
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.960
I think they simply ... it's "fake news".

517
00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:35.080
<c. Head Tapers> For Pär are the memories "fake news".

518
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:41.240
<c.huvudaret> But Erik has a completely different view of <c. Head talkative> What the previous students have told.

519
00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.640
They confirmed what I had already avoided thinking, yes.

520
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:51.200
What I knew was true, which I didn't want to be true.

521
00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:59.880
There is a very beautiful surface, and that is the one you see.

522
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:10.000
And under that, some kind of porridge just bubbles, of something else.

523
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.200
And how to ...

524
00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:17.240
It is almost impossible to understand.
 What is it, like?

525
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:26.720
<c. Head Tapers> The deeper I dig, <c. Head Tapers> the less I understand.

526
00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:33.520
<c. Head Tapers> How can two so different memories <c. Head talkators> be accommodated in one place?

527
00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:38.480
<c. Head Tapers> How have I been able to have a <c. Head Treaty> so positive feeling of my schooling -

528
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:43.400
<c. Head Tapers> - When so many other <c. Head Tapers> have a completely different experience?

529
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:51.040
Your role in class and school was pretty ... I experienced you ...

530
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:57.400
You had some form of ... You weren't so insistent in it, I experience.

531
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.280
You had a free position in your class anyway.

532
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.960
It was socially pretty nice for you.

533
00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:12.400
Merete thought I was something, and that was absolutely crucial.

534
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.680
I remembered you.
 I remember it was a lot about you.

535
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:26.080
Now I remember you were - and then I mean in good sense -

536
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:30.560
- A favorite at Merete.
 She really loved you as a student.

537
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:36.640
It was very Jasper here and Jasper there, and you would have the lead role.

538
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.760
Yes, she was interested.

539
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:45.560
Are you brave enough to jump high?
 Can you paint beautifully?

540
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:53.240
Can you sing beautifully?
 It is important, as you can.

541
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:59.040
That you had a great soul, that you were so open and flexible -

542
00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.600
- And could show your feelings and express feelings.

543
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.680
She was in some way fascinated by who you were.

544
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.320
<c. Head Tapers> I have always thought <c. Huvudpratare> that the Solvik School was created -

545
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.920
<c. Head Treaty> - To Arm <C. Head Tapers> This little girl with wings.

546
00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:37.640
<c. Head Tapers> And so it was enough.
 I was a <c. Head talkative> such a child, and I was refueled -

547
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:44.240
<c. Head Tapers> - With Freedom, Art, Modet <c. Head Treaty> and the feeling of being selected.

548
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.400
<c. Head Tapers> because I was seen <c. Head Treaty> as the right kind of child.

549
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.440
There was a shadow side.
 Some were on the other side of the fence.

550
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.640
- Was there favorites and so?
 -Yes.

551
00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:03.040
That there was more a rule than exceptions in some way.
 Did you see any of that?

552
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:08.000
Yes, actually, when you say it, I recognize it.

553
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.120
It's strange that I haven't thought about it anymore.

554
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:17.920
When you say it, I recognize it, but ...

555
00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:33.800
It's strange.
 Because I was always popular with the adults ...

556
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:39.680
... so I didn't notice the division as much.

557
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:47.280
It is very tragic that it is so, but I probably thought everyone felt that way.

558
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.760
And it feels very sick.

559
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.160
Very sick.

560
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.600
It's almost the worst thing you can do to children:

561
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:07.400
To divide them into "more worthy" or "more popular".

562
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.600
"According to my values, you are not as favored."

563
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.200
And it hurts.

564
00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:30.720
Many described it as that there were some kind of ideal children in some way.

565
00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:33.880
Can you experience that it was so?

566
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:38.920
I know it was like that, yes.
 I know there were ideal children.

567
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.880
I know there was ... yes.

568
00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.840
Yes I know.
 I know it was like that.

569
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.400
Yes.

570
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.160
You know it's ...

571
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.480
That said, the school has a very dark side too -

572
00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:09.600
- With ideal and how it should be, how to change people -

573
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.840
- And what was real.

574
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.800
Yes, there were.

575
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.960
I was constantly questioning this.

576
00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.200
For me it was all the time:

577
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.960
"This school is for everyone. It is for everyone."

578
00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:33.120
Although I felt that not everyone was involved in it.

579
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:39.400
Without it, like that.
 But for me it was always everyone.

580
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.600
All children.

581
00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:49.440
I got a bit like that ... not bullied, but: "She has not really understood."

582
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.760
Did you talk openly in the college about what a child would be like?

583
00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:01.240
Yes, you would go in a certain way and be ... "So you would be."

584
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.480
Yes...

585
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.400
Nice and ... I don't know.

586
00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:12.560
You would be brave, you would be mobile, you would be happy.

587
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.400
- I don't know ... - mm.

588
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:35.320
You stir in a very deep stew.

589
00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:41.320
You do it.
 But it does not matter.

590
00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:47.520
But it gets a little cold.
 It gets a little cold ...

591
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:52.360
- Is it cold for you too?
 - Yes, it actually is.

592
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:58.840
It will be, because you are stuck in history.

593
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.040
You are stuck in this.
 It is not possible to get away from it.

594
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.240
- It will be up ... - yes, just that.

595
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:12.240
... looked at, left.

596
00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.400
But...

597
00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.880
Yes...

598
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.520
There was...

599
00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:35.240
There was something behind it.
 I don't know what the school was for.

600
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:42.040
I just feel like a darkness.

601
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.800
It was all the time as an invisible threat:

602
00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:49.680
I do not take care of myself, then it will be the bench.

603
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:56.200
And you felt that here at school something is going on other than what we see?

604
00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:01.680
One of the other students had to hit and kick me with his approval.

605
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.760
"Are you totally fucking stupid in your head?"

606
00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.720
Oops.
 So bad that you were injured in the soul.

607
00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.680
