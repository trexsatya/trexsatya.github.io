00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,280
“It is genetic” or “it sits in the genes” we hear often-

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,760
-But what does that mean and can we say so? We will learn more about that now.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,160
DNA is an abbreviation of deoxyribo- nucleic acid and is a large molecular-

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,640
-which containing information for how your upcoming cells should work-

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,840
-And is a drawing for how the body should be built up.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,400
The DNA structure can be likened to a ladder.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,080
The sides consist of sugar molecules and phosphorus that are repeated in succession.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,720
The step pins consist of nitrogen bases:

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,520
Adenin, thymine, cytosine and guanine.

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,280
It is the order of nitrogen bases

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,240
-which just gives you your unique DNA.

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,440
Adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanin-

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,920
-Dructions are shortened with the letters A, T, C and G.

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,960
The nitrogen bases must be assembled in a certain way for it to work.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,560
A binds with T and C binds with G.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,880
Together they form base pairs.

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,920
This means that if one side of the steps has the consequence A, T, A, G, C-

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,720
-So the other t, a, t, c, G.

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,880
A certain number of base pairs then form what we call a gene.

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,840
The DNA molecule itself becomes long-

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,200
-And gets the structure as a helix-shaped ladder, a DNA spiral.

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,200
The DNA spirals can be up to two meters long if stretch out them-

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,320
-But to get a seat in our cells they are tightly rolled like new-

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,080
-When we call chromosomes. A human has 46 chromosomes.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,400
They are composed in pairs, 22 pieces, with the same genetic information.

26
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,560
The twenty -one couple are gender chromosomes.

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,720
Depending on the gender, they have different combinations.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,800
If it is a set of an X chromosome and an Y chromosome ...

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,240
... it is a man.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
If you change the Y chromosome with an x-

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,240
-The there will be a woman with two X chromosomes.

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,360
The chromosomes, your DNA, are available in exact copies in all your cells.

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,600
We can say that everyone sits with the same drawing for how your body should be built.

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,520
Different genes are turned on in the cells to give them specific tasks-

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,440
-Something we call gene regulation.

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,840
It helps the cell regulate its tasks.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,280
Skin cells are coded to divide quickly and quickly produce skin.

38
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,280
The nerve cells, with long committees, are coded to send out signals-

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,080
-And the blood cell is coded to transport oxygen to all our cells.

40
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,120
To be able to do all this, the cell needs to produce protein.

41
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,000
They are the body's building stone-

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,600
-And builds tissues, bones and organs.

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,600
They also ensure that cells can communicate with each other.

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,040
Can you say that everything is genetic? No, that does not work.

45
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,320
There is a lot of research on what is inheritance and what is the environment.

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,440
For example, one-egg twins that have identical hereditary mass are compared

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,640
-But that still becomes different in both appearance and personality.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,800
So the DNA gives us certain characteristics and conditions-

49
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,400
-But our environment has a major impact and impact on our genetic mass.

50
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,040
If you have genes to become tall, but go through a trauma in puberty-

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,320
-Can the surrounding factors, such as the environment, dominate your genes.

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,200
The same goes for diseases. If you have cancer in your family-

53
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,240
-You, by eating right and exercising, never have to get sick.

54
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,040
So to say that everything is genetically is not possible.

55
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,640
But your DNA definitely has a crucial role in being you.

56
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,600
