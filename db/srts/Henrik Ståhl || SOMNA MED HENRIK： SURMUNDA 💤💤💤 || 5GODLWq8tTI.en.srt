1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.040
Hello and welcome to fall asleep with Henrik.

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.910
Your.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.389
Devout.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.170
Worker bee.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.690
Your.

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.350
Sad.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.290
Buddly Gumma in the night.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.060
I am Henrik.

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.420
And it is you who are falling asleep.

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.380
And that's as it is.

11
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.040
What happens happens

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.390
And right now there is nothing we can do about it.

13
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.160
Now we start.

14
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.710
And hello fall asleep.

15
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.199
Surly or happy.

16
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.980
Sorry or completely unstable.

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.080
My name is Henrik and if this is strange and.

18
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.130
Compliant.

19
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.470
That's how it is.

20
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.880
Because it is here all over it is the whole pod's thought and idea.

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.740
I will talk until you fall asleep.

22
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.540
And i won't stick to anything

23
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.340
Or if I want it.

24
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.260
If so then I will stick to some kind of red thread.

25
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.249
But I will simply talk.

26
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.429
Until the sleep enters or the other

27
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.570
As you are looking for what it is now is when you can use

28
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.600
As they are Henrik to exactly what you want.

29
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.860
Today is a story of cuts.

30
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.149
So I will tell you something and then before you now rush away and.

31
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.600
Roars with Tordön's voice.

32
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.560
That Henrik Ståhl should hold on and mansplain

33
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.970
things for me

34
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.980
So I just want to say that it may well happen that it will be so,

35
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.620
But then that is as it is

36
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.990
and that there is nothing you can do about

37
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.929
It right now.

38
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.280
Therefore, when you listen to this, it is already recorded.

39
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.769
You cannot influence what has already happened in the past.

40
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.989
Equal.

41
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.070
As firm as the course of time lies the order of the recording.

42
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.100
It is clear that you can choose another section.

43
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.579
Or another podcast

44
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.910
And you can choose a lot of different things, but you can't change the contents of it

45
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.590
Here at it.

46
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.760
I quite often get desires for themes and.

47
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.550
Substances.

48
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.170
And I am very happy for them often so I get ideas from them and feel that

49
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.640
has been a bit fun to try to get in and when sitting here and talking so can

50
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.440
It pops up then.

51
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.820
Yes, but that's exactly the letter and then it can show up.

52
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.420
So you are welcome to write to me and come up with wishes if you do

53
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.290
with the little fox behind the ear that it is not certain that I will be able to do

54
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.130
something of it.

55
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.040
Because it becomes what it is simply.

56
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.560
But, with that said, we are now starting today's story.

57
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.910
Which is aimed at you, which may be a bit.

58
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.060
Annoyed or angry or sad, or

59
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.440
So that you have some kind of negative

60
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.460
Feeling in the body like.

61
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.430
Bent to handle just like this right now.

62
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.820
Acidity.

63
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.230
The so -called surry.

64
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.010
It is the opposite of love

65
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.760
Ugh what what

66
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.660
Robban Brobergs I became now.

67
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.280
This is about.

68
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.380
A city.

69
00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.600
Called Surmunda anyway.

70
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.170
Surmunda was one.

71
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.680
Sooty sour location enclosed.

72
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.510
Under one a thick cloud cover.

73
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.210
The narrow dirty streets.

74
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.299
Old.

75
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.620
Such brutal historic buildings.

76
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.670
Constantly hidden in half -dark.

77
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.030
Because the clouds constantly pulled like a blanket between.

78
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.130
The city's surry and and.

79
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.760
Heaven.

80
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.250
It felt like a constant lid was over surry.

81
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.980
A gray lid.

82
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.730
Do you know something that has a gray lid

83
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.790
How many gray lids are there in the universe

84
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.800
Thus, to the number exactly.
 There must be one.

85
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.430
There must be a figure there.

86
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.390
That thought of a lot lately.

87
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.930
How many times

88
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.470
How many sighs has there so far occurred in the universe

89
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.410
There must be a real figure.

90
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.090
It is clear that you have to decide what a sigh is.

91
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.080
So you could have fun with it a little to say then that.

92
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.260
Or joking to what you make it a little more fun by saying that o k

93
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.469
The sigh must have been performed by a human

94
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.330
It must have been performed in an indignant state thus not an relief of relief

95
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.849
or one

96
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.099
Exhalation that just became a sigh without it to be one.

97
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.960
Sigh.

98
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.250
Imagine having to be damned every damn day.

99
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.000
Type it excuse the swearing.

100
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.020
So.

101
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.810
O k

102
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.060
How many sighs have been performed by people in an indignant state then.

103
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.970
The last two hundred thousand years

104
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.520
Since you also have to draw a line when we became people on real people.

105
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.950
I mean, I know that

106
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.750
our genus, homo sapiens sapiens,

107
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.820
is

108
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.219
An indication, but really it is a sliding scale.

109
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.050
So the last two hundred thousand years.

110
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.500
How many times has one been sighing

111
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.660
I know there is an exact number, although of course it is all the time

112
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.260
Rising because it sighs around the earth as one there was no tomorrow.

113
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.309
Then it was sigh.

114
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.690
So I.

115
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.460
It's just asking that question a little bit and you are happy to guess qualified,

116
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.490
Says it out loud in the room right now.

117
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.130
How many sighs have so far taken place

118
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.840
So you

119
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.500
Good.

120
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.480
But this gray lid

121
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.950
So is not a plastic lid.

122
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.720
Or a lid for the ears

123
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.430
Or a lid on expression possibilities.

124
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:52.430
Without a cloud cover that lies like a lid over Sunda.

125
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.859
Pale light from street lights.

126
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.560
Who blinks desperately seems to fight to survive.

127
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.840
Where.

128
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.900
Along the windingly greedy streets wandered a

129
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.760
Young woman named rubbing.

130
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.370
And she was very small for the plant.

131
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.240
Like everyone in healthy.

132
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.870
The lack of sunlight meant that you did not grow up as you should.

133
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.350
She has been very short but had a radiance that signaled

134
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.570
greatness presence.

135
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.150
Determination that made her appear larger than her comrades.

136
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:44.660
She was dressed in.

137
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.160
Work clothes, durable boots.

138
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.110
A cloth tied in the hair.

139
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.939
So such a bandana

140
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.370
Her face was dirty, but her eyes were clear and filled with one.

141
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.010
Used people to say rare curiosity.

142
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.070
Gibba was.

143
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.220
Yes she was showing in town,

144
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.520
She was a collector, you can say just as Pippi Longstocking had expressed.

145
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.790
Her job was to collect stuff she looks through.

146
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.050
So, this is how this now sounds apocalyptic,

147
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.890
Thus, as it is a disintegration a city.

148
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.320
It's a bit like it feels, but it's not.

149
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.100
This is just a city in a parallel reality

150
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.750
Which happens to be covered by fog.

151
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.750
And there was a certain measure of desperation and vulnerability in town of course

152
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.210
precisely because of the lack of sunlight.

153
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.070
But her job was because there was a certain.

154
00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.440
Missing in town, there were some buildings like.

155
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.459
Was abandoned in with regular intervals

156
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.050
And then it was her job to walk around and root there.

157
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:12.140
In the city

158
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.650
After useful things and then she presented them at the City Council.

159
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.020
Here, look here a can opener well the one it should Anderssons have as well

160
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.490
in other words.
 There was some kind of.

161
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.370
What do you call it

162
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.900
Planning economy There was something now kind of from communist.

163
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.660
The board there

164
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.750
So she walked around and gathered stuff for the general good.

165
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.910
But really it was only a small group of gatekeeper who decided was everything

166
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.400
would be disposed and distributed.

167
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.610
Sometimes she finds useful stuff such as a can opener.

168
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.569
Sometimes she finds things that were completely unnecessary.

169
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.710
Type a small piece of one.

170
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.300
Bracket to 1 iron bar of unclear unclear use.

171
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.080
Sometimes she finds absolutely fantastic.

172
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.100
For example, books.

173
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.980
From bygone times.

174
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.280
A time when

175
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.459
Surmulna had been a higher education institution before the big cloud had come and settled over

176
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.100
Yes set over.

177
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.610
Town.

178
00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.660
The sums had been the world's knowledge center.

179
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.790
So sometimes she finds.

180
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.440
Books.

181
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.160
With invaluable fragments of knowledge,

182
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.430
Much was worn and destroyed.

183
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.709
But some things were to interpret.

184
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.140
And she was obliged to hand in everything she found to the Office.

185
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:05.630
But sometimes she used to break against the law and take home the books first

186
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:11.220
and try to read and copy on small pieces of paper it she

187
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.290
found worth.

188
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.520
Assimilating

189
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.089
Before she handed in the books to those who decided.

190
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.770
Right now she was not out and working, but she was out walking and leisure homes.

191
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.590
Overall you can say well

192
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.280
She had one she looked everything and know what she was on her way.

193
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.560
That is interesting when walking on the town.

194
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.170
Then you can meet people who do not know what they are on their way

195
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.590
they may know it, but their

196
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.250
Intention running.

197
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.699
Does not show it up and it is often when you end up in these

198
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.240
The situations when you.

199
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.180
Does it go the way for each other and then you should go aside and then go both in the same direction

200
00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.890
And then it gets a little.

201
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.910
Confusion.

202
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.170
Then I always laugh and.

203
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.610
Smiles a little over -eating when such happens

204
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.090
And sometimes I get the same reaction back, but sometimes it is too.

205
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.680
Some people can't handle that.

206
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.970
It is too embarrassing or too annoying.

207
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.780
That then I usually feel offended and sad after one.

208
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.960
Such an interaction.

209
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.500
Clinging just knowing what she was on

210
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.910
And she showed with her whole body and her clear clear look.

211
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.350
It was a determination.

212
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.740
People usually know at a long distance.

213
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.209
Which way she would take in a possible meeting.

214
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.250
She went to the city gate.

215
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.680
A large rusty star port.

216
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.270
Of spare parts.

217
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.170
This is really with a maximum theme now, but it may have happened then.

218
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.540
The guard in the gate raised an eyebrow.

219
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:19.910
When he saw Dibba,

220
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.340
Well, what are you going to do now he said.

221
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.210
She always went out of town.

222
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.420
She got it because she was gathered.

223
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:30.640
Her job was, after all, to gather stuff that could be to general good,

224
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.189
But he still thought because he was a slightly older gentleman.

225
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.880
So he thought it was a bit his job

226
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.260
to throw small sour glimpses to this young girl who passed by

227
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.910
What are you going to do now, he said.

228
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.890
Shit you in it, she told him then.

229
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.410
That, there he did not like, of course.

230
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.720
The thing is that she did not think that he threw glimpses at her,

231
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.790
But there was nothing he had reflected on.

232
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:02.410
He thought she was stubborn,

233
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.190
But he dares not say anything more because she was gathered and the collectors were important for.

234
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.770
For town and for the council.

235
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.360
Then, then she pulled out her compass

236
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.360
From one rock pocket.

237
00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.300
And then you point to it

238
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.590
I'm on my way there, she said, pointing to the compass.

239
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.209
And it was it pointing north then

240
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.280
And then he starts laughing in the guard.

241
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.000
Though it sounded more like his

242
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.670
Like something into him tried to tear himself away from his personality.

243
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.450
Sometimes I have sometimes you hear people who laugh that way.

244
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.250
It sounds more like there is something trapped inside them

245
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.099
that attempts to hit itself free

246
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.250
And come out and avoid this prison in there.

247
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.280
You think you will find something today, or it's just that ground and decay

248
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.570
Out there, so the guard said.

249
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.190
But he still opened the door, because it was his job.

250
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.720
Couldn't you just have done your job right from the start

251
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.620
Mumbled gibba, what did you say

252
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.970
Said the guard a little musty

253
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.080
I, he had no power over her.

254
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.290
She was high status, he was low status in this city.

255
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.030
So she went out through the squeaky gate.

256
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.820
And left the city.

257
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.980
And stepped out in this one.

258
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.400
A little now you know, now I actually have.

259
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.390
Now I know what I have for pictures in my head.

260
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.470
It's a series I'm watching Netflix that is.

261
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.700
Bad, it's called The Dark Knight or Dark Warrior or anything

262
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.850
one one.

263
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.780
Korean series about any type of apocalyptic world there.

264
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.339
The whole of South Korea has become or the entire Korean Peninsula has become one.

265
00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.800
Sand desert after some type of apocalyptic event.

266
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.420
I, I think

267
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:17.020
Netflix has a craze for South Korean series.

268
00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.349
Now and had a few years after the squid game, and.

269
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.050
It's.

270
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:29.130
Exciting, but now I am starting to think, now I think I'm starting to be able to like the structure.

271
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.970
Now a little gets tired of.

272
00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.060
This.

273
00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.620
There is little.

274
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:41.100
It's a bit harsh as well and quite one -dimensional characters.

275
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.690
Correct me if I'm wrong in this as Netflix does,

276
00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.410
so I.

277
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.950
I have not stuck to this one, but it is very nice environments.

278
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.379
They have this sandy.

279
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.270
That's what I see a little in front of me now, though I said this was not apocalyptic.

280
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.720
But there is something about this.

281
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.870
The cloud that has suddenly ridden slid in then.

282
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.000
And hear a little bit the previous knowledge monopoly surgrown in

283
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.080
A darkness that in the long run and removed all.

284
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.190
All of knowledge.

285
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.700
Gribbe knew people were talking shit about her behind her back.

286
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.760
They call her naive and

287
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.360
Maybe crazy even.

288
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.470
Because always went outside the city gate because most of it

289
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.550
As you could find value you find in the big big city

290
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.820
Surmole.
 I would like to point out that Surmulna was one.

291
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.780
A former metropolis of ancient.

292
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.190
Ancient metropolis thus as large as perhaps

293
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.500
New York in time.

294
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.770
And that means there were plenty to discover inside town,

295
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.620
But it was like she felt something pulling her outside the city gates.

296
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.580
Disagree was the word and use about her.

297
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.540
Elliest.

298
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.020
But she had something on feel.

299
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.960
She had a feeling that somewhere outside the trampled paths

300
00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.640
The streets and.

301
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.180
The alleys and platforms inside town.

302
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.070
So there was something that could change everything about didn't know what.

303
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.030
She had

304
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.710
Read and seen traces of it in old books she had found.

305
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.649
A world where there was light from heaven and warmth

306
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.800
Where the sun was shining clear.

307
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.100
And this was a world she was.

308
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.870
Abstract decisions to find some way.

309
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.860
I want up above the clouds.

310
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.600
She mumbled for herself

311
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.090
Outside Surmolen.

312
00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.190
Stretched a world of.

313
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.450
Livid.

314
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.439
Hills.

315
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.630
Cool gloomy mowing a no man's land.

316
00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.760
There were no animals where there were none.

317
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.230
Only in just the wind that

318
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:41.170
Threw themselves the silent empty tree protection one that stood everywhere

319
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.720
before you are now rushing away.

320
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.100
So if someone says this was just too depressed for one

321
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.159
Collection's section so I just want to say

322
00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:52.310
Giving it a little time now so I'll find really nice warm shifts in this.

323
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.540
But me man, I have to

324
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.750
Paint a little scraper first.

325
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.230
It has to scrape a little in order for it to feel good later.

326
00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.870
She had her compass.

327
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.900
She knew that under her, the story hid.

328
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.680
There was another world she had seen the traces of it in the books.

329
00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.570
She was safe.

330
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.639
Not sure of anything formulated.

331
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.920
But sure of their own intuition on his own feeling that something.

332
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.720
It was important to discover here.

333
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.010
It was as if

334
00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.110
Humanity sometime as the cloud pulled over the world.

335
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.690
Had left.

336
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.490
The spaces between the cities.

337
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.860
There was nothing there, it was empty.

338
00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.510
The world was a gray shadow

339
00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.770
On ash gray land between the cities.

340
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.729
There were no ruins, no traces of anything.

341
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.850
Humanly.
 It was almost like one.

342
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.580
Some kind if man

343
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.000
If you play yes now.

344
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.030
This is TV Spel's reference then.

345
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.310
But if man

346
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:23.620
playing the TV game so you happen to slip into some of the gaming world that is not meant

347
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.460
That you should be in.

348
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.210
If there is any small bug in the game so you happen to do, for example, a volt

349
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.270
or a jump or a switch changed and comes in

350
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.460
On something that is just meant it was a backdrop.

351
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.780
Then you can move in a world that looks like the one you just moved,

352
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.360
But it's empty.

353
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.570
There are no n P C where there are no animals there is no one.

354
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:53.080
No wind in Grenå branches it as one.

355
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.689
Like a painting.

356
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.910
Yes, I think it is so.

357
00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.300
It rarely happens now more, because it is so rare that the games

358
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.920
bugs like that,

359
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.459
But when they do, I usually get happy and I usually feel.

360
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.720
That I.

361
00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.530
I want to walk around there and just be.

362
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.169
It is a feeling of having stopped the time something that does as you know is quite

363
00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.040
Refounded if you have listened to other sections and fall asleep with Henrik.

364
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.530
She just went, she had no direction.

365
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.020
She just

366
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.300
put one foot in front of the other and eventually she stood in front of a

367
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:34.120
high of round stones that were just too

368
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.820
Symmetrically placed

369
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.620
to be the result of any type of natural process.

370
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.040
It was a.

371
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.429
Someone who has stacked these stones in a pile

372
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.450
It is one this was a treasure chest for Gubba.

373
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.470
She started lifting on the stones.

374
00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.440
It was hard to do.

375
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.700
It was a bit like picking pins for as soon as she lifted on a

376
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.220
So the dozen fell others and they were quite large and heavy

377
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.540
And totally round the round so like bulk bullets.

378
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:14.880
And they fall down and threaten her on both fingers and legs and feet.

379
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.030
It took a long time and in the end she had lifted on all the stones.

380
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:26.710
And then she found what would then change everything.

381
00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:29.270
One.

382
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:37.170
Old apparatus of any kind of a copper colored archanged.

383
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.950
Thus, green is oxidized.

384
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.890
Tube of any kind

385
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:46.670
With 1 small.

386
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.980
Dry.

387
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.979
Very fragile rubber application that is stuck.

388
00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:00.100
It was a face mask that was stuck in this copper tube.

389
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:01.800
It was covered.

390
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.440
Green, green oxidation and dirt.

391
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.860
But it was something.

392
00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.780
So Gribbe had never seen anything like it before.

393
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.929
But there was something with the very structure of the object and the fact

394
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.020
That it was buried.

395
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.450
Under a wall during a rose

396
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.850
That made Gibba know that this was

397
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.190
What she was looking for.

398
00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:32.419
This was.

399
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.080
She brought them the nozzle against her nose and mouth.

400
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.449
And then she realized that this was a face mask that could help her

401
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.990
to get up above the clouds.

402
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.920
A machine from the old time, some time before the cloud.

403
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.850
Came sliding.

404
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.520
And removed all the knowledge from the world.

405
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.880
Glimma felt like she had 12 hearts in her chest.

406
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.080
Like to beat the fastest they could.

407
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.080
One heart at a time.

408
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.220
All, she vibrated and sang.

409
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.910
It was so close now.

410
00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.490
She didn't know how or why.

411
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.590
But it was so close now this world as she dreamed of.

412
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.090
Maybe she could actually reach the sun

413
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.130
Maybe they could actually come above the clouds

414
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.290
She starts running back.

415
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:48.200
Her feet.

416
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.330
Trampled it.

417
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.360
Admittedly for her invisible dust on the ground because.

418
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.360
The air was so filled with fog and smoke.

419
00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:03.130
But the sound of her feet against the dry soil below them.

420
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.110
Create it as a drum in her

421
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:11.790
And as she steps, a troubled feeling also came

422
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.860
Because she knew

423
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:17.310
That this could be a trouble for her.

424
00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.520
The city council and all the others in town.

425
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.260
Many people were afraid of unknown things.

426
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.760
None of those who lived in.

427
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.170
Was called the city.

428
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.990
Ugh, I hate when I forget things.

429
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.820
Sumba please.

430
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.720
Thanks to fall asleep.

431
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.240
After all, none of them had experienced the world with sunlight.

432
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.240
So, of course, it was a risk to her to suddenly establish this,

433
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.310
So she decided to keep as much as possible for herself.

434
00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.590
And just reveal.

435
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:01.459
For.

436
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.300
ORIN.

437
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.770
Orin Dorin, who was

438
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.760
He who decided in the village in the office.

439
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.490
The age of the city.

440
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.520
Age's guy there was one.

441
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.740
There is usually an age guy in almost every context.

442
00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.710
Often I think when you are new to work or so.

443
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.360
Or new in school or you in any context at all

444
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.950
The first question one should really ask or then with others

445
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.220
Is who is the age guy here

446
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.030
It can be a woman or man.

447
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:43.129
But I think the epithet age -old just sounds good.

448
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.929
Often there is someone in all institutions.

449
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.970
It doesn't have to be the person who has the most.

450
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.510
On paper power,

451
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.090
But it is always de facto the person who has the most influence.

452
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.330
So who is age's guy at your workplace or your school fall asleep

453
00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:02.879
Tag a friend.

454
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.679
She decided to tell the age guy for the age group.

455
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.300
In this case, it was actually one who likes her.

456
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:18.230
He went her cases when it suited him and Orin Dorin Dubbe.

457
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.120
Orin, dorin orin dorin dub

458
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:22.890
He was called.

459
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:28.220
She would tell him, but not anyone else like this in the beginning.

460
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.180
When she came back into Sunda.

461
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.980
Was the guard completely silent, he had something else to think about.

462
00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:45.430
The triumphs of the hope she had known when she discovered this oxygen mask.

463
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:51.250
Be now mixed with you with fear and unrest.

464
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.040
How would they react

465
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:55.179
What if it leaked,

466
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:59.500
what if someone tried to take it from this one before she had established it at Orin

467
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.310
Dorin dub

468
00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:01.939
What would happen then

469
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.960
It felt like she had to own the narrative here

470
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:12.440
because this would not be running away and get way too big and scattered

471
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.900
to make use of it.

472
00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:19.870
It is a general guide among posture I think

473
00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.700
when it

474
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:26.010
Applies to large potentially overthrowing things attitudes.

475
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:32.070
Idealism, ideal ideal attitudes ideal,

476
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.540
inventions or new knowledge.

477
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.570
Keep it for yourself for a while because

478
00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:40.770
It's S Entier everything.

479
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.120
When it comes to sensitive things to

480
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.740
You yourself understand what it is you send out before you send it out.

481
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.179
Then you can never be fully prepared, of course.

482
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.670
But you can at least try.

483
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.820
She knew she couldn't keep this completely to herself.

484
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:06.560
She had found something that might change the whole place

485
00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:08.590
Life forever.

486
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.230
But she then chose in the first position that only

487
00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.010
Tell that age guy Orin the door dub.

488
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.990
Which was according to rumor, was as old as goals themselves.

489
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.110
At least he was there in the eyes of Gnabba, because she was after all

490
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.210
No more than the opposite old.

491
00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.850
Orin door double always sat at the square

492
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.790
In the middle of town on an old old rocking chair one of those standing at Kålgården.

493
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.710
Google rocking chair Carl Larssongården if you are curious about what it is for the rocking chair,

494
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.310
It's like one.

495
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.920
A rocking chair designed by Karin Larsson, who according to rumor was far too.

496
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.750
Weird and uncertain to make the carpenter dare to live deliver it according to

497
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.990
Her measures of daytime so he came in the darkness in the protection of the night.

498
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.990
And delivered it.

499
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:09.580
It is very low and today it is very gentful, but it may not be

500
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.690
nineteen hundred seven or something when made.

501
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.340
When you are very nice in any case, he sat in.

502
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.139
Ikea did something similar.

503
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.140
Did you know by the way that Ikea is going

504
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.780
It tells Carl Larsson the farm when I was there on a guided tour with my

505
00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.170
Family here a few weeks ago.

506
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.810
Then the guide told us that

507
00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.770
Ikea goes once a year and guided show at Karlsgården to get ideas

508
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.520
And spread.

509
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.820
I think that is fantastic.

510
00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.980
I mean in a time when everything is still documented there is,

511
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.160
It's just google.

512
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.500
Inventory Carl Larsson The farm, so there is a picture of every object.

513
00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.460
It's something that going around on the spot.

514
00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.100
But this was nothing like guys knew anything about

515
00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.520
And neither does Orin Dorin Dubte.

516
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.360
Orin Dorinda double so I rub.

517
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.680
Her voice was very clear, though she was nervous.

518
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.500
I have found something something that can change everything to everything

519
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.730
Throughout the universe.

520
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.330
She replied in this strange way because it was a dialectal thing.

521
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.770
And Orin Dorin double who didn't think it was strange any such universe

522
00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.010
So he just lifted on one eyebrow.

523
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.340
Such an exaggerated bushy eyebrow

524
00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.160
such a thing that one wonders, but why have you not even tried to

525
00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.420
cut it a little neighbor with 1 small scissors

526
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.880
After all, there are people of the upper ages that you can meet as you sometimes wonder,

527
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.360
Why haven't you done at least anything because you see nothing,

528
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.110
It hangs down.

529
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.200
Over the eyebrows why you don't have to shave everything.

530
00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.220
I also do not mean that you have to stand grooming yourself as a teenager.

531
00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:01.220
You may feel that you are past that and that is fine,

532
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.720
But at least it makes it easier to see.

533
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.380
But no one never said to trout trout old man without the

534
00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:12.139
let him be held and he doesn't seem to have suffered from it.

535
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:17.600
With and orin the door, double be kind and wise and fine and I

536
00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.020
Don't talk shit about him here.

537
00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.679
He immediately understood the seriousness.

538
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.510
And the importance of holding this

539
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.200
underneath lid, so to speak.

540
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:34.440
So he said that old men first fell in here, so he slipped into his little house.

541
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.359
And you just followed with open your backpack in there.

542
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:43.000
We at that table in the shady pixel kitchen

543
00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:48.090
and showed him his mask and that arched tuber.

544
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:51.540
What do you think it might be, do you think

545
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.880
The same thing I whispered she and the penny Dorin Dubbel's eyes widen

546
00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:56.939
When he saw.

547
00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.860
That he thought it was.

548
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.960
He thought so.

549
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.549
His breath became quick and hoarse a little neighbor as an asthma

550
00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.450
Asthma coated guinea pigs.

551
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.710
A guinea pig coated with asthma.

552
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.380
He couldn't even say anything.

553
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.510
He opened his mouth and closed it again several times.

554
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.530
It's oxygen mask.

555
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:24.170
Whispered gibba or how orin the door dub a machine from the old world

556
00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.970
If this works.

557
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.730
If you can make it work

558
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.790
rectify him because he would not be hurt that she

559
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.710
took too much freedoms so maybe we can use

560
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.520
this one and the like if we can back track how it is built up

561
00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.730
So maybe we could get above this cloud cover and see the sun again.

562
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.380
And.

563
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.259
Orin, Dorin, double nodded his eyes were filled with hope.

564
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.350
I think I can fix it.

565
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.779
We can fix it, he said

566
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.450
When he looked to arrest, a little neighbor was swaying.

567
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.100
They were somehow in symbiosis with each other.

568
00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.040
It was a father's daughter relationship.

569
00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.540
Or Dad Grandpa relationship maybe you should say.

570
00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.360
I have read some about these machines, you saw BA.

571
00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.020
Apparently this idea contains.

572
00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.500
Clean air oxygen

573
00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:31.370
If oxygen is missing at high altitudes or there is some missing some, so it is.

574
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:36.970
And then you need this to be able to be up there without losing consciousness.

575
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.460
Karin said nothing.

576
00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.040
Instead, he looks at Gubba.

577
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.830
His gaze was deep and pervasive and he said,

578
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.700
This can change all the knife, but I want you to know one thing.

579
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:55.680
I won't be able to climb on any mountain peak and perform those experiments

580
00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.250
As required, without it you will be.

581
00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:58.700
Must do it.

582
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.200
I am

583
00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:05.330
An old man and my oxygenation is not what it usually has been.

584
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.070
And I.

585
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.370
Is.
 In addition, I have a port win.

586
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:16.600
And you know how difficult it is when you have the port wine 2 to do something at all.

587
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:19.620
Your baby is happy this.

588
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.640
She had become really sad if you had said I will send one of my

589
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:26.170
Heads on and do this.

590
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.410
She wanted to be the one.

591
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.100
Would learn and be the first and see if this worked.

592
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:36.990
So.

593
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.210
She was very happy that she was selected, so to speak.

594
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:47.910
And he said and so Orin Dorin Dubte that this is also dangerous.

595
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.950
We have to keep this secret because if it gets wrong

596
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:57.380
Then we can get a riot on our hands so and then he directly translated from English.

597
00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:01.510
Which he often did without knowing if this was part of the actual aart.

598
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.589
It is also dangerous to climb above the clouds,

599
00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.110
Not just by different aviation holdings up there.

600
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.370
No man has been over the clouds for hundreds of years.

601
00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.570
And.

602
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.750
There is no one, but no one knows what is up there,

603
00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.890
What kind of world is up there.

604
00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:28.290
He looked at her and asked in the same breath, are you ready to

605
00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:31.660
Get into this even though you don't know what it will end.

606
00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:38.050
And rub in just so that it is me.

607
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.850
We can't just keep living like this.

608
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.790
Sure we can do.

609
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.089
We have for emergency.

610
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:48.910
We, we are like an old one.

611
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.129
Retired couple who have been involved in difficult things in life.

612
00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.890
And who sits in their apartment and dare not go out of it

613
00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:02.570
Because they are afraid to break if they go out.

614
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:07.230
And the outside world has not been so mild to them, you should say.

615
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:12.680
But still, they themselves stay captured in that apartment

616
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.870
of the fear of breaking if they go out.

617
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.950
They dare not be from each other not before to the customer.

618
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:24.540
And they never dare.
 Never, never.

619
00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:30.450
Ruck on their routines even the smallest and when they do.

620
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.060
So it feels like they are going to break because it rushes in

621
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.060
light and air in those where

622
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.700
The gaps and cavities they suddenly open up.

623
00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.500
We can't continue to live, so she said.

624
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.910
And the penny door double nodded.

625
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.300
She was right.

626
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.810
And of course she knew that.

627
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.819
And you also fall asleep, because I have this very clearly.

628
00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.720
It's not like there are any doubts, what needs to be done here

629
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:03.399
And it's really a boring, a dull story,

630
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.460
So I apologize for that, because that's it.

631
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.960
Especially I think when you.

632
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:13.240
When reading or hearing or seeing a story that

633
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.020
Leaves mass unanswered.

634
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.360
I prefer it to this.

635
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.720
This type of slightly Anglo -Saxon structures that

636
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.320
As I devote myself to here now

637
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:28.310
But now I'm in on this, so me and I'm bad at the others

638
00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.380
The structures themselves.

639
00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:36.870
But during the days that followed now, Orin Dorinda Gubbe and Gibba worked

640
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.910
Every day on this oxygen mask.

641
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.350
How to do to fill an oxygen stub with oxygen

642
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:50.440
Gubba studied got access through the orin door double

643
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:54.230
to 1 lot of old texts found in the secret library

644
00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.160
and charts and such as she

645
00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:01.490
In some cases in some cases, it was recognized from the fact that it was herself who had gathered it.

646
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.650
And then she could remember that what she had

647
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.870
Made copies and stuff.

648
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.210
She told the words the door stud about this.

649
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.050
She thought it was nothing he needed to know.

650
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.650
She tried to understand these complex mechanisms, and.

651
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.730
The cycle that.

652
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.220
Just were really abstract things.

653
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.840
All nights she was in Orin Dorin, double's own secret workshop

654
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.220
Down in the basement.

655
00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:35.190
Behind a door that was not smoked here, Urban Urban Pursuit.

656
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.549
It was a call to 1 guy named Ur.

657
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:46.620
Sorry.

658
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:50.050
It was a call for 1 guy named Urban Pursuit.

659
00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:55.610
Urban prince was really had no reconciliation at all.

660
00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:01.140
Yes, the only thing that distinguished him was that he smoked like a so -called brush binder.

661
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.570
One thus a person whose profession is to bind brushes,

662
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.730
But they apparently smoked frequently.

663
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:11.910
In there behind were they

664
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:14.160
And kept on and labeling.

665
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.310
It was difficult, of course, the frustrating work.

666
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.970
More than once she wanted to give up.

667
00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.209
But every time she stood there

668
00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:31.440
Was about to throw that tank for fanders.

669
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:35.270
Is out in the door where Urban Urban Burst.

670
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.660
Support.

671
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.680
So first, she reminded herself of what was at stake here.

672
00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:43.790
So she looked

673
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.890
she went up the stairs through the secret gap.

674
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:52.700
Smoke does not have urban burst or the heat burst my name is coast.

675
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.770
Yes, at least he.

676
00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.850
He was dead for a long time.

677
00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.380
Urban was on so there was no one who

678
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.150
No one no one cared about it.

679
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.480
After all, it was like a postum thing he had written after Urban Afrase.

680
00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.390
Almost like a little

681
00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.770
fun fool one, a little trick,

682
00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.890
A small bus.

683
00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.620
With Urban's reminder.

684
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.500
She looked up at the clouds then she saw that it.

685
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:21.060
This is what it is all about.

686
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:24.560
To come to bring some clarity.

687
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.790
And then she continued to work

688
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.550
And I will not go in now fall asleep on the technical stuff.

689
00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.549
The steps required because I do not know how to produce pure oxygen.

690
00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:39.720
I don't know how to fill it oxygen.

691
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:40.910
Think with Syria and such.

692
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:43.450
So.

693
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.030
I.

694
00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:50.549
No to say that after 2 weeks

695
00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:54.030
Lots of failure so come.

696
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.660
A moment.

697
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.569
Gubba pressed the button on the small

698
00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.330
the tube that arranged plastered away all the voice and stuff from

699
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.350
Where you now shiny copper colored.

700
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.399
Button was blue with red

701
00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:14.930
Text on and on the text stood varnish.

702
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.420
Lack but it was old old language for air.

703
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.010
And to hers.

704
00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.550
Fantastic joy so the machine started acidic to 1 small

705
00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:30.750
Small click, a small spin,

706
00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:35.790
A small room in rooms, a small burs and a small screw and.

707
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:38.960
In the end, she put.

708
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:44.799
And a little sucking sound from the nozzle and she brought it to her nose

709
00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.880
and his mouth and pulled in the first dose of his life of

710
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.759
concentrated oxygen, which went straight into the system and she

711
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.040
cried with happiness.

712
00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.490
Cribs she has a voice behind her back

713
00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.670
As she turned around, Orin Dorinda double stood there with trembling knees

714
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.220
And a voice shaky of emotions.

715
00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:07.770
You did it.

716
00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.509
He had been to the toilet all the time.

717
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.560
Old people often go to the toilet for much longer periods of time.

718
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.640
It may take longer, so to speak.

719
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.090
To get off with the shit

720
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:25.129
So he had been on the toilet for 2 weeks so he had not been able to help her at all

721
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.210
And he was very proud of her.

722
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.100
They still kept it secret.

723
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:38.000
There was no time to lose, however, so she started preparing for climbing.

724
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.049
There was a mountain

725
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.220
further afield as they had in mind and thought it,

726
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.630
It has looked and going over the clouds, but no one had been there.

727
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:52.720
She collected ropes and nails.
 She studied old maps and routes,

728
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:57.130
Trained himself for the physical challenge of climbing up a mountain.

729
00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.390
When you have never done it before.

730
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.440
All the time she could feel

731
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:06.130
These 12 hearts in your chest that just thump you like in stereo.

732
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:11.200
And a little scared she was also of course because it was without a doubt dangerous.

733
00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.600
Maybe even deadly

734
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.540
But, she knew she couldn't back out now.

735
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:22.010
And then one day

736
00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:26.370
So she felt she was done orin dorin dub

737
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.450
had been to the toilet, so she said,

738
00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.450
He just said hello through the door to him.

739
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.170
He mumbled just something in response, because he had extra hard

740
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.600
Delivery in there.

741
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:40.130
And she went away in secret.

742
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:43.320
The guard.

743
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:46.299
Had Orin Dorin Dubbe

744
00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:51.500
fittingly replaced for the day and replaced with 1 old dog

745
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.760
Which was dressed press with the nose on the lever.

746
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:56.080
As soon as there is a human being.

747
00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:57.950
It was carelessly done.

748
00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:03.220
Because there were hazardous enemies also out there that I have not mentioned.

749
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.110
What I won't mention anymore either.

750
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.370
But they could have come in so it was irresponsible, but that

751
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:13.470
Went well and everything and then the guard came back so there.

752
00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.450
And so with oxygen stump

753
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.340
And some cheese sandwiches.

754
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:23.500
Then she begins her climbing.

755
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:25.690
Up the mountain behind the city.

756
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.420
I will see the sun, she told herself.

757
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.630
I will see the sun.

758
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:38.610
Arrested.

759
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.970
Arms and legs ached.

760
00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.240
This was no easy climbing.

761
00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:48.700
In the beginning it was just a little oblique uphill, but eventually it became vertical walls

762
00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:52.420
So she had to climb in a way she had never done before and all the time

763
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.080
so low the clouds as

764
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:59.170
Thick almost physical obstacles that fought against her progress.

765
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.950
The air became thinner and cooler.

766
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:04.770
It felt like fire when she breathed in

767
00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.180
Each step each.

768
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:08.530
Every little one.

769
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.340
The bundle centimeters were a challenge.

770
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:15.670
But she continued.

771
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.400
Now I will make a comparison of myself that does not mean

772
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:22.790
That I'm gibba here.

773
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.250
For guys are a real hero, but sometimes when I'm in the gym

774
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:27.560
so I can feel that

775
00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.950
My body absolutely does not want to do what I want it to do.

776
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:36.000
I did dips the other day for example, that's when you man.

777
00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.730
Hangs in a position and makes it like bending your arms.

778
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.430
It is a

779
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:46.790
Triceps and chest exercise or I don't know what body parts are.

780
00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.230
That i think it tae

781
00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.830
On my forearms the underside of my upper arms simply.

782
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.500
Triceps and then

783
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.940
Yes, what I'm really bad at it and I'm really weak and then my body said, said

784
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.940
You should not do this this should not devote it to,

785
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:04.799
You are one you are.

786
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:07.820
This is completely uninteresting to me from all aspects.

787
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.380
But then I see

788
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:12.690
To the body that now you do this anyway, no matter how it feels.

789
00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.760
And when I had done it then, then it almost feels like you stop there.

790
00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:20.460
When doing such

791
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.830
It feels completely silent and very organic,

792
00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.620
But I had done it like this

793
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:29.380
10 times though I didn't want to

794
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.610
So it was so I was in a completely different place mentally.

795
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.550
Sometimes this is what it takes to get over a mental barrier,

796
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.750
That you just continue for a little while.

797
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.570
I do not mean to force yourself to do things that are not good for one,

798
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.120
But in this case, I knew it was good for me in the long run.

799
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.360
After hours of climbing.

800
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.709
She finally felt

801
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.520
The change.

802
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:59.610
It was cold up there, of course.

803
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.650
But.

804
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.480
Everything was much brighter.

805
00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:05.170
Now it went fast.

806
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.650
The colors start to run through the clouds, first bleached.

807
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.990
And then ever stronger and then

808
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.450
After what felt like an eternity and a second at the same time, she broke through the clouds.

809
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:20.910
And chair on the top of the mountain

810
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.029
Above them and they were completely white on the top.

811
00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:29.990
And here she stands now.

812
00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.080
Gubba as the first in the whole

813
00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:38.850
In several hundred years no one in Surmulna had seen what she saw now with her eyes on

814
00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.300
for several generations.

815
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.270
A clear blue

816
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.280
Quite empty sky stretched out endlessly in all directions.

817
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:52.740
Goal by cloud on clouds on the end to the horizon.

818
00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.030
The sun stood as one.

819
00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:57.120
Relentless.

820
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:02.710
Guest lamp high above so light and beautiful that it almost hurt.

821
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.850
But it hurt for other reasons as well because she had not seen sunlight whole

822
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.460
its life

823
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.580
So it hurt to be at all in

824
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.900
In Enzo C the sun in the periphery.

825
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.759
She could see

826
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:21.630
This white country that stretched out under and around her in all directions.

827
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.200
Instead of ash gray and lifeless

828
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:28.640
hills and formations so they were here

829
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:30.100
Dazzling white.

830
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.600
And she was constantly using her breathing mask.

831
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:41.290
And it was also a bit to pull in pure oxygen was like one.

832
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:47.010
Like explosion for every breath, she cried tears off.

833
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.629
Joy of course, triumph and relief,

834
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:52.370
But also sadness that.

835
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.480
She was alone up there

836
00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:57.470
That she had no one of this with, she knew that.

837
00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.750
What is his name O.

838
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.620
Odin Bodin Doobie.

839
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:08.009
The old man he could not

840
00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.330
Ever climbing up

841
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:18.520
She spent all the rest of the day above the clouds discovered this new world.

842
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:21.350
Sat there and felt the cool.

843
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:25.339
Unreasonable wins on their skin.

844
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:29.689
She was thinking of surrying her people and on all that they

845
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:33.800
had missed under the clouds and she knew she had to.

846
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.550
She must let them see this.

847
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.460
She must let them feel this freedom, this beauty regardless.

848
00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.970
What they would think about her

849
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.279
Prank.

850
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:54.250
She didn't know how to do it, because they had only an oxygen mask.

851
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:57.470
Yet, she knew it had to happen.

852
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:03.530
And then the sun went down.

853
00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.350
And threw like one.

854
00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:09.259
Sombrero.

855
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:11.940
A glowing sombrero.

856
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:16.010
At the horizon and colored the clouds,

857
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.759
Orange and deep blue and pink.

858
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:27.550
And then she starts her journey back down to Sunda back

859
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.700
to the city.

860
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:31.430
And it went very fast.

861
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:37.129
But of course it was dangerously as dangerous as up,

862
00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:41.020
But she had already established with her chin and the horse shoes and the ropes.

863
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.780
But the clouds turned out to be a bit as unwilling to drop her down as they had

864
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.000
been to release her.

865
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.310
It was actually like they were trying to hold her.

866
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.730
And then she had to again urge her body

867
00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.800
to just do the yard itself,

868
00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:01.550
not keep on feeling so much or wait for something to

869
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:07.050
feel organs instead properly without driven by the memory of the sun and of

870
00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:11.670
the hope of being able to share this beauty with the people down on the ground

871
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:13.000
So she pressed.

872
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:23.400
When she finally returns to town, she went straight into Bysala.

873
00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.720
Standed on stage, everyone was there.

874
00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.960
I have been

875
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.640
Above the clouds, she screamed with triumphantly crazy look.

876
00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:37.820
You have what mumbled people no one wanted to believe.

877
00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.379
Then came orin dorin double, so he is named

878
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:43.520
Then Orin Dorin came double and said.

879
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.930
He just came out of the toilet.

880
00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:47.240
And so

881
00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:51.600
What she said is true and he had some toilet paper under one foot,

882
00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:52.760
But no one cares about it.

883
00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:58.830
And to show everyone that she speaks the truth, she activated

884
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.530
the air purifier and held it forward

885
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.810
And it sounded like that from like the oxygen that flowed out.

886
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.050
Heard throughout the hall.

887
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:10.450
You could hear a button needle fall.

888
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:11.310
So it was quiet.

889
00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.640
And then they finally went.

890
00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.350
The skepticals went ahead and breathe in oxygen to try

891
00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.600
And could certify and testify that what she said was true.

892
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:25.850
But not everyone was willing to believe that it was true

893
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.810
and some were also afraid that they had after all

894
00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:29.840
gotten used to.

895
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.589
It was part of their universe, this gray.

896
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.370
The ignorance many were suspicious and were worried that

897
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.720
This news would disrupt the balance.

898
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:45.710
But there wasn't much to do.

899
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.490
It was like a kind of pandora's box

900
00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:54.290
here.
 It was something that had been opened that could possibly be closed again

901
00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.430
so despite resistance and fear

902
00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:00.209
So it was so that most people wanted to see the sun.

903
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:02.890
The first

904
00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:05.610
Climbing Expedition was already departed the next day

905
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:11.690
And they had decided on they were 8 people brave pioneers with ribs.

906
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:15.280
And then they had decided to split on the oxygen mask up there.

907
00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:18.900
And when these people came down from there after seeing

908
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:23.259
the width of beauty up there so it was like to

909
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:24.299
This was important.

910
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:28.259
Influential people should say so they could affect people in their

911
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:29.530
network and eventually

912
00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:34.230
So there was a huge consensus that they had to do something to get rid of the clouds.

913
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:44.859
And then the big flutter was invented.

914
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.990
The big flutter the flash was a huge solar spring

915
00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:53.730
which was driven by the hand where the guard and the dog.

916
00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.730
They pulled in that lever at the door that had been made about

917
00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:58.770
so that.

918
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:04.910
The big peel the fan could, like blowing back and forth, and when they did

919
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:09.270
Then the clouds were shipped away in a single high and the dog and the guard.

920
00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:13.290
They had to lead the remuneration.

921
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:17.880
Which hurts a lot, but it was worth it because they have been so awkward

922
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:20.839
If the dog is not awkward so it had to suffer unnecessarily

923
00:57:21.050 --> 00:57:23.620
so there is some kind of shadow

924
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:25.580
shadow in this story and that is that

925
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:28.630
The dog had to suffer.

926
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.109
The failures of others.

927
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:40.120
But the clouds blew away, they disappeared.

928
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.720
In front of them and above them.

929
00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:51.970
Stretched an endless sky full of blue.

930
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:57.880
Small pussies left by the large gray lid.

931
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:03.580
Up the ground ran flowers in all colors.

932
00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:07.860
Birds suddenly began to sing their joy what they had been before no one

933
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:09.100
Enter what they had been.

934
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:15.040
A mild breeze swept down through surround and tangled around in the father of people

935
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:19.460
and the sun stood there like a stranger high in the sky

936
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:21.370
Without hiding off clouds.

937
00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:25.130
The new world had begun.

938
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:30.060
The new world was here, and you just her people.

939
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.919
For now you can actually say so uniformly it was

940
00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:39.260
felt an oo overturn joy lies joy

941
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:41.420
over to have overcome all obstacles, and.

942
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.880
That it has reached its goal.

943
00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:52.580
And they cried and laughed and sang and drank each other and danced and smiled.

944
00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:57.690
And now, like the real adventure.

945
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:00.410
To explore this suddenly

946
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:04.240
Clearly the world around and the enemies that were out there.

947
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:08.270
They went up in a small blue little smoke, because they had nothing to hide anymore.

948
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.009
This light was anything but relentless and revealing.

949
00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.950
It was a beautiful light

950
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.770
And the blue sky accompanied the light in a wonderful almost.

951
00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:27.190
One hundred percent poetic experience.

952
00:59:30.690 --> 00:59:33.029
And Surmolled became a green city.

953
00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:39.450
And in this new country that old people and her people had received.

954
00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:43.720
And then that work begins and I should not say that it was easy as well.

955
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:44.130
It was a.

956
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.520
It was a difficult job to build a new future.

957
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:53.310
Initially, they chose to move out of sur cloud and build a new city outside.

958
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:58.470
On the hills outside, which were now covered with grass and flowers.

959
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.110
They divided the information among themselves.

960
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.820
Worked to

961
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:10.400
create a new social structure and recapture the knowledge that had

962
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:12.190
Went in to stand.

963
01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.570
And the small improvised city grew.

964
01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:22.900
The housing became more than just storage boxes for people.

965
01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:25.070
I talk like.

966
01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:30.490
I talk like him from Malmborg or what his name is

967
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.920
Who wrote songs in the seventies about my people, family and stuff.

968
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.640
After all, it is naive and strange and nice at the same time.

969
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:44.920
This world as it was a real one from Malmborg World

970
01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:49.120
where everyone drank each other to and danced and smiled

971
01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:55.580
And safeguarded the planet about the humans and animals and plants.

972
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.510
On the same.

973
01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:05.490
And they developed effective methods for agriculture and water management.

974
01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:08.760
They protect nature and preserved.

975
01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:12.980
Preserved things but don't let it stand in the way

976
01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.210
for a innovative.

977
01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.410
Inventive wealth.

978
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.200
And Gibba became manager and top dogg,

979
01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:24.700
But she was always kind and took care of everyone

980
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:26.960
and Orin Dorin Dubbe.

981
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:29.060
He went to the toilet.
