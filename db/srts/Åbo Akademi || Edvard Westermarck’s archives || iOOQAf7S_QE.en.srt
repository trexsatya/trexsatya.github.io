1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,600
The social anthropologist Edvard Westermarck 
was one of the first scholars from

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,400
Finland who had an international career.  

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,360
He became widely known for 
his research on marriage,

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,200
morality and religion, at a time when there 
was great interest in Darwinism and race theory. 

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,040
During his career, Westermarck served as 
professor in philosophy both at

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,480
University of Helsinki and 
Åbo Akademi University in Turku, Finland. 

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,600
He was appointed the first Rector 
of the newly founded 

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,520
Åbo Akademi University in 1918.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,200
However, his impact and networks did not 
evolve from this northern part of Europe only,

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,760
but also from northern Africa and 
the United Kingdom.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,000
He held the position of professor in 
sociology at London School of Economics

12
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,240
and Politics for 24 years, 
and lived and worked

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,440
in Morocco regularly for 
more than half his life.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,280
Professor Westermarck was a pioneer in the ways 
in which he conducted his field research,

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,160
and he is said to have lacked the “colonial 
attitude” of some of his fellow researchers.\h

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,480
Through his research, Westermarck influenced a 
whole generation of scholars from around the world. 

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,760
Many of his students became internationally 
known social anthropologists. 

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,720
His importance as a researcher, teacher, 
and friend is evident through the documents

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,920
he left behind.

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,240
Westermarck rose to fame with the 
publication of his first magnum opus

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
”The History of Human Marriage”, from 1891.\h

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,760
“The Origin and Development of 
Moral Ideas” was published in 1906.  

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
The manuscripts for both books are found 
here at the Archive Collections at

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Åbo Akademi University Library.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,800
Welcome to the Åbo Akademi University Library 
and the Archive Collections of Edvard Westermarck.  

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,600
We are very proud to house them 
since more than sixty years: 

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,160
letters, manuscripts, pictures and more.

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
Westermarck kept the drafts of many of his 
books, speeches and lectures,

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,040
and it seems that he was a bit of a perfectionist, 
judging from all the corrections found in the text.   

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,880
Westermarck also left a 
collection of 7500 letters,

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,240
carefully catalogued here at 
Åbo Akademi University Library. 

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,040
His letter collection includes 
correspondence with some of the

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,280
most renowned anthropologists of his time.  

34
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,960
Westermarck’s collection of letters reveals the 
vastness of the research network he created.

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,480
It also illuminates the development of 
social anthropology of the time –  

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,360
including some of the academic disputes.   

37
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,200
The letter collection also includes a large number 
of letters from friends and family in Finland,

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,040
including letters from his sister Helena 
Westermarck who was a well-known writer,

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,360
artist, and women’s rights activist.

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,600
"Dear miss Dawson, thank you very much indeed 
for your kind letters, and please forgive me

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,320
for not writing to you before. 

42
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,040
When in Morocco, I lost at least a month by

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,960
having to revise the translation of my 
“Memories” and have been struggling

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,240
hard to get my “Moorish Proverbs” 
ready for the printers.

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,520
Yet I could not manage it during the busy 
time in England, and am now on my way 

46
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,560
back to Morocco, where I hope to complete 
the revision of the typescript and 

47
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,720
to read the proofs so that the book 
can be published in the autumn.\h

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,160
I was very pleased with my seminars this year.  

49
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,760
We discussed questions relating to the family,

50
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,440
marriage, and kindred subjects.

51
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,200
Malinowski read the first paper, 
or rather gave the first address,

52
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,960
for he did it without any notes. 

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,360
Baron Meyendorff spoke of the 
Soviet law of marriage, and

54
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
other gentlemen of the Oedipus 
complex and so on. 

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,080
Last week I had seminars on two 
days in succession, which ended with

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,640
a tea party for twenty persons.

57
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,800
I never had a more satisfactory 
term at the school."

58
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:37,280
Edvard Westermarck’s large collection of photographs 
contains some pictures of Westermarck in his 

59
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,320
professional and home settings in both Finland and England, 
but the majority of the pictures are from Morocco.

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,920
Photograpy was one of the main 
methods Westermarck used by

61
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,640
in his extensive fieldwork in Morocco.

62
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,280
These pictures give an excellent presentation 
of the conditions of field research in the late

63
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,560
19th and the early 20th century.

64
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,840
Westermarck focused his field research 
on the customs and beliefs in Morocco,

65
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,440
and he wrote several books on the subject.  

66
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,280
One of his main interests was “baraka”, 
which is a concept of holiness.  

67
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,040
In his fieldwork, Westermarck wanted to be 
able to get his information directly from

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,400
his informants, and therefore he learnt 
Arabic and also studied one of the

69
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,080
Amazigh dialects, Shilha or Tashelhit. 

70
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,040
The notes from his language studies 
are stored in the archives.  

71
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Westermarck had a longtime friend and 
research assistant in Morocco

72
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,400
named Shereef Abdessalam el Bakkali.

73
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,440
El Bakkali helped him learn Arabic, and was also 

74
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
his assistant in the field research.

75
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,200
In Westermarck’s absence, el Bakkali 
took care of Westermarck’s beloved

76
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,080
Villa Tusculum outside Tangier.

77
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:23,400
As a unique feature, Westermarck’s archive 
collection includes el Bakkali’s letters to Westermarck.

78
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,000
El Bakkali’s work helping 
Westermarck map the local

79
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,800
traditions in Morocco earned him 
the Order of the White Rose of Finland.  

80
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,680
Westermarck was one of the key figures 
behind the Pro Finlandia cultural petition 

81
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,880
also known as the European Address in 1899.

82
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,960
His archives are also a source of 
information about Finnish university history 

83
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,920
from both Åbo Akademi University 
and the University of Helsinki.

84
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
One of the folders contains Westermarck’s 
documentation about the Åland islands dispute,

85
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,680
which was presented to the League of Nations in 1921.\h

86
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,720
He was also an avid defender of 
women’s, children’s, and gay rights. 

87
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,840
The significance of Westermarck’s research 
for the development of moral theory and 

88
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
social anthropology cannot be denied.\h

89
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,400
His personal as well as national history 
helped shape him into

90
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,680
the researcher he was, and his 
contributions to science

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,680
are of great value for researchers still today. 

92
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,840
Through digitization we can greatly improve 
the accessibility of this 

93
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,080
outstanding collection across the globe.

94
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,160
We hope it will shed light on the histories 
of Morocco, and of social anthropology

95
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,200
and also benefit researchers in linguistics, 
philosophy and evolutionary psychology.
