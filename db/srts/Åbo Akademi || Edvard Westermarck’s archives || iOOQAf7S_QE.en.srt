Edvard Westermarck's archive - Turku Academy Library

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,600
Social anthropologist Edvard Westermarck was one of the first researchers from

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,400
Finland that made an international career.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,360
He became widely known for his research on marriage,

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,200
Morality and religion, at a time when interest in Darwinism and Rasteori was great.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,040
During his career, Westermarck was professor of philosophy both at

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,480
The University of Helsinki and the Turku Academy in Finland.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,600
He was appointed first principal of the newly founded university

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,520
Turku Academy in 1918.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,200
But his impact and networks not only developed from this northern part of Europe,

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Without also from Northern Africa and the United Kingdom.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,000
He held the position as professor of sociology at the London School of Economics

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,240
and politics for 24 years and lived and worked regularly

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,440
in Morocco for more than half his life.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,280
Professor Westermarck was a pioneer in the way in which he conducted his field research,

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,160
And he is said to have missed the "colonial attitude" in some of his research colleagues.

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,480
Through his research, Westermarck affected a whole generation of researchers from all over the world.

18
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,760
Many of his students became internationally known social anthropologists.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,720
His importance as a researcher, teacher and friend is evident from the documents

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,920
He left behind.

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,240
Westermarck reached fame with the publication of his first Magnum Opus,

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,680
"The History of Human Marriage", from 1891.

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,760
"The Origin and Development of Moral Ideas" was published in 1906.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,560
The manuscripts to both books are here in the archive collections at

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Turku Academy Library.

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,800
Welcome to the Turku Academy Library and Edvard Westermarck's archive collections.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,600
We are very proud to have stored them for more than sixty years:

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,160
Letter, Manuscript, Pictures, etc.

29
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
Westermarck retained the drafts of many of his books, speeches and lectures,

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,040
And he seems to have been a bit of a perfectionist to judge by all the corrections in the lyrics.

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,880
Westermarck also left a collection of 7500 letters,

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,240
Carefully cataloged here at the Turku Academy Library.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,040
His letter collection contains correspondence with some of his

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Time's most famous anthropologists.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,960
Westermarck's letter collection reveals the extent of the research network he created.

36
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,480
It also highlights the development of the social anthropology of the time -

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,360
including some of the academic disputes.

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,200
The letter collection also contains a large number of letters from friends and family in Finland,

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,040
including letters from his sister Helena Westermarck who was a well -known author,

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Artist and women's rights activist.

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,600
“Dear Miss Dawson, thank you very much for your friendly letters, and forgive me

42
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,320
Because I haven't written to you before.

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,040
When I was in Morocco I lost at least a month by

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,960
need to revise the translation of my book "Memories" and have fought

45
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,240
Hard to get “moorish proverbs” ready for the printing company.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,520
Yet I did not manage it during the hectic era in England and are now on the way

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,560
back to Morocco, where I hope to complete the revision of the manuscript and

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Read the proofs so that the book can be published this fall.

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,160
I was very pleased with my seminars this year.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,760
We discussed issues relating to the family,

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,440
marriage and other related topics.

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,200
Malinowski gave the first presentation, or rather held the first lecture,

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,960
Because he did it without any notes.

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,360
Baron Meyendorff spoke of the Soviet Marriage Act and

55
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Other gentlemen about the Oidipus complex, etc.

56
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,080
Last week I had seminars two days in a row, which ended with

57
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,640
A tea party for twenty people.

58
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,800
I have never had a more satisfactory term at school. "

59
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:37,280
Edvard Westermarck's large image collection contains some photographs from his

60
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,320
Occupational and home environments in Finland and England, but the majority of the pictures are from Morocco.

61
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,920
Photography was one of the most important methods used by Westermarck

62
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,640
in his extensive field work in Morocco.

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,280
These images provide an excellent presentation of field research conditions at the end

64
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,560
of the 19th and early 1900s

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,840
Westermarck focused its field research on customs and beliefs in Morocco,

66
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,440
And he wrote several books on the subject.

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,280
One of his primary interests was "Baraka" which is a concept of holiness.

68
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,040
In his field work, Westermarck wanted to be able to get his information directly from

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,400
the informants, and therefore learned Arabic and also studied one of

70
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,080
Amazighdials, Shilha or Tashelhit.

71
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,040
The notes from his language studies are stored in the archives.

72
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Westermarck had a long -lasting friend and research assistant in Morocco

73
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,400
by the name of Sheref Abdessalam El Bakkali.

74
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,440
El Bakkali helped him learn Arabic and was also

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
His assistant in field research.

76
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,200
In Westermarck's absence, El Bakkali took care of his beloved

77
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,080
Villa Tusculum outside Tangier.

78
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:23,400
As a unique feature, El Bakkali's letter to Westermarck is preserved in the archive collection.

79
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,000
El Bakkali's work to help Westermarck map the local

80
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,800
The traditions in Morocco gave him Finland's white rose the words.

81
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,680
Westermarck was one of the key people behind the cultural petition Pro Finlandia,

82
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Also known as the European address in 1899.

83
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,960
His archive is also a source of information about Finnish university history

84
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,920
from both the Turku Academy and the University of Helsinki.

85
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,800
One of the binders contains Westermarck's documentation on the Åland issue,

86
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,680
which was presented to the League of Nations in 1921.

87
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,720
He was also an avid defender of women's, children's and gay rights.

88
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,840
The importance of Westermarck's research for the development of moral theory and

89
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,480
Social anthropology cannot be denied.

90
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,400
His personal and national history helped to shape him into

91
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,680
the scientist he was, and his contribution to science

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,680
is of great value to researchers than today.

93
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,840
Through digitization we can significantly improve access to this

94
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Outstanding collection all over the world.

95
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,160
We hope it will illuminate the history of Morocco and Social Anthropology

96
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,200
And also benefit researchers in linguistics, philosophy and evolutionary psychology.
