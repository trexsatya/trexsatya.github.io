1
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:33,338
There is an old agricultural property outside Piteå, which is said to affect the family that lives there so much that they sometimes scream out loud in frustration that it should stop.

2
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:44,773
It is said that a man has hanged himself in the barn, in one of the beams. We are trying to find out who this man is.

3
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:50,604
Those who live here experience enormous discomfort when they try to stay in the barn.

4
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:56,203
And what's in there wants you to leave quickly.

5
00:02:56,203 --> 00:03:04,966
The family reports seeing figures inside and outside the houses, watching them. And the feeling inside the dilapidated house is that it is children.

6
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:08,992
A boy and a girl.

7
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,467
Outside the house there is a man standing by the house knot watching them.

8
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:33,196
The boy in the family, whose room is on the ground floor closest to the kitchen, is talking to someone they can't see.

9
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:50,972
On this land there used to be an old Norrbotten farm, which unfortunately burned down.

10
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:11,498
And the flames took a woman and her child with them who never made it out.

11
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:22,112
Perhaps it is these unsavory spirits that still haunt the houses.

12
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:33,516
Then we made our way here in Piteå, to this agricultural property. Actually, there are three properties, it's this one, then the one that's a little more run down, and then we also have the barn.

13
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,508
Much to investigate.

14
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:44,189
There are specific things that happen, we must focus on them. We will see if we can make these phenomena happen, but we don't know.

15
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:50,000
It can happen now, it can happen anytime. But we have had little things that have happened before we started here.

16
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,609
I think we caught a shadow even, on the surveillance. And that got us all jumping.

17
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,096
It was very interesting to see that.

18
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:01,347
In fact, we have not previously been able to document that, not in this way.

19
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:07,875
We've seen it before, on the Safari investigation, but then it didn't record it. But now we had on the recording luckily.

20
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:12,203
This sequence shows what it looks like when the camera switches to Nightvision as we usually see.

21
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,738
So it was very, very special.

22
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:39,816
Absolutley. And I think like this, now there is quite a lot to investigate, many rooms. Then there are specific phenomena they say are happening here, so I think we should try to focus on the hot spots we have.

23
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:41,395
Shall we start in the kitchen?

24
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:53,784
I think we should start in the kitchen, but we should also focus on a special room. Where a little guy gets things to himself, he talks to something before he goes to bed.

25
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:57,755
And he also receives information, which is not so positive.

26
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:58,335
No.

27
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:04,800
So we're going to go in and try to address this, but they also think it's a little girl walking in, walking around..

28
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:14,983
but we'll see. Maybe it's something trying to show itself as a little girl. We'll check, I think we'll start with that room.

29
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:23,727
We bring some tools with us. I think if it's a younger energy, I think we put RemTeddy in there. See if it can push it down, you will run communication.

30
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:30,720
I think he receives a lot of messages that are not very pleasant. In case it wants to communicate with us, what is now here.

31
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,200
Exactly and it's only right through this door. It must be horrible as a parent to lie there and hear him talk about all sorts of things in there.

32
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:49,101
In the kitchen where we are now, we have a surveillance camera too, behind me. And here we have this box, above all, pulled out and these knives change position.

33
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:53,498
And ends up inside another cabinet. It's absolutely incredible.

34
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:58,469
If we can catch it, it will be absolutely wonderful. The Holy Grail of them all.

35
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,337
But as I said we have a lot of instruments, all the equipment is here so we can always go and get more.

36
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:13,538
It's not huge. We're going to pick up some instruments, we have to put on jackets, it's cold out there and cold inside the other house. Plus in the barn.

37
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:21,885
But right now we are in the heat. We go in here, I'm thinking if we should have a tool running. If you start it there and immediately open the door, we will see what is said.

38
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:31,332
I also think the PDA, Paranormal Direct Answer. It works if something comes to the right or to the left, so it lights up red or green.

39
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:35,361
Exactly. We prepare the whole room and see what happens.

40
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,189
Shit that scared me.

41
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,703
What?

42
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:39,244
When I look directly to the right...

43
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,314
Well, it looks like someone was standing there.

44
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:42,409
Yes, I thought there was someone standing there.

45
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,527
As if you hung a gallows over someone.

46
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:51,415
Like watching one of the worst horror movies, you only see a blanket and it looks like a human underneath.

47
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:57,262
As I said here he is sleeping, he hears a lot of stuff and he talks back to it.

48
00:07:57,262 --> 00:08:03,016
We start with PRS, both static and rem function.

49
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,203
I wouldn't have done that.

50
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,262
What does it say?

51
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,519
I wouldn't have put it there.

52
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,755
Okay.

53
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:19,816
I will put more things here that you can touch and push away. Do you recognize this teddy bear?

54
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:23,037
If you want to push it away, do so.

55
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,533
Just push it.

56
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,610
Include.

57
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:32,220
Are you included in this family? Is that what you feel?

58
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:33,820
I have shivers behind...

59
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,254
I was just going to say, I have shivers behind here...

60
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:41,388
You are not included in this family. I don't know who you are..

61
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,673
you don't say positive things.

62
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,735
I'm going to put another thing here that you can..

63
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,561
put your hand against or pass by.

64
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:55,191
Then you will be able to reply with different colors to us.

65
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:57,375
Allows.

66
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,632
It's almost like it gives us...

67
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,682
You decide.

68
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:07,917
What shivers! It comes in waves.

69
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,799
It comes from behind.

70
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:18,896
Do you usually talk to the boy who usually sleeps here?

71
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:24,807
If you do, go to this blue pulsing light that is in front of us on the bed.

72
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:31,354
Is it the little girl who usually says things to him who is here?

73
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:37,231
I can say, we have surveillance now in most buildings, if something happens, Lennie will call us straight away.

74
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:43,577
He sits in the bus and watches the surveillance. If we get a name out, he will see if he can relate the name to this farm.

75
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:48,213
That way we might get a better understanding of what it is or who it is.

76
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:54,714
We mustn't forget, there was a Norrbotten farm which was roughly where the barn is and it burned down.

77
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:57,122
It is said that a woman and two children were on fire inside.

78
00:09:57,122 --> 00:10:03,328
Right. And that's what we're thinking about, if this girl has gotten into this building, which is also affecting this boy.

79
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:08,980
We have to test everything here now. We haven't the faintest idea what we're dealing with here.

80
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,743
It could also be something very negative that has gotten in here. These shivers that come, they are interesting.

81
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:17,040
It comes in waves.

82
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,095
Love.

83
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:23,183
Because now I don't feel it, it kind of comes in spurts.

84
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,661
I'll try to go into the corner here I think.

85
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:29,080
I was the one who influenced it.

86
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,391
Now I would like you to come in here and show how strong you are.

87
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,773
Talk to us too.

88
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:40,523
Feel free to open a door in here or push something.

89
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:43,924
Can we get the name of whoever is here?

90
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,331
What are you?

91
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,429
Now there was a shiver again.

92
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,573
Here´s nothing now.

93
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:56,031
It felt here, right here.

94
00:10:58,227 --> 00:11:00,423
Can we get a name?

95
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:05,746
Are those initials?

96
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,520
It's hard to say...

97
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:18,242
We have other things going on here. We have a curtain down in the basement for the shower, where they hear this little girl laughing and hitting the curtain.

98
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:25,317
We're going to test that theory and be one on the inside of the curtain and then some stand outside and then we're going to see if the little girl can get in there.

99
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:33,414
It's going to be one hell of a hum down there, because it has a... what's it called? Dehumidifier.

100
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:35,985
And we can't turn them off, they don't want to.

101
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,221
I'm going to try to get down on my knees here and see if we get anything, if it's the little girl that's here.

102
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:45,414
My name is Tony, this is Niclas and Johan is the one filming here.

103
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,590
We only want to talk to you who are here.

104
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:55,199
We mean no harm, we want to know why you're staying. If it is a girl who is here.

105
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:58,342
Did you die in this fire outside?

106
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:04,449
By the barn, this old farm. Together with your sibling and your mother.

107
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:07,660
I found a small teacup here.

108
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,261
I'll put this next to the teddy bear and you can touch it if you want.

109
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:14,466
Are you under the bed?

110
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:24,165
What does it mean?

111
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,298
No clue.

112
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:27,548
Play first...

113
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,843
Okay, do you want to play with us here?

114
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,476
If I stick this under, can you hold my hand?

115
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,672
You can touch me.

116
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:44,986
Wait, that was....

117
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:45,715
Do you have a lamp here?

118
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:46,616
No I do not have it.

119
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,950
Either it's some hair or something..

120
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,933
I got touch on my fingers. Shit...

121
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,646
What the hell is this?

122
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:59,416
Here I feel something.

123
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,997
Wait, I'll get an instrument.

124
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:13,934
I have a perfect instrument for that. Which can take static fields, if that's what Tony got. We take the handheld parascope to it

125
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:18,952
Either it's a static field or it's some kind of cobweb.

126
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,912
You can get around here Johan.

127
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:30,945
Are you down here? Where!

128
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:34,181
Where! It is a static field.

129
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,840
Are you under the bed now?

130
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,996
I felt your hand or something. Damn!

131
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,325
I'll try a spirit box and see if we can get her voice through.

132
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,893
It was as if something caressed my fingers here.

133
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:46,682
What did it say?

134
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:47,465
Time.

135
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,816
Did you just hear this?

136
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:50,867
Here.

137
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:53,544
It sounded like.. well it might have been.

138
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,254
Difficult.

139
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,174
"Working now"

140
00:13:58,174 --> 00:13:58,813
Working now.

141
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:02,256
Are we going to shut this down for that long? Or should we have both running?

142
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:04,025
Run both.

143
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:09,587
The girl who is here can you say your name? Thanks! You are here.

144
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:10,700
There.

145
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,224
It's both ways here, both red and green

146
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:30,799
It was such a light touch over the fingers several times like this, back and forth. Think of a child's hand that with the fingertips runs over the fingers like this.

147
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,603
Never felt like that.

148
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,757
Are you still there?

149
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,510
You can do it one more time if you want.

150
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,970
You don't have to be afraid of us.

151
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:52,957
But still cool that this showed static, what I felt.

152
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,205
That was...

153
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,578
Put that by the bed and we'll see.

154
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:56,480
Is it on?

155
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,648
No, I've turned it off.

156
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,207
I put it here.

157
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:02,837
Now we have lots of tools here that can take different fields.

158
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,412
So if you're in here now, can you come and sit here on the bed please?

159
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:12,953
Get up from under the bed. You don't have to be afraid.

160
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,157
I run spiritbox again.

161
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:19,018
This was the sickest thing, it still feels like she's touching my hand.

162
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,347
Was it you who took Tony's hand?

163
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:25,819
*Breathe*

164
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,341
Someone breathing just..

165
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:32,723
"Beware"

166
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,966
Did it say beware or behind you? But now it's a man who's in here.

167
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,017
*Laughs*

168
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,702
Did you hear it?

169
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:43,507
"One"

170
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,405
"Girl"

171
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,307
A girl.

172
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:48,797
Now the shivers came again.

173
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:49,578
"Here now"

174
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:50,643
A woman.

175
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,377
It was like someone grabbed my hamstring when I'm standing with my foot on the bed here.

176
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,078
Or get pains.

177
00:15:58,014 --> 00:16:00,000
Are you touching Tony now?

178
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,079
"We're waiting"

179
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,342
A woman, I don't know what she said.

180
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,077
"Go now"

181
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,817
It was dark, like it said Go.

182
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:15,123
Is it really a little girl here? Then I want the little girl to come in here now.

183
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,664
The man who took his own life..

184
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:21,530
out in the barn...

185
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,252
are you still here?

186
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:27,118
"He says..."

187
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,602
"Get up"

188
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,449
It sounded like Get up. Or Up.

189
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,066
"Exit"

190
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:44,474
Turn it off. This man, he is seen inside the house, but he also stands outside and just looks at them. He is wearing a sloka hat.

191
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:50,679
Right. And a coat. And boots. So he just stands still.

192
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,040
They have even yelled at him, what do you want?! And then he just walks away.

193
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,780
That was sick, that was an awesome feeling.

194
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,369
It's cool, while you get the touch, you get a static field that pops up under there.

195
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:07,183
It was like I was walking into it, but it kept wandering along my fingers.

196
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:11,725
You get to play with this teddy bear or with that coffee pot over there.

197
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:12,873
Throw them down if you want.

198
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:22,014
I think we put our PMA there as well. Paranormal Motion Alert. I will turn on a switch here and it will then lie and be activated

199
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:25,732
and it will sound. If I run this now, it will be like this.

200
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:26,824
And it continues.

201
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:30,542
Until we turn it off. Maybe we will hear it too.

202
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:35,594
You can also have it just on the move.

203
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:44,323
That it moves. So I put it on the bed in case something pushes it or sits on the bed.

204
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,672
So if you want you can sit there in bed. Then we will hear it.

205
00:17:54,672 --> 00:18:01,138
Shall we go down to the basement? Or should we go up to this room where the wardrobe is said to open?

206
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:04,277
We'll go down to the basement first, I think.

207
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:23,211
Here we have where the family usually showers and this is where they belong, I'll show you, you know when it gets hot and cold the drapes usually go in and out, but when they stand in there they get this.

208
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:32,964
That someone hits. Really powerful. So there are no small movements and they think that it is the girl who runs here, that she makes them the phenomena.

209
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:36,983
Now we have the camera there so if something like that were to happen, it would be caught there.

210
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,702
I'm thinking if I put this down inside?

211
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:59,589
Can you come in here? You who usually hit here. On this curtain, if it's the little girl or whoever it is that's usually here fooling around and hitting the curtain.

212
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:00,805
Find.

213
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:09,124
Are you standing behind the curtain or can you come in here and turn on the curtain?

214
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:17,459
Actually, maybe someone should stand inside, just to illustrate that someone is behind. Are you going to try standing in there?

215
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:21,687
So it's like you're standing in the shower.

216
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:26,073
Play, I got now. Yes we are playing with you here.

217
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,271
I got Coming.

218
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:40,522
Yes come. I'm standing here. But hit the curtain first.

219
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:45,800
Now I'm standing here wasting water, if it's the man who doesn't like that you waste water.

220
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,631
Hit that curtain, if you're in here. You have done it several times before to those who live here.

221
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,616
Good, hit this now.

222
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,700
Niclas is in there, make sure he gets out.

223
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:08,583
We will check if we get any light phenomenon.

224
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,246
Time to pray, it says.

225
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:15,786
What do you want? Steam like you are talking about now, does it get hot in there Niclas?

226
00:20:15,786 --> 00:20:17,268
Yes.

227
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:30,567
We're going to test something Nicke, Johan and I back out so you can stand there by yourself for a little while.

228
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,727
We back out, then we have that camera running.

229
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:38,105
Can you come and close this curtain now while I'm standing here?

230
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,251
Take all the power you can. Get the water turned off here, hit the curtain.

231
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:55,640
Take all the strength you have and pull the curtain now.

232
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,172
All power. In the drapery. Now.

233
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:12,703
Now we'll see if that's true because he's in there by himself now. If this girl or boy wants to hit the curtain.

234
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:21,651
Maybe it didn't want to when we were there. But we have a camera running, so it hits, it has to hit from the outside and in towards Niclas.

235
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:25,017
All power in the drapery, now.

236
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:46,470
The drapery moves but Niclas doesn't notice it, and that the surveillance camera is flashing.

237
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,072
Do you feel something there?

238
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:48,805
No.

239
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:50,000
Nothing?

240
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,627
Unfortunately, nothing came.

241
00:21:52,627 --> 00:22:02,398
Now you have showered in the same way as the family. But we put the curtain back as it is, it rolls here all the time, so if something happens, we catch it with the camera.

242
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:09,760
Right. Now I've got the steam up so it got very hot in there. Then we'll see if it moves in any way.

243
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,650
We go up to the living room.

244
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,351
Boys?

245
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:12,429
Yes?

246
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:17,473
We just lost the kitchen camera.

247
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:19,075
Kitchen camera?

248
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:22,147
We are just on our way up.

249
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,155
Let me know when it comes back.

250
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:29,546
It's already back, it was gone for about thirty seconds.

251
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:30,551
Okay.

252
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,931
Wondering if something happened. We have to check, we have stuff on the bed.

253
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:37,906
Yes exactly.

254
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,907
Now the shivers came once more.

255
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:44,591
Shall we check the bed first then?

256
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:49,152
Everything looks normal but it smells strange in here.

257
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:50,440
There is a scent here..

258
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,835
Does it smell freshly baked?

259
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:52,667
Right?

260
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:57,920
It smells freshly baked.

261
00:22:58,107 --> 00:23:02,467
We'll leave it at that, the alarm doesn't seem to have gone off on the bed either.

262
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:06,360
Shall we go out to the living room? There is the rocking horse that is said to move.

263
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,448
I'm bringing spirit vibes, I'll put it by the rocking horse. And also our PDA, Paranormal Direct Answers.

264
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:16,132
Green or red, answers questions.

265
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:20,232
I replace Polterscript and run Ovilus in there.

266
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,729
Here on the right...

267
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:27,463
This is where it says.

268
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:30,000
The rocking horse.

269
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:37,577
I put it up here, in case it moves then this will take the movements.

270
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:45,474
You see, if I stomp. And if this one starts rocking, hopefully it will fall off.

271
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:57,984
So if we have the girl or the boy here, who usually plays with this rocking horse, who has made it rock before, could you do it now?

272
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,324
I'm putting this down too.

273
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,305
I back off a bit.

274
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,706
Do we have someone with us in this room?

275
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:24,160
I've got the spirit box ready so I'll just have a little session here.

276
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,880
Can you walk up to this rocking horse?

277
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,656
"Oh no"

278
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:31,375
No, a man.

279
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:37,976
The man who is here, is it you who went out into the barn and took your life?

280
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,646
"Seriously ill"

281
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,726
Seriously ill.

282
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:47,857
Did you find out you were seriously ill and then you went out into the barn...

283
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:50,676
and took your life?

284
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:58,163
Is it you that people usually see standing outside in the yard, in windows and just about everywhere?

285
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:07,992
Did it say Eriksson or Fredriksson?

286
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,001
After all, we brought in an object from the other house, that lamp, and put it on the table.

287
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:16,909
That's when the family says even more things start to happen.

288
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:19,189
Don't you love that this lamp is there?

289
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:20,268
"Go now"

290
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,583
Go now.

291
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:29,240
It smells freshly baked all the time in here now.

292
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,078
Who makes this building smell so good?

293
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:38,597
Say your name, you who make it smell so good.

294
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,524
"People live here"

295
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:55,374
This is also interesting, I mean we have these phenomena happening and right now it feels like we are talking to quite a few people around here.

296
00:25:55,374 --> 00:26:07,519
But I don't know, what we try to focus on when we are here is what he experiences. Is it really a little girl or is it something else that has been generated from something else entirely?

297
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:20,216
And we focus a lot on these phenomena, because they are the ones that stand out. It's the rocking horse, the bedroom there, the shower down there and we have another bedroom up there where a wardrobe door usually opens.

298
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:24,541
And objects are also moved there. These are caps that end up in completely different places.

299
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,298
I'll try Ovilus here and we'll see.

300
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:30,767
Anyone here? Angry I just got up..

301
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:37,042
Are you angry because we are here? Don't like us?

302
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:43,977
Can you make this rocking horse rock once for us?

303
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:51,373
You've made it rock several times before. When the family has been sitting here.

304
00:26:56,055 --> 00:27:02,843
What I feel now with hot spots, it's just his room. There are shivers, everything is very focused in his room.

305
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:12,533
Shall we go up? We leave the horse alone, it is also in front of the camera. Shall we go up a floor? And feel what it's like up there with this closet door that opens.

306
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,290
Yes.

307
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:15,803
We try it. Should we let the spirit vibes stay?

308
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:17,502
Let´s leave it. 

309
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:22,560
Okay, getting interesting now, I got.

310
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:34,349
It is this wardrobe that is said to open and close.

311
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:37,909
And these caps tend to move and change position.

312
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:42,787
Anyone up here who can open this closet?

313
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,493
Even these mirrors have fallen over.

314
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:46,263
Yes exactly.

315
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,552
I'm starting this one too.

316
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:13,103
That thing, I don't know what it was, it was something black, small like... I don't know if it was your shadow, can you do it once for Niclas?

317
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:14,263
Is that it?

318
00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:16,452
Yes, that might have been the one I saw.

319
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:17,623
It could have been me.

320
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:18,880
Yes, it can be.

321
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,080
What Tony sees is a light phenomenon passing in front of him that the surveillance camera captures.

322
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:41,170
If you're in there, take all the strength you can and just push the door open for us, please.

323
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:52,639
Take all our energy, we who are in here. Drain the camera battery, take everything from all the tech to be able to open this door.

324
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:57,644
Could you do that for us?

325
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:15,145
If it's the little girl that's here, doing these things, would you like to play with us and open the closet and we'll play hide and seek with you and hide, and you can look.

326
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:25,354
I try to listen while you talk, to the whole house. We hear drops, something hitting out here, you hear a lot.

327
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:29,173
But it's recurring, it's the same thing all the time. So it's nothing paranormal.

328
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:30,676
No.

329
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:34,206
Can you move a cap hanging here on the wall?

330
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,493
Evp is recorded.

331
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:39,052
"Jugs"

332
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:52,084
It's not the same discomfort here either. That's his room down there, so far, right?

333
00:29:52,084 --> 00:30:01,581
If you want to go for the instruments and what we feel, it's down there. But then if it moves throughout the house, the camera will catch it, if these phenomena occur.

334
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:11,071
But right in there, it seems like it's centered. I have a theory about the little energy that is there, uses him incredibly.

335
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:15,187
He sure has a lot of energy. So that's why it's in that room.

336
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:18,397
That he becomes like the battery for it.

337
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:24,470
I mean, doesn't it calm down, you have to do something completely different.

338
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:30,537
I'm going to put a PMB against this door.

339
00:30:39,788 --> 00:30:45,823
So if you want you can go by here and it will play a tune for you. Or open the wardrobe there.

340
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:50,000
So we let that camera work. Lennie says it now too.

341
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:59,070
That's what gets interesting, there are so many phenomena in different places here now and I find them so fascinating, you want to document them.

342
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:10,627
If we can find a logical explanation for them that's even better, we've tried everything here during the day, but nothing. Nothing logical, that one has been closed since we closed it.

343
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,725
Okay, we're going down.

344
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,978
As I said before, in these stairs you can hear them running too. People running up and down at night.

345
00:31:23,978 --> 00:31:27,040
It crunches a little when you walk, so you won't miss this.

346
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,443
No, exactly.

347
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:32,966
Here, it's a completely different feeling when you come down.

348
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,147
I agree.

349
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:36,677
You are drawn to that room.

350
00:31:39,673 --> 00:31:42,354
Shall we go back in and test?

351
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:46,365
I'm testing Ghostbox in there.

352
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:52,040
I have Ovilus with me, which works in parallel. So we'll see.

353
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,510
Now we are back here again.

354
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,012
It was under the bed earlier that we found it.

355
00:31:58,536 --> 00:32:01,699
Immediately! It was under the bed before.

356
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,709
Right when you said it!

357
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,786
And shivering. Good.

358
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:11,097
Can you get up and sit on the bed?

359
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:23,645
If it's a little girl, you don't have to be afraid of us. We're not going to hurt you or anything. You can just come up, sit on the bed, and you and I can talk.

360
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:26,327
I start Ghostbox here.

361
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:29,112
Ovilus can lie here.

362
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:34,334
Who are you?

363
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:39,457
Ghostbox works like Spiritbox, it's only digital.

364
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,141
The little girl that is under the bed, can you come up and sit.....

365
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,363
"Angry"

366
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,517
Did it say ouch?

367
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:48,575
I don't know if it said that or what it said.

368
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:52,464
So the little girl that's under the bed, come up to us here.

369
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:55,162
Do you see the teddy bear there?

370
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:03,449
See that teapot I set for you?

371
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:06,792
That noise, I put it here.

372
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,708
Can you tell us your name?

373
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:09,753
Look look!

374
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:13,339
Good! Go near it.

375
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:18,003
It glows on both.

376
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:32,171
Sit next to it and talk. So maybe we'll hear your voice.

377
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:44,532
Like it went.

378
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:49,539
Yeah, like it couldn't quite take it, did you see? It went away.

379
00:33:54,932 --> 00:34:00,000
Strange, I usually don't get anything, but in my head all the time, it's a girl's name.

380
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,453
Which has been going on now for probably ten minutes. Now I have to say, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa...

381
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,496
Who just goes round, round, round. We haven't gotten through Lisa, have we?

382
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:10,892
No.

383
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:17,639
Lisa, if that's your name....

384
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,443
can you touch anything that's on the bed?

385
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:33,400
Shall we leave this?

386
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,006
I'll bring this.

387
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:41,075
We leave the Teddy Bear and that because hopefully the camera catches it. And the alarm will go off and it will stay on until we get back in that case

388
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:48,601
Shall we go out to the building behind? Let's see if we can see this man. And there are lots of other things in the windows there.

389
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:54,369
Yes exactly. And Lennie knows if things happen, if PMB starts playing or something else.

390
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:58,667
But it's cold outside, so we have to wear our jackets.

391
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:07,566
And then we go out. We are leaving, we have a lot of stuff in our pockets. We also bring the sls camera, the thermal camera. We will look at everything, the man who hanged himself in the barn

392
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:13,379
but we will also look at where he has been seen. Around here, so we'll see if we can get any mapping.

393
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:21,109
The instruments are still running here. Lennie has full control of it, so he shouts, Johan you have a walkie talkie, so we will hear it.

394
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:36,089
We run both sls camera and thermal camera at the same time.

395
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,966
And it is in this house where they see people standing in here.

396
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:51,433
Anyone here?

397
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:56,108
It's interesting, a candlestick is on.

398
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:57,877
Should I turn it off?

399
00:35:57,877 --> 00:35:59,372
Do it.

400
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:09,096
Do we have anyone in here? Who usually stand by these windows and look out.

401
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,602
He has been seen standing here. And look straight at the person when they enter.

402
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:24,788
If you stand there Niclas, I'll see if I can get a mapping. See if we can get him with you.

403
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:29,431
You who usually stand here, this man.....

404
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,058
Can you come in here?

405
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:36,848
Probably you who built this house.

406
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:39,103
Stand with Niclas there.

407
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:41,282
The voice that Johan heard was not caught by the camera.

408
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,058
How disgusting it was, I heard a woman's voice.

409
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:44,857
What did it say?

410
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:50,210
A woman's voice, I didn't hear what it said. I heard a woman's voice in the headphones.

411
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,312
Only as a woman's voice I heard it was.

412
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:59,629
Is there a woman here?

413
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,732
As Johan just heard.

414
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:06,770
Can you side with Niclas in that case?

415
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,651
What degrees do you have?

416
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:13,774
I have zero degrees inside the building here.

417
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,921
That woman who was heard just now...

418
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:21,198
can you make a loud noise in this building where you please?

419
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:30,910
Where are you now?

420
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:41,811
I don't see any heat or cold or anything.

421
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:45,742
Wait, there! Now something appeared.

422
00:37:45,742 --> 00:37:49,373
On that hand there, now it disappeared.

423
00:37:49,598 --> 00:37:52,554
You hit it, but it was a little lower, like a child Niclas.

424
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:54,476
Okay, but then I bring up communication.

425
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:55,080
Did you get that?

426
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,885
Oh yes.

427
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:56,825
Good!

428
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,680
There was a shudder now as you say it, good.

429
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,103
Can you come back again? You don't have to be afraid of us.

430
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:12,852
What's your name?

431
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,615
Did you hear what it said?

432
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:27,926
Why do you want to hush us?

433
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:33,132
Are we talking too loud in here?

434
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,171
Then I raise this to max.

435
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,233
If you hear this noise...

436
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:43,468
then come and hush us one more time.

437
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:44,698
"Go!"

438
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:46,539
Go!!

439
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:50,424
Oh! Now it is, stand there!

440
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:55,103
A small child that is under your arm, touching your hand like.

441
00:38:55,103 --> 00:38:57,253
Good! Use this..

442
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,205
It disappeared again.

443
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:05,003
"My spot/my place"

444
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:10,421
We are standing, or something..

445
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,047
How angry he sounded.

446
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:17,310
I want these kids here...

447
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,930
Now it's back! Stuck on the other side...

448
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,976
Yes, there! Behind your back now.

449
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:29,482
But that doesn't look like a child, it looks like something is climbing your back now.

450
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:36,039
Climb up! Take off my cap, knock off my cap, pull on my jacket.

451
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:36,983
"Naughty"

452
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,408
Naughty.

453
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:42,541
Cool, there's a chill up your back.

454
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:49,257
Yes, it wanders up further and further after down back. The hands touch your hand there.

455
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:51,061
It touches your hand there Niclas.

456
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:52,258
It stood up, it squatted huh?

457
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:53,914
Yes, it was squatting, now it's standing up.

458
00:39:53,914 --> 00:39:54,794
*Thump in the building*

459
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:56,702
Oops, what a bang somewhere.

460
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:05,794
If it's you we see now...

461
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:09,201
the little child who is in the other house.....

462
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:17,695
do something. Pull my jacket.

463
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,766
It just stands behind you, it does nothing. It hits your leg or your hand a little.

464
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:28,320
And your knee.

465
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,947
There was another one..

466
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:33,660
I have to raise my hand..

467
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,153
Now it goes down, what the hell is it doing? Look...

468
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:40,000
Nicke, it's on the floor.

469
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:51,128
You see, it laid down and crawls along the floor. But now it's someone else who says...

470
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:52,075
"Hello"

471
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,807
It was a child.

472
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,844
Hey, we hear you.

473
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:01,107
Is your name Lisa?

474
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:09,731
Another one, though it's there now, on that side. It stands up on the bench. It also looks like a small child.

475
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:11,815
There are two kids here.

476
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:16,767
Are the children here now, you who passed away out here?

477
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,706
Do you see Johan?

478
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:19,206
Yes, I have full control.

479
00:41:19,206 --> 00:41:24,457
One sitting on the floor, one standing on the bench behind you Niclas.

480
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,235
"Mother is coming"

481
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,929
Mother is coming.

482
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,219
"Yes!"

483
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:37,815
I thought there was a black shadow behind you Johan.

484
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:41,880
I have a light inlet there, it was checked out all of a sudden and it's not you.

485
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,852
Mom is coming, okay if mom is here come in here too and talk to us.

486
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:53,071
Sick. One that is still sitting and one that is there. And both are small.

487
00:41:53,071 --> 00:41:56,385
Can we get your name? What's your name?

488
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:58,813
Can you stand up?

489
00:41:58,813 --> 00:42:02,094
What happens if I go out of the picture? Will they remain?

490
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:02,761
Should I try?

491
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:03,370
Yes.

492
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,968
Yes, try exiting.

493
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:13,430
Yes, it remains. It's sitting down there on the bench. Come and see for yourself.

494
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,534
Sitting leaning...

495
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:17,344
Now I don´t know what the hell is going on...

496
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:18,308
That's not...

497
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:21,846
Now something happened. It crawls after...

498
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:23,683
Gone.

499
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,298
I go there again.

500
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:28,738
You who were here..

501
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,086
Go down towards the bench there. There.

502
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:40,747
Now is the time for you to show yourself to us.

503
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:45,000
We would love to see you. If it is this man who is here now...

504
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,816
"Yes!"

505
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:50,618
Although there were two people who said it at the same time.

506
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:53,400
I'm shivering like hell here.

507
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,473
Do you talk to a boy in the other house?

508
00:42:56,473 --> 00:43:00,768
Now! One more. On the other side.

509
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,365
"Is there something wrong with us?"

510
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:06,674
The first sounded like Down.

511
00:43:06,674 --> 00:43:07,694
Disappeared.

512
00:43:07,694 --> 00:43:10,252
So, jump down.

513
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:15,053
Wow sick.

514
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:19,083
Is the man here? Which has been seen.

515
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:22,311
Go into that room too and we'll have a look.

516
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:24,869
Wait!

517
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,188
Bert.

518
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,125
A name.

519
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,208
"Stand there!"

520
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:30,688
Bert, someone said.

521
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,721
Is it the man who took his life in the barn?

522
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:40,440
Is that you that people usually see out here?

523
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,952
I would like to try something Tony. I'm closing this..

524
00:43:43,952 --> 00:43:50,980
I'd like to try standing where that barn burned down. On the ground out there. See if anything pops up next to me there.

525
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:56,675
Shall we test it before we go into the barn? But it's interesting, we have two energies moving here.

526
00:43:56,675 --> 00:44:10,000
They come through pretty well. But there are still too many questions. But it's like, there are still two children and the story is there. It's not far, we can just go there before entering the barn.

527
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,635
Lets go out.

528
00:44:11,635 --> 00:44:16,292
So if it's you who passed away out there, come with us.

529
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:27,420
As you can see, we are standing right outside the bus, what you hear now is our heater for the bus. But we've got a good bit to go...

530
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,513
Damn, was anyone standing there?

531
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:31,794
Aim the kinect there.

532
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,129
Someone was standing on the balcony there.

533
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:34,890
On the balcony?

534
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:42,218
Yes. It was a full shadow of a human. Stand still there, look here...

535
00:44:42,218 --> 00:44:45,235
So that was sick! Now I understand what they mean.

536
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:46,452
Where did you see it?

537
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:48,442
Like this.

538
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,585
Who stood there? Where! Wait, damn I got it...

539
00:44:57,585 --> 00:44:59,714
Here was an old man looking at us.

540
00:44:59,714 --> 00:45:05,984
Right where you were, someone was standing. It disappeared just as quickly.

541
00:45:05,984 --> 00:45:13,628
I understand now. What I saw was just black, this posture, you're standing with your arms at your sides.

542
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:14,409
Just stood and watched?

543
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:20,000
Just stood there. I thought now someone has come here.

544
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,657
Look there.

545
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:26,168
Can you come back, the man who usually stands here?

546
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:31,468
I just saw you. Now I understand what they are talking about here.

547
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:48,852
We have experienced this many, many times when we do this. That you see it, you get it confirmed afterwards, but we never get it on film.

548
00:45:48,852 --> 00:45:59,575
But now I think we actually got it. The sick thing is that you say we're going here and you stand, then it takes two seconds and then it just disappears.

549
00:45:59,575 --> 00:46:03,666
When I stand there, I become like this, the owners are back.

550
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:04,421
Well, is that what you thought?

551
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:05,683
Yes, that's what I thought.

552
00:46:05,683 --> 00:46:06,346
Was it that clear?

553
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:10,799
Yes, imagine a black shape that just stands and looks at us.

554
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:12,001
You didn't see if it was a man or a woman?

555
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:20,594
No, black guise. But precisely the posture, with the arms by the sides. just stands like this.

556
00:46:20,594 --> 00:46:29,080
But this is what they have been talking about, they have said that they see this man, he is standing here in the yard. He looks around the corners, he is here in the house, he is in the window, he is everywhere here.

557
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,501
And now I understand what they are talking about. He was so clear over there.

558
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:33,933
So sick.

559
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:36,814
But it's cool that sls took it afterwards.

560
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:45,920
Show yourself out here! And it is said that this Norrbotten farm was located here next to the barn.

561
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:50,000
I start and scan.

562
00:46:52,622 --> 00:46:56,564
These children, if you are with us now...

563
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,717
come here and talk to us.

564
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:11,157
I don't know what it said there.

565
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:20,461
If you can hear me now..

566
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:24,510
then come here and talk to me now.

567
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:34,149
"Coming"

568
00:47:34,524 --> 00:47:36,467
This was the man.

569
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:41,574
This man that is here, that we just saw, can you come here and stand next to me?

570
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:44,855
Stand next to me here now.

571
00:47:44,855 --> 00:47:49,848
If you stand there, we will see you too.

572
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:14,807
We stand outside in the yard and try to get in touch with the Ghostbox, while this is happening in the kitchen.

573
00:48:14,807 --> 00:48:29,207
What we can see is that one of the hooks is pushed down, and that cables move in the bags, we mark with arrows where you should look.

574
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,742
The cover is then pushed back.

575
00:49:22,408 --> 00:49:30,262
Okay, they won't get through here either. Shall we go to the barn and try, see if we can get in touch with them this man, maybe can see him too.

576
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:33,337
The energy memory of him if nothing else.

577
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:40,545
It is said that he has hanged himself here, from one of the beams. We aim the sls camera and see if we see anything.

578
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:47,976
The man who unfortunately chose to end his life here, are you still here?

579
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:50,996
Up there...

580
00:49:50,996 --> 00:49:52,550
It's up there, on the right.

581
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,698
Where? That way?

582
00:49:55,934 --> 00:49:58,265
On the contrary, yes, exactly.

583
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:00,655
Can you come back again?

584
00:50:02,636 --> 00:50:06,265
Just for a brief second I saw.

585
00:50:06,452 --> 00:50:12,028
If you took your life in here, can you show me which place?

586
00:50:12,403 --> 00:50:14,625
Where was it?

587
00:50:17,696 --> 00:50:23,743
I just got a quick one. I'll have a look between the caravans here.

588
00:50:23,968 --> 00:50:27,570
Anyone hiding down here?

589
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,912
You are welcome to show yourself if you are here.

590
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:37,555
Throw something.

591
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:40,312
Did you see it?

592
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:42,430
Where! No..

593
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:48,592
Are you hiding behind here?

594
00:50:53,835 --> 00:51:02,552
What is here, it appears only briefly. One second, then up on the wall, then gone.

595
00:51:02,552 --> 00:51:04,841
I go on this site too. Are you here?

596
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:08,459
I start communication here behind.

597
00:51:11,979 --> 00:51:13,902
Nothing.

598
00:51:21,842 --> 00:51:27,933
This man, can we get your name? Is your name Bert?

599
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:35,479
Hermansson in the last name, is that correct?

600
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:38,680
"Not really"

601
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,573
Not really. Maybe I was wrong then.

602
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:48,554
We heard from previous owners that it might have been, or I may have confused it.

603
00:51:48,554 --> 00:51:52,369
I get no mapping here, only on you, no one else.

604
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:53,857
Okay.

605
00:51:54,713 --> 00:51:58,191
Can you make a bang somewhere so we know where you are.

606
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:07,198
Knock.

607
00:52:08,023 --> 00:52:09,372
There was something here..

608
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:13,726
Was it at the caravan or?

609
00:52:14,213 --> 00:52:21,538
Niclas, shall we try entering the main house again? And then we go to the room, with the kinect. There isn't much battery left on it.

610
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,929
We'll see if we get any mapping on it.

611
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,827
Everything shines here.

612
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:44,613
No alarm has been triggered.

613
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:50,179
We are back here again.

614
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:56,946
Are you still under the bed?

615
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:00,411
There is Niclas.

616
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:14,844
You who usually talk to that boy, who has his bedroom here..

617
00:53:14,844 --> 00:53:18,762
could you show yourself to us just once?

618
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:21,576
A little time.

619
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:29,145
No mapping on the sls camera here.

620
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,765
I'll try once under the bed here.

621
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:38,742
Nothing.

622
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:47,140
We wait for Johan while he takes off his jacket before we continue, then this happens.

623
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,615
Damn, now he was there I think. Damn he was behind the car.

624
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:51,693
Huh?

625
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:52,954
Yes, hell!

626
00:53:52,954 --> 00:53:55,127
You see a lot Niclas.

627
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:57,685
Damn I want to see this damn old man too.

628
00:53:57,685 --> 00:54:02,770
But that's because I'm looking around, I'm looking out all the time. Now there was a black figure behind the car.

629
00:54:03,556 --> 00:54:10,859
While we are fixing and taking off jackets, I look out at the same place, but now he is standing behind the car.

630
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:19,200
The people who live here have two cars and they left one behind. And now he was standing behind the car. Unfortunately, we don't have surveillance out here, I'm the one who sees it.

631
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,911
Now when Johan takes off his jacket so we can be back inside.

632
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:27,479
It's quite interesting, I don't know why he appears to me. It's like you said, you also want to see and I understand that.

633
00:54:27,479 --> 00:54:35,989
But I'm a person who watches all the time, I might seem nonchalant, but I work on everything.

634
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:40,988
I let my body feel, but here I just turn my head, I see him standing there...

635
00:54:40,988 --> 00:54:44,053
The same dark figure, straight out here.

636
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:53,718
So I think it's cool, he walks around here, but he doesn't come in here it seems. But what we have focused on all evening is more this with the child

637
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:56,734
and it seems that there are still children here.

638
00:54:56,734 --> 00:55:04,582
Yes, everything the owners say here. There's two kids, we've got a woman through and you see this man out there in the yard walking around.

639
00:55:04,582 --> 00:55:08,805
We do not know if it is the same man who has hanged himself. Or if it's two different men.

640
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,658
Because it's one that has a slightly more aggressive tone as well.

641
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:20,496
You also have to think that it's their land and we're trying to get a little more justice for those who live here.

642
00:55:20,496 --> 00:55:26,563
What it is that can affect him. Because they also give him rather negative thoughts.

643
00:55:26,563 --> 00:55:32,544
So it's very difficult for us, I can't put my finger on why that energy does that.

644
00:55:32,544 --> 00:55:46,323
But I think we'll test a little more, we'll put out a pyramid that we have. The Pyramid of Truth. I'll put it in there and we won't be in the room.

645
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:59,103
We will stand here somewhere. And this one will then shoot out rays on each side. Which detects if something breaks it, then it will indicate with green or red.

646
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:03,281
And then that beep comes and has its own life in there.

647
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:06,388
Then I'll wait out here then.

648
00:56:06,388 --> 00:56:09,462
As you can see, it will be green and red.

649
00:56:09,462 --> 00:56:10,651
Two beeps.

650
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:18,512
So it will be on the bed here now, about this girl or whatever. So Johan will point the camera between us here now.

651
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:23,666
Now we have placed it here and it senses if there is any movement next to it.

652
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:30,491
So if the little girl is in there by the bed. We're not in there with you now, so you can come forward.

653
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:34,788
You can touch the flashing thing on the bed, it's nothing dangerous.

654
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:42,555
You can make it glow green if it's Yes and if it's red, it can be No.

655
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:47,960
Like I said, it's not dangerous, you can touch it as much as you want.

656
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,232
Do you know what we do?

657
00:56:49,232 --> 00:56:57,127
We have a car that runs on static. If you take it and place it under the bed, see if it can roll out to us.

658
00:56:57,127 --> 00:56:58,661
If she can get it out to us.

659
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:00,731
We test it.

660
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:04,300
We will put more toys for you there.

661
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:09,091
Then we have to consider that static fields are required for this car to start.

662
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:13,588
We will not be in the room ourselves. Tony will put it under the bed.

663
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:16,296
I put it where I had...

664
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:19,595
Now Tony passed by as you can see.

665
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:25,621
I put it here, where we had the static field.

666
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,084
Now it's under the bed. You can play with it if you want.

667
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:41,872
It was Tony again who walked by, so you can see how sensitive it is. It takes right away, so that's not why we're in the room.

668
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:47,386
So now we have posted a toy car for you too. You who are under the bed...

669
00:57:47,386 --> 00:57:48,778
There were shivers when you came out.

670
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:49,492
Yes?

671
00:57:49,492 --> 00:57:50,893
Good!

672
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:54,622
You don't need to be afraid of anything like I said.

673
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:07,981
Do you want to play with us? Play with this car that is under the bed and drive it out to us.

674
00:58:11,764 --> 00:58:13,085
Play with it!

675
00:58:13,085 --> 00:58:15,211
Play with that car.

676
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,055
Now we have addressed this with friendly voices, as if it were a child.

677
00:58:25,055 --> 00:58:26,228
Shall we try something else then?

678
00:58:26,228 --> 00:58:29,508
Try a little more like, that it's not a child.

679
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:36,563
You who are under the bed in this room, who are affecting the person who is in that bed..

680
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:38,628
can you make a sound from inside?

681
00:58:45,182 --> 00:58:48,640
The negative that is in that room..

682
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,257
There it comes!

683
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,106
The negatives...

684
00:58:57,215 --> 00:59:00,000
It pulled over the threshold and all.

685
00:59:01,198 --> 00:59:04,844
That was unpleasant, the negative!

686
00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:12,306
You made the car go out. The negativity that's in there, that's affecting this boy sleeping there...

687
00:59:12,456 --> 00:59:15,619
now I'm talking to you.

688
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:18,690
There is no little girl in there.

689
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,441
It's something else.

690
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:25,317
Are you afraid of us?

691
00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:33,687
If you are afraid of us, I will come in to you now.

692
00:59:40,503 --> 00:59:43,432
Can you throw something at us in here?

693
00:59:44,743 --> 00:59:47,598
You got the bus to leave.

694
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:52,693
It was sick when you said the negative. When you talked about it being something else.

695
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:56,631
We tried to address it as if it were a child, but it wouldn't listen.

696
00:59:56,631 --> 01:00:01,969
The thing that's in here with me now, that made this bus go out..

697
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:06,665
can you close this door? Lock me in here with you.

698
01:00:06,665 --> 01:00:10,844
Do you have the strength to slam this door shut?

699
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,655
Niclas hears a voice.

700
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,391
It sounds like a woman saying "Niclas"

701
01:00:18,391 --> 01:00:21,039
There are shivers in here.

702
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,560
It sounded like someone said something...

703
01:00:31,162 --> 01:00:34,664
Yeah, push me or push someone in here.

704
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:37,821
Push the door, push the bus.

705
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:41,594
The bus tries to drive again.

706
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:44,407
What was that?

707
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:45,963
That's it!

708
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:48,026
It´s that one..

709
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:52,048
I said push the bus.

710
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,802
It tries to push the bus.

711
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,670
There was a voice before Tony, out here.

712
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,680
Yes?

713
01:01:07,216 --> 01:01:08,791
I heard that one too. 

714
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,798
It lies there beating.

715
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,022
It wants to push it away.

716
01:01:17,243 --> 01:01:20,309
We're not getting out of here...

717
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:23,180
until you say your name.

718
01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:30,000
Who are you?

719
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,083
It starts vibrating more Tony, the bus.

720
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:32,830
Does it?

721
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,735
I put a PRS down on the floor next to it.

722
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:51,910
It could be that PMB starts up there too.

723
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:57,467
A bright light is caught by the surveillance in the room where the PMB is standing.

724
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,485
Show yourself as a mist here.

725
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:16,868
Play the melody up in the other room.

726
01:02:16,868 --> 01:02:20,245
If you are there by the wardrobe.

727
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:26,505
I'm standing here thinking about something that feels quite macabre...

728
01:02:26,505 --> 01:02:28,273
when we got here earlier today..

729
01:02:28,273 --> 01:02:31,444
this door was closed. No one in there.

730
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:34,320
What's also on this door, it's a hasp.

731
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,166
Huh?

732
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,429
Top left.

733
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:44,136
Is it so negative in there that they even lock this door sometimes?

734
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,514
Shutting it in.

735
01:02:49,622 --> 01:02:51,211
Do you understand?

736
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:53,423
It's pretty sick.

737
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,263
It's the bus.

738
01:03:00,424 --> 01:03:03,320
It picked up speed when you talked about the hasp.

739
01:03:04,256 --> 01:03:11,898
So those in the family sometimes choose to close and hasp. Maybe they forgot to tell you that this door...

740
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:14,673
What the hell was that?

741
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,230
It was the second latch on the bag to be lowered during the evening.

742
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:29,824
Something moved.

743
01:03:29,824 --> 01:03:32,916
Something moved in the drawers here.

744
01:03:33,702 --> 01:03:36,122
Or if there was any cover.

745
01:03:36,122 --> 01:03:39,201
It was like someone hit something.

746
01:03:42,909 --> 01:03:45,842
Is that you who did that?

747
01:03:45,842 --> 01:03:50,385
So close one of the lids here. Unless you like that we're getting closer to the truth here...

748
01:03:50,385 --> 01:03:52,864
that the family even tends to lock you up.

749
01:03:56,572 --> 01:03:59,128
It sounds like the car is about to pop popcorn.

750
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:00,956
It answers when you talk.

751
01:04:00,956 --> 01:04:05,120
Yes, it just gets more and more every time we mention it.

752
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:10,340
What's in there that makes them even have to bolt the door?

753
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,684
I haven't even thought about that.

754
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:19,348
No, I saw it now as I stand here thinking about what they have in there. That it is so...

755
01:04:21,384 --> 01:04:23,420
I am the voice.

756
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,157
Who are you?

757
01:04:25,157 --> 01:04:29,214
It is the voice, he hears the voice. Who says things to him.

758
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:30,750
Yes, but who is it?

759
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,689
Who are you?

760
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,360
Look. It just vibrates, the bus.

761
01:04:41,656 --> 01:04:43,863
Guess, a slightly nonchalant answer.

762
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:49,880
I believe you are a dark energy that has been generated in this place, by something very, very negative.

763
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:55,722
I even think you told this man to go out in the barn and hang himself.

764
01:04:55,722 --> 01:04:56,983
Am I right there?

765
01:04:58,893 --> 01:05:00,634
And then it increases.

766
01:05:02,656 --> 01:05:05,290
It vibrates even more.

767
01:05:08,473 --> 01:05:12,918
And you try to act like you're a little kid.

768
01:05:13,105 --> 01:05:15,120
So when the boy will be able to talk to you..

769
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:30,651
But we will tell those who live here, that what the boy is talking to, is not a little girl. So he should stop talking to you.

770
01:05:31,437 --> 01:05:34,569
It just faded, the bus too.

771
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:40,263
Okay. If you want to do something big and strong, do it now.

772
01:05:40,975 --> 01:05:44,495
Because you are not the voice of this house any more.

773
01:05:49,588 --> 01:05:52,367
If you have that kind of strength...

774
01:05:52,367 --> 01:06:00,338
I'll point one thing out here. If you can manifest without fear of me, then come in here.

775
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:05,320
Walk past this and make it blink, then I know you're out in the hall listening to everything I'm saying right now.

776
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:13,502
So if something goes past this pyramid, also a prototype that we're testing right now, if something breaks this beam, you see...

777
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:17,270
how it starts to light up. That there is something with density that moves.

778
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:19,968
What are you?

779
01:06:24,312 --> 01:06:27,790
You can scratch us as much as you want.

780
01:06:28,165 --> 01:06:32,184
But it will not affect what I will say to those who live here.

781
01:06:32,184 --> 01:06:35,264
Then you might as well leave this place.

782
01:06:35,264 --> 01:06:38,589
Crawling back to where you came from.

783
01:06:46,379 --> 01:06:48,599
Sick, it feels like someone ran a finger...

784
01:06:50,846 --> 01:06:54,227
It feels like someone ran a finger on the back of my neck.

785
01:06:57,486 --> 01:07:01,195
I'll see if there are high emfs in here.

786
01:07:01,794 --> 01:07:03,715
I stand behind you here Niclas.

787
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:12,140
Even if you say such words, you don't scare me.

788
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,907
It takes much, much more than that. Now this one is coming at you then.

789
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:21,329
Because I think you're hiding here, you don't dare go out of this room.

790
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,946
Throw the teddy down there then.

791
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,678
Now Niclas is there, lock him up.

792
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:40,497
Did you hear?

793
01:07:40,497 --> 01:07:41,584
It increases.

794
01:07:42,895 --> 01:07:45,528
I won't run..

795
01:07:49,723 --> 01:07:52,589
It sounded like it made a noise.

796
01:07:55,136 --> 01:07:56,408
Here behind.

797
01:07:59,816 --> 01:08:01,867
1.3..

798
01:08:02,129 --> 01:08:03,688
05..

799
01:08:04,474 --> 01:08:06,972
Even higher.

800
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:15,129
Here it's louder, right where the sound came from.

801
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:17,096
05 down here.

802
01:08:20,879 --> 01:08:26,096
And this is also a theory within the paranormal, that the electromagnetic field rises...

803
01:08:26,096 --> 01:08:33,821
when the energies, or the entity wants to do something. Or wants to manifest.

804
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,678
Is there anything else you want to do before we leave?

805
01:08:44,978 --> 01:08:49,517
Run upstairs, they've heard footsteps up there.

806
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,579
Knock on the walls.

807
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:57,209
Can you knock like this?

808
01:09:00,168 --> 01:09:09,536
Think like this, from everything that happens here, we got something very, very good. We will tell the family that it is not a little girl. We have come to that conclusion.

809
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:13,460
And I think the man that we see here, he goes around protecting them.

810
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,836
That he stays on the outside..

811
01:09:14,836 --> 01:09:22,880
He doesn't go in here because there is something negative here. But there is, as I said, a hasp on the door, you understand that it is something that they do not want to let out of there.

812
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,610
It may be that this door is about to slam because something wants to get out of here.

813
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:28,596
It's an interesting theory.

814
01:09:28,596 --> 01:09:32,747
But we tell them. Then they find out what we have come up with.

815
01:09:32,747 --> 01:09:34,113
Clearly.

816
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:51,189
Some investigations, nothing happens. And with some, everything happens.

817
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:59,340
The investigation in the north perhaps surprises us even more when we start analyzing the material than when we were there.

818
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:11,043
The family in the house talks about their experiences early on and we can now say in retrospect that we managed to document a lot of what the family experiences.

819
01:10:11,305 --> 01:10:22,424
Early in the investigation, we manage to capture the energy that the family senses down at the shower. Which creates a shadow in our surveillance camera.

820
01:10:22,611 --> 01:10:33,784
There was something special in one of the children's bedrooms down by the kitchen, where Tony senses a static field that our equipment also detected under the bed.

821
01:10:33,784 --> 01:10:44,797
Is this the dark energy the son senses in his bedroom? Which also causes a bus that senses static fields to leave the bed.

822
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:54,399
Is the man Niclas saw the man who hanged himself in the barn? And is he also the one talking to the child in the bedroom?

Perhaps the most interesting phenomenon that happens, which we have never been able to document before, is a poltergeist phenomenon.

The energy has enough power to push down the latches on our equipment bags. Not just once, but twice. As well as moving the wiring upwards in bags.

01:11:34,052 --> 01:11:41,898
This means that in retrospect we are now completely taken by what we actually managed to document that evening.

826
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:47,852
Our theory may be that the man who hanged himself in the barn is still in and around the house.

827
01:11:47,852 --> 01:12:04,006
Our recommendation is that the family contact a medium who makes sure that the children in the family are calm and that the energy that is still left is allowed to go to the place where it belongs.
