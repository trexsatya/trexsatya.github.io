1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,280
We find some genes that increase the risk of psychopathy.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:08.040
And we see that the genes especially in combination if you are exposed to the growing environment.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,960
Then it seems that the gene really poses a risk.

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,940
This is the series about crime.

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,940
Where we seriously talk about crime.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,500
It is important that we give nuanced images of crime.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,380
Instead of what happens in your information flows every day.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,000
My name is Henrik Andershed and I am a professor of criminology and psychology at Örebro University.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,620
These are the other sections of this series on crime.

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,260
And we will continue to talk about psychopathy and why you develop psychopathy.

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04.420
The question of whether it is inheritance or environment has been interested in researchers for quite a number of years now.

12
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,420
And you have studied this in slightly different ways.

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,200
The short answer is: It seems to be inheritance and the environment.

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,280
Not inheritance or environment.

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,320
However, it may look different for different people who develop psychopathy.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
You who listened to me last time

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,020
Heard that I was talking about primary and secondary psychopathy.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
And there is some support for and theories about

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Primary and secondary psychopathy.

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:38,800
The primary has more of inheritance and secondary has more of social influence.

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,240
You have studied this with inheritance and the environment in slightly different ways.

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Among other things, one has compared one-egg and two-egg twins.

23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Twin research can be called it.

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,100
One -egg twins are our natural clones.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,620
They have similarity in DNA.

26
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,620
They have the same heritage you can say.

27
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00.400
Because one -egg twins are more equal than two -egg twins

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05.440
Then we interpret as that there is something that is hereditary behind psychopathy.

29
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,680
We measure psychopathy at twin 1 and twin 2 in one -egg twins.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,680
And twin 1 and twin 2 in two -egg twins.

31
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,220
And then we are happy to study thousands of such twin pairs.

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,380
And then we see that one -egg twins are more similar in psychopathic features than two -egg twins.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Then it does not answer the question:

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,000
What is hereditary then? How does it work?

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,080
How does it work that we actually see something hereditary behind psychopathy?

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,760
We no longer believe that it is about a psychopath.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,040
Possibly there are many genes in combination

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,740
that affects the development of brain.

39
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,460
Which affects how the brain works even in adulthood.

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,520
After all, the brain is the organs of thought and personality.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,920
And of course we have a genetic impact on how our brain is affected.

42
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,700
Therefore, it is not so strange to see that we could of course have hereditary effects

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,700
on how we develop personality.

44
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,320
Maybe you have ever thought that you are quite similar to your mom or dad in behavior?

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,740
It can of course also be due to social influence.

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,620
Of course, we have also started to look at the DNA string.

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,480
Look at genes.

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,580
And look for genes that have to do with psychopathy.

49
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,820
We are no longer looking for the individual psychopath gene.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
We don't think it exists.

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
It is probably about many genes.

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,600
We find some genes that increase the risk of psychopathy.

53
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,200
And we see that those genes, especially in combination if one is exposed to

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
in the environment in growing up.

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
For example, violence in the home and so on.

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,460
Then it seems that the gene really poses a risk.

57
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52.080
Thus, gene and environmental interaction.

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57.940
One can thus have the genetic risk but have such a positive environment

59
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00.640
So you may not develop psychopathy.

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02.640
We still keep that too likely.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,120
That it can also work that way.

62
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,040
You can usually see these traits very early in life.

63
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,120
There is research from us here at Örebro University

64
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,400
which shows that we can measure these features as early as three years of age.

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,380
This does not mean that these people at the age of three have psychopathy.

66
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,880
It is not at all what the researchers want to say with it.

67
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,480
But you can measure deficiency in empathy. One can measure impulsivity.

68
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
You can measure voltage -seeking, need for change.

69
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,820
You can also measure if you start to lie a little more studied in school age.

70
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,320
So quite early in life we can measure these personality traits.

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59.540
Now many research is conducting and wants to find out: Where does this go?

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Which of these children show these features will develop psychopathy early?

73
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
And who don't.

74
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,020
A qualified guess is that all children who exhibit lack of empathy

75
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,080
At the age of three, it will definitely not develop psychopathy.

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,660
It will certainly be due to environmental factors and other factors during upbringing

77
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,340
Which will control it in different directions.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,520
Here we do not have all the answers yet.

79
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,220
But when asked how early we can see this type of personality trait, we can see it very early.

80
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,420
And we can also see that the personality traits seem to be problematic.

81
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,420
This is important at an early age.

82
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,260
That is,: when we measure lack of empathy at the age of three

83
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,340
so can we see that it is related to aggressiveness and threatening behavior

84
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,340
3-6 years of age.

85
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,920
This indicates that it is a type of empathy and personality trait that is not so good.

86
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03.620
How is this really about psychopathy and crime?

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07.320
Do all psychopaths commit crimes?

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,420
It is clear in the research that you have these personality traits,

89
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,060
That you have this whole syndrome that we call psychopathy.

90
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
It seems to increase the risk of crime.

91
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,260
Especially for violent crime, it seems.

92
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,220
It also seems to increase the risk of relapse in crime after stay.

93
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,320
You have already been convicted and make their time at an institution.

94
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,340
So there is generally a higher risk for a person with psychopathy to return to crime.

95
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,020
Than people who do not have psychopathy.

96
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,180
To nuance that a little more, you can say that it is also

97
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,480
so here that those who exhibit these psychopathic traits

98
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,740
and showed previous crime.

99
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:06,300
In studies, that group often has a very high risk of crime and relapse in crime.

100
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,280
However, these psychopathic traits but not so much earlier crimes are presented.

101
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,400
Maybe not almost any previous crime at all.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,380
Then the risk of crime is not very height.

103
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,460
It is an interesting nuance in the relationship psychopathy and crime.

104
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,540
Many researchers have been interested in the brain and psychopathy.

105
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,520
We have received some answers but also quite a few question marks.

106
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,220
One of the brain that we put in relationship and connection with psychopathy

107
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:50,780
It is how the forehead lobes that sit at the front work.

108
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,180
Worse function of the forehead lobes has been set in relation to increased risk of psychopathy.

109
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,180
And also the temporal lobes, that is, the temples.

110
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01.560
Then there are some structures inside the brain

111
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,980
For example, amygdala that regulates anger and fear.

112
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,360
Anger and fear are important concepts in relation to psychopathy.

113
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,680
Many who have psychopathy are quite fearless and get anger outbreak.

114
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,020
And there is a connection between amygdala and psychopathy according to most studies.

115
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,360
In Corpus Callosum that communicates the structure between the brain halves

116
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
There we have also seen some abnormalities

117
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
in people with psychopathy.

118
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
But this is hard to understand.

119
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Because we get quite weak relationships.

120
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,440
There is no strong relationship between how the brain is structured

121
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,600
That is, the size of different things in the brain and function in the brain.

122
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,600
We can actually film into the brain with magnetic resonance cameras.

123
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
We can expose people to tests.

124
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,980
It can look at a screen while filming into the brain

125
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,400
and see where in the brain beam we have the most activity

126
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,100
When the person looks at something that, for example, is sad.

127
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,300
So far, we are not completely wise to what we see.

128
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,300
We look pretty weak and diffuse relationships.

129
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,100
Maybe it is that our measuring instruments do not really keep up.

130
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
We may have to have better technology.

131
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,320
We can conclude that there are some relationships.

132
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:33,740
But there are many people with psychopathy who do not have a clear deviant brain.

133
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,420
A brain that looks perfectly normal.

134
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,320
What it is now. For our brains look quite different.

135
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,660
But within a normal range in terms of dimensions and function.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,720
That person can still show psychopathy.

137
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:53,540
So the possible myth that the brain must look completely different in a psychopath

138
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,080
We have not confirmed it in research so far.

139
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,880
I have met individuals in the Prison Service who in adulthood suffered serious frontal lobe injuries.

140
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,400
And describes a life before and a life after.

141
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,320
It indicates at least in some people

142
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,800
so may frontal lobe function be the basis for the type of personal trait

143
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,040
which is part of psychopathy, such as impulsivity. Not being able to inhibit and control themselves.

144
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,940
There are other diagnoses and mental deviations

145
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,780
which people can show that can be perceived as similar.

146
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,280
One can see, for example, that Asperger's and Autism and parts of the problems

147
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
which is about shielding yourself from others.

148
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,460
Exhibits what can be perceived as unemployment to others.

149
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,740
There may be anger outbreaks and impulsivity as part of

150
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01.860
They also syndrome.

151
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,760
You can interpret that as a psychopathic personality.

152
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,980
But maybe the foundation of it is something else.

153
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,100
And of course it is important to be aware of.

154
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Especially when we talk about how to handle it.

155
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,000
And how to diagnose it right and what treatment is required.

156
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,760
General one can say about people with psychopathy and their crime

157
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,400
that it tends quite rarely, just like criminals in general,

158
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,800
To be quite versatile.

159
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
Rather than specialized.

160
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,080
I think many people believe based on the media image that many who commit crimes

161
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
are very specialized and niche.

162
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,320
We see many serial killers in TV series and movies.

163
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,180
Serial killer is a disappearance of people who commit crimes.

164
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,740
It is a very small group that certainly stands for a lot of misery.

165
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,420
People with psychopathy are quite versatile in their crime.

166
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,780
They commit both violent crimes, property crimes, fraud and financial crimes.

167
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,020
It is the typical statistical image of a person with psychopathy

168
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,140
rather than being very specialized in something.

169
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,100
How is it psychopathy in connection with abuse?

170
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,500
A person with psychopathy who also abuses alcohol.

171
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,240
What does that mean?

172
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34.560
Here we have some answers.

173
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,880
And those answers tell us that it often entails an increased risk of crime.

174
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,700
But we also see that with quite a few other mental disorders.

175
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,020
We know schizophrenia as an example.

176
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,940
Schizophrenia itself is not a very high risk of violent crime.

177
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,800
But when it comes together with alcohol abuse

178
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,240
Then it becomes a rather proper increased risk.

179
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,620
It seems that mental deviations and problems with abuse.

180
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07.560
There is something in the combination that one can logically understand

181
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,480
that increases the risk of crime and different types of crime

182
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,960
Quite a lot.

183
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,820
So in short, you can say that psychopathy and abuse are a rather problematic combination.

184
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,040
And unfortunately, it is not uncommon.

185
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,640
We see that it correlates significantly.

186
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,660
Quite a few people with psychopathy also show abuse.

187
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,920
But not everyone.

188
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,380
Thank you for being with us today.

189
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,840

And don't forget to subscribe, of course.

192
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,040
I think it is important for all citizens to meet a more nuanced image.

193
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,920
Otherwise, maybe we will be scared unnecessarily.

194
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
To be affected by crime.

195
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,460
We may lose confidence in the legal system.

196
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,840
Due to the distorted reporting of crime.

197
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,120
Have you thought that you have a role in preventing crime?

198
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can have a role. I can have a role.

199
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
It is not just the police who have that role.

200
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,700
Together we can create a safer society.

201
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,320
This series is about it.
