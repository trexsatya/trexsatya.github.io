1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
- How's it going? - Good!

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03.840
- Then we drive then! - Yes!

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,960
- My name is Muna! - My name is Adelina!

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,760
- We'll answer any questions,

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,200
- About the basic teacher program grades 4-6.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,040
I chose the program to,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,400
I substituted at a school.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,360
I enjoyed the children very well there and in the classroom.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,120
- Same here. I also substituted at a school.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,840
I immediately felt that this is right for me.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,960
I was a little lost there for a while and didn't know what to do.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,320
Then when I started working at school, I felt that this feels good.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,280
- I would say that you should read the program if you enjoy children,

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,240
Enjoy a school environment and teaching.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
You learn the basic building blocks of pedagogy,

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Thus, the learning.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,240
We learn that it is important to create relationships with their students.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,520
To be able to teach and reach them.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,640
- Then we go through the three core subjects that are math, Swedish and English.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,440
The Swede and English are quite similar.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,760
Then there is a lot of grammar and phonetics,

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,960
meaning language sound. How to pronounce certain words.

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,480
And some children's literature.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,600
On the mat there is a lot about the usual calculations.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,160
You learn the theory behind the core subjects.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,400
The practice, too, how to teach it.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,960
- The education is four years, ie eight semesters.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01.840
The first course we start with is called educational science core, UVK I.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,000
There we learn about the learning theories and what they mean.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then we learn how to create relationships with the students in the classroom.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,520
Then we go more into the core subjects, mathematics, Swedish and English.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,000
Then we are divided into either SO or NO. What was it you chose then?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27.560
- I chose NO because I think it's much more fun.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:36,440
This includes biology, chemistry, physics, technology and ends with man and sustainable development.

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,800
What did you choose? - I chose so.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,880
This includes SO didactics, ie the art of teaching so.

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,680
Then also includes religion, history and together social science and geography.

38
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01.840
You have business -based training, VFU, several times during the program.

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07.840
The first time is already the first semester when you have five weeks of VFU.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09.800
How did you experience that period?

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,840
- Well, I thought it was nice to come out in practice.

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,840
To combine what we have read with the practice.

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
- Yes I agree.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,760
Then we also got to follow our supervisor.

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,640
See how they planned and taught different subjects.

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,040
We got to know the students and test what it was like to teach themselves.

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,840
How did you think it was? - I thought it was great fun!

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,640
To teach for these students, get to know them and create relationships.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,240
- I agree with.

50
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,200
It was fun to stand in front of a class and feel how it really felt for real.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,320
- After graduation, you can apply for teacher identification at the National Agency for Education.

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,120
- We become authorized to teach middle school, ie grades 4-6.

53
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,120
We also become eligible in grade 3.

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,920
What do you want to do after graduation?

55
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,720
- I probably want to work for a few years so I get experience.

56
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,600
After that, I think I will read on and research.

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22.560
- How about you?

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,000
- Yes, but I probably think like you.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,240
I want to go out into working life and accompany a class from four to six.

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,120
It feels exciting!

61
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,760
Then maybe I want to continue to teach a university class.

62
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
So a class like ours.

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,320
- It's very funny!

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,320
I have moved here from Linköping to Örebro.

65
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,400
In the beginning, I felt very small here on big campus.

66
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00.400
Eventually you will find new friends and people in the class you can keep up with.

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,640
We usually be here on campus.

68
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08.600
Sometimes we have a snack, we spend time with each other and we also plug together together.

69
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,880
How do you experience student life?

70
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,640
- I, just like you, have moved here, but I moved from Leksand.

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,200
I chose to get involved in the Corax Union section.

72
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,280
We fix with sessions and other activities.

73
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,920
With that, I get to know people from other programs too,

74
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,120
Which is very fun I think.

75
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,520
I very much appreciate student life!
