Hi, my name is Shevin and I am an administrator at Försäkringskassan.

2
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:14,416
You who participate in the establishment program and receive establishment compensation

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:19,666
may also be entitled to establishment allowance or housing allowance.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,333
You can get establishment allowance if you participate in the establishment program

5
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:26,916
and are registered custodians for children

6
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:32,166
for 20 years who are registered and live at your home.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,416
You get SEK 800 \ HKR per child until they have reached the age of eleven.

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,000

You can at most receive compensation for three children.

11
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:50,250
If you receive maintenance support, the establishment allowance may be less.

12
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,750
You can get housing allowance if you participate in the establishment program

13
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,208
And live alone in your own home.

00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00.666
You must be registered at the residential address.

15
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:05.666
How much you get in housing allowance depends on your housing cost.

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,291
You pay at least 1 \ H800 \ HKR of your cost

17
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:15,086
And you can at most get 3 \ H900 \ HKR per month.

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,750
If you have housing allowance or housing allowance can

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,250
The compensation will be less.

20
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,250
You cannot receive housing allowance

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,958
If you live inherent or share a home with someone else.

22
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,583

23
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:36,083
about establishment supplement or housing allowance with the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.

25
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,750
It is important that you report if something changes after you have

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,000

27
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:54,666

You will notify the changes by submitting a new application.
