1
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,312
In this movie we will take a closer look at qualities and entities.

2
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:18,688
We will go through to add properties, seek out entities,

3
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:23,808
Adding linked and local entities and managing entities.

4
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,392
We will return to our cookbook example.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34.304
Some properties are linked to works and others to the instance. There are also properties that are tied

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,864
to admin metadata or stock.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,216
To add a property, go first to edit.

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:46,848
The button with the large plus sign in the tool menu is "Add Properties".

9
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
If you are in the instance, which we are now, then the plus sign means "add properties during instance".

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,344
Thus, properties specific to the edition.

11
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01.440
We can try removing a property and adding it again.

12
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
We remove scope.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12.540
And we go to add properties.

14
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,800
We are looking for scope.

15
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
And to now add the property again so we can either click the plus sign

16
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
Or put us up to Plus and press Enter to add the property.

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,420
So we press Enter again to add an instance of the property and now you can enter

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,420
Number of pages again.

19
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,900
Then I use ESC to close the side window.

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
Some properties are instead linked to works.

21
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:54,432
The work information is under instance of works so far because we do not

22
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59.040
have started to break out works. We expand the instance of works

23
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:05,184
And we try to remove a trait here as well. We remove the subject.

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
I click Remove.

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:12.096
And to now add topic again during instance of works

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,860
So we go to add properties under text, ie instance of works, text,

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,820
Add properties.

28
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,896
We are looking for the property again

29
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,504
And tabs us forward and press Enter to add it.

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,856
Then we press Enter again to get to the side window.

31
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,976
Here we can now find the entity again.

32
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,840
So we are looking for vegetarian food

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,960
And we enter that it should be from Swedish subject words, SAO.

34
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,860
When you search for entities in the side window, you have the opportunity to delineate

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,160
The search and you have some opportunities to sort the hit list.

36
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06.620
We're Tabs up to Add and Press Enter

37
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09.952
And now the property has been added again.

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:17,380
If you want to get an overview of the characteristics associated with works, instance, admin metadata or stock,

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,740
Go to help and look in the table of contents there.

40
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,824
We click on help, it opens in a new tab.

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
We go into works and we can see in the table of contents that subject

42
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,260
Located under works.

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,420
We go back to the form.

44
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,512
We try with the property involvement and function

45
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46.304
under the instance of works.

46
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
We remove the property.

47
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,940
We go to add properties during the instance of works and we seek out participation and function again.

48
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,760
We use tab and enter to add the property. Then we come to a list

49
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:12,160
Where we can choose type. We choose primary participation because it was just a writer here.

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,880
Then we look for the entity again by clicking Add Entity and searching the side window.

51
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,340
We are stabbed to add and press Enter.

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,460
Then we do the same with function.

53
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,343
We go to Add Function, searching the side window for the entity writer,

54
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,207
We are stabbed and press Enter to add.

55
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52.095
The principle is that we link to entities that already exist, such as a person.

56
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,983
If necessary, we can create new agents for new people and you can watch a movie about it.

57
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00.543
The film Create new agent - person.

58
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06.943
Sometimes there is no entity to link to, and we have no information as a basis for creating a new entity.

59
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:10,271
Then we may need to create a local entity.

60
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12.575
I'll show what it looks like.

61
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
We remove the linked entity

62
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,767
and i now click Add Entity at Agent

63
00:05:22.303 --> 00:05:28,191
And then I go to create local entity at the bottom of the side window. I choose person,

64
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,079
And then I enter the information I have.

65
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,580
This is then a fingered case that it may look like when you do not have all the information.

66
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,620
This is how you sometimes do with subject words.

67
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,999
There are films about linking to subject words and about subject words as a local entity.

68
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,839
We will look at another trait during instance.

69
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
We go to title.

70
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:06,079
We have a main title and other title information or subtitle.

71
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
If we want to add a cover title, we may add another title entrance.

72
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,367
We go to Add Entity and choose type

73
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,160
Cover title

74
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,200
I enter a cover title here, I find it.

75
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,820
If we here want to add other title information under the cover title we may go to

76
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:45,600
Add properties under cover title. Then we can seek out the property other title information

77
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,840
And put us forward and add it.

78
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,200
And then we can enter the other title information if there is one.

79
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01.880
It is also possible to copy an entity to the clipboard and to duplicate it.

80
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05.727
Click on the three dots that mean manage.

81
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,127
If you copy to the clipboard, the tool feels where the entity can be pasted.

82
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
A paste in icon then appears in the places where it is now possible to paste the clipboard.

83
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30.047
For example, you can Copy an entity from one post and paste it into another.

84
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,703
You can also duplicate an entity which can be useful in some contexts

85
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:48,520
To delete a property or entity click the trash at the property or entity.
