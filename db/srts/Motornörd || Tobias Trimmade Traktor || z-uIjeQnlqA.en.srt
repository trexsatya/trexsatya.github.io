1
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,460
Motornörd =  Engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,040
A SPONTANEOUS PURCHASE

3
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,740
Hey, what's up?
I'm fine!

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,520
Do you have a rally car?
You have spike tires.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,480
Yes, it can be good to have sometimes.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,800
Today we will have look at my Fordson Dexta
with a 5 cylinder Volvo engine.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
Fordson?
It's a tractor...

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,460
-A tractor!?

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,880
-Where is it?
It's outside.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,540
What is this?
It is a 1964 Fordson Dexta.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,020
-What do you use it for?
I have that to compete with.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,740
I drive tractor-race, tractor-speedway
and tractor-cross we drive in Målilla.

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,580
-Traktor-cross?
Yes, we race at the motocross-track.

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,260
-Is that even possible?
It's possible but very bumpy.

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,300
-There's no suspension on a tractor?
No suspension at all, only the tires are swinging.

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:19,440
We are completely stuck in the seat without cushioning.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,240
It works but it feels in the body
a couple of any races.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,140
-There were several different branches?

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,900
For the most part we drive the tractor-race it's slalom
and then we drive between set bales.

20
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,240
It´s 5 to 6 differnt competitions a year
starting in June until October.

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,460
-Is there any competition ahead?
Yes, it's Hylletofta on September 14th.

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,780
That's what we're aming for right now.
Let's hope the stuff holds.

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,300
There has been some trouble this year for that
temptes pretty hard on the stuff.

24
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:00,800
It is a fully standard Volvo 850 engine with
original connecting rod, etc., The engine it's intact.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,840
A bit for a neat tractor in really
but you learn to drive it.

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,660
How do you get the idea to put a Volvo car engine in a tractor?

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,440
Well ... I have too much spare time.

28
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,260
-Who has come up with the idea of ​​tune a tractor?

29
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,900
Well that's a good question ...
I think it started with ...

30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,800
Rickard Nilsson from Gotland
which unfortunately is no longer with us.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,940
He started by posting videos on youtube.
"The Terror-tractor".

32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,480
I think many vehicle enthusiasts know who Rickard was.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,700
That's where it really started.

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,920
When Rickard posted his clips on Youtube
I was building my own tractor.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,760
It was a coincidence a friend had
been and looking for a tractor.

36
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:56,000
There is a T22a with a straight 6a diesel D24
lying next to which they have started to build.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Would you buy it?
Yes, I can do that ... so I brought it home.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,480
It stood in the workshop for a few years
before I put it together.

39
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:13,100
It was not intended that I would compete with it, 
but just a fun thing to build a tractor with a car engine.

40
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,960
Then it was a friend outside Sävsjö who asked if I would be in the tractor race?

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,340
What does that mean?
I said.

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,500
Well you drive slalom between bales etc.
Okay, I will try.

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,880
I went to the scrap yard and picked up a cabin arch that I mounted and competed with.

44
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,300
The first race I became 2nd.

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,660
Then I was hooked...

46
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,040
... it just kept going and then it was
more who were interested to race.

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,900
Then we started a Team.
Team Hylletofta.

48
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,560
We are 5-6 active drivers.

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,760
That was where it started for me and I have been racing since 2013
so there have been many competitions.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,860
My old tractor got off in the middle of a race.

51
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,280
Back then the start and finish line was at the same place.

52
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,500
When I drove over finish line, It was massive pits and the tractor started jump...

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,100
.. when it had bounced twice so it knick
and then the tractor was like a folding knife.

54
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,300
It was a bit scary but that tractor is repaired today.

55
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,540
I have sold it to a friend.

56
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,020
-You have 2 tractors here what is the difference between these?

57
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,880
This is a Fordson Dexta and it
others are a Fordson Super Dexta.

58
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,500
Fordson is an English tractor.

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,480
It came in the beginning of the 60s, 
maybe a bit earlier end of the 1950s around 1958-59.

60
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm not sure of the history back then.

61
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,600
This particular model has I have learned a lot since mounted it apart several times.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,900
This engine has a bit more hp than Dextra has.

63
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,520
Super Dextra was little better than
Dextra, you could say.

64
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,680
-What are you using this tractor for?
I have it as a truck.

65
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,700
I put together a couple of pallet forks so I can
lifting all my gearboxes and rear axles.

66
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,980
So it doesn't tempt my back too much.

67
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,880
It is a wear and tear tractor you could say.

68
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,980
The plan is that it should be refurbished.

69
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,860
Now I have bought so many tractors
since they break when I'm racing.

70
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,200
It is difficult to get hold of parts.

71
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,080
When I broke the rear axle last year, I called
five different tractor scraps yards and no parts was avaiable.

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,180
It took me 2 months to get hold of spare parts.

73
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,300
I got hold of this tractor in Hylletofta of all places.

74
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,220
I posted an ad on Facebook that I searched for parts.

75
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,480
Then I got a text message from a friend who had a tractor
and he asked me if you want to buy it.

76
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,680
Then I bought this and picked parts for the race tractor.

77
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,580
This is a standard tractor.
And I don't know what to call the other ...

78
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,080
We call it the little smurf.

79
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,380
I have spent many hours to build it.

80
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,640
After work, every weekend.
All the spare time you had was spent on the tractor.

81
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,120
Many friends pushed that Målilla tractor event is soon.
You must finish with the tractor.

82
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,460
A week before Målilla did
we first start up the tractor.

83
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,200
Then it was 03:44 i the middle of the night when it started in the garage.

84
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,840
Then my friend Jesper Fager was here and connected
his computer since it didn't start.

85
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,300
Then we had trouble with the trigger
and get all settings right.

86
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,580
But Jesper said I didn't go home until 
it starts and we were all very tired.

87
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,720
People who were here and watching went home because it was in the middle of the night, it's really crazy.

88
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,700
I'm passionate about it and what it to work.

89
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,820
When we got the tractor started we were
pretty tired so we continued on Monday.

90
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:01,040
Then when I was out testing it I realized that it was leaking oil from crankshaft seal.

91
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,920
Then I became quite annoyed and said that I
ignore this and can't keep up anymore.

92
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll be going to Målilla next year ...

93
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,600
.. but then the friends came and said
that we help you remove the engine.

94
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,380
Call and ask if you could have a day off from work.

95
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,300
At 22:45 we rolled the tractor into the workshop
and at 00:20 the engine lay on the floor.

96
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,340
I tore flywheels and crankshaft seals.

97
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,880
I called Volvo on Wednesday morning and
ordered a radial seal and had it within 2 hours.

98
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,660
Assembled the tractor and did a test drive in the evening.

99
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,080
Thursday we tuned the tractor on the street.

100
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,580
With the help of Natanael Ceder from Maxxtuning in Vrigstad.

101
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,420
Then it was off to Målilla.

102
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,060
I thought of one thing.
The front suspension are different when I compare to the original tractor.

103
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,540
This is how the original front suspension looks like.

104
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,300
This one is reinforced.

105
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,940
Since I have built a frame on the tractor.

106
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,560
I had to move the stabilization bar out.

107
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,160
They sit in the outer holes watching it
second tractor they are in the interior.

108
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,500
I've widened the shafts.
You can see that there are holes here.

109
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,020
I have moved the shafts out and grinded out of the holes.

110
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,820
Then I can angle the ball joints
so I get another camber.

111
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,420
Okey, The tires point outwards.

112
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,500
It will run more on the inside of the wheel.

113
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,840
Basically I want to angle the ball joints
forward so the wheels fold more.

114
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,240
Here the wheel is straight or almost so it points inwards.

115
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,360
You have welded these reinforcements on the inside.

116
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,580
Yes, I have extended the tractor 10 cm.

117
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,400
If we look at the trailing edge, I have made a sleeve.

118
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,940
As I have lathe and welded.

119
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,280
There are others who built their tractor in similar ways.

120
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,580
However, they have had problems since they have broke or bent.
Therefore, I have reinforced the inside.

121
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,940
Ah, you have welded a plate on the back.

122
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,040
Why do we have weights on it on the side?

123
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,820
Because the tractor is short.
It works differently from competition to competition.

124
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,760
This one is very smooth and I turn it around easily.

125
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,080
The disadvantage of short wheelbase is that it wants to
bounce and ride very much on the rear wheels.

126
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,460
Then you want to get the weight down.

127
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,440
I have made a metal belly in 15 mm steel, so it helps.

128
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,400
If that is not enough and want to get grip to the rear axle.

129
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,760
Then I put weights here that weigh 40 kg each.
So I have 120 kg on each side.

130
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,620
Then I feel that the tractor will be steady.

131
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,300
Is the side cover for Speedway?

132
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,360
Yes and for tractor cross.
This is when we drive several tractors at the same time.

133
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,860
When we drive slalom we drive on each track.

134
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,380
When there can be close contact, we have these pipes.

135
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,340
That pipe should be longitudinally
so nothing can come in between.

136
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,060
How did you get this puzzle together...

137
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,880
It was first and foremost you have to 
consider how long you want the tractor.

138
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,300
The engine makes the tractor longer.

139
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,160
I wanted hydraulic clutch.

140
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,680
This holds the gearbox together
and I've made an adapter.

141
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,480
To assemble the car engine with the tractor.

142
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,500
Many times you build an adapter plate on the tractor or against the tractor's bellhousing.

143
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,980
In this case, I chose to cut a bit from the bellhousing.

144
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,220
I took the grinder and cut it.

145
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,360
Then I talked to a friend here in Sävsjö
who works at a company with a milling machine.

146
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,240
He milled off the cover so I had to measure by all dimensions.

147
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,860
I've used all the measures of
a Volvo 850 input shaft.

148
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,500
But has the tractor's input shaft.

149
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,660
I drive with a flywheel from rear axle parts
and a Sachs 765 pressure plate.

150
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,040
There is no longer the standard clutch pedal.
I have taken this one from a Volvo tractor.

151
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,060
It's like driving a car.

152
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,280
On the standard tractor, I brake with the heel.

153
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:29,480
When driving, you can disengage with
the whole foot or with the heel.

154
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,280
It will be difficult if you have a hard pressure plate.

155
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,680
Then we have the cabin, I have come to the 
conclusion that we must be a cross on the cage.

156
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,280
In case of the tractor rolling over.

157
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,680
I have chosen to put pipes here as well.

158
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,640
Have also chosen to cross the pipes at the back 
according to the rules.

159
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,100
I've done double crosses here.
I use the other for the seat belt.

160
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,880
The carbin is just bolted to the fender down to the trumpet.

161
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,100
Trumpet?
The rear axle is called the trumpet.

162
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,380
Because it looks like a trumpet?
Yes exactly.

163
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,600
I can see the battery, is it a catch tank below?
Yes.

164
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,640
-On a tractor?
Since the racing is very bumpy, I don't want to drop the fuel pressure.

165
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,400
Especially since the tractor runs on E85 Etanol

166
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,640
The petrol tank is a old pressure air tank from a truck.

167
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,120
I put the prtrol tank at the rear so 
I have an escape route out if it catch fire.

168
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,080
On a standard tractor the petrol tank is under the steering wheel.

169
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,020
I don't want E85 there.

170
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,780
If I would roll over I will get all E85 on me.

171
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,060
That's why I want the petrol tank 
behind me so I can escape.

172
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,680
It have wide and huge tires.

173
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,240
I have new tires this season.
Earlier I've driven with diagonal tires.

174
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,320
Tractor tires are expensive.

175
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,260
The tractor has been a jumpy and I haven't
got the right grip in the starts.

176
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,400
Radial tires are much softer.

177
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,600
I have chosen tires that have a tight fit
and the tire become almost straight.

178
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,620
When I rock the tractor like this
you see that it have soft tires.

179
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,280
The tractor isn't that bumpy anymore.

180
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,260
I had some problem when I was driving
Speedway and the tractor went like a duckling.

181
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,040
That's probably because it's short.
When it starts bouncing, it continues.

182
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,020
The only thing you can do about it is stop.. 
but you don't .

183
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,640
...first over the finish line wins.
Then you can't stop.

184
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:44,320
Why did you have spike tires earlier?
This is the case when you share ideas with others.

185
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,720
Rickard and some others also had spike tires...

186
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,960
Well, spike tires are probably good idea.

187
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,040
It was the first thing put on the tractor.

188
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,700
I've driven with spike tires speedway tracks.

189
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,980
Then others say it works
with standard 3 ribs tires.

190
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,280
I had trouble in the beginning that the
tractor is wheeling at the start.

191
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,520
The first race in Målilla I did a giant wheelie at the start.

192
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,960
When the tractor hit the ground the rim was 
flat because the tires are too hard.

193
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,020
It destroyed both rims and after the race
I went home and was thinking about solutions.

194
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,560
I cut out a couple of rims of metal and
weld to the inside of the rim.

195
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,360
The other rims I have in there are reinforced.

196
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,020
Now I have tried to run original
tractor tires and they withstand more impact.

197
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,800
And the tractor get little higher at the front.

198
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,620
The grip is good and I don't change tires anymore.

199
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,960
Earlier I was changing front tires constantly
but that's a pain to do.

200
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,900
-What is this?
Why do you have one?

201
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,460
It is the steering column that sits there.
It's orbitrol.

202
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,760
-What is orbitrol?
Hydraulic steering.

203
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,160
-Hydraulic steering?
Do you need it?

204
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,880
It's much easier to drive.

205
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,520
Standard tractor have mechanical steering 
and if that pinch you have no wrist left...

206
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,400
Hahaha!!

207
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,000
Many of these people get hurt...

208
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,780
Yepp, many have been hurt.
-They have to learn the hard way.

209
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,260
It had become very much
turning when driving slalom.

210
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,860
Then it had been a lot of 
back and forth all the time.

211
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,480
That is why I have chosen to build power steering.

212
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,240
Then this is a very special sport...
-Yes!

213
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,420
You have to be stupid to keep doing this.

214
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,100
It shakes and jumps but the competition horns grow out.

215
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,580
It's terribly fun.

216
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,200
We benefit from charing ideas with each other.
No one has any secret at races.

217
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,720
When I ask others what they have
done, they are honest and helpful.

218
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,860
That what's great about this sport.

219
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,760
What kind of people are competing?
Are you all farmers?

220
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,800
Many have their own farms.

221
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:20,140
I grew up in Sävsjö but have also been 
a lot in Hylletofta since my mother grew up there.

222
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,840
I was with my grandparents when I was younger.

223
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,520
That's where I got it from
since I work with tractors now.

224
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,760
Well, that's where I got the interest.

225
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,640
The engine is fully visible here.
I can remove the hood.

226
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,140
Here I have my little screwdriver
that I always carry with me.

227
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,060
This has to be easier work with then a car?

228
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,460
Yes, I can accesses everything smoothly.

229
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,380
I found the engine on Facebook.

230
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:57,860
It was a loose engine from a Volvo 850
with gearbox and suspension.

231
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,320
I picked up the engine in Husqvarna
and knew nothing about it.

232
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,860
It turned over and had compression
so I brought it home.

233
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,760
I've changed the timing belt and some other stuff.
It's only a small 16t turbo.

234
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,680
That means that it charge very early.

235
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,880
The engine is completely standard.

236
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:25,060
It is said that they can handle about 300hp
and it has lasted for 3 years.

237
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,500
I have had help to build the exhaust manifold.
-It looks like a snake pit.

238
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,460
Yepp, it's designed by Jesper Fager.

239
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,320
There are straight pipes on this one.
Yepp

240
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,000
And a screampipe out of the wastegate.

241
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,380
I have pipes here that go from the cabin to the front axle.

242
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:50,900
It is a reinforcement since I broke the
other tractor so you want it as strong as possible.

243
00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:00,320
Future plans are to update the breaks for the next season.

244
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,860
It's drum brakes standard and that's what we use.

245
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:08,260
Drum brakes stop working pretty fast.
You tear apart and change the coating ...

246
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,320
... run 2-3 competitions and they hardly work it again.
Brakes are quite nice to have.

247
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,740
The idea is to build disc brakes.
I have some plans that should work.

248
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,600
More others have switched to disc brakes.
There are ideas how to build for next season.

249
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,120
This is probably the next step.

250
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,900
-Is it a 4-point belt?
Yepp.

251
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,560
Mine is quite wide.

252
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,100
Otherwise, it cuts your skin since it bounces so much.

253
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,340
The seat is bolted so the only one
the suspension that exists is the wheels.

254
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:54,880
When I have the steering wheel straight and 
full steering left or right are 2 laps.

255
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,380
You see the wheels are straight.
Since it is orbitrol steering...

256
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,000
When has run a race the steering knob could 
be over here but I never think about it.

257
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,100
-Is that the accelerator?
Yes it has a hand accelerator and there is foot accelerator.

258
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,320
You have 2 other pedals.
That's the brake.

259
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,600
For each wheel?
There you have left and right.

260
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,160
I push one of them when you want to turn.
And I brake with the heel.

261
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,280
When I turn left I press the pedal.
Likewise and I should turn the other way.

262
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,980
But when it bounces, 
how do you know which pedal to use?

263
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,660
It's in your head.

264
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,440
2nd, 3rd gear and reverse.

265
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,900
You see I have welded an iron here.
That is beacuse the 1st is here.

266
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,320
I do not want 1st gear by misstake.
It has happened in the passed.

267
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,780
Then the gearbox would make a weird noice.

268
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,800
That's why I've made a stop so I can't get the 1st gear.

269
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,840
Here I have water temp,
oil pressure and oil temp, ect.

270
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,360
Here I have charging and oil pressure on ordinary diodes.

271
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,940
Would probably not need any gauges
since I can't look at them anyway...

272
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,260
-What does usually breaks?

273
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,740
Everything possible ....

274
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,740
I have had problems with gearbox and rear axles.

275
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,200
Here we got the problem.
Here is 2ans gear...

276
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,040
This is also 2nd gear from gearbox nr 1
which broke down in Målilla.

277
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,900
There should be 41 cogs here ...
Now there is no one left.

278
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,220
Here are 2 pieces.

279
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,500
There have been a lot of pieces at the bottom.

280
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,660
It's pretty solid stuff.

281
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:59,240
Now the rain has come but I think so
people want to see is when you start this ...

282
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,560
... and drive around a bit in the parking lot.
Unfortunately, I can't join you.

283
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,820
Haha!

284
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,640
We'll see if the gearbox hold this time.
-Haha!

285
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,500
Hahaha, the cap blew off..

286
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,220
HAHAHA!

287
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,680
A tractor.
It's crazy.

288
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,400
What a fantastic machine!
Yes it seems to work now.

289
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,840
Now I hope it works in Hylletofta.

290
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,140
Now I have practice on the start procedure.

291
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,080
So far it is no rattling from the gearbox.

292
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,000
I wish you the best of luck in the competition
I'll see if have time to drop by.

293
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,860
I definitely think you should
then you get to see some cool construction.

294
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,440
See you later!
Bye!
