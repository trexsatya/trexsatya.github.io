1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04.840
You've just learned the basics of simpler stock analysis-

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08.840
-Hit a stable real estate share with low debt-

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,120
-And Press Buy. Congratulations to the investment.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,320
Everything went wrong. You are poor.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,360
So it can go when you can't hybrid capital.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,080
Therefore, you should learn how it works. Now!

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,080
In the balance sheet you will find the company's assets.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,400
These assets are financed by loans, the rest is equity.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,040
The most important thing to know is that when too much that is borrow-

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,680
-Is the bank worried. Then they want higher interest rates and maybe stop lending more.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,680
Fast -growing real estate companies need a lot of money to continue buying new.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,520
What do they do when they can't get more loans?

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,480
Well, then they give out a preference share.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,680
There are special shares that are over ordinary shares.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58.560
They simply ask investors for money. In return, they receive dividends.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02.320
"Give us money now, we give back a little at a time and even more."

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,280
Type as a loan.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,120
But preference shares are not counted as loans. They instead end up on equity-

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,440
-FastÃ¤n they are rather something between loans and shares.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,360
Then there are D shares. They are not as strong as preference shares-

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,600
-But works in a similar way.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,080
Thus, as a loan, but is not seen as a loan, but as equity.

23
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,760
But you can try even more. For example, start a joint venture.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,120
One takes properties you already own-

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
-And asks if anyone wants to buy 50 % of them. For 40 million.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,800
Some company thanks yes. The properties then end up in a jointly owned company.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,800
A joint venture.

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,360
In addition to receiving 40 million, the loans follow on the properties-

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,880
-With the Joint Venture company.

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55.880
Now the debts are not visible in "our" company.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59.840
Joint venture is seen as an asset owned to 50 %.

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,000
The debt of the Joint Venture company is not visible among "ours".

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,000
How should you be able to see this? Well, by counting margin.

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
Pretending as if the D shares and preference shares are debt-

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,000
-Do to take the number of D shares and preference shares times their respective share price.

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,080
That value minus equity plus debt,

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,120
Now you get a more conservative picture of the company's balance sheet.

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Now you can. Good luck!
