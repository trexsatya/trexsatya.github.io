1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05.800
American tanks with controversial ammunition will soon be in place.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,080
From the Russian side, this is raised as if it were nuclear weapons, which is completely wrong.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,040
At the same time, Ukraine continues to make progress along the front.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17.560
Here are presents, Russian damages!

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,920
North Korea's Kim Jong-Un is soon expected to make a rare foreign visit to Russia.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,720
And what does Putin hope to get out of that meeting?

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,160
The war this week deepens the latest news development in the Ukraine war.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,120
Ukraine continues its advance at the Robotyne resort along the southern front.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,320
Russian leaders in the region have confirmed that one has withdrawn -

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,120
- Of what you describe as tactical reasons.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,480
From robotyne, one spreads in both eastern and western direction, towards Verbove -

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,680
- Which is located nearby to move on to the next Russian line of defense.

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03.440
This is an important step, maybe a breakthrough.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,480
The goal is set to inta or isolate the strategically important city of Tokmak -

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,400
- Cirka ten kilometers south of Robotyne.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,240
In these battles, it now seems that the Ukrainians have takeover with artillery -

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,280
- That you shot a lot of the Russian.

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,640
It is one of the most important factors in this battle.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,040
Heavy drone attacks have been directed at Ukrainian port cities -

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,960
- Several nights in a row, during the week.

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,240
Russia, since they withdrew from the grain agreement a month ago -

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,080
–Have invested a lot in trying to knock out the Ukrainian economy -

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,760
–And Cereal exports, which is a large source of income for Ukraine.

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
The attacks against the cities of Izmail and Reni attracted considerable attention -

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,520
- As the cities are located right on the border with Natoland Romania.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57.840
And the countries had different views on what really happened.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
The drone attacks performed by the Russian Federation -

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08.080
- No direct threat to our national territory.

29
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,680
For us, it is clearly what happened. We have evidence.

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,800
The Romanian government is allowed to draw the conclusions.

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,360
That one chooses to hit goals that is so incredibly close to Natoland Romania -

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,120
–Is that from the Russian side is prepared to a large risk -taking -

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,360
–But also expecting the weapons to have enough precision -

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35.560
- To not end up wrong, but it is high risk.

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,040
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has been plagued by several corruption scandals.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,160
I.a. Should you have paid SEK 210 million for winter jackets that cannot withstand cold.

37
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,720
You have also bought food for the army for three times as high as normal.

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59.640
That there is corruption in Ukraine, it is well known, but it is also well known -

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,320
- That you have an extensive endeavor to fight this corruption.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08.600
This week, one of the country's richest businessmen for money laundering - was charged

41
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,320
- And several high -ranking officials have been allowed to resign after corruption charges.

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17.560
Most recently the country's defense minister Oleksij Reznikov.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,440
Although Reznikov personally has not been accused of something -

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,080
- So Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has been affected by several corruption scandals.

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,840
Oleksij Reznikov has lived through more than 550 days of full -scale war.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,680
I think the ministry needs new approaches -

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,440
- And other forms of interaction with both the military and society at large.

48
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,960
The problem is when corruption becomes structural.

49
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,800
That it becomes high level safety - that the state is corrupt.

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,120
And that is what you do not want, because it is a legacy from the Soviet Union -

51
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,280
- And not least characterizes Russia.

52
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,360
President Zelenskyj has had as stated the goal of stopping corruption in the country -

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,400
- Something he went to election in 2019.

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
During the war, billions of investments from allied western countries have

55
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,880
- Pumped into Ukraine.

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,120
It is about everything from weapons and investment support to pure charity.

57
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,840
Given the corruption challenges, the question is whether the Western countries should be worried.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,240
In the Russian information war, one tries to target areas -

59
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,360
- Where you know you can hear in the West, that is:

60
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,920
"Your money is leaking. Your weapons will return to organized crime."

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,760
There are no such clear tracks, but Russia would like to get that message out.

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,600
On the part of the West, Ukraine should of course be best supported and in that support -

63
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,040
- In the fight against corruption.

64
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,480
It includes control and audit -

65
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56.560
- That can be implemented together with the Ukrainian authorities.

66
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
They are also keen on this. Former Defense Minister Reznikov-

67
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,160
- Have talked about having to be open with how this works.

68
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't think we should be worried, but we should be vigilant -

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,080
–And we will help Ukraine collectively to overcome corruption.

70
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,760
In mid-September, the first Abrams tanks are expected from the USA-

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,400
- Delivered to Ukraine. It states sources for Politico, who say -

72
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,360
- The first delivery of ten tanks is currently in Germany.

73
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,880
Something that has attracted attention is that the tanks may be delivered -

74
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,200
- Together with ammunition containing depleted uranium.

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,680
To the modern tanks, and also to the Challenger wagons like Ukraine-

76
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,920
—Thely has received from the UK, something called arrow projectile -

77
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,240
- Of depleted uranium.

78
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,480
When using uranium, you take some of the uranium and enrich it for nuclear power plants.

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,520
That which is the residual product, with low radiation-

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,080
- Is just a very heavy and dense metal and with it you make alloys -

81
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,200
- To the arrow projectile, as the United Kingdom, which the United States has - as Russia has.

82
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,000
That which can form a danger with radioactivity -

83
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,640
- It is precisely at the impact, that gases and small splits are formed.

84
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
They are dangerous, especially for the crew of the vehicle hit -

85
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32.560
- But they probably have other problems to think about when they are met.

86
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37.560
North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un is expected to visit Russia and Vladimir Putin-

87
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,920
- In September, there are sources for the US defense ministry.

88
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,520
Russia has very few friends left and North Korea is one of the countries -

89
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,760
— Which is under major sanctions and does not have much to lose on -

90
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:59,760
- To help Russia. I guess Russia mainly wants artillery ammunition -

91
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05.840
-Rocket Artillery amnition. Maybe robots, but it's not quite as likely.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,200
But quantity goods of what you consume all the time.

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,360
What North Korea wants can be nuclear technology and robotics, but not least food.

94
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,840
North Korea always needs food, because there is almost always starvation in North Korea.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,080
Kim Jong-Un rarely leaves North Korea, and according to the sources-

96
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,320
- If the meeting is likely to be kept close to the boundary between the two countries.

97
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,480
But it is clear that this would be a continued Russian preparation -

98
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,760
–For a long -lasting war, to ensure

99
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,520
- In addition to your own production, you also have the opportunity to import.

100
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,600
It may not get any immediate effect -

101
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,360
- But Russia wants to ensure that you can hold on for a long time.
