00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00.888
Hello!

2
00:00:00,888 --> 00:00:05,200
Today I speak English, and that's because I have a guest with me.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,500
When you look at this, I'm actually in Greece.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,560
Doesn't really look like it, but I am, I promise.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,716
The girl next to me is called:

6
00:00:13,716 --> 00:00:14,496
Antonia: Antonia.

7
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:15,556
Clara: an ... Andonia?

8
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:17,716
Antonia: Mjjaaaaa, something like that.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,600
Clara: And that's why she's here, because I'm sucking in Greece.

10
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:23,727
In Greek, I mean.

11
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,739
I suck in English too, apparently.

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,734
How are you today?

13
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:27,734
Antonia: Good, how are you?

14
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,680
Clara: I'm fine thanks!

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,920
So the reason I sit here with Antonia is for her to teach me a little Greek for my holiday.

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,840
If you could rank yourself, how Greek are you on a scale from one to ten?

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,420
Do you love feta cheese?

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,898
Antonia: Yes, of course !!!

19
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:47.065
Clara: Okay, she's very Greek.

20
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:48,196
Antonia: Ten out of ten.

21
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:49.621
Clara: Perfect! That's the spirit!

22
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:55,720
Before I came here, I searched a little quick on Google for Greek words.

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58.840
So okay, how does a "yes" say in Greek?

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,763
Antonia: "NE".

25
00:00:59,763 --> 00:01:02,000
Clara: And how does a "no" say in Greek?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,720
Antonia: "ande".

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07.040
Clara: Yes is no and no is okay?!

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09.240
Huh? Huh ???

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,850
What are you Greeks doing ??

30
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,420
But now it's time for you to learn Greek.

31
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,300
Antonia: Yes.

32
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Clara: Maybe I can start with something simple?

33
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,600
I see in front of me how I get off the plane, get into the terminal,

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,100
Jumps on the bus and goes to the hotel,

35
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,800
And the first thing I will say is:

36
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,280
Where the hell is the beach?

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,460
Antonia: Without the swear word, you say:

38
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34.540
Poú Eínai I̱ Paralía?

39
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,729
Poú ..?

40
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:36,679
Eínai ..?

41
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:39,422
.. I̱ Paralía?

42
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:40,722
Clara: Para ... Lea?

43
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:41,542
Antonia: Ne. [= yes (hehe)]

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,860
Clara: Po inside e Paralea!

45
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,040
Antonia: Okay, so if you want to use the swearword it is called:

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51.060
Poú Sto Diáolo Eínai I̱ Paralía?

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,800
Clara: Thiallo?

48
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Antonia: Diá-Olo

49
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,686
Clara: Thia -ollo

50
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:55,526
Antonia: Yes! But you can also say:

51
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:58,186
[Found no translation but NOTE NOTE FUL WORDS !!!]

52
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01.331
Antonia: It's such a ugly word ...!

53
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,359
You actually have that word here! "Clean".

54
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:04.433
Clara: Clean?

55
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07.260
Antonia: It actually means "cock" in Greek.

56
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,479
Clara: Clean ...

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
Antonia: Yes, but it is one of the very worst swearing.

58
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,900
But you can say "#!? &%* Eínai in Paralía?" And that means "where the hell is the beach?".

59
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,180
Clara: Puston Potso Ill Paralea!

60
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,320
But give me your meaning now! I am super -tagged and a little nervous.

61
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,180
Antonia: ????

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,900
Clara: Exactly.

63
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,108
Antonia: What do you think it means?

64
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:35,100
Clara: Help! I am from Sweden and I ..

65
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,640
Antonia: Wait, huh! You..? No, go on!

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,220
Clara: Help, I am from Sweden and have no pants so where is the nearest place where I can buy pants?

67
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
Antonia: Aha.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,120
But you actually got some right, Soui̱día means Sweden.

69
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,786
Clara: Yes! That's what I thought.

70
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:55.820
Antonia: It means “I need sun protection factor 50,

71
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,240
Because I am from Sweden and if I burn

72
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,860
Then I will look like a chicken that just came out of the oven. ”

73
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,590
Clara: I am! I am in Greece!

74
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07.960
That is still good to be able to.

75
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09.040
Suecia.

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09.960
Antonia: Souidía.

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,572
Clara: Sueecia.

78
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:11,699
Antonia: Español?

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,480
Clara: So when I'm on the beach, and when I asked someone ... where ... polish ... the beach

80
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,460
Then my next question is: Do you sell pink flip flops?

81
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,720
Antonia: Pouláte Roz Sagionáres?

82
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,460
Clara: Polas Pink Sayonares!

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,460
!

84
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38.560
Sayonares?

85
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,329
That was easy!

86
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,099
Antonia: Should I continue? Okay.

87
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,340
If you are out and see someone nice, you will say this.

88
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,320
???????

89
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,540
Clara: That guy is so good looking that I want him to ...

90
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,160
... read Fifty Shades of Gray for me.

91
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,160
Antonia: But you have to be more "Popotimanarinafto"

92
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02.425
Clara: Popotidanarinado

93
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:06,900
Antonia: It actually means "you are so stylish - five out of five nasal spray".

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,280
Clara: ooooohhhhhhhh !!!!! 1!

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,660
So how does one "five out of five nasal sprays" say?

96
00:04:12,663 --> 00:04:14,663
Antonia: ?? !!!!!!!!

97
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
Clara: That is so cool

98
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,680
I think I'm ready for Greece!

99
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,460
I am so tagged and we will see as usual next week.

100
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,040
Thank you very much for teaching me Greek.

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,643
Antonia: Oh, thanks for coming!

102
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,643
Both: Hello!
