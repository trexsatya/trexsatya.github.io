1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,180
 

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,860
What the hell are you doing?

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,260
* laughs* I didn't think you were filming!

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,680
Ha, what should we do tomorrow?

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,380
We are going to Kebnekajse!

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,020
 

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,560
Hey hi youtube this is my dad and my little sister

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,140
Hello Hello!

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:16,800
 

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,300
 

11
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,480
We 're off to see the kebne - *inaudiable *

12
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,180
Tomorrow i will climb kebnekajse

13
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,360
With these two

14
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,140
 

15
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,700
Or we shall climb the day after tomorrow

16
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,440
We are going to Kiruna, and Nickalokkta

17
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,880
Nickalokkta is at the end of the road

18
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,140
This is where we get off the bus

19
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,580
It is ... nine in the evening

20
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,040
The day before

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,120
Tomorrow we will fly to Kiruna, then we will take a bus to Nikkaloukta

22
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,060
Then we shall wander from there, to

23
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,555
Kebne, then we will hike up Kebne.

24
00:00:42,555 --> 00:00:45,625
And then we'll wander down Kebne, and then we'll wander back to

25
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:46,935
Nikkaloukta, and then we'll take the bus

26
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,380
Then we will sleep in a hotel and then we will fly home. And this will take approximately

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,980
Four days.

28
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:52,480
so that,,

29
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,440
Join us, come! Let's go.

30
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,835
 

31
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
 

32
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,459
 

33
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,079
Now I'm ready.

34
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,580
Ohly wait!

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Safety First.

36
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,700
Good morning!

37
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,880
Now we are on our way to Arlanda and are going to go flyyg

38
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,440
 

39
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,280
To Kiruna!

40
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,660
 

41
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,520
We'll have so much fun!

42
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,640
Are you sure about that?

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,140
But...

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,620
Dad where are we now?

45
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,160
 

46
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Nikkalouka!

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,760
What was it called yesterday?

48
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,960
Nouk colook!

49
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,520
And the day before yesterday?

50
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,580
Nakkikika!

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,340
Now we have traveled by bus from Kiruna to Nikkaloukta

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,900
And here is cold, but it does not rain at least so it is nice.

53
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,940
Exited?

54
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,620
Let's Take Photos!

55
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,200
Okay! Okay!

56
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,720
The Lelle Fege!

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,800
Where is the Lelle Fege?

58
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,940
Og then, then you cope, and so hell!

59
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:06,825
Sure it will be like this, if you say something in Danish, you want to say something

60
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,875
In Danish, and so you don't know what it's called in Danish, then you can just say it in English

61
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,785
With Danish dialect, it sounds like it's Danish. Like this,

62
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:15,445
I don't know what dinner is called but I can say like this,

63
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:17,620
We should go home og spise a little dinner!

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
Sure, it works!

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,860
Check out here

66
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,220
Kebne Bejb!

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,060
I'm your kebne bae.

68
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,980
The Long Wandering

69
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,400
Has Begun!

70
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,840
*We're on to see the wizard, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz!*

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,660
Dad what do you have on your backpack?

72
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
A baguette!

73
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,000
A salmon baguette. It's dinner.

74
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,340
Oh! No, but God! Oh hell!

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,180
Fyfan!

76
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,600
That bridge was damn the most disgusting!

77
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,100
 

78
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,600
An adventure completed! Now continues ...

79
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,960
The great adventure!

80
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,820
Next!

81
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,985
I'm gonna drink me piss ..

82
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,940
And you didn't bring me in Wild Kids your fucking

83
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,455
Look at me now!

84
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,155
God this feels like Blair Witch Project

85
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,135
 

86
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:31,025
Since the last time I filmed it has been raining

87
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:32,805
And it has rained

88
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:36,315
Eh, and so it has rained a little more, and therefore I have

89
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,305
Eh, my camera inside my rain jacket whole

90
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:42,245
The road to

91
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,880
The mountain station where we are now

92
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,980
It is twelve kilometers of rain. All we have is wet!

93
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,055
My sleeping bag is so wet

94
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:53,365
That I could squeeze it out and it would run. I don't know what to sleep at night.

95
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:56,635
I will freeze like an ass. Do you hear how it rains? This..

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,215
So ... stressful!

97
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,960
I am not built for such challenges

98
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,780
I feel like a spoiled Stockholmer - and I am after all

99
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Largely. But shit what it took time! Now it is almost twelve o'clock

100
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,825
At night. And I think the last time I talked to you so was six o'clock in the evening

101
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:12,925
Herrejävstagud! But ... should you see it from the bright side

102
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,965
So we are there. And it could ...

103
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:18,885
You could have had menstruation. And besides, we will be allowed to fall asleep

104
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:21,325
To the most cozy sound there is.

105
00:04:21,325 --> 00:04:24,815
Okay, but now we'll try to sleep and dry a little. See you tomorrow. Good night.

106
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,120
Good morning! Tajm for porridge!

107
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,460
How are you? - wet. - Tired. - Hungry.

108
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,900
You are so damn miserable.

109
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,540
I have slept very at night. I had one

110
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,180
Snorobeemed pillow, it's just air

111
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,020
As well as.

112
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,760
Now it's time for ... *mmmm *

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,240
Delicious! Check...

114
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,875
I'll let that lens off-immose

115
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,855
But today we should climb kebne .. or?

116
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:53,885
Aa, it is very foggy and they are raining. If we are lucky we may not get!

117
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:54,885
Well.

118
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:58,255
Here we are again, on the way to become a daily

119
00:04:58,255 --> 00:04:59,255
It still rain

120
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,215
And, eh, these two

121
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:05,365
Are convinced that we will reach Kebne's top today. I am ...

122
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:08,485
All the more pessimistic, and I'm usually an optimist

123
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:09,485
Should you know

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,680
Here we go!

125
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,180
So it rains so damn much and i'm so glad we should not go over here

126
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,540
We're going up to the snow instead!

127
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,260
And so i have shoe

128
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
And no energy

129
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,740
Five out of five nasal spray

130
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
Okay, eh ...

131
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,820
Now it's like this. I have fat a lot of shoe polish, but we just went down for this hill to

132
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
We were forced to kind of take, eh, this bridge over. Damn Fors.

133
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,600
So my foot turned twice and I have shoe shav on

134
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,000
Three different places

135
00:05:43,525 --> 00:05:44,525
Eh, and then I feel that

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,440
No! Now, I am going home!

137
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,620
And I'm not even disappointed with it. But these two continue a little more!

138
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,600
Go Go!

139
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,020
On the initiative of one of them, guess who!

140
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Okay, goodbye, have a good time!

141
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,180
Bye!

142
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,760
 

143
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:12,040
*Music from Wizard of oz*

144
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:20,300
*Music from Wizard of oz*

145
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,760
You are back! - Hello!

146
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,760
How did it go? - like two fish in the water

147
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,680
Or as two hikers in the water

148
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,000
Because we were. - we came one hundred meters

149
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,300
After we said goodbye to you

150
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,160
So now we sit here and eat

151
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,780
Lunch! Noodles with soy protein and

152
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,400
Great fake sweet and sour sauce

153
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:45,585
 

154
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:46,865
 

155
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:50,315
Good morning! Day three with these two

156
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:53,345
In a forest. Today we will hike back to

157
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,105
Nikkaloukta and from there take the bus to Kiruna

158
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:59,055
And then take in a hostel and then tomorrow we go home

159
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,280
It's just that these are the 19 kilometers to Nikkaloukta

160
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,480
So that we were thinking of thieving

161
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,300
Boat! Or we were thinking of going boat very legal

162
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,985
By paying for a ticket admittedly, but

163
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:13,935
So we will hike in type 9 kilometers, and then we will go boat

164
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,305
It will be very nice because I have brutal pain

165
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,345
In my right foot. Here's how you can do!

166
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,555
So you have to do when you know the road will be wet

167
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,315
And you will need to go in the wet with anyway one foot

168
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:28,185
But the other foot cannot have to tie on

169
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:31,185
It then dies

170
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:34,180
Now you are well! - Yes, I long for a shower, otherwise it's good

171
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,840
Here we have my backpack too. I look very much forward to putting it on my back

172
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 

173
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,140
See you along the way, bye!

174
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,940
Oh be nice

175
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Sööööt!

176
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,460
No but gold!

177
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,900
Zero!

178
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,900
Nine kilometers later!

179
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,300
It's me.

180
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,400
Fyfan what I'm sweaty

181
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,340
Now we'll just find

182
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,220
To little fine

183
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,100
What do you do? - You hate people. -No I love them!

184
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,400
She hates people.

185
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,720
I love them!

186
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,160
Now comes the boat

187
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 

188
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:23,615
 

189
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Now we've got off the boat

190
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,380
And do you see what I see?

191
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,679
Where the hell is it somewhere? Do you see up there?

192
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,879
We have not been there. - But a good try! We excited

193
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,505
The bow and the string burst

194
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,625
And we walked home again. That happens

195
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:50,955
 

196
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,325
We're back, bitches!

197
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:56,565
No, what did you say now? - Good!

198
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:59,525
Good for yourself! Good work!

199
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:01,025
Ah, good!

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,360
Check out again! Check...

201
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,960
Now we are on the bus home and thus a thought struck me

202
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:12,335
So we have walked there

203
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,280
We have gone there. How sick is that?

204
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,760
There - we have walked there

205
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
I do not get it

206
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,780
Good morning!

207
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,620
It is day four on the big adventure and today we will

208
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Go home!

209
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,300
We came to the hostel last night, cooked dinner

210
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,920
Washed our clothes

211
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,640
I was filming nothing and you have not missed very much

212
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,740
Except when some guy man plain for me how

213
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,960
The washing machine worked

214
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,500
But now we are at least on our way to the airport bus and are going to go home

215
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,920
Nice.

216
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,020
Now I'm home Bob!

217
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,380
So, Shine Bright Like A Diamond?

218
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,600
Now I have come home, I just said hello to Dad and Kimba

219
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,095
And

220
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:02,135
It is very nice to be home, my God

221
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,660
I was going to sit down and cut the material that I have filmed now

222
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,620
And it will be very exciting to see. On the one hand, it feels like we have not done anything

223
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,220
Because we never came up for Kebne. It's 9 kilometers

224
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,075
Up to the top, but I barely think we came two kilometers

225
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,425
Because it was raining so much. On the other hand - I'm not

226
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:18,445
Great disappointed that we did not come up because it would have been as a job, plus that if you count together

227
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:21,575
The total stretch that we actually wandered these days

228
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:24,485
Then it is thirty -five kilometers

229
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,495
Thirtyfive! I understand why my foot has blisters

230
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:30,245
And has kind of started to develop an extra heel. I mean check out this!

231
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:33,415
What is it? But anyhow,

232
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:36,285
Thank you very much for looking and following along on the spring

233
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:39,495
Miserable mountaineering. It was fun to have you with

234
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:42,505
But you have to take it beautifully, and so we will see just as usual next week

235
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:43,505
Bye!
