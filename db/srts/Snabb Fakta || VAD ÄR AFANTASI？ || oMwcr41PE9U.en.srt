1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08.660
What is afantasi?

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,520
We will find out today.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,420
Close.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,300
Imagine you stand on a beach.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,380
The waves are booking in front of you and the sun is going down.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,140
Can you see it in front of you?

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,320
Can you imagine this scene in your head?

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,200
If you can't, if you don't see anything at all in front of you,

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,640
Then you can have what is called afantasi.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,160
It is a neurological condition where one cannot

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,160
visualize images in their head.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,400
One cannot imagine a beach or room

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Or something else in their imagination.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,640
In short, man has an inability to create mental images.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,920
This phenomenon was already described in 1880 by Francis Galton

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01.620
A British anthropologist and psychologist.

17
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,580
In his study published in 1880,

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08.640
called the Statistics of Mental Imagery, he examined

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,320
How well people could produce mental visual images.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,940
He asked to visualize and describe their breakfast tables

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,020
As carefully they could.

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,200
Then he discovered a surprising variety

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,980
in the person's ability to create these mental images.

24
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,020
Some could create clear and vibrant images in their senses,

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,320
while others reported a total inability to visualize.

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,100
They couldn't see anything at all.

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,480
The very term “afantasi” first got its name and became

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,080
more widely known after a study named Lives Without Imagery

29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,480
Congenital aphantasia from 2015 by the professor

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,220
Adam Zeman who worked at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom.

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00.940
The vast majority of people who have afantasi are born with it,

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,760
But there are reported cases where the condition has been developed, for example

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,500
after a brain injury, a stroke or an operation.

34
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,600
Characteristics if a person has afantasi is as

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,960
Said the inability to create mental images in the head.

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,540
They don't remember events the same way

37
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,780
And can't play a memory in the head.

38
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,080
A person with afantasi may also have difficulty with expression

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,320
Like counting sheep before falling asleep.

40
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,080
It can be confusing because the person does not see any

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,440
Sheep in front of them who skip a fence.

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,000
Persons with Antasi are not as afraid of scary stories either

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,960
Because they can't see the scary in front of them.

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,020
Avantasi can also affect several senses.

45
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,220
People with afantasi may also have a reduced ability

46
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,080
To imagine sounds, smells or flavors.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,000
But one should not misunderstand it as persons with afantasi

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00.420
is not as creative or good at problem solving.

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,740
Those who have the condition have adapted to it and taught themselves

50
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08.040
to think and remember in a way that is not dependent

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
of visual mental images.

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,140
Some people first discover that they have afantasi much later

53
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,000
in life and may also be surprised that others can

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,080
see things in their head.

55
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,400
Today we know that the ability to visualize pictures

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,040
in its head is on a spectrum where Avantasi represents one end

57
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,120
with a total or close total inability to create mental images.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,660
And on the other side of the spectrum we find hyperfantasi

59
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,200
Where individuals have an exceptionally good ability to create mental images.

60
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,100
Between these two there are a variety of different levels

61
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,540
of the ability to visualize things in one's head.

62
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,760
A tool used to explore this spectrum is

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00.120
VIVIDNESS OF VISUAL IMAGERY Questionnaire

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,380
It is a survey that helps researchers measure

65
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,160
And compare individuals' ability to create mental images.

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,280
About 2 to 3 \ h% of all people on earth may have a fantasy to a

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,420
some degree, but many are not even aware that they have the condition,

68
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,120
So the actual figure can be higher.

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,660
We still know very little about Avantasi, but the research is ongoing.

70
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,560
The important thing to take with you is to aphantasi

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34.560
should not be seen as an obstacle to living a full life.

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,600
Many who have the condition are not even aware of it and have successfully

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,780
learned to navigate through everyday life without the need

74
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,740
of visual mental images.

75
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,140
I hope you have learned a little more about what AFANTASI is for something.
