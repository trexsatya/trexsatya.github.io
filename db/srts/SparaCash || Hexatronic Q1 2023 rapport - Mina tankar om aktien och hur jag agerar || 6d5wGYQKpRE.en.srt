00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Hexatronic has a report today and I thought I would make a quick comment on the report after a lot of requests namely.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,660
So we check and then we see here that the share is currently trading down to minus 10 percent.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,660
Absolutely crazy and it was one of my biggest holdings, or has been anyway.

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,660
Now it is no longer that after this year's decline of just over 40 percent.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,660
And we actually had a bang report.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,010
Because if we look here, we will see that yes, but it is a record quarter.

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,010
The first quarter was a record quarter both in terms of sales and profitability.

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:51,170
Mainly North America then, the USA and Europe very strong except for Sweden then which has taken a bit of a break if you say so.

9
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,330
But despite this, the stock is down a lot.

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:03,150
Because if we take a look at this graph that we see here, we can see that the turnover is crazy.

11
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:11,150
They are growing nicely and the margin is also up so that you increase both profit and turnover.

12
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:21,150
But there were few words that were reviewed in the report, where some might have interpreted this organic growth, which has come down quite a bit.

13
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:28,150
For example, DI who shared this graph back then of the organic growth which has dropped quite a bit.

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,150
Which could be a reason why the stock is traded down so much.

15
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,150
Since the order book, we also see that it has come down quite a bit.

16
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,150
But CEO Henrik Larsson-Lyon says himself that they are not worried.

17
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,150
In the past, during, for example, covid, there have been very long delivery times.

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:55,150
This means that you may have ordered or placed an order 4-5 months in advance.

19
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,150
Because it takes so long then to get material in to be able to implement the words.

20
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:05,150
While it will then go back a little more normal 2-3 months maybe so.

21
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,380
And this could be one reason why the market trades the share down so much.

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,380
It has also been very highly polished.

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:24,240
And I scraped together some numbers, namely on turnover which has been historical as you can see above me.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,240
And then we look at turnover, then the biggest legs where we see the most likely growth going forward.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
It's probably North America and the rest of Europe.

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,240
For this we have the USA, we have Germany and we have the UK.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Those are the three biggest parts if you say.

28
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,240
And we look at historical growth.

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Here, I have not included Sweden because as you can see here, Sweden is a bit sluggish and not so extremely high growth potential.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,240
But if you look at these legs, it looks very nice in the long run.

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,240
If you think that the US will continue to grow at the same rate as it did before.

32
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:16,270
After all, there was decent growth if you look from the first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023.

33
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,270
And then we add the quarters together and we see that it looks quite nice geographically.

34
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,270
Both in Europe and in North America then.

35
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:36,800
And if you look at the estimates that I have entered here, where it is assumed that you follow these financial goals.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,800
If you reach 20% growth in 2023 2024 2025.

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Yes, but then we get a P/E of 17 in 2024.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,800
And falls down to P/E 14 in 2025 if they then succeed in this.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,800
One thing that I find interesting is the Biden package itself.

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
As it has been presented in the USA.

41
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,200
Which Henrik has actually talked about himself.

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,200
And next to this, I wrote a little about this Biden package in brief

43
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,200
from what Henrik said during a previous interview in DI in March this year.

44
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:24,200
And this is broadband if you are to say Biden's contribution then to the United States.

45
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
It is to develop the infrastructure.

46
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
It's called the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act.

47
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,200
And for broadband, they budget 65 billion dollars.

48
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,200
And Henrik and Hexatronic estimate that this money will flow out

49
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Or start rolling out in 2023 or the end of 2023.

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,200
And there Henrik himself has said that they have a market share of 5-6%.

51
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,200
And there is a major player in the US that has 70-75%.

52
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,200
And this growth hasn't shown up in the numbers yet.

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:09,380
And since we see such explosive growth in the US, it's like the good times are ahead of us.

54
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,380
So it will be better in the US.

55
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,380
This way, I don't think you should worry that it will sort of stop in the US right away.

56
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,380
But here you still gas up.

57
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,380
So I actually don't understand why the market is trading the stock down 10% on a record report.

58
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,380
I think the market is a bit too worried actually.

59
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,380
For interest rates and inflation here for Hexatronic.

60
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,480
So I will stay with my shares.

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,480
It's not often that I post comments like this.

62
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,480
But I will stay. I will not buy more because the holding is a bit too heavy in my portfolio right now.

63
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
So we'll see how it goes.

64
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,480
We are keeping our fingers crossed that it may be the case that the market reevaluates its view of the share a little further on.

65
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,640
But it was a small short report comment on Hexatronic.

66
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Hope you appreciated it. In such cases, feel free to put a thumbs up and so on.
