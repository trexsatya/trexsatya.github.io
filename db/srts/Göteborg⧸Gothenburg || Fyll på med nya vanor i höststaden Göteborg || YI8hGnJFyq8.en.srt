1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.880
Fill with new habits in HÃ¶ststaden Gothenburg.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.080
 To fill up with the best inspiration for all the good pastries I do ...

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.600
... so I visit the best cafes in Gothenburg.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.180
 Gothenburg grows so it is cracking ...

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.740
... and it's great fun that people have experienced new food cultures.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.460
 That Gothenburg has grown like this with restaurants,

7
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.060
It has been absolutely magical.

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.920
 To fill my autumn wardrobe, I like to go to a second hand shop.

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.880
 I think it is very important to shop sustainable,

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.320
And in Gothenburg you can shop from sustainable stores.

11
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.540
 Yes, now I am in the place that is the best to replenish energy.

12
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.940
 I think the fig culture is highly up to date in Gothenburg.

13
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.175
 You still want to sit and have a cup of coffee and eat a good pastry ...

14
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.520
... while you sit and gossip and chatter and have it wonderful.

15
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.280
Autumn city Gothenburg
