00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
How to argue				a source's credibility and relevance

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,040
You argue the credibility and relevance
of sources in many school subjects.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,800
But being source-critical
is also important throughout your life.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,800
Your arguing explains
and strengthens your idea or opinion.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,600
You can make a claim about
a certain source not being credible-

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,400
-but what supports your claim? Why do
you think the information is unreliable?

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,200
Is it biased? Is someone spinning
the information for personal gain?

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,680
In order to assess the quality of your
work and give you things to improve-

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,880
-your teacher consults
the knowledge requirements.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,600
The requirements for Swedish,
grade nine, include:

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,440
"To find, select and summarize
information from varied sources"-

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,320
-"and find support to argue for/against
the sources' credibility and relevance."

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,520
The quality of a source-critical
argument is made up of many things.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,040
It's important to get a wide scope-

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,640
-by describing several strengths
and weaknesses of the source.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,640
Credibility is one perspective.
You can also assess the relevance:

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,400
In what way is the source relevant
to your query?

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,960
You should also demonstrate links
between source content and your claim-

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,800
-by offering concrete examples.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,320
Another way of developing
a source-critical argument is-

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,200
-to use your knowledge
about the topic or the general context-

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,120
-in order to assess
the contents of the source.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,200
An example:

24
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,120
Argue the credibility and relevance
of three different sources.

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,440
The topic is anonymity
and online surveillance.

26
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,440
The first source is
a blog entry by an IT security expert.

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,320
She describes how anonymity
can protect as well as cause harm-

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,640
-and demonstrates both pros and cons.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,400
The source is relevant, as it provides
information about both sides.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,600
It's also credible,
because it's not one-sided.

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,080
Your source-critical argument
will be more developed-

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,760
-if you present concrete examples
to support your conclusions.

33
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,640
Which pros and cons are mentioned?

34
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,360
The IT expert says
that anonymity can help people-

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,440
-to report on matters which they would
otherwise be unable to talk about.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,280
But criminals can also use anonymity.

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,240
Also, lies and prejudice
are spread by anonymous people.

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,120
Good! By making your claims concrete
through content references-

39
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,160
-you're showing that they are supported.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Is it fair to assume
that the author knows the topic?

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,560
Yes. An IT security expert at the IIS
should be familiar with the topic.

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,320
She also references studies
that support her claims.

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,240
What about source number two?

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,960
It portrays a one-sided and biased view,
as it only describes the bad things-

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,640
-that can be done anonymously online.

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,440
When a source offers a one-sided view
of reality, it is tendentious.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,200
Your argument will be more developed
if you use concrete examples.

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,320
In what way is the source tendentious?

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,040
It is positioned clearly
in favour of increased surveillance.

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,920
It is uncritical of the Police being
able to access communications data-

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,600
-even without criminal suspicion
or a court order.

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
Can you still use the source?

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,400
Yes. It's still relevant
within this context-

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,160
-as it offers the arguments of those
who want to make anonymity harder.

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,360
Using information from other sources,
I can also describe the advantages.

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,920
Do you know anything else about the
source that can develop your argument?

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,880
The origin is an organization
that fights certain online crimes.

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,920
They want to increase surveillance
as it would help them in their work.

59
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,160
And the third source? What strengths
and weaknesses does it have?

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
The third is a Wikipedia article.

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,560
Anyone can contribute to it,
but volunteers check the entries.

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,720
The quality is varied,
so each article has to be scrutinized.

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
-How?
-Like always.

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,760
I pay attention to wording
and how the problem is described.

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,640
That way,
I'll know if the article is tendentious.

66
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,520
I also have to see if the article offers
relevant answers to my questions.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,880
When it comes to Wikipedia articles,
there are three other things to check.

68
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,280
First of all, the article has to be
based on several quality sources.

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,520
Second of all, there is a conversation
to check under the Discussion tab.

70
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,120
Third of all, the history shows me
that there are many contributors.

71
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,800
Those were three good tips
for checking articles on Wikipedia.

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
The article also includes-

73
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,080
-the latest decision from the CJEU
about surveillance.

74
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,080
The decision came only a month ago,
so the article is up to date.

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,640
Good! There you developed your
argument by using your own knowledge.

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,680
A source-critical argument-

77
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,720
-can be developed further if you know
a lot about the topic at hand.

78
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,520
Moving on.

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,960
A wide scope requires many strengths
and weaknesses to be identified-

80
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,880
-based on the perspectives
of credibility and relevance.

81
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,280
Source criticism
is not about finding the ultimate truth-

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,280
-but about being able
to assess different sources.

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,880
Make your claims concrete
by offering examples to support them.

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:11,720
That might be carefully selected quotes
or accurate summaries of the text.

85
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Put your argument into context
by using your knowledge about the topic-

86
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,480
-or the source's context,
and assess the source with that in mind.

87
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,040
Your source-critical ability will help
you in all subjects and all your life.

88
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,280
On social media,
we all work on that ability every day.

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,120
It is, after all, important
to check anything you share.

90
