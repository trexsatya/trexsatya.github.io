1
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:23,960
She's still sitting there with this smile, the sneer. Not this joyous as it was at first.

2
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:26,011
What?

3
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,546
At first it looked like a woman standing there.. Yes, a woman!

4
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:37,063
What the hell was that?

5
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,617
You laughed now?

6
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:48,400
No, I haven't laughed. Oh, there's a woman in front of us! She showed very clear, dark hair.

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,232
I shiver all over.

8
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,036
I saw her so clearly.

9
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:59,240
Did you hear the bang over there? I heard a really loud bang.

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,069
It was a light... a light ball..

11
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:15,613
Now someone grabbed my vest.

12
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:33,220
Then we are inside the ChÃ¢teau de Veauce here in France and Wilma, you are there.

13
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,337
Yes, I'm here.

14
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:41,174
A medium, which will hopefully be a good tool for us so we can get this investigation going.

15
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:48,233
It's an exciting castle, very, very old and they have these castle ghosts, Lucie who walks up there between two towers you could say.

16
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:55,986
Right. And this is something that happened in the 80s, I think it was, so they caught a really weird picture of Lucie up there.

17
00:02:55,986 --> 00:03:08,374
So we will focus on that. It goes back a long way with this too, there were guards during the 15th-17th centuries who saw her walking there.

18
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,680
It will be interesting.

19
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:20,000
And it's big, partly because it's the whole dungeon down there below us, where we should start, I think. Then we have this floor up here, here another investigator has been touched.

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,975
And you can even see how this string moves, on the shirt.

21
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:30,648
Right. We have seen a unique clip that has not been released. You see how something moves on the arm, and it is a string.

22
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,367
Of course we're going in there. It will be very interesting.

23
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:38,983
And then we have this path up stairs at the top between the two towers.

24
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:49,557
So it will be interesting. We will run a lot of technology and equipment and then see if you, Wilma, can help us on the trot. Find out more about what's here.

25
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:52,040
What do you say, shall we go down to the basement?

26
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,288
We start there.

27
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:12,432
Now we've made it down to this basement, it starts straight away with a steep staircase and old items.

28
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:19,762
We don't really know what has happened down here. We will try to communicate and we will go into a special room.

29
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:25,876
There we will see if you can tune in to something. And then we'll see if we can get the instruments to react to that as well.

30
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:32,302
It could be pretty cool, because there are deaths here, it goes back so far in time all this.

31
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:35,632
But who is moving here? We only know Lucie.

32
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:39,499
Yes, that is what is known here, but then there is surely much more.

33
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:43,299
A special room, with this wine cellar.

34
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:48,508
There are two ways to go here, but I think we're going straight in on the left here.

35
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,591
We go in and check there.

36
00:04:49,591 --> 00:05:00,469
I was just going to say, if anything happens on the surveillance, Lennie is sitting up at the switchboard and is in charge. So if something happens, there is a walkie talkie, so we can hear it and can go straight there in that case.

37
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:06,503
So he has his eyes on that. Shall we start Ovilus right here?

38
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:11,416
You two together will come up with something about the story, I'm sure.

39
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:17,485
Niclas hears a woman talking.

40
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:23,233
What did you hear?

41
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,708
It sounded like a woman talking.

42
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,125
Yes.

43
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:38,909
Before we came here, I felt a woman who shows that she was pregnant or that she had a miscarriage. And that she was very hurt by this.

44
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:50,000
So that might have something to do with it. Because I also felt when we walked here, that there is someone waiting for us. Someone who wants to have their voice heard tonight.

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,680
Shall we go in there and see if we pick this up?

46
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,693
Now we don't speak French. But we try to communicate in English and Swedish of course.

47
00:05:57,693 --> 00:06:03,647
I'll do that, if you stay here, I'll put instruments further away, and we'll see if the energies can come towards us.

48
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:06,065
I will place them on each side of a beam there.

49
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:17,701
One is PRS. Where we will get the static or REM function. And then PDA, Paranormal Direct Answer. Red or green, answers questions.

50
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:23,793
So I put them some distance away. And this will be like a motion detector as well.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now it lies there and pulsates and it lies and feels there.

52
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:59,543
Shall we back up behind us? I put a motion detector there.

53
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,028
Now I got up on Ovilus..

54
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:06,815
Together, smile now, what does that mean?

55
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:19,834
I can feel it, it's like there's a woman sitting at the far end, waiting for us. It's like she wants to tell us about this son, because she shows that it was shameful for her.

56
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:31,274
That she was convicted of something or that it was not okay for her to have this child. So she wants to talk a lot about this child.

57
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:42,436
And I feel the energy so that she is sitting furthest away. And that she is ready to communicate.

58
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,662
If you're sitting over there...

59
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:47,434
could you walk up to what's pulsing over there?

60
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:06,270
Now she almost sits and sneers a little, as if now we should play instead. Now it's Game on instead.

61
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,644
At first it was welcoming, but now she is preparing to get closer to us.

62
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:25,809
And I'm going to send some away and see if she can come to us so we know as well. I don't see her coming so it's like she's just sitting there like we're the ones to move closer.

63
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,786
Before she comes this way.

64
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,598
But she still sits with the sneer, not the joyous one that was at first.

65
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:40,000
Shall we move forward then? What do you think?

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,076
Just wait a little bit..

67
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:48,674
Because if we have more things moving down there, maybe something wants to come.

68
00:08:49,117 --> 00:09:01,949
Sometimes it's like I see something... like a white figure. Then I saw it behind Wilma in the corner. I don't know if it's...

69
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:09,790
the eyes playing a trick. But it was like she was in this vault.

70
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,377
That's how I see her too.

71
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:18,208
Do you see there? If you look away there and in the middle, between the technology there.

72
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,168
Yes. Yes actually.

73
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:33,173
When you look at it for a long time, it fades away. Throw something, if you have that power, take our energy and throw something in here, a rock.

74
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,436
Has anyone died down here?

75
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:52,218
She shows me now, when you ask that question, that that question is hard to answer. Because she shows it with her body language, she backs up a little. She finds it difficult to talk about it.

76
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:56,169
What happened to you? Can't you tell me?

77
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:11,867
We have a dungeon further away with different sections. Mild punishment at the top, worse and then worst at the bottom. We press upwards then.

78
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:14,284
Yes, I think we do.

79
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:19,673
Now we come to you here. I can imagine that many have died here.

80
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,076
Don't you like us coming here?

81
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,170
What was that?

82
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,785
Something toched my leg, or was it a cobweb perhaps?

83
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,171
Do you have any lamp?

84
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:48,402
What the hell was that? There's quite a lot of cobwebs here so that must be it then.

85
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:55,060
Yes, we have spiders and most things found in old basements.

86
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:56,766
Shall I go first?

87
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,566
Now we come to you.

88
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,113
There's a big hole down there.

89
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:04,481
Oh!

90
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:16,018
Have you opened that door? Wasn't it closed when we were here before?

91
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:20,316
Well... If it has been closed, our surveillance camera caught it.

92
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:27,483
That the door was closed before, we can't see on the surveillance, it's something obscuring the camera.

93
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:28,743
We'll have to check it.

94
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,414
Niclas hears a whistle

95
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,875
It sounded like someone was whistling.

96
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:40,830
But, we can't go there.

97
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,109
Yes, he was in front and felt the door and said we are not allowed to go in there.

98
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:49,775
Then someone has opened there then, trying to trick us in there.

99
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,769
Is that what you mean?

100
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:57,539
Try pushing your hand in there and we'll see.

101
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,733
You can walk here.

102
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,353
He said we weren't allowed to go there.

103
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:16,484
It's still that energy like she's trying to play a trick on us. Because now I see her sitting here just continuing to sneer as we head in there.

104
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:26,317
And like "Blame yourselves". It makes such a difference because at first she was welcoming and then when we came in here she changed immediately.

105
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:29,672
And she wants to shove us in there all the time.

106
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:41,915
Mess with the surveillance maybe?

107
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:46,120
Do we have anyone here?

108
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,985
There are holes like that everywhere.

109
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,825
Is there water there?

110
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,547
Disturbance only on Nicla's microphone

111
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,539
Sure enough there is water there.

112
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,970
Lucky I didn't jump down then.

113
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:14,592
At the same time as there is a disturbance, you see something peeking out at the door

114
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:20,237
Then they have water under here then. So it is also a leader.

115
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:21,560
It was me.

116
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,164
Exactly, water is also an element.

117
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:29,884
Try pushing your hand over there then.

118
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,540
Grab my arm.

119
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:42,620
I feel a great chill when you said that, it comes from inside. From where you stand and towards us.

120
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,801
Come out here!

121
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:50,477
Too bad we can't go in there... But we can't do that, it's a risk of collapse.

122
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,878
Come out here! Close this door.

123
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,000
It's fetting cold..

124
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,374
It sounded like something fell into the water.

125
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,557
We are not afraid of you.

126
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,213
It just makes you more curious to go in there.

127
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:19,148
I know. Unfortunately we can't do that

128
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:26,813
This female energy that I felt, she's gone now.

129
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:31,382
Yes, it's in there.

130
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:39,168
Did it disappear?

131
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,548
Yes.

132
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,713
On the other side there.

133
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:04,443
Come out here, come to me.

134
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:15,158
And then it backs off, it's just like, "Come on, go through the door."

135
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:19,315
It's alluring all the time.

136
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:23,162
They shouldn't get that. Then they can sneak out here to us.

137
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:24,601
Exactly.

138
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:32,619
As I mentioned, the female energy, it feels like she's done her job now. So that energy is gone.

139
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:39,276
So it was perhaps that she would bring us inside.

140
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:44,530
I'm thinking of Incubus, it's a woman...no, it's Saccubus...

141
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:47,120
Did it close properly?

142
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:52,017
What is it?

143
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,794
At first it looked like a woman standing there in the water...

144
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:57,476
Yes, a woman standing there in the water!

145
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:07,500
I only saw the outline, this white thing you were talking about. She stood there in the water. I had it confirmed, because she was down there looking up.

146
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,781
My arms are shivering.

147
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:10,999
So unpleasant.

148
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,659
Yes, she just stood there.

149
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:20,000
I closed that one now, if I closed something else because that was....

150
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
I see you and we got confirmation there.

151
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,265
Lure one into the water. What does she want to do there? Drown one..

152
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:35,796
But think, people must have died here, there are surely people underground where we are. But the confirmation came quite quickly.

153
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,169
Right when you said it.

154
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,101
Yes, as soon as you said it

155
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:48,278
You've been saying The White, all along, but I didn't see what you were talking about, but here it was the outline of a woman standing in a nightgown.

156
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:50,560
She was standing right down here?

157
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:58,177
There is an edge there, the only thing I see is the edge. I don't see it going down, I just see it break because she's standing at an edge.

158
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,115
I can not see.

159
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:02,197
There, it breaks right there.

160
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:07,741
So if you stand where I stand, you only see her shoulders and head.

161
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:11,605
So you only saw from here up?

162
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:18,686
That woman down there...

163
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:21,401
what's your name?

164
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:26,226
Is your name Lucie?

165
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:49,000
I could hear the water down there now, like it was dripping. And then when you asked about names, then I thought of Felice or Felicia. A French pronunciation though.

166
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,962
I take Polterscript. What I found so interesting too is that this energy really shows up, manifests itself.

167
00:17:54,962 --> 00:17:59,101
So cool to see it. You saw it first, this white thing.

168
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:06,111
But not as you described it. I saw it more like a square type, like it was something white.

169
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,378
But it's uncomfortable..

170
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:28,208
Tony feels something on his cheek

171
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:33,212
I can't remember what it's called, but like we're kind of mocking..

172
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:34,769
What's going on now?

173
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:37,447
There are cobwebs here...

174
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:40,633
There are a lot of cobwebs on you here.

175
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:43,729
Now this chill comes when you talk about it.

176
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:49,205
Imagine a nail pulling against the beard and pulling down here to the chin and stopping there.

177
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:53,608
As soon as you start talking about it, I feel this chill.

178
00:18:56,331 --> 00:19:02,449
Open this door. If you want us in there, open the door.

179
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:10,330
What the hell was that? I don't usually back down, but that was...

180
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:13,286
I hope we got it on camera.

181
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,404
Did you film this way?

182
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:14,904
Yes.

183
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:20,000
Then we can analyze this, if it was a bat looking over the edge. Or waved over the edge.

184
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,920
What we see now in hindsight is a bat flying towards the door and turning

185
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,152
Just when you say so, when you look there.

186
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:34,571
Can you do it again? Open the door.

187
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:46,647
I feel such a strange energy behind it. It's not an energy from a person I know, but it's more someone crawling like this.

188
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:52,974
It is some being or something else, something that has not belonged to a human being.

189
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:58,203
Very strange, I have not encountered it so much before.

190
00:19:58,203 --> 00:19:59,825
You have not encountered that example.

191
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:08,653
Yes, that is something new.

192
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:20,000
That's the first time, it went so fast so I don't know. I want to put logic on it first, if it was a bat that appeared there. But that damn timing.

193
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,520
It is terrible.

194
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,012
What looked like an old gray hand that was coming....

195
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:34,946
We can't put too much weight on that either, that's what we discovered and that's what we felt and what we think we saw, but the analysis will see that .

196
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:36,202
Yes exactly.

197
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:45,655
Come out here.

198
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:50,000
Now it's starting to sting here. Damn, it's like...

199
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,461
Do we have something here?

200
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,275
It's such a bright light that it's hard to see.

201
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:08,379
Damn, it's like a nail here. So unpleasant.

202
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:11,182
If there's someone down there...

203
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:13,426
show yourself.

204
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:25,800
But I think we'll leave it at that for now. We have a camera here, so if these doors open, Lennie will call us right away.

205
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,308
Okay, are you following us?

206
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:56,107
This is an interesting room, check out all the wine bottles around here. I think they said there are over 3000 bottles of wine here. Here it would be fun if something was thrown.

207
00:21:56,107 --> 00:22:02,519
Or that a wine bottle comes out. I put this in the natural passage here, which is so old.

208
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:12,609
I feel that we have this woman who appeared in white, with us. That she followed us now, up from the water and following us in here.

209
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:17,858
So I feel her energy here too.

210
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:20,747
The woman who is here..

211
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:37,686
If we listen a little to how it sounds just...

212
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,828
Can we hear your voice?

213
00:22:50,149 --> 00:23:01,164
It's like she's playing a trick on us all the time, because she's super fast when I look inside where she is. She's in here, but then suddenly she's standing in the corner.

214
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:10,176
Then quickly there, quickly there, as if she surely shows herself as through light phenomena that we can see on the surveillance then maybe.

215
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:22,660
That it moves very quickly and it's like she doesn't want or can't get any communication out. But only that she can make us see her quickly.

216
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:33,197
I put out the motion detector at about the height where the cork machine is, in case someone comes in. If she moves fast, hopefully this one will take it.

217
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:37,219
But it would have been interesting if that had also picked it up.

218
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:41,865
Now I entered it.

219
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:55,280
But I'm thinking, since you Wilma are getting something that could show up on surveillance, I'm going to call Lennie so he can see about it.

220
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:08,257
Lennie, keep an eye out when Wilma senses that there may be light phenomena or that you can possibly see something. So call us on the radio in that case.

221
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:09,228
Yes.

222
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:18,621
We also have to keep in mind that Lennie is sitting up there by himself. It can bang up there, we didn't put any instruments there just so it wouldn't be hard to sit there.

223
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:25,520
He is sitting there in the dark, he has a surveillance system. But when it starts moving and banging there, he calls out to us and we have to go up there.

224
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:34,550
Because this is a bit of an unexplored area, you come here with your knowledge, you give us some theories on what it could be and what you feel.

225
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:47,284
We see things. We experience crazy things. And there's not a lot that's happened here, but we'll go through everything, then we'll go to the active areas later.

226
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:53,107
Do we have anyone here who could throw something? Throw a wine bottle.

227
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,859
I'll walk around a bit and see if we pick up anything.

228
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:09,039
If the woman jumping around is here...

229
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,376
the woman...

230
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,988
The woman, okay.

231
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:23,025
What's your name?

232
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,531
Movement.

233
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:40,311
Was it me who did it? I'm just going to test because as you can see, my arm is here now...

234
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,529
It's cold here.

235
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:50,000
Is she the one moving there then? And then we get the word Real.

236
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:01,063
Can you who are here, this woman...

237
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:03,626
why are you still here?

238
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:11,894
I don't know what you did when you went there, if you cornered her.

239
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:14,036
Try one more time.

240
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,797
Are you here?

241
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:23,784
Get out of here.

242
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:29,821
Or if you're here, come in here.

243
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:49,616
I feel like someone is holding my hand now, really hard.

244
00:26:54,303 --> 00:26:56,316
What was that?

245
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,000
Did it come off paint?

246
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:04,387
Something fell or that bottle rotated.

247
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,354
A male name.

248
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:10,596
Something sounded here.

249
00:27:15,246 --> 00:27:17,708
Do you understand if this sounds?

250
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,464
Something...

251
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:22,744
Although it may have been paint that came off.

252
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:30,213
It feels like someone is squeezing my hand and arm, like the arm isn't getting blood.

253
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:33,843
I feel exactly the same...

254
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:38,257
Tony hears a man's voice somewhere in the room

255
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:42,228
It's so clear now.

256
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,835
That was a man's voice, did you hear that?

257
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:51,240
I heard a man say something.

258
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,600
The voice is caught, but faintly

259
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,655
I feel like...

260
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:02,800
It's, sorry to interrupt, but it's Johnny.

261
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,818
It came through a name.

262
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:12,261
Is Johnny here? It doesn't sound like it's a typical French name.

263
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:19,078
But then we have to bear in mind that those who own it now are from England.

264
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:27,236
I'm not double.

265
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:30,000
I am modern.

266
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:41,534
Exactly what I was talking about. I'm not double, I'm modern, Johnny. And it's a woman's voice on this one...

267
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:13,480
Think what I said there. Maybe Johnny has to do with them, modern times. And like I'm not a duplicate of something, I'm real. Everything is so cool, that comes through.

268
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:21,660
And I feel very small suddenly. I feel shrunk almost, like my energy is suppressed.

269
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:27,371
Like I can't get any kind of contact, like someone is covering my mouth.

270
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:28,802
I feel a little like that.

271
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:31,244
Does it feel like you are being media blocked?

272
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:42,382
Yes exactly. And that they take my identity and just push it down, like crumpling a piece of paper. That's how I feel all the time.

273
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:48,413
But if you back off a little bit, down there. Switch places with her Tony.

274
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:51,706
If you back down more towards that window there.

275
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:58,316
See if you can feel it stronger there, where Tony was standing.

276
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:04,209
Now it starts on my face. Like a spider web.

277
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:05,844
But not like nails?

278
00:30:05,844 --> 00:30:10,653
No, it was like someone pulled a string, which got stuck in the beard.

279
00:30:10,653 --> 00:30:22,311
Here I feel that it is easier because here I come back and collect impressions again. But when I approach where you are standing, it's like I'm being pressed down.

280
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:32,169
It's here, it's like a magnet, it stops for me. Here, it's like I'm becoming a child again.

281
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:38,312
Those are the impressions that he shows me, so the question is whether it could be a connection...

282
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:45,044
Imagine what happened to him who owns this.

283
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,263
The dog that came in the night..

284
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:54,539
Yes, exactly that. He realized that this is a ghost dog. And it's quite interesting when he gets this, I can take the whole story..

285
00:30:54,539 --> 00:31:06,432
The owner goes to bed and wakes up in the morning, he sees a dog walking by the bed. And he realizes that we have no dog, we have no animals here, everything is locked.

286
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:15,522
Then he thinks he should stretch out his hand, then he feels how the hand hits the dog's head, then the dog also jumps up

287
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:23,537
and lay down next to him and lay there for a while. He just lay there completely still and did nothing, then the dog jumped down, left and disappeared.

288
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:25,654
Now it says dog.

289
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:31,280
And there are tracks in the stone up there, paw prints.

290
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,109
Right.

291
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:38,427
It feels like we're not getting any further right here. Shall we move up a floor?

292
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:39,747
We go to Lucie's.

293
00:31:39,747 --> 00:31:41,988
At the top. Shall we go to the corridor straight away?

294
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:43,141
We go to her directly.

295
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,324
I just have to check, there's no dog on the construction site now, is there?

296
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:46,964
No.

297
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:54,419
I heard dogs barking as I walked around pulling network cables. I didn't know this. I heard dog barks, loud.

298
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,454
Exactly, you haven't heard this story.

299
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:57,813
No.

300
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:00,213
No, so there is no dog here.

301
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:08,326
Because I went past that wooden staircase and past where he lives, then I heard a loud dog bark, then I thought "Does he have a dog in there?"

302
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:12,720
That was sick. Because he told about the dog, the ghost dog but...

303
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:15,020
The sound of a woman laughing

304
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,129
You laughed now?

305
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:19,567
No, I haven't laughed.

306
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:20,491
Huh?!

307
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:21,136
Huh?

308
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:27,311
There is a woman in front of us, she showed herself very clearly. Dark hair.

309
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,103
Well, it was a woman who laughed.

310
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,223
She floated, with dark hair. Directly in front of.

311
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:35,842
I shiver all over.

312
00:32:35,842 --> 00:32:37,331
I'm shivering all over....

313
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:41,695
I saw her so clearly. So very clear.

314
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:49,088
We must have caught this. We have caught it on that microphone if Johan is there. It was clearly a woman laughing.

315
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:55,078
And she really floated like this. Like she floated by.

316
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,674
Show yourself again.

317
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:09,633
That woman's laugh.

318
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,182
If we caught it, that's..

319
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:14,633
I was absolutely sure that it was you who was laughing there.

320
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:15,859
How did it sound then?

321
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:26,652
I have never seen anything so clearly, this was with the physical eye, so not medially but straight ahead. It was like she was floating, it was so cool.

322
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,163
It was really cool.

323
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:33,394
Hope she follows up then.

324
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:42,906
As I said, this is Lucie's room. It's the way in here..

325
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:48,624
that you've seen her and it's probably here that they've captured her in a picture.

326
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,172
So it's pretty special.

327
00:33:51,759 --> 00:34:01,958
Lennie is in now too, he's behind the camera. So now we are all, now there is no one sitting at the surveillance.

328
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:11,940
Shall we leave this one here? If it activates, I go further in and place a PMB. There will be quite a lot of backs because it is not that big and there are quite a few of us.

329
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:14,815
So we'll see.

330
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:18,564
I will place this out only then.

331
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:26,570
Shall we come right in?

332
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,562
You can do that.

333
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,373
Lucie?

334
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,039
If you're here...

335
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:37,904
can you show yourself?

336
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:52,002
I get a pressure on my chest, almost like an anxiety attack. I also felt that when I walked in that corridor, where you have heard the dog.

337
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:54,262
And that sadness comes with it.

338
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:56,916
This is also where they took photos, Nicke.

339
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:57,416
Yes.

340
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:01,537
In the 80's sometime, what thinks is this ghost then.

341
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:10,252
I will put this here. And aim it straight up at the beam. Then it will be the whole area, then we backtrack a bit.

342
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:31,744
Yes, I took it out. An old honorable Flux, I'll put it down too.

343
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:33,903
Then we back off.

344
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:39,050
You don't have to be afraid of us. We're just here to talk to you.

345
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,610
I put down one more Flux.

346
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:58,709
I get a lot of communication here and I get direct contact with this woman. I think it's Lucie. She shows me how she cries and then how she has to be quiet, like someone is covering her mouth.

347
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:18,296
She has a lot of anxiety and shows such emotions. And that sge backs down a little because she has learned that you shouldn't talk, or that she wasn't allowed to talk when she was alive.

348
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:26,282
Is this story also true that you were trapped here by the baron's wife?

349
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:32,929
That you died in one of these towers or in the dungeon?

350
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,088
There came a female perfume.

351
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:37,607
Right in my face.

352
00:36:41,187 --> 00:36:43,244
Where did it come from?

353
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:46,127
Lucie are you here?

354
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:48,587
Does it disappear?

355
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:49,608
Yes.

356
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:55,118
It just appeared like that... then it disappeared.

357
00:36:56,742 --> 00:37:00,895
Pick up the phone and google translate.

358
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:06,477
Write if it is Lucie who usually walks back and forth here. Is that you Lucie here?

359
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:13,295
This is the only way to communicate in French. So we'll see if we get results.

360
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,404
I'll ask if she's afraid of us.

361
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:40,860
Lucie, show yourself.

362
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,207
Let's see you.

363
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:51,332
I will ask if she has appeared in the picture.

364
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:14,812
It's a completely different feeling here, if you compare it to how it was down in the basement. Here I don't even get the same as it was down there. Right?

365
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:19,629
No, down there you were a little more at full throttle. You didn't know what could happen.

366
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,812
Did you hear the bang over there?

367
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:23,673
Further away?

368
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:25,743
Yes, I heard a loud bang.

369
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:33,966
The advantage is that we have a surveillance camera, which documents all the time here. Then we get a movement, that she walks here, then we have it.

370
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:38,966
I'll go get this. Then we go down to where we know a touch has been filmed.

371
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,328
We try there. See if we can make it happen for us.

372
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:53,339
We are down here now, we have all the conditions. If Wilma sits there Tony, you sit there first.

373
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:58,985
I'm going to place some instruments here, I'm going to put a Flux here on the table.

374
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:05,296
Or no, we'll take Flux infront of you. Because that is an old wizard table they used here. Perfect.

375
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:07,858
This is where he was sitting.

376
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:12,508
Exactly, I can do a little reconstruction. Because we won't be able to show it, we got to see a unique clip.

377
00:39:12,508 --> 00:39:24,336
He had some string here. And you see something that does that and he reacts immediately. And it's quite interesting.

378
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:26,511
If you sit down there.

379
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:46,922
I immediately feel a man standing close to you and moving around you. Because I feel a coldness between us, clearly. Here it is warmer, then here it gets freezing cold. So it's all around you.

380
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,682
Okay, you can touch me. Lift up my shirt.

381
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:02,121
Go to the blue light on the table there.

382
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:17,897
I feel that the man is still there and he tells me that you should respect the nice room. When we enter here, we must enter with respect and we must almost ask permission before

383
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:31,663
we sit down or before we touch things. So it is very important to him that we respect the room. Because this room is classified as very nice for them. For him.

384
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,653
That's a man we have?

385
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:34,745
Yes, it's a man.

386
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:45,098
This man, can you walk up to any of our things that we have here? That iron stick on the table, there is a lot that is not usually here.

387
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:48,982
Should I pick up the phone again and try some French phrases?

388
00:40:48,982 --> 00:40:52,149
Do that, then we'll also see if we get a reaction.

389
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,551
I ask if they have touched a person who sat on this chair.

390
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,977
What happened there?

391
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:02,716
There were double voices.

392
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:07,153
It was an echo, did you hear it?

393
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:20,936
So, why do I see light phenomena? That must be another light phenomenon, now I see another one and it flew right into your arm.

394
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:21,712
Huh?

395
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:28,054
It must have been caught on surveillance.

396
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:28,940
No light phenomenon was caught on the surveillance

397
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:35,190
Why do I see them with my own eyes? I have never been able to see it.

398
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,437
Touch me.

399
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:43,264
Say, touch one of us.

400
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:45,632
Before you do that, wait...

401
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:54,953
I'll put it on wizard table here.

402
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,293
Touch any of us.

403
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:09,708
Loud thump in the room

404
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,916
Did you hear? A bang. It was somewhere behind Johan.

405
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:21,956
Niclas, I think you and I will switch places. Because I keep hearing that the woman should sit on the sofa.

406
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,796
Okay.

407
00:42:24,014 --> 00:42:25,869
You shouldn't sit there.

408
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:30,183
I ask if it wants us to leave the castle.

409
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:53,812
I don't think the energies here know how to communicate with us. How are they going to do with this or how are they going to do with what we mentioned before, that the castle is not so well investigated...

410
00:42:53,812 --> 00:43:02,759
there haven't been that many people here. They feel very insecure, they send me a word now and then and show something.

411
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:18,187
But they are surprised and think "What is this?" They don't know how to use it and I think that's why things are so quiet. Because I feel that we have energies here.

412
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:22,277
Try if you see and hear us...

413
00:43:22,277 --> 00:43:24,092
with Wilma's help...

414
00:43:24,092 --> 00:43:29,315
can you just come, to this table?

415
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:34,574
And touch this iron stick standing there?

416
00:43:34,832 --> 00:43:37,638
Just go near it.

417
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:40,754
You don't have to be afraid of anything.

418
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:47,871
It's usually quite interesting when you run Spiritbox, but we certainly won't understand what they're saying.

419
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:49,271
No.

420
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,509
But this noise usually attracts someone.

421
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:58,042
We can test, we know a little, we may have some names. We can see if we can decipher anything.

422
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:06,840
I'll go get one. If we are in the nice room, there should be no toys here. So I put this one on the couch.

423
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:09,194
So we'll see.

424
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,153
So it's the same thing, if anything comes close to this one...

425
00:44:15,555 --> 00:44:17,631
It absolutely shouldn't be there.

426
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:23,534
Throw away that teddy bear if you want.

427
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:26,926
Now I start Spiritbox.

428
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:38,322
A man's voice comes through

429
00:44:38,765 --> 00:44:40,055
What was that?

430
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:46,170
There are a lot of voices, it's as you say there are many here.

431
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:52,867
As soon as you started it there, I see lots. Everyone comes here.

432
00:44:54,011 --> 00:44:55,444
A woman's voice comes through

433
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,214
Touch my arm here now. Or my shirt.

434
00:45:14,507 --> 00:45:17,051
It's like they're sitting at the table.

435
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:17,966
Right.

436
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:23,990
Woman.

437
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:29,172
It's like they're having a conference or something.

438
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:31,580
Just voices at every seat.

439
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:44,406
Cool! It's like they're sitting here having a meeting.

440
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:52,041
Think they're having a dinner in here.

441
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:57,383
Right. And this is very difficult, I won't have a clue what they are saying when I listen to this.

442
00:45:57,383 --> 00:45:58,165
No.

443
00:45:58,165 --> 00:46:02,097
But it confirms what you say, that there is a lot of energy in here.

444
00:46:02,097 --> 00:46:07,209
And when we open up this noise, that's when it usually starts because then they realize we hear them.

445
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:11,680
This was interesting, sound at every seat.

446
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,565
No touch. Did he sit further forward or?

447
00:46:21,436 --> 00:46:23,472
Insect flying by

448
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:29,581
Ask if they are sitting at this table, in French.

449
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:35,968
Niclas' batteries in the microphone die, Niclas tests with PMB behind Tony while we wait for new batteries, to see if there is someone behind him

450
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,639
Directly.

451
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:54,062
I start with PMB in between.

452
00:46:54,837 --> 00:46:57,098
Straight into that chair.

453
00:47:16,177 --> 00:47:18,364
I'll ask if they see us.

454
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,654
Do you know that you are dead...

455
00:47:42,001 --> 00:48:01,819
It's like they ignore us, it's like they have their thing here at the table and everything else around is not important. It's like a "time loop" It plays over and over.

456
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,847
There is a completely different way to communicate with them, your tarot cards.

457
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:17,966
Shall we try one quickly? If you sit here at the table, maybe we can pin point them out here. Shall we try it Tony?

458
00:48:17,966 --> 00:48:22,320
We turn this off but we leave some instruments running at the same time.

459
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:33,860
We will stand on that side, Johan will stand next to you here and look at your cards, while you tell, I will place an instrument behind here and we will see what happens.

460
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:48,141
I have two different decks, one that tells us what we have around us, what kind of energy it is. Then you can start asking what it wants to say to us.

461
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:57,719
And before I took out the cards, I got the number three, which means we're going to draw three cards from this deck.

462
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:05,856
And then I go on my intuition, that is, my gut feeling that tells me when to draw these cards.

463
00:49:05,856 --> 00:49:09,585
I also set up a PMB here.

464
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:19,546
I misplace things that shouldn't really be here because it's the nice room.

465
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:22,875
I have more instruments, should I put a Flux a little more behind us?

466
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,968
Do it, we put a lot around us.

467
00:49:26,968 --> 00:49:31,810
So we'll see who confirms, who moves in the room here. It will be really cool.

468
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:44,393
Then I now ask what kind of energies we have around the table. I will draw three cards.

469
00:49:54,025 --> 00:50:06,741
This tells, Bring into the light, so this does not know that it is dead. It's not everyone but a certain energy in here that doesn't know it's dead.

470
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:17,161
It's like it ignores us, like it doesn't really see us.

471
00:50:20,335 --> 00:50:31,126
This confirms it, that this spirit believes it is still alive, just like I said. This needs to be brought into the light.

472
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:44,933
This also confirms that it is a soul from a human. This is then one of the energies that we have around us. I said before that I will draw three cards, but I need to check some more.

473
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:54,186
Now it shows how we should help it to be brought into the light. Okay, what else do we have around us?

474
00:50:54,186 --> 00:51:07,746
A strong energy that can move objects and touch people. That is exactly what we have confirmed since before then, when someone has been pulled by the shirt.

475
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:17,240
It is interesting, there is little that people have told about before, what happened with this touch. Even what we are dealing with here.

476
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:29,520
Now we don't have all the time in the world, we won't have this castle for several days, but it's here and now. We got a little here before, that maybe it could increase in intensity then.

477
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:40,196
I have no idea, but what I think happened to this guy, he just got the feeling of going in here and sitting down.

478
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:43,773
The others just laughed.

479
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:45,936
Because nothing has happened here before.

480
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:58,000
And that's what I think it is about this place, that when you come in here, you're supposed to be lucky. Because think what he said, he who owns it, I've only seen this dog.

481
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,570
What's down in the basement, come...

482
00:52:01,308 --> 00:52:04,911
Down in the basement.. the stronger energy.

483
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:12,587
Is it the same? Is it the one who comes up and visits them sometimes or is it two of them?

484
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,757
It got colder here.

485
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:26,400
But I think it is, it's a ground floor energy. I don't think it goes up here. It's a woman, it's a very strong woman down there. We see her, we hear her.

486
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,874
If I sit down over here..

487
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:30,608
Shall we sit down and just listen in for a bit?

488
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,404
Thumps and footsteps are heard in the building.

489
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:51,465
I see it as one and the same time or event being played out. I see it as a nice dinner that you have, with important people.

490
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:59,717
Who sit around this table. And here sits a man of higher rank.. it could be a king or a prince.

491
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:05,099
He has to sign something. Then it's mixed with men and women sitting around here.

492
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:16,939
I see how he writes on something and that you toast in exquisite glasses. This goes on like a loop all the time, the same sequence all the time, like in a movie.

493
00:53:16,939 --> 00:53:19,741
Sounds like it's a big event.

494
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:28,124
Yes and maybe that's why I don't feel seen, because they are here and now in this.

495
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:34,697
They don't see or care that other things are happening around them.

496
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:43,331
Can you move to the side one more time? When you were talking, I thought I saw a light passing there, right in front of you Niclas.

497
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:54,541
That's what I'm saying, there's so much cool stuff going on here. Imagine a light phenomenon, you see a woman floating. I see a woman standing in the water and looking up.

498
00:53:54,541 --> 00:54:07,200
We hear her, twice. Then there is touch that has been documented, so there is something moving here. But I don't understand why we get to see right now? These light phenomena.

499
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,525
We have not experienced this before, that we see.

500
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:10,775
No I know.

501
00:54:10,775 --> 00:54:15,191
I'll check if it was some kind of reflection, but I don't think so.

502
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:20,546
We take one with communication, who talks a little. Polterscript.

503
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:28,002
It will throw out words. Maybe we can find out what they signed.

504
00:54:28,629 --> 00:54:31,400
Find out what they signed yes...

505
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:37,480
There is something about what you were talking about.

506
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,692
Has anything happened in connection with you signing the paper? Something odd about...

507
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,413
Is there something special about that paper? About the castle?

508
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:57,171
Something unsolved that you want to convey and tell about?

509
00:54:58,426 --> 00:55:02,834
Six pieces. How many chairs are there? Eight..

510
00:55:12,429 --> 00:55:21,328
Lennie, keep an eye on the door now. Now Lennie is sitting out there listening. It said door, silence and door.

511
00:55:21,328 --> 00:55:23,967
There may be doors here too.

512
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:27,336
Can you close these doors? Close that door on us.

513
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,342
I tested that chair, it, it, it...

514
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:38,302
everyone had voices at it and there are six chairs.

515
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:40,094
It's awesome.

516
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:50,911
And that I realized that there are important people sitting here. They are talking about something important and these people have power over something.

517
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:57,703
Tony, are we going to sweep through the last two? There are two more rooms..

518
00:55:57,703 --> 00:56:02,345
Wait, we get up and walk a little, move a little.

519
00:56:02,345 --> 00:56:03,464
Right.

520
00:56:03,464 --> 00:56:07,488
We let Wilma interpret and we bring some communication.

521
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:10,878
Static!

522
00:56:11,321 --> 00:56:14,160
As soon as we left, it started here.

523
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:20,000
REM went off and static field swept around it.

524
00:56:20,886 --> 00:56:22,856
Tony hears a woman's voice in the room

525
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:26,800
Now I heard someone here say... but it was a woman.

526
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,806
Did you say something Lennie?

527
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:31,533
He is very far away.

528
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:33,977
I know. It was like this...

529
00:56:35,408 --> 00:56:39,570
Maybe it's her, but it could be others too...

530
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:45,191
Nothing that stands out?

531
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:47,686
There have been two bangs down here.

532
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:48,807
Okay.

533
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:01,680
I don't know if it's changes in the castle or if it's something else. But it feels quite peaceful here, I feel, because I manage to sit here alone in the dark.

534
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,336
Is it inside the rooms perhaps?

535
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:03,886
Yes exactly.

536
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:13,176
Here I get the same feeling, as if you have important conversations here or deals or settlements, at this table.

537
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:23,257
But when I came in here, I got the feeling of a lot of animals around me, around my legs. Maybe they had a dog or a cat running around here too.

538
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:37,060
And that this room is a little more social than the other. But it's still an important space and talking about important things, but it's more of an open energy here.

539
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:45,511
And that you brought your dog with you. That it is not as nice for them.

540
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:50,946
Pull out a chair while we're standing here.

541
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:59,120
Nothing on Polterscript either.

542
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:05,536
It feels peaceful.

543
00:58:05,536 --> 00:58:13,608
It's interesting that you get that in, but it might not be as strong as the other one there.

544
00:58:14,715 --> 00:58:16,994
We'll take the next one too then.

545
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:28,112
Here there is much more life and movement. Here they have done something social, here is The play room or what to say.

546
00:58:28,112 --> 00:58:35,030
This is where you really socialize and toast. And you might have some dance or some activity here.

547
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:45,314
So here there is a lot of movement around me and very happy energies. So it's completely different if you compare it to the room where we were before.

548
00:58:47,153 --> 00:58:49,656
Anything left here?

549
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:55,625
It's like you go in here when you celebrate something, if you've won something, then you go in here and celebrate.

550
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,124
Okay.

551
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:10,000
If I'm going to say what I think has been here, I think they've had a big pool table here. The men have been in here and done things too.

552
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,806
It's not that far from what you say. It's matches, you celebrate something. It's awesome.

553
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:21,303
It's a lot of memory energies I think.

554
00:59:21,303 --> 00:59:30,162
There is nothing on the communication. It's good that you get what you say in, but it doesn't feel like a very active room.

555
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:34,249
We have one room left. No, we have two rooms left.

556
00:59:34,249 --> 00:59:47,971
Here it's like I'm being drawn in, like Come in, come in. Here I can sense an energy, not a memory, but here it is someone pulling us in.

557
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:54,492
Like a circus director...

558
00:59:54,492 --> 00:59:55,336
A bouncer?

559
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:56,880
Yes exactly.

560
00:59:57,138 --> 00:59:59,676
Anyone here and want to talk to us?

561
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:22,473
It's also, we're here now, we got access to this castle, to document Lucie and all of them here. But we also had the opportunity to go down into the basement, we have had the opportunity to go on all floors.

562
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:30,222
And I can say that it is quite peaceful here. But we have our ghost up there. And it's interesting, because we've got a completely different thing

563
01:00:30,222 --> 01:00:36,198
and it would be damn interesting to hand it over to him later. And tell us about what we got down in the basement.

564
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:43,169
So if more paranormal investigators are going to be here, go down to the basement. That's where the strongest is.

565
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:51,968
Because there is no discomfort here either. Quite convivial, nothing on the machines. It's like you say, Come in here.

566
01:00:51,968 --> 01:00:55,638
The energies are just around here and are as pleasant as can be.

567
01:00:56,709 --> 01:01:05,604
Really, exactly. It feels like the feminine energies are dominant tonight, that's what we've encountered for the most part.

568
01:01:05,604 --> 01:01:12,944
Usually male, masculine energies tend to take up much more space. But now it's really the women.

569
01:01:12,944 --> 01:01:16,264
and I think that's really cool.

570
01:01:17,777 --> 01:01:23,320
Shall we take the last one? The showroom. We will check how it is.

571
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:36,864
I get a bad feeling when I walk in here and that is that some kind of abuse has taken place here. Then I feel a female energy trying to communicate it to me.

572
01:01:38,045 --> 01:01:50,401
That there is some kind of abuse that has happened here. I don't know if it could be an energy memory or if they are trying to explain it.

573
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:59,627
Because it's still a bit of the same energy, it's not as intense as we've come in contact with before.

574
01:01:59,627 --> 01:02:01,823
Do you think this is way back?

575
01:02:01,823 --> 01:02:04,361
This is a long way back.

576
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:05,767
It has taken place here then?

577
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,534
If there's anything left here...

578
01:02:11,534 --> 01:02:13,317
Can you move something?

579
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,423
Talk to us?

580
01:02:15,423 --> 01:02:17,573
We have a bar here.

581
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:20,167
Can you do something with the glasses in here?

582
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:33,714
I also gather that it could have been some type of strip club or brothel. Also connected to this abuse that I felt when I stepped in here.

583
01:02:33,714 --> 01:02:43,407
It is that, this happened and it became a scandal. That you were ashamed of this or that you tried to keep it quiet.

584
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:57,917
I feel that in the energy, that people don't talk about it that much. Then it was really something that was kept quiet, because it was an important man who went for a woman.

585
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,520
And they didn't want to tarnish his reputation.

586
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,188
I'm thinking, we're in a castle, that power.

587
01:03:05,188 --> 01:03:13,793
And it also goes with what I first felt, I think it was down in the basement, when I saw like tape over my mouth. Being silenced.

588
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:22,382
It was certainly the case then, that the women were silenced, they would be silent. In order not to degrade the men's status.

589
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:31,117
Just look at how the castle is designed here, soldiers and such were on the outside, in wooden stands behind a wall.

590
01:03:31,117 --> 01:03:35,660
The horses were at the far end of the yard and had their own stalls, certainly warm...

591
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,249
Now I saw it again....

592
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:43,477
I saw it again, a ball of light or...

593
01:03:47,204 --> 01:03:49,670
Now someone grabbed my vest.

594
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:51,420
Pulled it back or?

595
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,360
I backed away, I thought I caught something at first.

596
01:03:57,563 --> 01:04:06,261
What we can see is that the Mel meter on the right side of Nicla's chest goes up as if it is stuck.

597
01:04:06,261 --> 01:04:09,750
It went like a arc.

598
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:10,615
Against me?

599
01:04:10,615 --> 01:04:14,390
Yes, but behind, I thought it was more against the wall.

600
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,785
That was awesome.

601
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,337
This incident that took place here, which you tried to hush up...

602
01:04:25,876 --> 01:04:28,984
Is that the woman here now?

603
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:37,927
Now it's touching, someone pulled the shirt a little. Now maybe that's happening...

604
01:04:37,927 --> 01:04:43,713
Is it the woman who's here now? Who is trying to get redress.

605
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:48,265
Show yourself!

606
01:05:03,543 --> 01:05:09,213
It was a little bit there, a lot there. There's a picture of a woman on the wall there too.

607
01:05:09,213 --> 01:05:10,685
Right.

608
01:05:14,265 --> 01:05:20,836
It was very interesting, when you start messing around a bit...

609
01:05:22,268 --> 01:05:27,708
Shall we go out into the yard? And try to look up at Lucie Tower? And this dungeon.

610
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:28,966
If we see something.

611
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:38,316
A light phenomenon or something moving in the window. Because there has also been a guard who went down the stairs, who went up to a person's car and knocks on it

612
01:05:38,316 --> 01:05:45,059
and the person is completely shocked, then a soldier from a long time ago goes back up the stairs and disappears.

613
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:51,563
We stand out here, in this history, we have the stables back there. And we can't go into this building right?

614
01:05:51,858 --> 01:05:53,933
It's because of risk of collapse.

615
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:56,366
You can see how the roofs have collapsed.

616
01:05:56,366 --> 01:06:01,416
We were out here earlier today, you and Lennie were supposed to go up to the tower with the owner.

617
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:07,260
Then a stone comes from the roof and we shout to Lennie Move! And then, right next to him...

618
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:11,702
And it happened over there. Right where they've seen this soldier walking up and down.

619
01:06:12,846 --> 01:06:20,000
It was really like you are not going to the tower. There could have been stones over there and it's the roof tiles that are leaking.

620
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,490
This is very interesting.

621
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:32,624
And up here is Lucie Tower. And up there in the aisle there we were, watching. And there in the dungeon she passed away.

622
01:06:34,728 --> 01:06:37,918
We hear something walking in the gravel

623
01:06:37,918 --> 01:06:42,106
There was something walking there. Stand still..

624
01:06:47,605 --> 01:06:48,917
Someone walked here.

625
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,661
Yes, someone was walking there.

626
01:06:50,661 --> 01:06:52,051
I wonder if you can hear horse hooves, I just thought.

627
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:53,110
Right!

628
01:06:54,772 --> 01:07:01,231
It sounded just like horse hooves. Like something was walking here.

629
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:07,763
Shall we head for these stairs? We look at it.

630
01:07:17,948 --> 01:07:24,120
The stone came from up there. About to hit Lennie in the head.

631
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:32,122
It feels like someone is watching us in that window. The other window there.

632
01:07:32,122 --> 01:07:39,357
That someone is just standing there watching us. It's not something I see, I just feel it.

633
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:43,951
Can you throw something if you're out here with us now?

634
01:07:43,951 --> 01:07:52,499
It was above that window that it fell? From the chute there.

635
01:08:19,217 --> 01:08:30,189
Getting to investigate a castle is always special. And getting access to this magical castle ChÃ¢teau de Veauce in France is rare.

636
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:42,825
Who is the woman moving on the ground floor that Niclas sees in the water? Is it the same woman who laughs and whom Wilma senses?

637
01:08:42,825 --> 01:08:50,604
Yes, a woman standing there in the water! I only saw the outlines, this white thing you were talking about. She stood there in the water.

638
01:08:50,604 --> 01:09:04,991
Not everything we experience is paranormal, but the reactions may be so at first. For example, that we really thought we saw a shadow, until we realize that it is a bat making the shadow down in the basement.

639
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:10,486
Then we can analyze this. If there was a bat peeking over the edge.

640
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:18,018
In the remaining parts of the castle it was difficult to communicate with what many have known.

641
01:09:19,347 --> 01:09:38,120
We really tried to get a glimpse of the castle ghost Lucie wandering between the two towers, but despite trying to document her in several ways, she didn't want to show herself to us this time.
