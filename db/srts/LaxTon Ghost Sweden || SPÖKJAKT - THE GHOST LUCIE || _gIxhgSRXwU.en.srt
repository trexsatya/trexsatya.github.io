1
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:23,960
She is still sitting with this smile, the mockery.
 Not this joyful as it was first.

2
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:26,011
Huh?

3
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,546
At first it looked like a woman standing there .. Yes, a woman!

4
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:37,063
What the hell was that?

5
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,617
You laughed now?

6
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:48,400
No, I haven't laughed.
 Oh, it's a woman in front of us!
 She turned out to be very clear, dark hair.

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,232
I shudder all over my body.

8
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,036
I saw her so clearly.

9
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:59,240
Did you hear the bang over there?
 A really severe bang I heard.

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,069
It was a light ... a light ball ..

11
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:15,613
Now someone took hold of my West.

12
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:33,220
Then we are in ChÃ¢teau de Veauce here in France and Wilma, you are there.

13
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,337
Yes, I'm with.

14
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:41,174
A medium, which hopefully will be a good tool for us so we can get this investigation further.

15
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:48,233
It is an exciting castle, very, very, old and they have these castles the ghost, Lucie that goes up there between two towers you can say.

16
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:55,986
Just.
 And this is something that happened during the 80s, I think it was, so they caught a very strange picture of Lucie up there.

17
00:02:55,986 --> 00:03:08,374
So we will focus on that.
 It goes far back with this too, it was guards during the 15-1600s, who have seen her go there.

18
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,680
It will be interesting.

19
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:20,000
And it is big, partly it is the whole dungeon down there under us, where we should start I think.
 Then we have this floor up here, here another investigator has been given a touch.

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,975
And you even see how this string moves, on the sweater.

21
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:30,648
Just.
 We have seen a unique clip that has not been released.
 You see how something is moved on your arm, and it is a string.

22
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,367
Of course, we are going in there.
 It gets very interesting.

23
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:38,983
And then we have this time up, at the top between the two towers.

24
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:49,557
So it gets interesting.
 We will run a lot of technology and equipment and then see if you Wilma can help us on the pile.
 Get more about what's here.

25
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:52,040
What do you say, should we go down to the basement?

26
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,288
We start there.

27
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:12,432
Now we have gone down to this basement, it starts directly with a steep staircase and old objects.

28
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:19,762
We don't really know what has happened down here.
 We will try to communicate and we will go into a special room.

29
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:25,876
There we will see if you can tuna in on something.
 And so we see if we can get the instruments to react to it too.

30
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:32,302
It can be quite cool, because there is death here, it goes so far back in time all this.

31
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:35,632
But who is moving here?
 We only know Lucie.

32
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:39,499
Yes, that is what is known here, but then there is certainly much more.

33
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:43,299
A special room, with this wine cellar.

34
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:48,508
There are two directions to go here, but I think we go straight to the left here.

35
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,591
We go in and look there.

36
00:04:49,591 --> 00:05:00,469
I was just going to say, if something happens on the surveillance, Lennie sits up at the Central and is in control.
 So something happens then there is a walkie talkie, so we hear it and can go straight there in that case.

37
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:06,503
So he is in control of it.
 Should we start Ovilus right here?

38
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:11,416
You two together will come up with something about the story, I'm sure.

39
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:17,485
Niclas hears a woman talk.

40
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:23,233
What did you hear?

41
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,708
It sounded like a woman talking.

42
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,125
Yes.

43
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:38,909
Before we came here, I knew a woman who shows that she was pregnant or that she had miscarriage.
 And that she was very hurt about this.

44
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:50,000
So it may have any connection to it.
 Because I also felt when we went here, that someone is waiting for us.
 Someone who wants to get their voice heard tonight.

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,680
Should we go in there and see if we capture this?

46
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,693
Now we don't speak French.
 But we try to communicate in English and Swedish of course.

47
00:05:57,693 --> 00:06:03,647
I do so, if you are left here I put instruments further away, and we will see if the energies can come towards us.

48
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:06,065
I will post on each side of a beam there.

49
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:17,701
One is PRS.
 Where we will get static or REM function.
 And then PDA, Paranormal Direct Answer.
 Red or green, answers questions.

50
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:23,793
So I put them a bit away.
 And this will be like a motion Detector as well.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now it lies there and pulsates and it lies and senses there.

52
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:59,543
Should we secure behind us?
 I put an exercise detector there.

53
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,028
Now I got up on Ovilus ..

54
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:06,815
Together, smile now, what does that mean?

55
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:19,834
I know, it's like there is a woman at the far end, waiting for us.
 It's like she wants to tell you about this son, because she shows that it was shameful to her.

56
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:31,274
That she was convicted of something or that it was not okay for her to have this child.
 So she wants to talk a lot about this child.

57
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:42,436
And I feel the energy so that she sits at the far end.
 And that she is ready to communicate.

58
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:44,662
If you are sitting over there ...

59
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:47,434
Would you be able to go to what pulsates there?

60
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:06,270
Now she almost sits and mocks a bit, like now we have to play instead.
 Now it's Game On instead.

61
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,644
At first it was welcoming, but now she is preparing to get more closely.

62
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:25,809
And I'll send away a bit and see if she can come to us so we feel too.
 I don't see her coming so it's like she's left there as we are going to move closer.

63
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,786
Before she comes here.

64
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,598
But she still sits with the mockery, not the joyful that was first.

65
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:40,000
Should we move forward then?
 What do you think?

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,076
Wait a little bit just ..

67
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:48,674
Because we have more things that move down there so maybe something wants to come.

68
00:08:49,117 --> 00:09:01,949
Sometimes it's like I see something ... like a white figure.
 Then I saw it behind Wilma in the corner.
 I don't know if it's ...

69
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:09,790
that the eyes play one a splash.
 But it was like she was in this vault.

70
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,377
That's how I see her too.

71
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:18,208
Do you see there?
 If you look away there and in the middle, between the technology there.

72
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,168
Yes.
 Yes actually.

73
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:33,173
When you look at it for a long time it tunes away.
 Throw something, if you have such power then take our energy and throw something in here, a stone.

74
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:37,436
Does anyone have died down here?

75
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:52,218
She now shows me, when you ask that question, that question is hard to answer.
 Because she shows it with the body language, she backs back a bit.
 She thinks it's hard to talk about it.

76
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:56,169
What happened to you?
 Can't tell you that?

77
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:11,867
After all, we have a prison hole further away with different sections.
 Mild penalty at the top, worse and then the worst at the bottom.
 We press upwards then.

78
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:14,284
Yes, I think we do.

79
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:19,673
Now we come to you here.
 I imagine that many have died here.

80
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,076
Don't you like us to come here?

81
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,170
What was that?

82
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,785
It was something that took me on my leg, or was it perhaps a spider network?

83
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,171
Do you have any lamp?

84
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:48,402
What the hell was that?
 There is quite a lot of spider networks here so it must be then.

85
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:55,060
Yes, we have spiders and most of it in old basements.

86
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:56,766
Should I go first?

87
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:59,566
Now we come to you.

88
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,113
It's a big hole down there.

89
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:04,481
Oh!

90
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:16,018
Have you opened that door?
 Wasn't it closed when we were here before?

91
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:20,316
Well ... if it has been closed then our surveillance camera took it.

92
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:27,483
That the door was closed before we can't look at the surveillance, that's something that obscures the camera

93
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:28,743
We have to check it.

94
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,414
Niclas hears a whistle

95
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,875
It sounded like someone whistled.

96
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:40,830
But, we must not go there.

97
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,109
Yes, he was there and felt on the door and said we must not go in there.

98
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:49,775
Then someone has opened there then, trying to fool us there.

99
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,769
That's how you mean?

100
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:57,539
Test run your hand there so spring we see.

101
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,733
You can go here.

102
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,353
He said we couldn't go there.

103
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:16,484
It is still the energy that she is trying to play us a joke.
 For now I see that she is sitting here and just keeps mocking when we are heading in there.

104
00:12:16,484 --> 00:12:26,317
And like "blaming yourself".
 There is such a difference because first she was welcoming and then when we came in here she shifted immediately.

105
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:29,672
And she wants to shovel us in there all the time.

106
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:41,915
Maybe stroll with surveillance?

107
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:46,120
Do we have someone with here?

108
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,985
There are such holes everywhere.

109
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:54,825
Is there water there?

110
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,547
Disturbance only on Niclas microphone

111
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,539
Sure damn there is water there.

112
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,970
Lucky I didn't jump down then.

113
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:14,592
While it is a disturbance, you see something looking forward at the door

114
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:20,237
Then they have water below.
 So it's also a leader.

115
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:21,560
It was me.

116
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,164
Exactly, water is also an element.

117
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:29,884
Try pressing your hand over there then.

118
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,540
Grab my arm.

119
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:42,620
I feel a great cold when you said so, it comes from.
 From where you stand against us.

120
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,801
Come out here!

121
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:50,477
Too bad we can't go in there ... But we must not do it, it's racially risk,

122
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,878
Come out here!
 Close this door.

123
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,000
So it gets really cold ..

124
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,374
It sounded like something fell into the water.

125
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,557
We are not afraid of you.

126
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,213
You just get more curious to go in there.

127
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:19,148
I know.
 Unfortunately we can't do it

128
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:26,813
This female energy I knew, she is gone now.

129
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:31,382
Yes, it's in there.

130
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:39,168
Did it disappear?

131
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,548
Yes.

132
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,713
On the other side there.

133
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:04,443
Come out here, come to me.

134
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:15,158
And then it backs, it's just like "coming again, going through the door".

135
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:19,315
It's alluring all the time.

136
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:23,162
They should not get it.
 Then they can sneak out here to us.

137
00:15:23,162 --> 00:15:24,601
Exactly.

138
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:32,619
As I mentioned, the female energy, it feels like she has done her job now.
 So that energy is gone.

139
00:15:34,242 --> 00:15:39,276
So it was perhaps that she would bring us inward.

140
00:15:39,276 --> 00:15:44,530
I think of Incubus, it's a woman ... no saccubus it is ...

141
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:47,120
Was it close properly?

142
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:52,017
What is it?

143
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,794
At first it looked like a woman standing there in the water ...

144
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:57,476
Yes, a woman standing there in the water!

145
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:07,500
I only saw the contours, this white you talked about.
 She stood there in the water.
 I got it confirmed, because she stood down there and looked up.

146
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,781
I just shudder my arms.

147
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:10,999
So unpleasant.

148
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,659
Yes, she just stood there.

149
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:20,000
I closed that now, if I closed something else for that was ....

150
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
I see you and then we got confirmed there.

151
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,265
Attract one in the water.
 What does she want to do there?
 Download one ..

152
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:35,796
But think, people have certainly died here, there are certainly people under the ground where we are.
 But the confirmation came pretty quickly.

153
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,169
Directly when you said it.

154
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,101
Yeah, as soon as you said that

155
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:48,278
You have said the white, all the time, but I did not see what you were talking about, but here it was the contours of a woman standing in a nightgown.

156
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:50,560
She stood straight down here?

157
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:58,177
It's an edge there, the only thing I see it is to the edge.
 I don't see what goes down, I just see that it breaks because she stands at an edge.

158
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,115
I can not see.

159
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:02,197
There, it breaks there.

160
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:07,741
So if you stand where I stand, then you only see her shoulders and head.

161
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:11,605
So you just looked here from and up?

162
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:18,686
The woman who is down there ...

163
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:21,401
what's your name?

164
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:26,226
Are your lucie?

165
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:49,000
I heard the water down there now, like it was dropping.
 And then when you asked about names, I got up in my head, Felice or Felicia.
 Though a French pronunciation.

166
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,962
I take Polterscript.
 What I think is so interesting also is that this energy really turns out, manifests itself.

167
00:17:54,962 --> 00:17:59,101
So cool that you see it.
 You saw it first, this white.

168
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:06,111
But not as you described it.
 I saw it more like a square type, like it was something white.

169
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,378
But it's unpleasant ..

170
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:28,208
Tony feels something on his cheek

171
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:33,212
I do not come up with what it is called, but like we mock type ..

172
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:34,769
What happens now?

173
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:37,447
It's a spider network here ...

174
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:40,633
There is a lot of spider web on you here.

175
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:43,729
Now this cold comes when you talk about it.

176
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:49,205
Imagine a nail that pulls towards the beard and that pulls down here to the chin and stays there.

177
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:53,608
As soon as you start talking about it, I feel this cold.

178
00:18:56,331 --> 00:19:02,449
Open this door.
 If you want us in there, open the door.

179
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:10,330
What the hell was that?
 I don't usually back back, but that was ...

180
00:19:10,994 --> 00:19:13,286
I hope we have it on the camera.

181
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,404
Did you film here?

182
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:14,904
Yes.

183
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:20,000
Then we can analyze this, if it was a bat that looked over the edge.
 Or waved across the edge.

184
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,920
What we see now in retrospect is a bat flying towards the door and turns

185
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,152
Just when you say it, when you look there.

186
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:34,571
Can you do it again?
 Open the door.

187
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:46,647
I feel such a strange energy behind it.
 It is not an energy from a person I know, but there is more someone who crawl like this.

188
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:52,974
There is something or something else, something that has not belonged to a human being.

189
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:58,203
Very strange, I haven't encountered it so much before.

190
00:19:58,203 --> 00:19:59,825
You haven't encountered that example.

191
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:08,653
Yes, that is something new as well.

192
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:20,000
This is the first time, it went so fast so I don't know.
 I want to put logic on it first, if it was a bat that showed up there.
 But that damn timing.

193
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,520
It is terrible.

194
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,012
It like an old gray hand that was on the way ....

195
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:34,946
We can't place so much emphasis on it either, that's what we discovered and that's what we knew and what we think we saw, but the analysis will see it.

196
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:36,202
Yes exactly.

197
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:45,655
Come out here.

198
00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:50,000
Now it starts to burn here.
 Damn, it's like ...

199
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,461
Do we have something here?

200
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,275
It is such a strong lamp so it is difficult to see.

201
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:08,379
Damn, it's like a nail here.
 So unpleasant.

202
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:11,182
If there is someone down there ...

203
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:13,426
show yourself.

204
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:25,800
But I think we let this be now.
 We have a camera here, so the doors open these doors so Lennie shouts to us right away.

205
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,308
Okay, are you following us?

206
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:56,107
This is an interesting room, check out all the wine bottles around here.
 I think they said there are over 3000 wine bottles here.
 Here it would be fun if something was thrown.

207
00:21:56,107 --> 00:22:02,519
Or that a wine bottle comes out.
 I put this in the natural passage here, which is so old.

208
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:12,609
I feel we have one woman who showed up in white, with us.
 That she followed us now, up from the water and after us here.

209
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:17,858
So I feel her energy here too.

210
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:20,747
The woman who is here ..

211
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:37,686
If we listen to how it sounds just ...

212
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,828
Can we hear your voice?

213
00:22:50,149 --> 00:23:01,164
It's like she's playing us a joke all the time, because she's very fast when I check in where she is.
 She is in here, but then she suddenly stands in the corner.

214
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:10,176
Then fast there, fast there, as if she certainly turns out as through the light phenomenon that we can see on the surveillance then maybe.

215
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:22,660
That it moves very quickly and it is like she does not want or can get any communication.
 Without just that she can make us see her fast.

216
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:33,197
I put out the motion detector at about the height where the cork machine is, if someone comes in.
 If she moves fast, hopefully this will take it.

217
00:23:33,197 --> 00:23:37,219
But it would have been interesting if that had also picked it up.

218
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:41,865
Now I went into it.

219
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:55,280
But I think, because you Wilma get to you something that could show up in surveillance, so I call Lennie so he is in control of it.

220
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:08,257
Lennie, have some control when now for Wilma feel that the light phenomenon may come or that you can possibly see something.
 So, in that case, call us on the radio.

221
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:09,228
Yes.

222
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:18,621
We must also keep in mind that Lennie is sitting up there.
 It can slap up there, we have not added any instrument there just because it should not be difficult to sit there.

223
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:25,520
He sits there in the dark, he has a surveillance system.
 But if it starts to move and bang there, then he calls to us so we have to go up there.

224
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:34,550
For this is a little unexplored area, you come here with your knowledge, you give us some theories on what it can be and what you feel.

225
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:47,284
We see things.
 We experience crazy things.
 And it is not very much that has happened here, but we go through everything, so we go to the active areas later.

226
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:53,107
Do we have someone here who could throw something?
 Throw a wine bottle.

227
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,859
I walk around a bit and see if we catch something.

228
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:09,039
If the woman jumping around is here ...

229
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,376
the woman...

230
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,988
The woman, okay.

231
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:23,025
What's your name?

232
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,531
Movement.

233
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:40,311
Was it me who did it?
 I'll test just because as you see, my arm is here now ...

234
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,529
It is cold here.

235
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:50,000
Is it she who moves there then?
 And then we get the word real.

236
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:01,063
Can you who is here, this woman ...

237
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:03,626
Why are you left here?

238
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:11,894
I don't know what you did when you went there, if you pressed her down in the corner.

239
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:14,036
Try again.

240
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,797
Are you here?

241
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:23,784
Go out here.

242
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:29,821
Or if you're here, come in here.

243
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:49,616
I get like someone holding me in my hand now, damn hard.

244
00:26:54,303 --> 00:26:56,316
What was that?

245
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:00,000
Did it loosen the color?

246
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:04,387
It was something that fell or if that bottle rotated.

247
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,354
A man's name.

248
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:10,596
Something sounded here.

249
00:27:15,246 --> 00:27:17,708
Do you understand if this sounds?

250
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,464
Something...

251
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:22,744
Although it may have any color that came loose.

252
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:30,213
It feels like someone is pushing my hand and my arm, like not the arm gets blood type.

253
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:33,843
I feel exactly the same ...

254
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:38,257
Tony hears a man's voice somewhere in the room

255
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:42,228
It is so clear now.

256
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,835
That was a man's voice, did you hear that?

257
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:51,240
I heard a man who said something.

258
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,600
The voice is caught, but weak

259
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,655
I feel like ...

260
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:02,800
It is, sorry for being departed, but it is Johnny.

261
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,818
It came through a name.

262
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:12,261
Is Johnny here?
 It doesn't sound like it's SP's usual French name.

263
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:19,078
But then we should keep that in mind that those who own it now are from England.

264
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:27,236
I'm not double.

265
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm modern.

266
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:41,534
Just what I was talking about.
 I'm not double but I'm modern, Johnny.
 And it's women's voice on this ...

267
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:13,480
Imagine what I said there.
 Johnny may have to do with them, modern time.
 And like I'm not a double copy of anything, I'm real.
 Everything is so cool, which comes through.

268
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:21,660
And I feel very small suddenly.
 I feel almost shrunk, like my energy is depressed.

269
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:27,371
Like I can't get any kind of contact, like someone holding my mouth on me.

270
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:28,802
A little so I feel.

271
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:31,244
Does it feel like you are getting medially blocked?

272
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:42,382
Yes exactly.
 And that you take my identity and just squeeze it down, like snapping together a paper.
 So I feel all the time.

273
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:48,413
But if you back a little, down there.
 Change place with her Tony.

274
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:51,706
If you back down more towards that window there.

275
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:58,316
See if you know if it is stronger there, where Tony stood.

276
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:04,209
Now it starts in my face.
 As a spider web.

277
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:05,844
But not like nails?

278
00:30:05,844 --> 00:30:10,653
No, it was like someone pulled a string type, which got stuck in the beard.

279
00:30:10,653 --> 00:30:22,311
Here I feel that it is easier because here I come back and collect impressions again.
 But as I approach where you stand, then it is like I get depressed.

280
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:32,169
It's here, it's like a magnet, here it stops me.
 Here it is like I get small again.

281
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:38,312
It is the impressions that he shows me, so the question is whether it can be connection ...

282
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:45,044
Imagine what happened to him who owns this.

283
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,263
The dog that came at night ..

284
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:54,539
Yes exactly.
 He realized that this is a ghost dog.
 And it is quite interesting when he gets this, I can take the whole story ..

285
00:30:54,539 --> 00:31:06,432
The owner lies and wakes up in the morning, he sees that a dog will go by the bed.
 And he realizes that we have no dog, we have no animals here, everything is locked.

286
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:15,522
Then he thinks he should stretch his hand, then he knows how the hand hits the head of the dog, then the dog jumps up also

287
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:23,537
And lay next to him and lay there for a while.
 He just lay there completely still and did nothing, then the dog jumped down, went and disappeared.

288
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:25,654
Now it says dog.

289
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:31,280
And there are tracks in the stone up there, paw prints.

290
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,109
Just.

291
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:38,427
It feels like we are no longer coming right here.
 Should we move one floor up?

292
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:39,747
We go to Lucie's.

293
00:31:39,747 --> 00:31:41,988
Top.
 Should we go to the corridor right away?

294
00:31:41,988 --> 00:31:43,141
We go to her right away.

295
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,324
I just have to check, there is no dog on the building here now or?

296
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:46,964
No.

297
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:54,419
I heard dog skulls as I walked around and pulled network cables.
 I didn't know this.
 I heard dog shells, powerful.

298
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,454
Just that, you haven't heard this story.

299
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:57,813
No.

300
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:00,213
No, so there is no dog here.

301
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:08,326
Because I walked past that wooden staircase and past where he lives, I heard a strong dog shell, then I thought "does he have a dog in there?"

302
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:12,720
That was sick.
 Because he told us about the dog, the dog ghost then but ...

303
00:32:13,384 --> 00:32:15,020
The sound of a woman laughing

304
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,129
You laughed now?

305
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:19,567
No, I haven't laughed.

306
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:20,491
!

307
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:21,136
Huh?

308
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:27,311
It's a woman in front of us, she turned out to be very clear.
 Dark hair.

309
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,103
So, it was a woman who laughed.

310
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,223
She hovered, with dark hair.
 Directly in front of.

311
00:32:34,223 --> 00:32:35,842
I shudder all over my body.

312
00:32:35,842 --> 00:32:37,331
I shudder on the whole ....

313
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:41,695
I saw her so clearly.
 So very clear.

314
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:49,088
We must have caught this.
 We have caught it on that microphone if Johan is there.
 It was clearly a woman who laughed.

315
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:55,078
And she really hovered like this.
 Like she hovered by.

316
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,674
Show you again.

317
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:09,633
That laugh.

318
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,182
If we have caught it, it is ..

319
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:14,633
I was quite sure it was you who laughed there.

320
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:15,859
How did it sound?

321
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:26,652
I have never seen anything so clear, this was with the physical eye, ie not medially but right in front.
 It was like she hovered, it was so cool.

322
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,163
It was really cool.

323
00:33:30,163 --> 00:33:33,394
Hope she follows up then.

324
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:42,906
That said, this is Lucie's room.
 It's time in here ..

325
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:48,624
As you have seen her and this is where they have caught her in the picture.

326
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,172
So it's pretty special.

327
00:33:51,759 --> 00:34:01,958
Lennie is now too, he is behind the camera.
 So now we are all, now no one is sitting at the surveillance.

328
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:11,940
Should we leave this here?
 If it is activated, I go further in and place a PMB.
 It will be pretty much back because it is not that big and we are quite a few.

329
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:14,815
So we'll see.

330
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:18,564
I'll post this first then.

331
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:26,570
Should we follow in directly?

332
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,562
You can do that.

333
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,373
Lucie?

334
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,039
If you're here ...

335
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:37,904
can you show yourself?

336
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:52,002
I get a pressure over my chest, almost like anxiety on.
 I also felt that when I walked in that corridor, where you have heard the dog.

337
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:54,262
And that grief comes along.

338
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:56,916
It is here that they have photographed, Nicke.

339
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:57,416
Yes.

340
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:01,537
In the 80s sometime, what thinks this is the ghost then.

341
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:10,252
I will put this here.
 And direct it straight up to the beam.
 So it will be the whole area, so we back a little.

342
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:31,744
Yes, I took it out.
 An old honest flux, I put it down too.

343
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:33,903
So we back.

344
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:39,050
You don't have to be afraid of us.
 We're just here to talk to you.

345
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,610
I put down another flux.

346
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:58,709
I get a lot of communication here and I get direct contact with this woman.
 I think it's Lucie.
 She shows me how she cries and then how she has to be quiet, like someone holding her mouth.

347
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:18,296
She has a lot of anxiety and shows such emotions.
 And that she backs up a little because she has learned that you should not talk, or that she was not allowed to talk when she lived.

348
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:26,282
Is this story also true that you were trapped here by the Baron's wife?

349
00:36:26,282 --> 00:36:32,929
That you died in one of these towers or in the dungeon?

350
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:35,088
There was a female perfume.

351
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:37,607
Right on my face.

352
00:36:41,187 --> 00:36:43,244
Where did it come from?

353
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:46,127
Lucie are you here?

354
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:48,587
Does it disappear?

355
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:49,608
Yes.

356
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:55,118
It just showed up like that ... Then it disappeared.

357
00:36:56,742 --> 00:37:00,895
Take the phone and Google Translate.

358
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:06,477
Write if it is Lucie who usually goes back and forth here.
 Is it you Lucie who is here.

359
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:13,295
This is the only way to communicate in French.
 So we'll see if we get results.

360
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,404
I'll ask if she is afraid of us.

361
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:40,860
Lucie, show you.

362
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,207
Let's see you.

363
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:51,332
I'll ask if she has been shown in the picture.

364
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:14,812
It is a completely different feeling here, when compared to how it was down in the basement.
 Here I don't even get the same as it was down there.
 Right?

365
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:19,629
No, down there you were a little more on full range.
 You did not know what could happen.

366
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:22,812
Did you hear the bang over there?

367
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:23,673
Further away?

368
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:25,743
Yes, I heard a severe bang.

369
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:33,966
The advantage is that we have a surveillance camera, which is constantly documenting here.
 So we get a movement, that she goes here, then we have it.

370
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:38,966
I go and pick up this.
 So we go down there where we know that a touch has been filmed.

371
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,328
We try there.
 See if we can make it happen.

372
00:38:45,837 --> 00:38:53,339
We are down here now, we have all the conditions.
 If Wilma sits there Tony, you sit there first.

373
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:58,985
I place some instruments here, I will post a flux here on the table.

374
00:38:58,985 --> 00:39:05,296
Or no, we take flux in front of you.
 Because that is an old magic table you used here.
 Perfect.

375
00:39:05,296 --> 00:39:07,858
This is where he sat.

376
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:12,508
Exactly, I can do a little reconstruction.
 Because we will not be able to show it, we got to see a unique clip.

377
00:39:12,508 --> 00:39:24,336
He had some string here.
 And you see something that does so and he reacts immediately.
 And it's pretty interesting.

378
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:26,511
If you sit down there.

379
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:46,922
I know a man directly standing close to you and moving around you.
 Because I feel a cold between us, clearly.
 Here it is warmer, then here it gets icy.
 So it's around you.

380
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,682
Okay, you may touch me.
 Lift up my sweater.

381
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:02,121
Go to the blue light on the table there.

382
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:17,897
I feel that the man is there and he tells me that you should respect the fine room.
 When we go in here we will go in with respect and we will almost ask for permission before

383
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:31,663
We sit down or before we touch things.
 So it is very important to him that we respect the room.
 For this room is classified as very nice for them.
 For him.

384
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,653
It's a man we have?

385
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:34,745
Yes, it's a man.

386
00:40:36,914 --> 00:40:45,098
This man, can you go to one of our things we have here?
 That iron stick on the table, there is a lot that is not usually here.

387
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:48,982
Should I take the phone again and test some French phrases?

388
00:40:48,982 --> 00:40:52,149
Do it, then we also see if we get a reaction.

389
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,551
I ask if they have touched a person sitting on this chair.

390
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,977
What happened there?

391
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:02,716
There were double votes.

392
00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:07,153
It was an echo, did you hear that?

393
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:20,936
So, why do I see the light phenomenon?
 That must be another light phenomenon, now I see another and it flew straight into your arm.

394
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:21,712
Huh?

395
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:28,054
It must have been caught on surveillance.

396
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:28,940
No light phenomenon was caught on the surveillance

397
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:35,190
Why do I see them with my own eyes?
 I've never been able to see it.

398
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,437
Touch me.

399
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:43,264
Say, touch any of us.

400
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:45,632
Before you do it, wait ...

401
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:54,953
I put it on the Sean table here.

402
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,293
Touch any of us.

403
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:09,708
Hard thumps in the room

404
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,916
Did you hear?
 A bang.
 It was behind Johan somewhere.

405
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:21,956
Niclas, I think you and I should change places.
 Because I always hear that the woman should sit on the couch.

406
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,796
Okay.

407
00:42:24,014 --> 00:42:25,869
You should not sit there.

408
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:30,183
I ask if it wants us to leave the castle.

409
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:53,812
I don't think the energies over the law here know how to communicate with us.
 How they should do with this or how they should do with what we mentioned before, that the castle is not so investigated ...

410
00:42:53,812 --> 00:43:02,759
There have not been so many people here.
 They feel very uncertain, they send some words to me every now and then and show something.

411
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:18,187
But they are surprised and think "what is this?"
 They do not know how to use it and I think that is why it is so quiet on the stuff.
 Because I feel we have energies here.

412
00:43:18,187 --> 00:43:22,277
Try if you see and hear us ...

413
00:43:22,277 --> 00:43:24,092
With Wilma's help ...

414
00:43:24,092 --> 00:43:29,315
Can you just come, to this table?

415
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:34,574
And touch this iron stick standing there?

416
00:43:34,832 --> 00:43:37,638
Just go near it.

417
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:40,754
You don't have to be afraid of something.

418
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:47,871
It is usually quite interesting when driving a spirit box, but we will definitely not understand what they say.

419
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:49,271
No.

420
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,509
But this noise usually attracts someone.

421
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:58,042
We can test, we know a little bit, we may have a little name.
 We can see if we can interpret anything.

422
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:06,840
I go and pick up one.
 If we are in the finroom then there should be no toys here.
 So I put this on the couch.

423
00:44:07,467 --> 00:44:09,194
So we'll see.

424
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,153
So it's the same thing, if something comes close to this ...

425
00:44:15,555 --> 00:44:17,631
It should definitely not be there.

426
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:23,534
Throw that teddy if you want.

427
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:26,926
Now I start Spiritbox.

428
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:38,322
Voice of a man comes through

429
00:44:38,765 --> 00:44:40,055
What was that?

430
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:46,170
There are lots of votes, as you say there are many here.

431
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:52,867
As soon as you started it there I see lots.
 Everyone comes here.

432
00:44:54,011 --> 00:44:55,444
Voice of a woman comes through

433
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,214
Stir my arm here now.
 Or my sweater.

434
00:45:14,507 --> 00:45:17,051
It's like they are sitting at the table.

435
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:17,966
Just.

436
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:23,990
Woman.

437
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:29,172
It's like they have a conference or something.

438
00:45:29,172 --> 00:45:31,580
Only votes at each chair.

439
00:45:37,669 --> 00:45:44,406
Cool!
 It's like they sit here and have a meeting.

440
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:52,041
Imagine they have a dinner in here type.

441
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:57,383
Just.
 And this is very difficult, I will not have a clue what they say when I listen to this.

442
00:45:57,383 --> 00:45:58,165
No.

443
00:45:58,165 --> 00:46:02,097
But it confirms what you say that there is a lot of energies in here.

444
00:46:02,097 --> 00:46:07,209
And when we open this noise, that's when it usually starts because then they realize that we hear them.

445
00:46:08,928 --> 00:46:11,680
This was interesting, sound at each chair.

446
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,565
No touch.
 Did he sit later or?

447
00:46:21,436 --> 00:46:23,472
Insect flying past

448
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:29,581
Ask if they sit at this table, in French.

449
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:35,968
Niclas batteries in the mosquito die, Niclas tests with PMB behind Tony while we wait for new batteries, to see if there is anyone behind him

450
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,639
Immediately.

451
00:46:51,639 --> 00:46:54,062
I start with PMB here.

452
00:46:54,837 --> 00:46:57,098
Straight into that chair.

453
00:47:16,177 --> 00:47:18,364
I'll ask if they see us.

454
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,654
Do you know that you are dead ...

455
00:47:42,001 --> 00:48:01,819
It's like they are ignoring us, it's like they have their thing here at the table and that everything else around is not important.
 It's like a "time loop" it's played over and over again.

456
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,847
There is a completely different way to communicate with them, your tarot cards.

457
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:17,966
Should we try to put one quick?
 If you sit here at the table then maybe we can pin them out here.
 Should we test it Tony?

458
00:48:17,966 --> 00:48:22,320
We turn this off but we leave some instruments running at the same time.

459
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:33,860
We will stand on that page, Johan will stand next to you here and look at your cards, while you tell me, I put an instrument here behind and we will see what happens.

460
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:48,141
I have two different card games, one that tells us what we have around us, what kind of energy it is.
 Then you can start asking what it wants to say to us.

461
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:57,719
And before I took out the cards I got the number three, which means we should draw three cards from this game.

462
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:05,856
And then I go on my intuition, ie my gut feeling that tells me when I have to draw these cards.

463
00:49:05,856 --> 00:49:09,585
I also set up a PMB here.

464
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:19,546
I wrong places things that really should not be here because it is the finroom.

465
00:49:19,546 --> 00:49:22,875
I have more instruments, should I put a flux a little more behind us?

466
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:26,968
Do it, we put lots around us.

467
00:49:26,968 --> 00:49:31,810
So we see who confirms, who move in the room here.
 It gets really cool.

468
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:44,393
Then I now ask what energy we have around the table.
 I will draw three cards.

469
00:49:54,025 --> 00:50:06,741
This tells, brings into the light, so this one does not know that it is dead.
 It is not all but a certain energy in here who do not know that it is dead.

470
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:17,161
It's like it ignores us, like it doesn't really see us.

471
00:50:20,335 --> 00:50:31,126
This confirms it that this spirit believes it is still alive, just as I said.
 This needs to be brought into the light.

472
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:44,933
This also confirms that it is a soul from a human being.
 This is then one of the energies we have around us.
 I said before that I should draw three cards, but I need to check a little more.

473
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:54,186
Now it shows how to help it be brought into the light.
 Okay, what else do we have around us?

474
00:50:54,186 --> 00:51:07,746
A strong energy that can move on objects and take on people.
 That is exactly what we have confirmed before then, when someone has been drawn in the sweater.

475
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:17,240
It is interesting, it is a bit what people have told about before, what happened to this touch.
 Even what we are dealing with here.

476
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:29,520
Now we do not have all the time in the world, we will not have this castle for several days, but it is here and now.
 We got a little here before, that it might increase in intensity then.

477
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:40,196
I have no idea, but what I think happened this guy, that he just got him to go in here and sit down.

478
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:43,773
The others just laughed.

479
00:51:43,773 --> 00:51:45,936
Because here nothing has happened before.

480
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:58,000
And that is what I think it is with this place, that when you come in here, you should be lucky.
 Think about what he said, he who owns it, I've only seen this dog.

481
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,570
What is down in the basement, came ...

482
00:52:01,308 --> 00:52:04,911
Down in the basement .. The stronger energy.

483
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:12,587
Is it the same?
 Is it the one who comes up and visits them sometimes or is it two?

484
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,757
It got colder here.

485
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:26,400
But I think it's so, it's an energy on the bottom floor.
 I don't think it goes up here.
 It is a woman, it is a woman who is very strong down there.
 We see her, we hear her.

486
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,874
If I sit down here ..

487
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:30,608
Should we sit down and just listen in a little?

488
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:34,404
Duns and steps are heard in the building

489
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:51,465
I see it as it is one and the same time or event that is played.
 I see it as this is a nice dinner you have, with important people.

490
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:59,717
Sitting around this table.
 And here there is a man of higher .. There may be any king or a prince.

491
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:05,099
He should sign something.
 Then it is mixed with men and women sitting around here.

492
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:16,939
I see how he writes on something and that you bowl in very nice glass.
 This goes as in a loop all the time, the same sequence all the time, as in a movie.

493
00:53:16,939 --> 00:53:19,741
It sounds like it's a big event.

494
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:28,124
Yes and that may be why I do not feel seen, because they are here and now in this.

495
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:34,697
They do not see or do not care that something else is happening around.

496
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:43,331
Can you move aside again?
 When you talked, I thought I saw a light passing there, right in front of you Niclas.

497
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:54,541
That's what I say, there are so many cool things happening here.
 Imagine the light phenomenon, you see a woman floating.
 I see a woman standing in the water looking up.

498
00:53:54,541 --> 00:54:07,200
We hear her, twice.
 Then the touch has been documented, so there is something that moves here.
 But I don't understand why we'll see right now?
 These light phenomena.

499
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,525
We have not experienced this before, that we see.

500
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:10,775
No I know.

501
00:54:10,775 --> 00:54:15,191
I'll check if there was any kind of reflection, but I don't think they.

502
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:20,546
We take one with communication, which talks a little.
 Polterscript.

503
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:28,002
It will throw out words.
 We may be able to find out what they wrote on.

504
00:54:28,629 --> 00:54:31,400
Find out what they wrote on yes ...

505
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:37,480
There is something about what you were talking about.

506
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,692
Does anyone have happened in connection with the fact that you wrote on the paper?
 Something fate around ...

507
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,413
Is there anything special about that paper?
 About the castle?

508
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:57,171
Something unresolved that you want to convey and tell us about?

509
00:54:58,426 --> 00:55:02,834
Six.
 How many chairs are there?
 Eight..

510
00:55:12,429 --> 00:55:21,328
Lennie, is in control of the door now.
 Now Lennie is sitting out there listening.
 It said door, silence and door.

511
00:55:21,328 --> 00:55:23,967
There may be doors here too.

512
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:27,336
Can you close them the doors?
 Close that door in front of us.

513
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,342
I tested that chair, the one, the ..

514
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:38,302
Everyone has been votes on and there are six chairs.

515
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:40,094
It's awesome.

516
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:50,911
And that I knew that there are important people sitting here.
 They talk about something important and these people have power over something.

517
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:57,703
Tony, should we make us sweep through the last two?
 There are two more rooms ..

518
00:55:57,703 --> 00:56:02,345
Wait, we go up and go a little neighbor, move us a bit.

519
00:56:02,345 --> 00:56:03,464
Just.

520
00:56:03,464 --> 00:56:07,488
We let Wilma interpret and we bring some communication.

521
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:10,878
Statical!

522
00:56:11,321 --> 00:56:14,160
Directly when we leave, things went here.

523
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:20,000
REM went on and static field swept around it.

524
00:56:20,886 --> 00:56:22,856
Tony hears a voice of a woman in the room

525
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:26,800
Now I heard someone here who said ... but it was a woman.

526
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,806
Did you say anything Lennie?

527
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:31,533
He is very far away.

528
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:33,977
I know.
 It was here type ...

529
00:56:35,408 --> 00:56:39,570
Maybe she is, but it may be others too ...

530
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:45,191
Nothing that stands out?

531
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:47,686
Two bangs have been heard down here.

532
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:48,807
Okay.

533
00:56:50,000 --> 00:57:01,680
I don't know if there are changes in the castle or if it is anything else.
 But it feels pretty quiet here I feel, because I fix to sit here myself in the dark.

534
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,336
Is it inside the rooms maybe then?

535
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:03,886
Yes exactly.

536
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:13,176
Here I get the same feeling, as having important conversations here or business or settlements, at this table.

537
00:57:13,176 --> 00:57:23,257
But when I came in here I got a feeling of a lot of animals around me, around my legs.
 Maybe they have had a dog or a cat running here too.

538
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:37,060
And that this room is a little more social than the other.
 But it is still an important room and talking about important things, but it is more an open energy here.

539
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:45,511
And that you brought your dog with you.
 That it is not as nice for them.

540
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:50,946
Pull out a chair when we stand here.

541
00:57:56,371 --> 00:57:59,120
Nothing on Polterscript either.

542
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:05,536
It feels calm.

543
00:58:05,536 --> 00:58:13,608
It is interesting that you get it, but it may not be as strong as the other there.

544
00:58:14,715 --> 00:58:16,994
We will take the next one too.

545
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:28,112
Here it is much more life and movement.
 Here you have done something social, here is The Play Room or what to say.

546
00:58:28,112 --> 00:58:35,030
This is where you really hang out and bowls.
 And you might have some dance or activity here.

547
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:45,314
So here there is a lot of movement around me and very happy energies.
 So it is completely different if you compare with the room where we were before.

548
00:58:47,153 --> 00:58:49,656
Something left here?

549
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:55,625
It's like going in here when you celebrate something, if you have won something, then you go in here and celebrate.

550
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,124
Okay.

551
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:10,000
If I want to say what I think has been here, I think they have had a large pool table here.
 The men have been in here and done things as well.

552
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,806
It's not that far from what you say.
 There are matches, you celebrate something.
 It's awesome.

553
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:21,303
There is a lot of memory energies I think.

554
00:59:21,303 --> 00:59:30,162
There is nothing on communication.
 It's good that you get what you say, but it doesn't feel like a very active room.

555
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:34,249
We have a room left.
 No, we have two rooms left.

556
00:59:34,249 --> 00:59:47,971
Here it is like I am being retracted, like coming in, came in.
 Here I can feel an energy, not a memory but here someone is pulling us in.

557
00:59:47,971 --> 00:59:54,492
Like a circus director ...

558
00:59:54,492 --> 00:59:55,336
A throw -in?

559
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:56,880
Yes exactly.

560
00:59:57,138 --> 00:59:59,676
Anyone here and want to talk to us?

561
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:22,473
That's it too, we're here now, we got access to this castle, to document Lucie and all of them here.
 But we also had the opportunity to go down into the basement, we have been given the opportunity to go on all floors.

562
01:00:22,473 --> 01:00:30,222
And I can say it's pretty quiet here.
 But we have our ghost up there.
 And it's interesting, because we've got a completely different thing

563
01:00:30,222 --> 01:00:36,198
And it would be really interesting to hand it over to him later.
 And tell us about what we have got down in the basement.

564
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:43,169
So if more paranormal investigators are to be here, then go down into the basement.
 This is where the strongest is.

565
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:51,968
Because here it also feels no discomfort.
 Quite pleasant, calm on the machines.
 It's as you say, come in here.

566
01:00:51,968 --> 01:00:55,638
The energies are just around here and are as nice as possible.

567
01:00:56,709 --> 01:01:05,604
Really, exactly so.
 It feels like the female energies are dominant tonight, that's what we have encountered for the most part.

568
01:01:05,604 --> 01:01:12,944
Usually male, masculine energies usually take much more space.
 But now it is really the women.

569
01:01:12,944 --> 01:01:16,264
And I think that's really cool.

570
01:01:17,777 --> 01:01:23,320
Shall we take the last one?
 The showroom.
 We check how it is.

571
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:36,864
I get a hard feeling when I go in here and that is that an abuse of some kind has taken place here.
 Then I feel a female energy trying to communicate it to me.

572
01:01:38,045 --> 01:01:50,401
That there is some kind of abuse that has happened here.
 I don't know if it can be an energy memory or if you try to explain it.

573
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:59,627
Because it is still a bit the same energy, it is not as intense as we have been in contact with before.

574
01:01:59,627 --> 01:02:01,823
Is this far back do you think?

575
01:02:01,823 --> 01:02:04,361
This is long back.

576
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:05,767
It has taken place here then?

577
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,534
If there is something left here ...

578
01:02:11,534 --> 01:02:13,317
Can you move something?

579
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,423
Talk to us?

580
01:02:15,423 --> 01:02:17,573
We have a bar here.

581
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:20,167
Can you do something with the glasses in here?

582
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:33,714
I also get to me that it may have any kind of strip club or a brothel.
 Also linked to this abuse that I felt when I stepped in here.

583
01:02:33,714 --> 01:02:43,407
It is that, this happened and it became a scandal.
 That you were ashamed of this or that you tried to silence it.

584
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:57,917
I feel that in the energy, that you don't talk much about it.
 Then it was really something that you silenced, because it was an important man who gave up on a woman.

585
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,520
And they didn't want to impair his reputation.

586
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,188
I think, we are in a castle, take that power.

587
01:03:05,188 --> 01:03:13,793
And it also goes together with what I knew first, I think it was down in the basement, when I saw tape over my mouth.
 That you become silent.

588
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:22,382
It was certainly then that the women were silenced, they would be silent.
 So as not to impair men's status.

589
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:31,117
Just look at how the castle is designed here, soldiers and things were on the outside, in wooden places behind a wall.

590
01:03:31,117 --> 01:03:35,660
The horses were at the far end of the yard and had their own stables, certainly heat ...

591
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,249
Now I saw it again ....

592
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:43,477
I saw it again, a ball of light or ...

593
01:03:47,204 --> 01:03:49,670
Now someone took hold of my West.

594
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:51,420
Pulled behind it or?

595
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,360
I backed back, I thought I got stuck in something first.

596
01:03:57,563 --> 01:04:06,261
What we can see is that Mel Meter on the right side of Nicla's chest goes up as it is stuck.

597
01:04:06,261 --> 01:04:09,750
It went like a bow like that.

598
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:10,615
Against me?

599
01:04:10,615 --> 01:04:14,390
Yes, though behind, I thought it was more against the wall.

600
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,785
That was cool.

601
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,337
This event that took place here, which you tried to silence ....

602
01:04:25,876 --> 01:04:28,984
Is it the woman who is here now?

603
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:37,927
Now it is touch, there was someone who pulled a little in the sweater.
 Now maybe that happens ...

604
01:04:37,927 --> 01:04:43,713
Is it the woman who is here now?
 Which is trying to get redress.

605
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:48,265
Show yourself!

606
01:05:03,543 --> 01:05:09,213
It was a little neighbor there, very much there.
 It's a picture of a woman on the wall there too.

607
01:05:09,213 --> 01:05:10,685
Right.

608
01:05:14,265 --> 01:05:20,836
It was really interesting, when you start rooting a little in it so ...

609
01:05:22,268 --> 01:05:27,708
Should we go out to the yard?
 And try to look up at Lucie Tower?
 And this dungeon.

610
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:28,966
If we see something.

611
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:38,316
Something light phenomenon or something moving in the window.
 Because it has also been a guard who went down the stairs, who went up to a person's car and knocks on it

612
01:05:38,316 --> 01:05:45,059
And the person gets completely dear, then a soldier from a long time ago goes back up the stairs and disappears.

613
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:51,563
We stand out here, in this history, we have the stable behind.
 And we must not go into this building huh?

614
01:05:51,858 --> 01:05:53,933
It is because of racial risk.

615
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:56,366
You see how the roofs have collapsed.

616
01:05:56,366 --> 01:06:01,416
We were out here earlier today, you and Lennie would go up to the tower with the owner.

617
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:07,260
Then there will be a stone from the roof and we call for Lennie move on you!
 And then, right next to him ...

618
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:11,702
And it happened over there.
 Right where they have seen this soldier walking up and down.

619
01:06:12,846 --> 01:06:20,000
It was really like you are not going to the tower.
 It could have come stone over there and it is roof tiles that release.

620
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,490
This is very interesting.

621
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:32,624
And up here is Lucie Tower.
 And up there in the hallway there we were watching.
 And there in the dungeon she passed away.

622
01:06:34,728 --> 01:06:37,918
We hear something going in the gravel

623
01:06:37,918 --> 01:06:42,106
There was something that went there.
 Stand still..

624
01:06:47,605 --> 01:06:48,917
Someone went here.

625
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,661
Yes, someone went there.

626
01:06:50,661 --> 01:06:52,051
Wonder if you can hear horse hovers, I just thought.

627
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:53,110
Right!

628
01:06:54,772 --> 01:07:01,231
It sounded just like horses.
 Like something went here.

629
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:07,763
Should we go towards this staircase?
 We look at it.

630
01:07:17,948 --> 01:07:24,120
Up there came the stone.
 Was hit Lennie in the head.

631
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:32,122
It feels like someone is looking at us in that window.
 The second window there.

632
01:07:32,122 --> 01:07:39,357
That someone is just standing there looking at us.
 It's not something I see but I just feel it.

633
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:43,951
Can you throw something if you're out here with us now?

634
01:07:43,951 --> 01:07:52,499
It was above that window that it fell?
 From the stupid there.

635
01:08:19,217 --> 01:08:30,189
Being able to investigate a castle is always special.
 And gaining access to this magical castle ChÃ¢teau de Veauce in France is few to be found.

636
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:42,825
Who is the woman moving to the bottom floor that Niclas sees in the water?
 Is it the same woman laughing and who Wilma senses?

637
01:08:42,825 --> 01:08:50,604
Yes, a woman standing there in the water!
 I only saw the contours, this white you talked about.
 She stood there in the water.

638
01:08:50,604 --> 01:09:04,991
Everything we experience is not paranormal, but the reactions can initially be so.
 For example, we really thought we saw a shadow, until we realize that it is a bat that makes the shade down in the basement.

639
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:10,486
Then we can analyze this.
 If it was a bat that looked over the edge.

640
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:18,018
In the remaining parts of the castle, it was difficult to communicate with what many have known.

641
01:09:19,347 --> 01:09:38,120
We really tried to get a glimpse of castle the ghost Lucie who wanders between the two towers, but despite attempts to document her in several ways, she did not want to prove to us this time.
