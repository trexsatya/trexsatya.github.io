00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
What does the investment climate look like for unlisted companies?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,360
And how do it go-

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,440
-Klar CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's investment company Flat Capital-

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,400
-which, among other things, invested in Open AI where it has been messy lately.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,360
We will talk about that in today's EFN market. Welcome.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29.640
-Welcome Hanna Wachtmeister. -Thanks. Fun to be here.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,200
Fun to have you here. You are CEO of the investment company Flat Capital.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,640
Today we will talk about trends and the investment climate for mainly unlisted companies.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,040
But also about flat capital, of course. We start there.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,880
What is Flat Capital for companies?

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55.720
Flat Capital is listed since 2021. A small investment company-

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00.800
-What is checked and owned mainly by Sebastian and Nina Siemiatkowski.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,520
-It started ... -klar -founder and CEO.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,800
Good. You get stuck in who they are ...

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,920
Nina and Sebastian with their entrepreneurial travel were given the opportunity to invest-

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,200
-In other entrepreneurs around 2013, when Flat Capital saw their first light.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,000
They began to invest in, among other things, budbee, or today Instabe, and Truecaller.

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,320
Can you tell us a little more about your strategy and why are you focusing on unlisted companies?

19
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48.560
Our strategy has its basis very much in mainly Sebastian's experiences-

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,440
-When I was in. Brief

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00.560
-They we believe that an interesting return profile is-

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,920
-In the opportunity to be long -term. Being a long -term investor in companies.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,080
Because it takes time to build companies. Not four years.

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,120
Klarna ... Sebastian has been holding on for 18 years. And will last for another 18 years.

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,400
Building good companies takes time.

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,200
And do you have a fund structure that is common in the unlisted world-

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,920
-If the funds often have a lifetime, they are built up.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,760
And there is a possible conflict in how you build companies and maximize value-

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,960
-Man between if you are a "venture capital"-investor-

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,120
-or if you can be with the whole trip.

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,280
We try to be long -term. We do not take a lot of charges-
