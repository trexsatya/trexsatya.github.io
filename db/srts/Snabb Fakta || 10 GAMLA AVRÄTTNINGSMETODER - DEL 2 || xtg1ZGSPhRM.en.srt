1
00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:10.850
Then we are

2
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.566
Back with ten old execution as methods from the past.

3
00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:17.450
Part two.

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't forget to look at part one afterwards.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.066
Link can be found in the description.

6
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.066
But now we jump in right away.

7
00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.433
Number 1: Brass bull

8
00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:33.533
The brass bulls were manufactured during ancient Greece

9
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.066
and used as a torture and execution tool.

10
00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.433
It was a device shaped like a hollow bull,

11
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.666
Made of bronze or by brass.

12
00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:48.983
The punished person was locked inside the bull through a gap in the side.

13
00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.066
Then you lit a fire under the bull.

14
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.800
When the metal got hot, the person would

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.650
Inside slowly roasted alive.

16
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.150
The bull was designed in a way where one had made holes in the bull's mouth

17
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.083
or in the nostrils and when the punished screamed in there the sound came

18
00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:12.616
out of there and distorted it to a sound similar to a bull

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.966
Beeing ..

20
00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:26.216
Number 2: Gillotin.

21
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.650

22
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.350
that consisted of two large vertical rails and a large heavy

23
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.433
Blade placed at the top, also called car.

24
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:41.933
The penalty's head was placed in a bracket and then

25
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:46.283
If you dropped down the blade which then cut off the head from the body.

26
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.033
It was important that the blade was angled so that it created a

27
00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.733
Cutting movement over the neck.

28
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:56.366
If the blade was straight then it could happen that it punished

29
00:01:56.366 --> 00:02:00.500
The person only broke his neck and was still alive.

30
00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:05.116
Number 3: Poena Cullei

31
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.283
Pena Cullei was

32
00:02:07.283 --> 00:02:10.283
a punishment used in ancient rum.

33
00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:16.283
The punished person would be placed inside a sack along with different animals,

For example, a snake, a dog and a monkey.

35
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.600
Then they tied the bag together

36
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.600
and threw it in a lake or in the sea.

37
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.050
The person fought for his life inside the sack at the same time as it

38
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.150
Got to fight panicked animals that also tried to save themselves.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.466

43
00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:52.466
Usually while the person was still alive.

44
00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:56.333
It was an extremely painful and horrific execution

45
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.400
method that often led to shock,

46
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.566
blood loss and finally death.

49
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.933
was a horrible execution method used during the Middle Ages.

50
00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:15.800
The punished person was tied on to a platform

51
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.766
Or in a chair with a cage placed over the stomach.

52
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.216
Then they placed starved rats in the cage

53
00:03:23.483 --> 00:03:28.916
and by heat it up from the outside, the rats were forced to gnaw

54
00:03:28.916 --> 00:03:34.283
And scratch through the person's body in a desperate attempt to escape.

55
00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:38.866
The rats bit and tore through the body on the punished person

56
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.300
Until it finally died.

57
00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:50.566
Number six walled.

58
00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:55.816
The punished person was walled in live stone for stone

59
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.166
and then left there to die by either thirst or by hunger,

60
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.566
Which could take several days and sometimes weeks.

61
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.200

The punished person was stuck between

65
00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:25.366
two boats, usually completely naked, where the head,

66
00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:28.800
The arms and legs stuck out from the sides of the boat.

70
00:04:41.783 --> 00:04:44.516
Which would attract insects.

71
00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:46.616
One could also pour honey on it

72
00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:49.816
punished the person's body to attract more insects.

73
00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:53.700

00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:03.500
This created smelly infections as they ate up their flesh,

76
00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:07.916
Which led to a slow and painful death.

77
00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:13.133
Number 8: Crushing

78
00:05:13.816 --> 00:05:16.700

You are executed by being crushed.

80
00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:24.616
It usually meant that a heavy object, such as a large stone,

81
00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:28.766
was placed on the chest or on the stomach of the punished person.

00:05:33.983 --> 00:05:36.233
And maybe another one.

84
00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:40.516

was a method of execution from China abolished in 1905.

97
00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:31.500
The punished person was tied to a wooden pile in a public place.

98
00:06:32.066 --> 00:06:35.300
Then you put small cuts on the body a little here and there.

99
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.066
The cuts were random with different depths and different lengths.

100
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.550
Sometimes you could start putting the cuts on one arm

101
00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:48.683
Cross and right and right and left until it finally fell off.

102
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.100
Then they continued over the rest of the body.

103
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.866
A very slow and painful death

104
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.616
If you were merciful.

105
00:06:57.616 --> 00:07:00.600
Did you put the first incision in the throat

106
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.800
so that the punished person died faster.

107
00:07:06.266 --> 00:07:09.266
