1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,760
When you listen to music-

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,400
-Tare your heart rhythm to the pace of music.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22.560
The music can touch in the same way that the human hand can touch us.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,840
Scientists try to understand how music affects our body and brain-

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,080
-To improve our health.

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120
My name is Eva Bojner Horwitz-

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,040
-And I work here as a professor of music and health.

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,840
At the Royal Academy of Music, the research team collaborates with Karolinska-

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
-to understand how the music affects us-

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01.720
-And what benefit the music plays.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06.040
We are interested in the effects of the music.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,280
We want to understand how to buffer against different types of stress reactions-

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,760
-But also see what we can strengthen.

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,920
How is the body affected by different genres, tempo, rhythm, pulse?

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,040
What the researchers have been able to show through various experiments-

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,000
-Is that the body and brain are like a tuning fork.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,040
The music not only puts our emotions rocking.

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,120
It also triggers a number of biological reactions in the body.

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52.840
Pulse, respiratory rate, hormones ...

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Even the bowel movements are affected.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01.040
It is very interesting with these study-

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,720
-Where we see that after operational procedures, at the awakening ...

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,360
The patients who have been allowed to choose which music they want to wake up to-

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,640
-can get an increased activity of oxytocin, a calm and ro-rush-

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,240
-Imme with those patients who have not been listened to music.

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,680
Music can calm but also stimulate blood circulation.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Good for avoiding complications during surgery.

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,920
It stimulates the brain at e.g. Dementia and stroke.

29
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
When the music meets ear-

30
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,000
-and reaching the brain's sorting center, thalamus-

31
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05.080
-There the signals go two roads.

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,320
The first one quickly goes down to the reaction part, amygdala.

33
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,760
That part of the brain belongs to the limbic system.

34
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,920
It is usually called the emotional brain.

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,840
Amygdala controls the autonomic nervous system.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,640
Music can raise pulse and alertness and set the body to activity-

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:34,320
-Or so the music can send signals that lower heart rate and heartbeat.

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,320
Signals that have been found early in human development.

39
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,960
In the cave we need to pay attention to life -threatening sounds.

40
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,520
But also the fire, the heat, the touch that creates peace and quiet.

41
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,080
The second way goes slow-

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57.560
-And leads up to the cerebral cortex and frontal lobe.

43
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,360
There, the music is interpreted by reason.

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,960
The music is linked to memories and deeper feelings.

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,000
Here the reward system may activate-

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,040
-We signal substances such as dopamine that give strong, positive emotions.

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,480
And oxytocin that provides calm and quiet feelings.

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,120
This is intricate.

49
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,160
There is no music that everyone responds to, the same way.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,640
The impact of music can give many kinds of physical reactions.

51
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,200
The researchers have just begun to understand the mechanisms behind the influence of music.

52
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,080
Next step: Map how the music can be used to diagnose health.

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,880
What is exciting is that our bodies give us pre-signals.

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04.040
There are orchestras in our bodies that we can tone to, read ...

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09.600
We might be able to read warning signals on stress much earlier-

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,840
-Do that we train ourselves in music listening.
