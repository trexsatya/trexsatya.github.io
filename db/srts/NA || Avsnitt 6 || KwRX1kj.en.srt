00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.080
Willy lives in this box.

2
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
It's my best friend.

3
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.400
It is a rice cake.

4
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.600
Oh, fuck!

5
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.040
Date: 2002–11–15.

6
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Male, about 30 years, white, Caucasian origin.

7
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.440
Medium length, slightly overweight, lost muscles ...

8
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.560
... incipient flint, heavily soiled nails.

9
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.000
He has apparently lost control of gastrointestinal function.

10
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.800
Personal listing: You lose faith in humanity when you look like that.

11
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.240
The decay process has apparently been going on for a long time.

12
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.000
For God's sake - I'm trying to work.

13
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.680
There is some bastard who has bitten Willy.

14
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.560
Now they will close the post here as well.
 Is there anything worse than the post office?

15
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.560
Chernobyl.

16
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.680
-Sorry.
 Was it warm?
 - Scolding.

17
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.440
- We have to lower the heat.
 - Now it gets even warmer.

18
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.280
It is dear.

19
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.960
You seem to be quite clean in your hair.
 We don't have to wash it.

20
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.120
Be so good and in the chair over there.

21
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.960
So you were relegated from Yvon Holm Hair Academy ...?

22
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.640
- It was so ridiculous.
 - It was one of my test customers.

23
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.240
She claimed that she had a reduced sight since I had cut her.
 Bullshit!

24
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.240
- She was blind to the eye before.
 -Certainly.
 You saw that.

25
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.200
And you?

26
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.080
Old man ...!

27
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.720
- What did it take to her?
 - She had such an Ossis.

28
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.400
One of her test customers died.
 Excuse me...

29
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.000
Hello?
 May I help you?

30
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.360
With male voice: Hello.
 Sir, I'm a woman.

31
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.080
Do you want to know the Meaning of Life?

32
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.240
-You have to navigate in a countryscape.
 - Can I Ask You ...

33
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.680
--Is your TV set going?
 –Yes, it's going very well.

34
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.880
Tie it!

35
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.360
-Hello?
 -Ouch!

36
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.680
- Have you hurt yourself?
 -Ouch!

37
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.640
Hello.
 I lay here in the bath and relaxed ...

38
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.120
Suddenly I got pissed off and relieved the pressure.

39
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.080
-In the bathtub?
 God, be 'disgusting!
 -Yes is not it?

40
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.440
It hurt a lot.
 Suddenly I kissed my kidney stones.

41
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.440
Oh God...!
 It must have hurt terribly!

42
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.320
Yes.
 And I don't know ...

43
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.360
What do you do with such a thing?
 Can you have it as an ornamental thing?

44
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.960
Yes.

45
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.400
I want the hair that Kajsa Bergqvist has it.
 Do you know, then?

46
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.920
Absolutely!
 She is very nice in her hair.

47
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.440
-Ouch!
 -Sorry!

48
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.840
I was a little spent.
 There is nothing visible.

49
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.000
- It bleeds.
 -No problem.
 Sit still.

50
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.720
-Take it away!
 - I should burn the wound.

51
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.480
-It works.
 - I know, but pick up a patch.

52
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.200
Well, damn ...!

53
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.760
-Serve something that is worse than P-fines.
 - Relief cancer.

54
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.640
Thanks, please Ingvar.
 You were the best plot we've had.

55
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:11.280
It was fun.
 You can jokingly say: being the plot is like anal sex.

56
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.480
You penetrate a smoke -filled opening and empty your bag.

57
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.520
Okay.
 Bye.

58
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:41.280
Thanks.
 I need to drink hot.
 I have a sore throat.
 I have a cold.

59
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:51.800
It's hard when it runs.
 I've got ... Witch milk.

60
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.720
Men can get it.
 Milk -like liquid that comes out of the breasts.

61
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.680
- Milk out of the nipples?
 - A milk -like liquid.

62
00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.040
When I stimulate the nipple ...

63
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.440
Oh!

64
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.600
Yes, it's hard.
 It fixes no brides.

65
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.760
No, but I'm trying to see it positively.

66
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.160
You can have it as a party trick.
 It breaks the ice.

67
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.320
- Is it good with tea at sore throat?
 -Yes.
 And I stood for the milk.

68
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:47.360
I wanted to look like Kajsa Bergqvist!
 She doesn't look like this!

69
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.000
- Lite she looks.
 -No!

70
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.080
If she had cut herself here, so ... it will be SEK 350.

71
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:06.040
- I can sue you.
 Damn pussy!
 - We say 300 evenly, then.

72
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.120
This takes hours.
 My wife who has dinner ...

73
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.600
Is there anything worse than an angry girl in the house?

74
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.600
Termites.

75
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.040
Half the plate should always consist of vegetables.

76
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.960
You can choose exactly what you want.

77
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.480
This should be for people with weight problems.
 Only me is fat!

78
00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.200
- Now we talk about our vegetables.
 - Then I have a question.

79
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.920
- Is a biscuit chocolate a vegetable?
 -No.

80
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:54.120
A composite meal should consist of carbohydrates, proteins and vegetables.

81
00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:00.280
- carbohydrates are pasta, rice, potatoes.
 - Then I have a question.

82
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.880
If you do not lose weight you get the money back?

83
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:12.440
I have gained weight since I started.
 I have to get compensation!

84
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.520
- Have you gone down?
 -A little.

85
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:22.480
- You have never been fat.
 - Now we return to our plate.

86
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.840
- Two cooked potatoes ... - Do you get mazarin for the coffee then?

87
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.880
If you would like a mazarin for the coffee, you can always save points.

88
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:44.360
- Three glass of wine corresponds to a mazarin.
 - Three tubs wine for a nasty mazarin!

89
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.520
- Needs have no law ... - you can exercise - it helps.

90
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.680
I'll have a mazarin!

91
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.440
What are you looking at, fucking anorectic?!

92
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.200
Hello, Elsa-Britta.
 Now I am here.

93
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.040
NEMS LOOK!

94
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:28.480
Isn't it the home service with his pile and rosy cheeks?

95
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:35.440
- Yes, here I am.
 - Now, little friend, you should help me.

96
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:42.680
There is a package of Topz.
 And there hangs a crystal chandelier.

97
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:49.440
Take a topz and polish the crystal chandelier really well.

98
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:56.960
- I did this last week.
 - Dustrious, yes.
 Now you get another chance.

99
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.600
Now I have to say.
 I do not have time.

100
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:08.480
I will visit many today.
 Many people can't even get out of bed.

101
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:16.880
Lord Jesus, say as it is - that you wish I was dead!

102
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.720
Don't say so, Elsa-Britta.
 Obviously I don't want you to die

103
00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.160
Go, you.
 Just go!
 I'll probably do this, you will see.

104
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.960
No, Elsa-Britta ...

105
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.200
- I just go up here ... - no, it is not possible ...

106
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.440
I have to do it.
 You fall and hit you.

107
00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.800
There you go!

108
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.800
Clean it properly.
 If it breaks, you will do with me!

109
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.440
-Have you understood?
 -Yes I understand.

110
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:19.240
I love this person.
 Look!
 I love him.

111
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.720
-We made the Asia trip as planned.
 - Walked in the Himalayas?

112
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.520
We flew to Sri Lanka and went on an elephant safari - in unexplored jungle.

113
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:58.560
Imagine your early morning, the animals come to life ... the sounds, the scents ...

114
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:05.760
- We were at High Chaparral this summer.
 - It's not much to talk about.

115
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.240
No, but it was a great experience.

116
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.800
Big Bengt has built up an authentic western city.

117
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.600
Bank, Saloon, Sheriff's office - all!

118
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.160
Magnus, can you just go and rent an elephant and ride out in the jungle?

119
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.120
We did not ride ourselves - we had an elephant driver.

120
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.640
Incredibly skilled.
 He ruled the elephant with small movements.

121
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.680
Rodeon at High Chaparral is fascinating.

122
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:54.400
The riders must have a hand in the air all the time.
 It's full roll!

123
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.880
And the horse does everything to throw the rider.

124
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.040
- Tell the Himalayas.
 - The flight in Nepal is not so good?

125
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.000
CRY

126
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:17.000
So it is if you want to come to the unique places.

127
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:23.080
When we went to High Chaparral, we have to change trains in Alvesta.

128
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.480
- A time wait.
 - You can show the prayer wool?

129
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.520
We were in a Buddhist temple 4,000 m above sea level.

130
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.240
There Magnus bought this prayer wool from an old monk.

131
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:45.000
We also bought some stuff on the "chapp".

132
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:52.480
Unnecessary, Kristina thought, but I thought it was fun to have.

133
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:59.000
- Hands up, man!
 - Check those signs.

134
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.560
Yiiiha!
 I'm Big Bengt.

135
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.720
- This writing is not used today.
 - hand up.

136
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.120
I'll blow your hate off.

137
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.040
I'm gonna kill you.

138
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.640
It's just for fun, Kristina.

139
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.400
Huh?
 What are you saying?

140
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:39.280
Ulf is lying.
 We haven't been to High Chaparral.

141
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.680
We haven't been there.

142
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
That's true, what Kristina says.

143
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.240
I've been lying here tonight.

144
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.480
We have never been to High Chaparral.

145
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:16.120
We have lived on a lie.
 We haven't even been to Småland.

146
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.920
But one day, honey ... we're going there.
 I promise you.

147
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.320
Ouch ouch ouch!

148
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.480
The Indians have shot me.
 Indian devils.
 Call 90,000.

149
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.240
I'm bleeding.
 Ouch ouch ouch.

150
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.360
Surely the discount attracts many from the university?

151
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:29.000
Yes.
 Researchers are better as customers in terms of creative freedom.

152
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.800
That's how it is.
 You trust our expertise.

153
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.280
If we say you are good looking, you trust it.

154
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.600
- You have to trust people.
 -Yes is not it?

155
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.760
-OUCH!
 - Wanting, was it too hot?

156
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.960
- It was probably a little hot.
 - Then we take it a little colder ...

157
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:58.880
- You were together with a scientist?
 - The bear.
 He was an economist.

158
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:05.160
He never cared about what he looked like in his hair.

159
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.840
He didn't want me to cut him.
 What I was joking!

160
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.600
In the end he gave with him.

161
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.640
Old man ...!

162
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:29.280
- Doesn't she get well?
 - It's a bit sensitive ... Jörgen died.

163
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:35.800
Very boring.
 So!
 Then you can sit in the chair.

164
00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.160
Brokers and rock stars are allowed to go ahead in the queue.
 But never sweeter!

165
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.520
Some teach their children to be afraid of sweeteners.

166
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.840
- Have any profession worse "cred" than sweethearts?
 -Executioner.

167
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.280
I'm glad you came, Kristina.
 I can not live without you.

168
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.120
I have missed you so much.
 I do not get it...

169
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.640
I do anything for you to come back.

170
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:33.200
Say what you want me to do, I do.

171
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.680
Then I want you to cancel the cable TV subscription.

172
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.600
Then we get the evenings together without football.

173
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.200
If you want it, I can terminate cable TV.

174
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.320
Yes.

175
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.480
-Okay.
 -Good.

176
00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:02.760
It can be difficult - it is a year's notice period.

177
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:09.680
Telling it out now, we will be rid of it in a year.

178
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:16.360
I terminate Viasat Sport, and then we keep Canal Plus.

179
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:20.520
It's much more than just football.

180
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.280
But huh, damn, Kristina!
 Why did you just choose cable TV?

181
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.240
I had to choose anything.

182
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:40.640
Because I love you.
 I didn't think you would turn it to me.

183
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.080
It depends on ... Kristina ...

184
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.360
What do you work with?

185
00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:02.000
I prepare an experiment that we will do in a particle accelerator.

186
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:08.160
- Do you feel for quantum physics?
 - I forgot everything from high school.

187
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:12.680
We have many medicines here.

188
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.680
- We take 175 for them.
 - Well, do they have an extra discount?

189
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.600
Yes, they can put on themselves.

190
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.200
Now it's finished.
 So there it was.

191
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.920
It got good in the neck too.
 Then I thank you for that.

192
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.720
–200.
 - So it was said ... be so good.

193
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:58.880
Now you are soon on the run again.
 Is there anything that spikes up more than coffee?

194
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.840
BEEP

195
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.920
THE DOORBELL RINGS

196
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.520
Hello.
 I'm so sorry to wake you up.

197
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.000
In just Felt so lost and in needed some support.

198
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.000
I'm Lost in the Material World.

199
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.640
What do I do to become a good human being?

200
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:12.880
You have to learn how to navigate in a countryscape.

201
00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.600
I'm so sorry, she is so ... material.

202
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.080
Are you sleeping?

203
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.240
Are you sleeping?

204
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.080
-Did you sleep?
 -Yes.

205
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.880
It was nothing special.
 We'll take it tomorrow.

206
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.160
SVT program text: Ulla Zedigh Brenner

207
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:23.080
- I am going on a weekend now.
 Have a good one.
 - Can I borrow your rubber chicken?

208
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.800
Take it.
 See you on Monday.
