1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,353
- Whole thing?
- Whole thing.

2
00:00:01,353 --> 00:00:03,009
Oh my God. 1, 2, 3.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,675
It tastes like uncooked pasta.

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,220
4 out of 5.

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,309
I'm not in the frame.

6
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,780
Zero!

7
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:15,138
- Zero!
- Zero!

8
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:25,645
Hey, hey!

9
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:30,991
Today we are trying candy
from Portugal!

10
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:38,005
Many have asked for this particular video
since we moved here.

11
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:42,476
We have actually made one before.

12
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,412
A really long time ago.

13
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:49,758
You had been on a work trip to Madeira
and brought some candy home.

14
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,371
Yes.

15
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:54,943
Since moving here, we've noticed that
that wasn't typical Portuguese candy.

16
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,290
- No.
- No.

17
00:00:56,424 --> 00:01:00,494
So, today we will give you
candy that's typical for Portugal.

18
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,373
- Well, we will give it to ourselves.
- We will try it, quite simply.

19
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,364
- Yay! Shall we begin?
- Yes!

20
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,503
"Flocos de Neve"

21
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:18,001
It's hard candies in a red wrapper, and they're white.
"Flocos de Neve" means "snowflakes".

22
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:23,191
No, Laura. You can't eat that.
Not yet.

23
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:30,463
Laura has a piece of apple
while the rest of us try candy.

24
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:33,936
- Ready?
- Yes.

25
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,271
Let's go.

26
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:43,336
- It's good.
- Mhm, it is.

27
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:49,211
- A bit of a floral taste.
- Yes, a fruity taste.

28
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:57,030
- Wait, how does a flower taste?
- Good question. I know how flowers smell, though.

29
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:09,207
- Laura likes her apple.
- She's, like: "Apple is yummier than candy."

30
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:16,663
We give each candy we try between 1 to 5 points.
Who wants to go first?

31
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:22,313
I do. I give this little hard candy...

32
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:25,679
...4 out of 5 points.

33
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:30,999
- Oh, how high!
- It was really good.

34
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:34,667
I give it 3 points.

35
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:45,003
I give it 2 points. I wouldn't buy it, but it's perfectly okay
if I'd get it for free at, like, a bank.

36
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:47,501
At a bank?

37
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:53,458
- Isn't that where they offer free hard candies?
- You're right. A bunch of these in a big glass bowl.

38
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,511
- I think I'll change mine to 3 points too.
- Okay.

39
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:03,217
I also give it 3 strong points.
It was good, but... one or two is enough.

40
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:06,320
- "Bank-y".
- Good, but "bank-y."

41
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:10,491
If you notice that the light changes...

42
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:14,687
- I'm not in the frame.
- Now you are in frame.

43
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:22,503
...it's because the sun is setting, and we are trying to
make the lighting be the same throughout the video.

44
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:28,075
It might change a little here and there.
Hope you can stand it.

45
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,297
Sorry about that.

46
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,008
"Regina's Chocolate Umbrella"

47
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:35,762
This is what it looks like
inside the paper.

48
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:41,302
It doesn't seem to rain much in Portugal.
This is their definition of umbrellas.

49
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:43,642
- Shall we?
- Yes.

50
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,794
- I still have the other candy.
- What?!

51
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,808
- You still have the other one?
- Here.

52
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,730
- But I...
- Oh!

53
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:59,807
That's the crazy corner over there.
I don't know what they're doing. I've already tasted it.

54
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,086
Here we go.

55
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:10,684
- I need more! I need more!
- It tastes like the chocolate in advent calendars.

56
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,953
- Yes.
- Exactly like it.

57
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,206
- Pretty good.
- A bit better than that.

58
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:19,293
I agree. Like Milko, or...

59
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:24,766
- Milka!
- Milka is better than this one, though.

60
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,337
I like that you don't have to hold the chocolate.
You have this little handle.

61
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,066
Yeah, that was nice.

62
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,244
It's like a chocolate lollipop.

63
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,514
What are you doing?

64
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:48,001
He's shooting me with the umbrella.
A candy that can be used in many ways.

65
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:54,324
I like the aftertaste of this one,
so I give it 5 points.

66
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:58,103
- 5 points?
- What?! 5 out of 5?

67
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:06,500
I give it 2 points.
I wish it was a little more fun.

68
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:14,316
- Sorry, Laura is so funny. She's, like...
- She's singing into her microphone.

69
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,913
- She's, like: "Is this thing on?"
- She's stealing our show.

70
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:27,688
- How many points do you give it?
- 3 points. The chocolate is good, and I like the umbrella thing.

71
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:30,154
I also give it 3 points.

72
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:32,621
"Gelatina Banana" 

73
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:40,143
It's a jiggly dessert-like... jello.
Is that's what it is?

74
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:41,476
Yes. Jello. 

75
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:44,011
It comes in a bunch of different flavors.

76
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:53,300
It tastes like mallow banana,
but in a different form.

77
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,542
- Mm.
- Yes.

78
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,059
- But not as sweet.
- No.

79
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:00,956
But a bit worse.

80
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:05,609
- Laura really wants some.
- Do you want a little taste?

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,759
- She didn't get any.
- Was it good?

82
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,508
She got a little lick.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,010
It really tastes like it's for kids.

84
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:21,682
I feel like this is what you get
at a bad children's party.

85
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,908
- "At a bad children's party."
- "Here you go, instead of cake. Eat up."

86
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,555
Okay, then we won't serve these.

87
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:34,529
- Harry, you have a history of liking these jello things.
- Yes, but this wasn't my jello.

88
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:39,131
Not your jello, no.
There's a difference between jello and jello.

89
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,001
Yeah.

90
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:46,861
- I give it 1 point.
- Me too. 1 point.

91
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:51,512
- 0 out of 0.
- I also give it a 0.

92
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,610
"Pipocas Doces"

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,712
It's sweet popcorn.

94
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,119
Oh, how sweet.

95
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:07,361
- Quite good.
- No.

96
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:10,569
- I prefer salty popcorn.
- Me too.

97
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:14,067
- I've never understood this.
- Sweet popcorn? No.

98
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,136
I understand it.

99
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:18,175
- You like it?
- Yeah.

100
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,185
I give it 3 out of 5 points.

101
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:28,029
I give it 1.8 out of 5.

102
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,506
- Oh. Okay. 
- Specific.

103
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:36,523
- I give it zero points.
- I also give it zero...

104
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,026
- Zero!
- Zero!

105
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,453
What is it you two do?
Zero!

106
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,032
Zero! Zero!
Everything is zero!

107
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,582
- Laura's just, like...
- Pipita's head is zero!

108
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,356
- She doesn't understand a thing.
- No.

109
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:51,079
Her eyes are zero.

110
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:53,017
"Tiras Ácidas"

111
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:57,757
It's sour little gummy candies
in different colors.

112
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,355
- It's not that sour.
- No.

113
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,353
There's sugar on it.

114
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,729
It tastes like uncooked pasta.

115
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:16,196
- It's the same texture.
- Very boring texture.

116
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:23,003
I mean...
This feels like a candy... that parents buy-

117
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:30,010
-when their child is having a masquerade party
where they're dressing up as, like, princesses and Batmans.

118
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:33,971
Then this is the candy
that's in the candy bags.

119
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:38,945
- I give it 2 points.
- I give it 3 points.

120
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:45,534
- I give it 2 points.
- It was yucky and worthless. I give it zero...

121
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:50,286
Zero! Zero, zero, zero!

122
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,548
"Bem Me Quer"

123
00:08:52,835 --> 00:09:00,245
It's chocolate pralines...
filled with liqueur.

124
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:07,929
- Laura had enough and wanted to sit with me instead.
- I think she wanted to sit with anyone, just not in her chair.

125
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:12,519
No. She only wanted to sit with me
because I'm calm and secure.

126
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:20,027
I'm sure she'll want to get down on the floor soon and cause havoc.
We'll see how long she can stand sitting here.

127
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,030
She'll be like King Kong

128
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,166
Are you ready?
King Kong...

129
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:27,192
I'm ready.

130
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,802
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready.

131
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,101
- The whole thing?
- The whole thing.

132
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:33,212
Oh my God. 1, 2, 3...

133
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:36,837
You're cheating!

134
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:42,754
- Look at Alma. She did the Scream mouth.
- Mmm, how good.

135
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,060
What are you doing?

136
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:07,607
Don't run around and spit.

137
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:13,146
- I had to...
- It's very... liqueury.

138
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,483
- A lot of spirits.
- It just poured out.

139
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:23,023
Yeah. And it's like a cherry in there,
with a bit of chewing resistance.

140
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,818
This is probably
one of the worst ones we've ever tried.

141
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,429
It's non-alcoholic.

142
00:10:33,086 --> 00:10:38,004
- What is this?
- That one was so gross and strong.

143
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,474
- So...
- Who even wants to eat this?

144
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:48,000
Can I just say something?
I feel like you'd have to have, like, a leather tongue to enjoy this.

145
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,245
It's like drinking hand sanitizer.
Yuck! It was so gross.

146
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:58,358
- I give it zero...
- I also give it 0 points.

147
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:01,862
- Zero, zero, zero...
- Zero!

148
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,030
Zero, zero, zero, zero!

149
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:09,127
- The zero choir! The zero choir!
- The zero choir!

150
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,416
We will take a well-deserved break
to answer today's Question of the Day.

151
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:18,512
"Will Hussein..."

152
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:24,634
Oh? You say so?
I agree.

153
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:28,147
"Will Hussein come and visit you in Portugal?"

154
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:32,677
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

155
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:40,200
We really hope so.
We are trying to find a sensible time for him to come.

156
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,262
I have something really fun to tell.
He has taken his...

157
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:46,129
Driver's license!

158
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:50,510
- In Sweden. We are so happy and proud!
- Yes.

159
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,184
Hooray for Hussein!

160
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,898
"Sugus Laranja"

161
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:57,976
It's little fruit chewy candies.

162
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:07,508
- A strong orange flavor.
- Like Maoam.

163
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:15,626
Exactly! Laura is really jealous.
She also wants to try it. She can't.

164
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:22,645
She's, like: "I'm King Kong!"

165
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,492
"I'm King Kong!"

166
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,183
It tastes like any other orange fruit chewy candy.

167
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,778
- Yes.
- Mm.

168
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:37,785
Like the ones you get at a nail salon
when you go with mommy when she has some time off.

169
00:12:37,969 --> 00:12:42,001
I love your descriptions today.

170
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:49,336
The bank and the nail salon.
You've really been all over town.

171
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:54,608
- And at a Batman and princess party.
- Yes. Eating candy everywhere.

172
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:04,177
- Laura thinks we should give out points.
- Okay. I give the orange candy... 2 points.

173
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,414
4 points.

174
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:11,524
I didn't fart.
That was Laura's foot.

175
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,896
- 5 points out of 5!
- Oh, five!

176
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,954
Oh, wow.

177
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,688
I give it 2 points.

178
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:25,665
"Solano Café Espresso"
"Sin azúcar"

179
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,676
It's a small sugar-free coffee hard candy.

180
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:35,015
- This sounds like something for me.
- Mm, indeed.

181
00:13:35,186 --> 00:13:36,349
It smells good.

182
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,020
- No, it smells really gross.
- Oh, it smells like coffee.

183
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:45,333
- Eww, do you two think this smells good?
- Yes, and I don't even like coffee. Here we go.

184
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,860
Yes!

185
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:51,865
- I refuse. I didn't take it!
- Cheater!

186
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:55,335
- Yes. You have to.
- You have to.

187
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,944
It wasn't that bad.

188
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:10,381
A pretty bad flavor.
Like coffee that has been sitting around in a cup.

189
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:14,823
It's probably that it's sugar-free.

190
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:19,025
- It reminds me of the teacher's breath...
- Oh, yuck!

191
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:23,697
...in middle school, when you asked for help.
The teacher came up to you after lunch, like...

192
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:27,367
"Yes, Axel."

193
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,309
You were, like...

194
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:34,073
It tasted like disappointment.

195
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:39,687
I give it 0 points.
0.000001.

196
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:43,516
- Oh!
- 0.01? Okay. 

197
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:47,302
- So, it got some points, at least.
- A little.

198
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,191
I give it 0 points. Not for me.

199
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:57,461
I give it 1 point because it was sugar-free.
It gets a little bonus because of that.

200
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:04,170
- Zero, zero, zero, zero!
- Zero, zero, zero, zero!

201
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,527
Ouch.

202
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:11,845
♪ Alma's face is like a zero!
Look at her face! ♪

203
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:18,518
♪ And her eye is like a zero! And Pipita's, and daddy's
and mine and mommy's! Everything is like a zero! ♪

204
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,520
Help!

205
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:25,420
- Oh, God.
- I don't know what's happening here now.

206
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:28,444
"Dr. Bentes Peitoral"

207
00:15:28,783 --> 00:15:30,864
It's hard candies.

208
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:34,701
- It tastes a little musty.
- I recognize the flavor.

209
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:39,682
- Yes, from another candy.
- It's like a Greek ouzo hard candy.

210
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:43,132
I give it... 

211
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:49,042
Laura definitely has had enough of this.
Shall we try and bite into it?

212
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:52,227
- Yes.
- Okay.

213
00:15:54,258 --> 00:15:57,532
- Ouch, my tooth!
- Did it break?

214
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,359
- Yes.
- What?

215
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:03,317
- It's the same thing inside it.
- Yeah yeah, but your tooth didn't break?

216
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,532
Oh! No.

217
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:10,972
Look at this baby!
This has definitely freaked out. I'm sorry, viewers.

218
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:19,846
You know when you're, like, going with your friend
to their dad's job... and their dad is a broker...

219
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:25,263
It tastes like that hard candy they give you there.
Exactly like it.

220
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,620
- Really boring hard candy.
- Yeah.

221
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,190
- Yuck.
- Yeah. 

222
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,371
- That was the most specific description of a candy... of all.
- Yeah.

223
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:43,147
- I will actually still give it 2 points.
- Oh! I give it 1 point.

224
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,161
- Alma?
- 1 point.

225
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,130
1 point.

226
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,843
That was the last candy for today.

227
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:56,968
The sun is setting outside. Our faces look nice and orange.
Laura is all over the place.

228
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,356
Thank you for watching this video!

229
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:08,689
- Please leave a thumbs up, or down.
- Mostly thumbs up!

230
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:15,503
Comment, ask questions
and take care until next time!

231
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,671
Bye-bye!
