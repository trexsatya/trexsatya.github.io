00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.280
-So there.
 The whole damn house, swine.
 -Jajamän.

3
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.160
So clean that you can transplant a heart or feed a kid here.

5
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.400
-Satan, how tired I am on the rooster!
 -He calms down soon.

6
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.760
He has been wrong for three days, Billy.
 I'm about to lose it soon.

7
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.120
Time for this week's bingo draw.

8
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.160
Satan!
 Bingo!

9
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.480
The next issue is Ingemar 22. two, second.

10
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.400
Four in a row.
 Now damn.
 Come on now, Leffe!

11
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.080
The last number to win the high pressure washer is ...

12
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.440
-... Niklas ... -niklas ...

14
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.080
Now I didn't hear what the hell they said!

15
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.640
Repeat!

16
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.880
-Thanks, and congratulations to the winner.
 -Curse!

17
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400
-How did bingo go?
 -To hell.

18
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.560
That fucking rooster crazy, so you don't know what number to blip in.

19
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.480
I get so damned.
 Look at him.

20
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.440
Black little devil eyes.

21
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.440
I give myself a damn that it lacks soul.
 I have seen this on Discovery.

22
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.880
Soulless animals running around and haunting people.

23
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.480
You get cold corps from the fanfare.

24
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.880
That fucking rooster is driving me crazy.

25
00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.040
Not quiet ever, crazy day and night.
 You can't sleep or be awake.

26
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.480
-I know.
 -We have to do something for him.

27
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.520
I have a plan, Billy.

28
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.960
Should we play the rooster a little splash?

29
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.840
Then he will shit down.

30
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.160
-Heazing, little rooster.
 -We hurry us before the neighbor arrives.

31
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.640
So, the little rooster, now you should taste a little rinse of the system.

32
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.080
So yes.

33
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.960
Hope you get a hefty bowel rinse, rooster.

34
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.600
What a fool.
 Check out, what a chicken brain.

35
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.040
-Take all that, you.
 Hear!
 -Hear!

c. soundtuppen gal

37
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.880
C. sound noise

38
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.320
-What the hell happens?
 I'm afraid.
 -Break, I think.

39
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.640
-Hop out of bed.
 -I do not want to.

40
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800
Jump up, I say!

41
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.080
-Hell!
 -It's someone in the living room.

42
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.720
-Do first, you.
 -No, you have weapons.

43
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.360
This is a classic combat tactic.

44
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.320
You send in the lid.
 Then I come from the periphery and strike.

45
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.320
Okay okay.

46
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.360
-Satan ... are you with?
 -Yes.

47
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.520
One two Three!

48
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.120
Aaahh!

49
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.960
What the hell?
 - Leif, come here!

50
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.320
-What hell ... -fy fuck in hell.

51
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.560
It's crap everywhere.

52
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.920
God damn!

53
00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.480
-As I don't ate you to close?
 -Sorry.
 Take it easy.

54
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.520
Calm?
 Well, that I haven't thought about it before.

55
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.600
We are suitable for now when the house is full of bird diarrhea.
 We're going to bed-

56
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.680
-And watching TV, baking a cake and taking a beer.
 Oh, how cozy and quiet!

57
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.240
Sorry, Leif, but it was actually you who gave him the diarrhea.

58
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.680
Yes, we can clean up here anyway.

59
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.520
What have I said about walking around with the snuff stick and tearing down the furniture?

60
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.160
It is five o'clock, I have morning stands.

61
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.320
But empty that fucking mucus, and stop running around like a horny pig!

62
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.480
You are filled up like a testosterone bucket, it sprays smoke from the ears.

63
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:57.440
But I might want to wait until I get married.
 Unlike others.

64
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.720
c. soundtuppen gal

65
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.480
-I shoot him.
 I take the rifle.
 -Calm now.

66
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.640
What do you think the neighbor says if he finds a lead ball in the rooster?

67
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.640
We can go there for bird knobs or rooster murder.

68
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.000
When they shoot wolves it becomes a damn life.

69
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.960
But Leif, it's not so damn easy to be smart when you can't sleep.

70
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:36.200
-I'm about to go crazy.
 -Do and witness the traps at the swamp.

71
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.360
-Revältorna?
 -Yes.
 See if you find any fox.

72
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.640
-Why?
 -Because I say it.
 Trust me.

73
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.320
Okay.

74
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.200
A living fox.
 Don't kill that bastard.

75
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.880
Satan ... Check out, Leif.

76
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.240
-Oh, damn.
 -Take it calmly, he's aggressive.

77
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.640
Calm down, the fox.
 You get food soon.

78
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.680
Oh, damn.
 I can take him.

79
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.680
c. soundtuppen gal

80
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:40.640
You, now you shut up.
 We're tired of your gaping.
 - Are you ready?

81
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.520
-Drive!
 -Okay, are you with?

82
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.520
One two Three!

83
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:09.080
We invite the police to our meetings, but they do not want to come.

84
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.880
But what the hell ...!

85
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.800
Foxy!

86
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.000
What in all the hell?

87
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.720
Hell!

88
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.920
-Hallå, Tony!
 -What the hell do you want now?

89
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.040
We just wanted to say hello.
 What do you have in the bag?

90
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.600
-A fox.
 -What did you say?
 A fox?

91
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.960
Just.
 I found it in the chicken farm.
 Tuppfan had killed it.

92
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.520
Had the rooster killed a fox?

93
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.080
Just.
 If you walk on the hens, he gets crazy.

94
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.000
Oh, fuck.

95
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.280
There was probably no danger.
 It had scabies, so it might be just as good.

96
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.360
Was it a scabbard that he killed, the rooster?

97
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:14.320
Just.
 It sat in the groin, so it was just as good that it died.
 - Ajök!

98
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.160
-Where is it special?
 -We just wanted to say hello.

99
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.320
-Talk a little.
 -Nice.

100
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.760
Do you want to get in for coffee?
 What good, you are not welcome.
 Hello!

101
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.720
-Damn!
 -A scabbar was the icing on.

102
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.880
-Surely it is scabies?
 -I can't determine it on a straight arm.

103
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.000
You may leave samples.
 Follow here.

104
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.720
You get no help from today's healthcare.

105
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.880
Taxes should be paid, but damn they can help one.

106
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.120
-We don't pay that much tax?
 -And then they don't have to do their job?

107
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.800
The health care should work well, regardless of who pays!

108
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.680
Shit the same.
 What should we do?
 I am scratching the scalp.

109
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.640
We have to clean up the kitchen.

110
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.760
Clear!

111
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.760
Good work.

112
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.560
-But we can't sleep in the kitchen?
 -What then?

113
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.320
If we are going to get rid of the rice, we may well clean ourselves as well.

 -It probably won't work.

117
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:43.040
So attentive.
 Don't you think I see that we have rashes all over the body?

118
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.080
-It's that fucking rooster's fault.
 -I don't know if I can handle more.

119
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.720
Now the measure is raw, Billy.

120
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.600
-Want to drive hard towards hard, so ... -Are you safe?

121
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.960
I'm sure, I'm tired of that spring bag.

122
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.360
Komsi.
 Komsi, the little monster up.

123
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.000
Come then, the little monster up.

124
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.720

-Leif here.
 -I heard a shot.
 Did you hear?

133
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.440
Yes, it's clear as hell, Billy.

134
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.720
-What was it for bangs?
 -I shot the roof fan.

135
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.800
Did you shoot the rooster?

136
00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:01.000
I go to Spain and have sold the hens.
 The rooster cannot be sold.

137
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:07.080
I will enjoy three months in the sun, and avoid you.
 It gets damn nice.

138
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:12.400
-What are you going to do with the yard, then?
 -I'll rent it out.

139
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.360
How nice you are on your face.
 Have you surveyed yourself?
 Really good.

140
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:25.480
-I struggled with a menth dog ... -stir more, I would like to hear.

141
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.640
-You then rent out the yard?
 -Yes.

142
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.480
Fy Satan!

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.160

 -Absolutely.

Hello.
 It was from the health center in Sörbyn.

149
00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.800
We have received your test results.
 It was no vermin.

150
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.680
-What the hell was it, then?
 -Stress rash.
 Have you slept poorly?

151
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.040
-Yes, you can safely say that.
 -I suggest...

152
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:19.120
It is no danger, the problem is solved.
 But thanks anyway.

153
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:26.040
Well, the brother, now I'm going to enjoy a whole night's sleep.
