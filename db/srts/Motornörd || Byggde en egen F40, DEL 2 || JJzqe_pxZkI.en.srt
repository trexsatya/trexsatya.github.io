00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,700
Episode 53
The car is named PLÅTLADY. 
PLÅT = Sheet Metal. 
LADY = Red.

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,920
[IN PREVIOUS EPISODE]
-Tell me, what car is it?
It is a Ferrari F40 replica of a 1988 model.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,840
I build the whole car myself.
I've done everything you see.

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,400
-Hi!
Hello, welcome back.

6
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,820
-Are you ready for episode 2?
Yepp, let's start.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,160
Here is the first Ferrari F40 that was made.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,680
And some pictures of when Ferrari is testing
the F40 in wind tunnel and drives it.

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,000
The first F40 made had five gills.
All the other F40's only have four gills.

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,620
This car was stored at the Ferrari museum for a long time until a famous race driver was allowed to take it.

11
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,880
-Your car is not a Ferrari F40.
No, just to be clear it's a F40.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,300
Just so there will be no misunderstandings.
My car is an F40 and I built as I want it.

13
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,340
Then there is always someone who has opinions.

14
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,280
I like this car and I've build it as I want it.
I wanted one and this is a tribute to an F40.

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,060
I build my own tube frame chassi
and how i did it I will keep for myself.

16
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,720
That will be my secret.
I can show a picture of it but nothing more.

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,380
-Just so people understand
what does a Ferrari F40 cost?

18
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,000
Prices have gone up like all other cars but you
probably have to pay 1 million USD or more.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,260
-Don't we all have 1 million in the bank account?
Well, that something all car mechanics have...

20
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,480
-Wheels, tires & brakes?
There I have chosen 18" OZ racing rims.

21
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,740
Before I switched brakes I had 17"
rims that looked like the original wheels.

22
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,320
But those rims didn't fit when I changed brakes.
-Was the brake caliper too big?

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,420
Yes exactly.
Then I bought 3-piece 18" split rims.

24
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,020
I rebuild the rims so they looks
like having a center bolt.

25
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,560
Since the Ferrari F40 has a center bolt.

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,440
These are the rims that I want but as 18"
I will try to find a couple but need to save money first.

27
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,600
This is from a drag racing car that I bought.
Brake discs are Wilwood and JFZ brake calipers.

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,580
There are large 4-piston calipers.
The brake disc is 330x32 mm so there are thick discs.

29
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,700
I build my own wheel hub.

30
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,980
I have used A-arms as link arms 
both as upper and lower link arms.

31
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,720
Then there are adjustable coilovers
at the front and fixed coilovers at rear.

32
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,640
This is a Porsche 928 caliper and then a
Skoda Octavia RS brake caliper for parking brake.

33
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,340
There is no parking brake on the car
and the Skoda caliper fits well.

34
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:28,740
Brake discs are from the VW Passat from 2010.
Discs are 317x21 mm and fit well on the car.

35
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,620
It's been tricky to get everything together.
It should fit and look good and work.

36
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,680
Much time is spent on what parts to use
and how it should fit together.

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,240
The rear drive shaft consists of
3 different parts from 3 different cars.

38
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,820
When you build with different parts
it becomes very difficult.

39
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,000
-You have done all the windows yourself.
It's not car window glass?

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,860
No, it is 4 mm lexan plastic with splitter film.
It's like a real glass but in plastic.

41
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:14,340
-Have you cut the plastic yourself?
Yes I have done it with angle grinding machine.

42
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,220
-Angle grinding machine, doesn't the plastic melt?
Yes it does, but you have to cut hole smaller and grind.

43
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,680
-Is the windshield also in lexan plastic?
Yes, same as the original Ferrari F40.

44
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,160
I think the Ferrari F40 got glass 
windshield in 1992 but I'm not sure.

45
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,420
I first had a Porsche 928 engine but
it didn't fit well with the gearbox.

46
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,780
I threw it out and put in a
Audi A8 V8 at 4.2 liters instead.

47
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,600
I have been working as an Audi mechanic for 17 years
and I know it's a good engine so I decided to use one.

48
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,760
I know the enigne, 
it's aluminum V8 and does not weigh much.

49
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:08,560
It became much easier to fit the gearbox. 
And I built my own flywheel and clutch.

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,500
-Where did you find this engine?
I bought it from a crashed car in Stockholm.

51
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,460
I know it worked when I picked it up.

52
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,640
I have gone through the engine
and painted some covers.

53
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,000
The engine is silver in the middle but it dosen't
fit this build so I painted it red.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
T04 turbocharger below.

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,880
Both turbos are linked to the weastegate
which are located here.

56
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,780
I have rebuilt the throttle and other stuff.

57
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:49,060
The air for intercoolers comes from the inner shields.

58
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:57,220
Audi race catalyst and with a short exhaust system.
It's just under one meter.

59
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,420
-Have people said anything since you 
have chosen a German engine?

60
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:07,260
Well, there is always someone.
For me it has to be a V8 with double turbo.

61
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,260
-Did you build the chassis for a Porsche engine?
Yes I did.

62
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,300
I had built the chassis for the Porsche 928 engine.

63
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,100
Then I rebuilt the entire rear end and
I made the whole new chassis for this engine.

64
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,000
It's the engine that has been there since the MOT test. 
I haven't done anything with the care since then.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
-Where do you get all the parts?
Online, and I have order new parts over the years.

66
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,760
Race catalyst is from KL-racing.

67
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Oil cooler I had been lying from another
car in the garage which I could use.

68
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,980
Turbos & intercoolers I have bought new.
Intercoolers I bought from KL racing.

69
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,160
The hoses are from do88.

70
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,060
These are santo hoses that I bought here locally.

71
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,260
These clamps are not optimal for turbocharged engine.
Especially with more boost pressure.

72
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,320
-How much boost is it?
Only 0,5 BAR (7.25 PSI) and that's nothing.

73
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,620
-What's the engine for performance?

74
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,880
I do not know. 
I haven't had time to test the performance.

75
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,740
The idea is not to be the fastest car.
It is built for short weekend trips.

76
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:34,380
It will not be fastest and car around on a track.
If I push it to hard it will break.

77
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,180
Basically, I just want to drive without
 having any problem.

78
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,680
The hardest thing has been to 
build the gearbox shift control.

79
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,000
Wires that will guide the backdrop forward 
and tune it with a 6 gears.

80
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,060
I think it has been the most 
difficult thing on the whole car.

81
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,060
There are plenty of holes in the
body that air passes through.

82
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,780
Here comes air through the hose
which will cool down the turbo.

83
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,880
The hot air passes through the grid at the rear.

84
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,900
-Okey, the hot air comes out here.

85
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,580
This is the original Ferrari F40 tail lights
which I ordered from England.

86
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,100
I have built the frames around the lights
and the whole frame with grid.

87
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,540
-What does the tail lights cost?
They cost 500 USD / each.

88
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,040
-You're joking!!
Nope, But it was worth it, they are cheaper now.

89
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:36,920
Think you can buy them now for 300 USD / each.
Or used online but mine are new.

90
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,760
500 USD / each!!!
That's 2000 USD for all four.

91
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:49,300
Yes, all parts I have bought have
made the car quite expensive.

92
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,520
500 USD / each is absolutely crazy!
Yes, everything is so incredibly expensive.

93
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,000
A rear window costs 5600 USD which I can't 
afford so I had to build one myself.

94
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,260
Original side mirrors costs 2600 USD.

95
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:16,520
Wait a minute, does a rear window costs 5600 USD!!??
Yepp, prices for Ferrari parts is crazy.

96
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:24,060
I made a template in masonite which I tense up
to see how big the holes will be.

97
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:30,360
I cut holes and glued with a special glue.

98
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,060
Since I couldn't afford to buy the real rear window.

99
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,520
It didn't take long time to do.
I guess, it took me a couple of hours.

100
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,700
Actually, I want to make another one
since I'm not really happy with the resualt.

101
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,220
I will leave as it is.
Otherwise the car will never be finished

102
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,880
These side mirrors comes from a Corvette C5.
The original is a bit more straight.

103
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,860
However, the car is 2 meters (78 in) wide and I can see
backwards with these which is the whole idea.

104
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,640
-The car it's also very low.
Yes, the total height is 112 cm (44 in) from the ground.

105
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,200
I have weighed the car on race wave because I want the
weight distribution in front and rear and per wheel.

106
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,340
And be able to weigh in for the spring system.

107
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:29,840
The whole car weighs without oil in the engine, no fuel
and no person in the car weighs 1082 kg (2385 lb).

108
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,240
Which I think is pretty good.
-For a car made in metal, it's great.

109
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,720
Everyone thinks that sheet metal is heavy but it's not.

110
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,280
It's just sheet metal and nothing
else it doesn't weigh much.

111
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,400
-How thick sheet metal have you used?
It's 0.8 and then it is 2 mm at the bottom of the car.

112
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,600
The metal is thicker on the bottom because
I don't want anything to happen.

113
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,660
-Why has the car a license plate with PLÅTLADY?
I had the car at Elmia auto show many years ago...

114
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,820
...and there were so many who
had their own license plate.

115
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,020
To see the difference between my car
and a real F40 online I choose Plåtlady.

116
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:12,060
Since the car is made of sheet metal (PLÅT)
and LADY is red.

117
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,060
I wanted to be unique with something and there is
just one F40 in the world that is build in sheet metal.

118
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,660
I have chosen to do it just because it can be done.
It doesn't have to be in plastic.

119
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:31,480
Another thing that a F40 must have is the 
recessed F40 emblem in the rear wing.

120
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,860
I have cut out a piece and laid sheet metal behind it
and then used a Dremel and it took a couple of hours.

121
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,260
-I assume the car is Ferrari red?
Yes it is painted in Ferraris red.

122
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,840
-It would be weird otherwise.
Yes that's true.

123
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,160
Now the car is just painted.
When I had the car at Elmia auto show a few years ago.

124
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,900
I quickly assemble the car and had it painted
to see how it would look.

125
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,500
Then the paintwork would be for some
years so the car could be used a little.

126
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,940
Now I can grind it and repaint it and add clearcoat.

127
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,860
I don't have any clearcoat now.
Now it's just red paint.

128
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,700
In the coming year, it will be sanded
and painted so it looks perfect.

129
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,740
-When can we see this car on the road?
Yes, it is partially SRFO (home-built vehicles) inspected.

130
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,340
It's SRFO inspected but I have do drive and noice test.

131
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,640
The car is ready to be inspected now.
It should be done in 2 steps.

132
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,580
Step one is to check the chassis
and it should look like a car.

133
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,540
Step two is drive and noice test.
And it should work as a car on the road.

134
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:47,640
That's what left to do.
Then MOT inspection to get car registered for the road.

135
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,440
-There are many who want you to start the car.
-But then you have to wait, right?

136
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:59,900
Well then you have to wait until spring.
-Then I will be back.

137
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:09,100
-I guess, it's not the best weather outside.
No, it's snow and cold so I don't want to take it outside.

138
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,920
-I may do a revisit before the summer.
Great, looking forward to that.

139
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,600
-Me too, I also look forward to that.

140
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,900
-Fantastic, Thanks for having me.
Thank you for coming and thanks everyone who watch this video.

141
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,780
-See you later!

142
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,780
Motornörd = engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

143
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,940
More episodes will be translated to 
English in the near future.

144
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,160
Thanks for watching!
