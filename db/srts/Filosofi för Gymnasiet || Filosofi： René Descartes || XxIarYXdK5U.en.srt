1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,880
When during the Renaissance, the ancient ideals were rediscovered, the intellectuals of the 17th century wanted to think new.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,600
In the same way that Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei changed the conditions for science

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,720
did the Frenchman RenÃ© Descartes the same for philosophy

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,520
- Why he has come to be referred to as the father of modern philosophy.

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:31,560
He was born in a small village in the French countryside (later renamed Descartes after the philosopher)

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,400
But was so sick and weak that he feared he would not survive to adulthood.

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,020
Therefore, he got the habit of staying in bed until well into the day,

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,480
A habit he would keep for the rest of his life.

9
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,760
Of his well -off parents, he came to inherit so much money that he would never have to work.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,360
Instead, he devoted his time to thinking, often lying in his bed.

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,480
After completing his education, he broke with the higher social life in Paris

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,140
And moved to Amsterdam where he came to stay for most of his life.

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,480
Descartes came to criticize philosophy for unable to provide reliable knowledge.

14
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,060
Various philosophical theories collided with each other,

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,880
And there was no way to determine what was true and what was false.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,720
The reason for this, Descartes said, was that philosophy lacked a safe foundation

17
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,280
- An undoubtedly confident truth to be based on.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,900
This is unlike, for example, mathematics.

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,580
The reason we can construct complex mathematical theories is because we agree on how

20
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,760
Mathematics works at its most basic level - for example 1+1 = 2

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,960
Or that a straight line is the shortest stretch between two points.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,200
Something equivalent does not exist in philosophy, which is why we can never say anything with certainty.

23
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,700
Could it now, asked Descartes, be possible to find something equivalent in philosophy?

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,440
If one could find batches outside the mathematics whose truths were impossible to doubt

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,340
These could be used as a starting point for logical conclusions in philosophy.

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:24,760
In his search for a secure basis for philosophical knowledge, he used a method called systematic doubt.

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,840
He himself tried to doubt everything, in order to in this way hope to find something that could not be questioned

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,660
- Something that must be undoubtedly true.

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,600
He soon realized that experiences based on our senses (eg vision, hearing, feeling)

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,400
were not sufficiently safe to constitute undoubted knowledge.

31
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,500
This is because we always risk perceiving something wrong.

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,280
In fact, we can't even be sure if we are awake or dreaming, Descartes said.

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,460
Our senses are sufficient to navigate in everyday life,

34
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,940
But not to form the basis for absolute and undoubted truth.

35
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:13,360
Remains then do our reason, our thinking, but this too can doubt Descartes.

36
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,740
What if there is an evil demon that lurks us every time we count math

37
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,540
- Thus, even mathematics is undoubtedly true.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,720
But if now neither our senses nor our reason can give us secure truth,

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,920
Is there something that cannot be doubted?

40
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,820
There is, says Descartes.

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,080
The only thing we can be absolutely sure of is that we have the experiences we have.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,700
Although you can doubt that there is an outer world, you cannot doubt that you have the experience of it.

43
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,260
This is true even if you look wrong, dream or be fooled.

44
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,920
From this we can draw certain conclusions.

45
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,140
This means that we are some kind of existing being.

46
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:03,940
You do not necessarily know your own nature, but that you exist stands beyond doubt.

47
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,100
Because even if you are deceived by an evil demon, someone is cheated.

48
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,520
In addition, we know with absolute certainty that one is a creature

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,880
Which, if nothing else, has at least conscious experiences.

50
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,900
Descartes summarized this conclusion in a famous Latin phrase: "Cogito Ergo sum",

51
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:31,720
Which is translated to "I think, so I am".
 This is the foundation of knowledge.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,180
Then Descartes began to rebuild the world.

53
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,300
He began by trying to prove God's existence with a variant of the classical ontological proof of God:

54
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,440
1. God is by definition the greatest imaginable.

55
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,440
2. Suppose God does not exist.

56
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,820
3. In that case, one can imagine something that has all the qualities of God, but which also exists.

57
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:05,780
4. In this case, this is greater than God, as it is greater to exist than not to exist.

58
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,000
5. However, this leads to a paradox, since God by definition is the greatest imaginable.

59
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,040
6. The assumption that God does not exist is thus incorrect.

60
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,840
When Descartes assured himself of the existence of God, he also meant that everything we perceive with our minds

61
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,100
Must be true when God would not allow us to be fooled.

62
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:37,280
The reason why, after all, we sometimes wrong depends on our free will, which exceptionally leads us to incorrect reviews.

63
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,640
God also guarantees that our reason is not fooled by any external influence,

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,180
Why the world is as it appears to us.

65
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,080
The most important thing about Descarte's philosophy is his method.

66
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,740
He methodically reasoning and avoids speculation

67
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,280
(at least until he mixes God into the reasoning),

68
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,120
And thus lays the foundation for how modern philosophy is conducted.

69
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,580
Descartes was a dualist and saw the world as consisting of two substances - spirit and matter.

70
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:16,700
In us humans this was represented by body and soul, but here Descartes identified a problem.

71
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,840
How can these two units-one material and one non-material-affect each other?

72
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,180
How can a mental impulse affect a physical body and vice versa?

73
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,040
Descarte's response, after carefully examining the human body,

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,820
was that this interaction must take place with the help of "life -sand" in the pine cone gland

75
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:43,920
- The part of the brain that we think today controls the body's daily rhythm.

76
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,140
This problem is now referred to as the body-soul problem, something that philosophers are still trying to solve.

77
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:58,760
How can the tank (which is non-material) on lifting your arm affecting your body (which is material/physical)

78
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,560
To do just that - and vice versa.

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,380
How can consciousness arise from a lump gray matter consisting only of electrochemical properties?

80
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,740
These issues belong to what is today referred to as a philosophy of consciousness.

81
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,080
Descartes believed that thoughts, which are non-material, must originate from the soul.

82
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,620
As animals, according to Christianity, traditionally not considered to have any soul, he concluded that these either

83
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:34,260
Could have some thoughts or feelings - they were only biological machines or "vending machines".

84
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,180
This view of animals remained among many far into the 20th century,

85
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,780
And has probably led to much that would today be called animal cruelty.

86
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Descartes builds its philosophy on rational thinking.

87
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:57,700
He meant that knowledge originates from logical thinking, not through sensual observations of the world.

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,120
This makes him a rationalist,

89
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,160
Unlike an empiricist who believes that knowledge has its basis in experiences.

90
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:13,180
Like many other rationalists, Descartes, in addition to philosopher, was also mathematicians.

91
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,480
He saw insights into mathematics as fundamental to understanding the world

92
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,880
- A thought he shared with, for example, Pythagoras and Plato.

93
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,720
One morning, Descartes, his habit was faithful, and meditated

94
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,700
When he saw a fly flew around the room.

95
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,840
He realized that one could describe the position of the fly by indicating its distance

96
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,580
to three walls with a common corner.

97
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,760
Each position at a point in the room or plane could be described with speech called coordinates,

98
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,800
and a point in motion could be described with equations.

99
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,180
He had just invented the coordinate system.

100
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:00,960
Descartes also improved the algebraic notation by introducing exponents

101
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,540
and the Convention to designate unknown quantities with letters from the end of the alphabet

102
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,520
and known quantities with letters from the beginning of the alphabet.

103
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:18,080
Even before this, letters had been started to denote quantities,

104
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,220
But a notation was used that was quite cumbersome.

105
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,040
The equation that with Descartes notation would be written like this:

106
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,540
were previously written as:

107
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:41,320
Even what we today feel as Newton's first team, or the inertia, was first formulated by Descartes.

108
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,600
Thus, he is also one of the forerunners in modern physics.

109
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,980
One of those who admired Descartes was Queen Kristina of Sweden,

110
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,880
And she invited the philosopher to Stockholm to give her private lessons in philosophy.

111
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,320
He reluctantly accepted but came to suffer severely from the cold winter.

112
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,560
He himself must have described Sweden as a bears' land between cliffs and ice

113
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,280
Where even people's thoughts freeze to ice.

114
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:20,040
In addition, Descartes, who never ever got up before 11 am, was ordered to keep their lessons at 5 in the morning.

115
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,620
Within two weeks he suffered pneumonia and died shortly thereafter at Stockholm Castle.

116
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,320
Here we have Sweden's biggest contribution to philosophy history

117
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,580
- Our climate killed one of world history's greatest thinkers.

118
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:44,360
As a deeply believing Catholic in Protestant Sweden, it was unthinkable to bury him in weighted soil.

119
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,300
Instead, he was buried at a cemetery for undone children, but this posed new problems.

120
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,760
To accommodate the philosopher in a coffin adapted for children, it was decided to cut off his head.

121
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,100
As if this were not bad enough, the head was also lost.

122
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,560
This was first discovered 16 years later when France after diplomatic pressure

123
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,400
Got the coffin excavated and shipped to Paris for a statesman's funeral.

124
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:23,020
It was not until 150 years later that Descartes Kranium was found by the father of Swedish chemistry, Jacob Berzelius,

125
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,600
And it could be returned to Paris.

126
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,840
How the French reacted when they discovered that the Swedes have fun to

127
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,860
Carve out scribbles and neglect the lower jaw do not tell the story.

128
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,240
For some unfathomable reason, this time it was also possible to reunite the body parts.

129
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,600
Instead placed the skull on a shelf in the science museum in Paris

130
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,340
Where there is still the view- squeezed between a pair of Neanderthal and Cromagnon shells.
