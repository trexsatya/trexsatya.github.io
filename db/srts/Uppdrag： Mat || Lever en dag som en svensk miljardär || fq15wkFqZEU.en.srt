00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:10,000
We are going home to him, we will eat with him, we will work with him and we will hang with him.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,640
Just when I say it he rolls in.

3
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:19,948
- Hello!

4
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:20,726
- Mauri

5
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:21,570
- Tjena Mauri.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,320
- Nice!

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,120
- The same, really.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,200
Here we have billionaire Johan, who has 50 different companies -

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,480
-As in a short time, one of Sweden's richest people has become.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,160
- Wait now, you are parked there?

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,800
- Yes, I thought we could be close to the boat club.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,240
- But do you get it?

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,520
- It depends on who you ask.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,240
- And why do we meet here?

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,960
- I usually have breakfast here.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,200
- At the Royal Mot Boat Club?

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,880
- Yes, they have the world's best sandwiches.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
- But should we go in and check out?

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,600
- I think so.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,320
- Should we?

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,080
- Let's go.

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,200
This section is also in paid collaboration with Air Up.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,960
- How is the situation with you then?

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,800
- It is good.

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Is this with you?

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57.560
- Could it have been worse?

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,800
- Yes actually. Heat day at work.

28
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,320
- Did you work today? It's early in the morning. You have been at work already.

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
How hard do you have to sit still?

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08.040
- Quite difficult. At school it was hard.

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,320
At school I had problems. I had to go for a class ...

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,800
It's actually fun. I did an ADHD investigation.

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,280
It came to light that I'm just hyperactive.

34
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,280
It is very unusual as an adult to just be hyper.

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Hello to you!
