1
00:00:04,084 --> 00:00:10,000
We are going home to him, we will eat with him, we will work with him and we will hang with him.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,640
Just when I say it he rolls in.

3
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:19,948
- Hello!

4
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:20,726
- Mauri

5
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:21,570
- Tjena Mauri.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,320
- Nice!

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,120
- The same, really.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,200
Here we have billionaire Johan, who has 50 different companies -

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,480
-As in a short time, one of Sweden's richest people has become.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,160
- Wait now, you are parked there?

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,800
- Yes, I thought we could be close to the boat club.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,240
- But do you get it?

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,520
- It depends on who you ask.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,240
- And why do we meet here?

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,960
- I usually have breakfast here.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,200
- At the Royal Mot Boat Club?

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,880
- Yes, they have the world's best sandwiches.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
- But should we go in and check out?

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,600
- I think so.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,320
- Should we?

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,080
- Let's go.

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,200
This section is also in paid collaboration with Air Up.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,960
- How is the situation with you then?

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,800
- It is good.

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Is this with you?

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,560
- Could it have been worse?

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,800
- Yes actually.
 Heat day at work.

28
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,320
- Did you work today?
 It's early in the morning.
 You have been at work already.

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
How hard do you have to sit still?

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,040
- Quite difficult.
 At school it was hard.

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,320
At school I had problems.
 I had to go for a class ...

32
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,800
It's actually fun.
 I did an ADHD investigation.

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,280
It came to light that I'm just hyperactive.

34
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,280
It is very unusual as an adult to just be hyper.

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Hello to you!

36
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,680
- If I asked you now, to just sit and look out over the water ...

37
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,120
So we'll see how long it takes before you can't do it anymore?

38
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,040
- Yes, but when you get these challenges so ...

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,360
- Then will you want to win?

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,860
- Yes!

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,620
- So your competition instinct goes over?

42
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,120
- 100%

43
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,620
- Hyper?

44
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,120
- 100%

45
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,620
- Okay, thumb war!

46
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,360
- Thumb war?

47
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
- You see something in your gaze.

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,860
- Yes!

49
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,120
- You wake up!

50
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,620
- Yes now!

51
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,480
Now I'm on!

52
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
- The loser swish the other thousand bucks.

53
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,480
- Thousand?
 We drive ten thousand.

54
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
- Ten thousand?

55
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Ten salmon?

56
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,980
- Ten salmon!

57
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
- Lol!

58
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,980
There is much greater risk for me.

59
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,980
It is by far the biggest bait I have done in my life.

60
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,480
- Is that so?

61
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:57,980
- Yes.

62
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,980
- Are you holding up now?

63
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,980
- Thumb war!

64
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,480
Yes.

65
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,480
1, 2, 3.

66
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
- My God.

67
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,980
- Have I just won 10 salmon?

68
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,980
- Congratulations Mauri.

69
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,057
- 10,000

70
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,980
Damn start on this day.

71
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,480
- Really.
 And this sandwich.

72
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,980
- Yes, it was so good.

73
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
- And this company.

74
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,980
- And this man.

75
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
- Yes, this man.

76
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,980
- No, that man.

77
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,980
- No, that man.

78
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,980
- That man.

79
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,480
- No haha!

80
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,020
- What then?

81
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,420
- I thought we would take the boat and go out to my country place.

82
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Do you have sunscreen?

83
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,220
So you must not say?

84
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,720
- Yes.

85
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
- Sorry

86
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,620
- Is that your boat?

87
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,360
Yes, of course, Serru.

88
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,740
- What a long one.

89
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,380
- Yes it is long and slim and fast.

90
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,480
- Let's go.

91
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,180
- Yes we do.

92
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,220
- Oh!

93
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,220
- Oh sorry.

94
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,340
- Smooth out!
 - Yes, serve.

95
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,679
- Now it calls someone.

96
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,613
- Tjena, Viktor.

97
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,140
If there is something you should learn about billionaires, it is that they seem to talk on the phone all the time.

98
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,060
This particular conversation seemed to be a new 12 million boat that Johan wanted to buy in Norway today.

99
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,473
- Should you and I to Norway buy a boat?

100
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:16,207
- Yes I thought it, how does it feel to you?

101
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,740
- Do we get it?

102
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,380
- We find a good vehicle to go fast in, I thought.

103
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,700
Helicopter I thought.

104
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,500
What do you think about that?

105
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,140
- Hello?

106
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,500
Should we go helicopter to Norway?

107
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,020
- Yes.

108
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
- and buy a boat?

109
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,660
- Why not?

110
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,060
- We are going to Norway you and me.

111
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,980
We are going to Norway!

112
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,500
- Yes.

113
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,980
- But okay, first we're going home with you.

114
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,660
- Exactly.

115
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,500
- Oh, now Johan is starting to press a little.

116
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
- Yes exactly.

117
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,700
- And then you see how it starts to glide in the eyes.

118
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,500
- Now, now.

119
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,700
- This is fun for real.

120
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,525
- How many knots are we up in?

121
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:50,044
- Now we are only up to 35.

122
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:51,700
- huh?
 Is this only half?

123
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,700
- Yes.

124
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
- Oh my God!

125
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,700
How fast we go!

126
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
- Yes, lovely!

127
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,700
- Yes ...

128
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
- Are you happy?

129
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
- Yes, I'm happy.

130
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,460
But it is this eternal question if you have money you become happier and it is like ...

131
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,840
Yes, it will be easier.
 After all, life becomes easier.

132
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,200
I had a great job when I started my company.
 I was close to bankruptcy several times.

133
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,860
And lay and cried at home in bed because I had no money.

134
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,360
- mm.

135
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,960
So I know how hard it is.

136
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,740
So, to be short for money.

137
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,240
- Yes.

138
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,420
- It's really hard.

139
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,960
- are all houses here yours?

140
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,460
- Yes.

141
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,320
- Oh God!

142
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,320
- This section is in paid collaboration with Air Rup.

143
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,320
And now you might be wondering why I'm being chased by the police.

144
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Let me tell me why.

145
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,320
It all started with the fact that I completely innocently ordered home Air Up.

146
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
That flavoring plain water via the scented mind-

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,320
-So you experience flavors such as watermelon, pineapple or apple.

148
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,320
The problem now is that the police think that these are too good to be legal.

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
For everything else that is good in life, usually cost in one way or another.

150
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
For example, if you drink alcohol, well then you become backwards.

151
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,520
For example, if you eat useless food, then you feel worse.

152
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,760
But Air Rup has chopped the system.

153
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,560
Only the advantages, though without the disadvantages.

154
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,560
- There he is!!!

155
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,800
Air Up flavors regular tap water with scent.

156
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,360
As the scent mind accounts for 80% of all tastes you experience-

157
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,400
-This your brain interprets the scent of this little pod as a taste.

158
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,160
- We need reinforcement to E4 northbound.

159
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Mauri gets hold of an Air Up bottle.

160
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,480
-And it works so that you fill bottles with water,-

161
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,920
-S put on the pod with its favorite flavor.

162
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,920
And then just lift the pod to activate the taste.

163
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,400
And then it's just to enjoy.

164
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,920
In addition, there are 25 incredible flavors such as cherries, lime and peach.

165
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,600
With the code Mauri you get a 10% discount on Air Ups website.

167
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,240
- are all houses here yours?

168
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,760
- Yes.

169
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
- Oh God!

170
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
- How often are you here?

171
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
- One or a couple of weeks in the summer.

172
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
- So it's just a summer house?

173
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
- Yes.

174
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
- How much empty do you have?

175
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
- 55,000 square meters.

176
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
- 55,000 square meters of empty?

177
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
- You look mischievous when you think about it.

178
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
- Yes, it's a bit cranky.

179
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,760
- It's a bit cranky.

180
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,760
- Should I try to do something?

181
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
- I think I'll try to get this one.

182
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
- You don't want help from me.

183
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,680
- Nehehe, you are good.

184
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,880
- Why does no one trust me when it comes to these questions?

185
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,960
- You actively want to be doing?

186
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,460
- Yes.

187
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,880
- Here, I'll help you.

188
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,380
- Thanks.

189
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,920
- And here is the main house itself?

190
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,420
- Exactly.

191
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,280
- Now it calls.

192
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
- But who is calling?

193
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,680
- Håkan Guldkula.

194
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,000
- Håkan Guldkula?

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,128
- His name is that.

196
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:01,800
- No?

197
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,140
- Well, for real.

198
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,620
- Do you have a friend named Håkan Guldkula?

199
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
It's almost grisly and hot so I think.

200
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,520
- He is an amazing character.

201
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,800
- He is certain, but he can't be called Håkan Guldkula.

202
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
- You gas with that.

203
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,240
- Oh, I understand!

204
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,740
Woho!

205
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,240
Woho!

206
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,040
Do you keep up with or?

207
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,760
- Yes, I'm hanging on.

208
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
- You have apples.

209
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,080
- Yes, we have many apple trees.

210
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
- Can't we run and pallet any apples?

211
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,580
- Shall we do it?

212
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,080
- Yes.

213
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
- Should I pallet on my own plot?

214
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
- Ah just that.

215
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,080
- Are you involved in a good challenge?

216
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,580
- What does it mean then?

217
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,080
- I think we crank up a little neighbor and see the one who throws the longest.

218
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
100,000?

219
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
- No!

220
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
- I can not afford it.

221
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
- Yes, I know you have.

222
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
- Lol!

223
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,560
- But 100,000 is too much.
 We can lower it a bit?

224
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Yes, 95,000 then?

225
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
- Lol!

226
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,867
20,000!

227
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,787
That is a good.
 20,000 that's good.

228
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,800
- I don't know if I'm good either.

229
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,664
Now we'll see then

230
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,464
- It's the strangest thing I've done.

231
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,080
Are you kidding?

232
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,700
That is a good throw.

233
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,460
This throw can potentially cost me 20,000 bucks.

234
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
- Or win 20,000.

235
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,600
Imagine what opportunity Mauri.

236
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Come on.

237
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,640
- Does it feel hard?

238
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,460
- A little.

239
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,960
20,000.

240
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
- We have to hang out more you and me, I think.

241
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,580
- What is going on now, Johan?

242
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,180
- I think it's Håkan!
 He who we talked about Håkan here.

243
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,620
- Is it Håkan Guldkula?

244
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,860
We would just go and have lunch.
 Who do you think we come across when we go to port?

245
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,960
Yes, Håkan Fucking Gold Kula.

246
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Look into the camera and say what your name is.

247
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
- My name is Håkan Guldkula.

248
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,480
- Håkan Guldkula?
 Yes.

249
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,540
What are you doing here?

250
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,120
- I'm here watching the boat.

251
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,000
- Can't we come up with anything with Håkan Guldkula?

252
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,560
- Håkan has his own champagne brand called Guldkula Champagne.

253
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,320
I am also a partner in your champagne brand.

254
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
- It's one of all your fifty companies.

255
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
- Are you also swine?

256
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,844
- If I am?

257
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,640
- Swine.

258
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
- I have it okay.

259
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
- Hahaha!

260
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,600
- This is how I want to live too.

261
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
- But you do it now.

262
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
- Yes, in one day.
 It's not enough.

263
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,480
- Yes, yes.

264
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,120
- Happy Thursday.

265
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
- Look, the bus here in this man.
 Now he is in bus mood.

266
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,400
- Yes you drink far too slow guys.

267
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,520
- Are you starting to get a little intoxicated?
 You just sit and smile and look out at the horizon.

268
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,960
- I just enjoy the nice summer weather.

269
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,560
- Håkan Fucking Guldkula.

270
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
- Cheers, bowl.

271
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,880
- Okay, lunch!

272
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
- Lunch!

273
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,480
- Are you mischievous again?

274
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
- Yes, I'm busy.

275
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,520
And lunch we would eat in Johan's wine cellar where his wine expert had picked up some suggestions-

276
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,880
-Or would be suitable for today's meal.

277
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,600
- Legendary vintage 2005 from Emmanuel Roger.

278
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,040
From Le Chebler.

279
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,880
- Located in von Romanias, which is perhaps the world's best Vinby.

280
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,480
- God I become ... Do you understand everything He says?

281
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,760
- No, I don't, but I'm a bit on his ...

282
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,440
- He is in control of the stuff.
 There are many references and French names.

283
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,920
- What do you pay for this racker?

284
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,680
- This one may well be at a 60-70,000 approximately.

285
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,440
Depends on.
 Can be more expensive too.

286
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
Then we get on the next.

287
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
Also Magnum, of course.

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,640
Roma, stay in chambol with neat.

289
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,640
We find this.

290
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
- Now you should choose which wine it will be.

291
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
- No, I thought you would?

292
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
- Should I choose?

293
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
After all, these are for half a million.

294
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
- Ole Dole you get to drive.

295
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,640
Hahaha-

296
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
- Okay

297
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
- Yes drive

298
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Ole doledoff, kinkelakoff, kinkelane ole dole ole doledoff-

299
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
What is this host?

300
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
- 50-60 thousand.

301
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
- Damn what expensive!

302
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
- Yes what fun then, now it's time to open the wine.

303
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
That we look forward to

304
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
- But but...

305
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
After all, it is 60 thousand.

306
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
- you are so greedy .. you just

307
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,640
There we said hello to 60,000 Johan.
 Or we said hello to 60,000.

308
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
- Yes Hello!

309
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,640
- Cheers!
 Johan, you are the best.

310
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,025
- Do you know how lean it is?

311
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,640
- Yes, damn, it was good.

312
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,201
- It's good.

313
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:18,551
- It was damn good wine.
 Damn!

314
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,660
- Have you ever tried Boeuf any time?

315
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,732
- Are you Boeuf with Boeuf Bourguignon?

316
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,766
- Yes, now we are talking or how?

317
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,354
- Yes, now we are talking.

318
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:31,877
Now we're up and running this day.

319
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,076
- But when was it so rich?

320
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:35,526
- It went pretty fast.

321
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,255
In a couple of years maybe.

322
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,255
I have to pinch my arm actually.

323
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:40,255
Still after many years now.

324
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:42,220
That I am so good.

325
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Crazy right?

326
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
- Yes, it's cranky.

327
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,873
Bowl!

328
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:50,584
Hello to you!

329
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,640
- Short break to force Johan show all his cars.

330
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
What is that?

331
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,640
- The Ferrari 812 Superfast is called it.

332
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
- What's that?

333
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
- A very fast Porsche Cayenne.

334
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
- And that?

335
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Yes, it is a Cayenne but not as fast.

336
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
- And that?

337
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,640
- A very, very fast.
 One of the fastest cars in the world.

338
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
A Porsche 911.

339
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,640
It is difficult to keep the note.
 You have to be careful.

340
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
- Keep the note?

341
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
- Yes, the driver's license.

342
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
- You're a little mischievous.

343
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,430
- I am and I have become because the driver's license a few times.

344
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,430
- How many?

345
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,640
- Oh, I hardly dare to tell you.
 Surely a 20 times.

346
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,640
- 20 times!
 Have you got rid of the driver's license 20 times!

347
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,640
- Unbelievable!
 Congratulations!

348
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
- Yes, should you say congratulations?

349
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
- No, you should definitely not.
 But I'm happy!

350
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,960
- Yes, it's not good, but it's fun.

351
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,440
- Mauri.

352
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,400
- Johan.

353
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,200
Soon we would go helicopter to Norway, but first we got past one of Johan's office to see a little how he works.

354
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,720
- Yes, here we have my biggest company today, Panghus.

355
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,240
- One of your 40 companies?

356
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,240
- Yes, is right.

357
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,160
- There is a ping pong table.

358
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
- Yes, just.
 Is there money on games soon, right?

359
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,240
- So I am 10,000 back.

360
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
- Yes, we shit in it, Mauri.
 We are driving now.

361
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
- Here comes the kitchen.
 Here we have Fredrik who cooks here.

362
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
- Do you have a chef?

363
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
- Yes, we have a chef at work.

364
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,240
We build entire areas and we make the infrastructure so that the roads in the area draw sewers and electricity.

365
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,240
And then we build the houses from the ground up in the factory.

366
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
- How big business do you do?

367
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,240
- In really large areas, you may talk half a billion, up to one billion.

368
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
- You do it?

369
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
- Cranky huh?

370
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,800
- And what is this?

371
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,040
- Super 10.

372
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
It's our hockey agency.

373
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,040
- Do you have a hockey agency?

374
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
- Hello guys.

375
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,200
- You are an NHL professional?

376
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
- It's Jonte Bergen in Detroit.

377
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,280
- And you are one of Sweden's best hockey players who are just sitting here in your office.

378
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,880
But I got so curious, what did you have about?

379
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,080
- No, but it's a contract year.

380
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,960
- Should he earn more or less than he does on a weekend?

381
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
- Where do you aim?
 Do you dare to go so high?

382
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
- It depends on what a weekend!

383
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
Hahaha!

384
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,960
- Here is my office.
 This is how I sit in the days.

385
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
- Oh!
 It was a bent screen!

386
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
- Yes exactly!

387
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
- What a curvature!

388
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
- curvature!

389
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
- This is my pressure chamber.

390
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
- Excuse me?

391
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
- The pressure chamber I lie for an hour every day.

392
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
- Do you have a pressure .. an hour every day?

393
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
- Yes.

394
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
- Cranky huh?

395
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,360
- It's really cranky.

396
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,000
- And why is it good for you?

397
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,240
- Cell division in the body is important for you to feel good and live for a long time.

398
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,240
The largest sports stars in the world are in such a thing.

399
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
- What strange this is.

400
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
- No, sorry.
 Am I sitting on you?

401
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,040
- Hello!

402
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
- Hey!

403
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
- Then we guys are visible in a while!

404
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,720
- What is this?

405
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
- This is the oxygen.

406
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
- Okay.

407
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,760
- Surely you feel it is getting hard now?

408
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
- Damn, it blows itself up.

409
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
- It will be stiff now.

410
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,460
- Is it true?

411
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,840
- Now this is hard.

412
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
- What is so fun?

413
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
What is so fun about it?

414
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
- No nothing, cranky huh?

415
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
- It's cranky.

416
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
- Wait, I go first Mauri.

417
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
- That was great.

418
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
- My God, what a warm.

419
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:38,834
Now we're going to pull.
 It goes faster than checking in and going with regular flights.

420
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,569
This is a better and easier way.

421
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:41,765
- You recommend a helicopter?

422
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:42,440
- Hot!

423
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,062
- To ordinary people who need to transport themselves.

424
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:45,184
- Haha exactly!

425
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:54,905
Oh my God!

426
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Wow!

427
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Oh!

428
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,080
And while we move on to Norway, let's flush the time back a bit to better understand where Johan comes from.

429
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,080
The year is 1977 and Johan goes here at the Vaxmora school in Sollentuna.

430
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,080
- I went here for seven years because I had to go about a class too.

431
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
But there are millions in memories.

432
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,080
I had a tough time at school because I had a hard time sitting still.

433
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,080
I had a hard time taking on and learning.

434
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,080
I came after in all subjects and then it was a downward spiral.

435
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,280
- Was there anyone who believed in you?

436
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Among the teachers.

437
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,600
- I had a teacher here and when it turned a little neighbor.

438
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,400
When I went to a new class.

439
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,280
- It was a teacher named Berit Letse.

440
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,080
She took care of me in a good way and understood that I had these qualities.

441
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,480
I had a hard time sitting still.

442
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,320
- How important was it for you as a child to have one?

443
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,720
- It is extremely important of course.

444
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,600
Extremely important.

445
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,920
Guess who arranged a surprise for Johan at his old leisure farm.

446
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,800
- Check out Johan, who is sitting here.

447
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,440
--Wow!
 Unbelievable!

448
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,240
-Hello!
 How is it Berit?

449
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,720
- Here you come!

450
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,655
--Wow!

451
00:18:51,655 --> 00:18:53,518
- How lovely!

452
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:54,720
- The same Berit!

453
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,520
- How important was it for you to meet a Berit who saw you better and could handle you better?

454
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,560
- Incredibly important.
 It was like a turning point.

455
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:10,040
Although I continued to have a fairly low self -esteem in the school, it was a turning point with Berit.

456
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,560
- He is today one of Sweden's richest people.

457
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,960
- You can't ... No, is that really it?

458
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,160
- Yes, he is a billionaire today.

459
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,360
- Are you?

460
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,160
- Yes, they say it.

461
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,360
- Are they saying?

462
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,960
- He is.

463
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,960
- Well, what a wonderful to hear.

464
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
You can see that yes, how it can be.

465
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,560
If you should not judge anyone in advance.

466
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,560
I had a small card on you.

467
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,760
- Do you have it?

468
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
- Look, there you see.

469
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,960
- Wow, incredible.

470
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,160
- And there you really see how cute he is.

471
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,838
- Is it you two?

472
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:47,200
- Yes, just.

473
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,920
- I have to thank you so much for being so nice to me.

474
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,440
- Thanks so much for that.
 I live on that.

475
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,720
After this, Johan jumped off high school to try out different jobs.

476
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,560
He has been a leisure leader, a store worker, a constitutional porter.

477
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,720
He has run two clothing stores in Örebro, opened a bar in the Old Town.

478
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,320
He has started a floor team in Umeå and he has also trained as a pilot.

479
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,600
And the strangest of all, you have also been a football professional.

480
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,040
In the middle of all this.

481
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes, believe it or not, but before Johan's successful business career-

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,240
-They he was a brilliant football talent that played in AIK's A-team, among other things.

483
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
And he was trained by icon Tommy Söderberg-

484
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,040
-Som helped and shaped giants like Zlatan and Henrik Larsson.

485
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,600
- There he stands.

486
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,800
- Yes, incredible.

487
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,000
- He was also an important person in your career, right?

488
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
- Yes, he was like a mentor to me and followed me.

489
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,400
He helped me very much.

490
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,200
How's it going?

491
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
- It is good!

492
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,800
- Nice to see you!
 Hey!

493
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,800
- Hey!

494
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,300
- Mauri

495
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,500
- Hello!
 Tommy is my name.

496
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
- Oh, it's hug!

497
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,400
- Yes, there are some hockey tackles.

498
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,600
- You give very hard push.

499
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,000
Do you always do that?

500
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,600
- Yes.

501
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,800
Yes, but it gives the design that we are tagged.

502
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
- Yes exactly!

503
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
- Incredibly.

504
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,921
- What legend we have here?

505
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,921
- How do you remember him as a player?

506
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,680
- You can say that he was a very fast player.

507
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,880
He had a good basic technique.

508
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,200
Then it was such a spraying.

509
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,280
He was a nice devil.

510
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,720
He always had energy in the body and so on.

511
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
- He still has.

512
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,080
- I notice that.
 You saw that at the time now.

513
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
- Yes, you see it.

514
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,400
- I had the offer from AIK.

515
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,800
But for various reasons I refused no two years in a row.

516
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,480
And that's for me ... I regret it.

517
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,040
It would have been fun to see how far you could have gone.

518
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,680
- Thank you Tommy for providing assignments and food with your presence.

519
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,200
- Thank you, it was fun to meet.

520
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,480
And thus we return to the helicopter that is currently on the way from Stockholm towards the boat factory in Norway.

521
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
- Now we will try to find a store.

522
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,040
- Oh!

523
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,260
- Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

524
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
- No danger no danger.
 You, so long are you not.

525
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,720
- And here is the boat you are considering buying, Johan.

526
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
But will you buy it?

527
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
- I do not know.

528
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,680
- We'll see.
 The hearing has begun.

529
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,040
You feel a small atmosphere between you.

530
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,280
Both of you know you will soon be in negotiation as well.

531
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,400
Should we go out and drive a little?
 It is absolutely incredible.

532
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,120
- Do you think it's worth this money or?

533
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,000
- I can't decide that.
 It is up to you.

534
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,360
- Are you doubtful?
 -No.

535
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
- You want this one?

536
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Yes.

537
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
I'm not going to say anything.

538
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
- Are you ready?

539
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
- Yes for the hell.

540
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
- Now it gets speed or?

541
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
- Yes, I think so.

542
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,360
- Now we will go for 180 kilometers per hour at sea.

543
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Not many boats in the world can handle it.

544
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
We will get to know that now.

545
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
- There are quite a few boats.

546
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
- Stop, let me build.

547
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,640
- It is completely unique to go a hundred knots.

548
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,120
- Don't want help?

549
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,120
- Mauri, the train.
 It has probably been.

550
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,200
- Why nobody wants me to help with their boats, Johan?

551
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,880
You were the same before.

552
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
- Because you are crab.

553
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
- I haven't told anyone.

554
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,360
You are also laughing now, Richard.

555
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,840
- And now, my ladies and gentlemen, it's time for negotiation.

556
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,520
- Hello!

557
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
- Bye!

558
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Hello!

559
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,640
Now the champions will negotiate with each other.

560
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:18,258
The Johan that we have come to know who is out and about boat and chill.

561
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:19,640
It's a Johan.

562
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,180
The Johan who now sits down and negotiates a 12 million business.

563
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,309
It's a completely different guy.

564
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,274
We others are considering whether to buy a TV for 7000 at Elgiganten.

565
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:34,308
He is now negotiating a boat for type 12 million.

566
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:38,205
What has happened?

567
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:40,446
- We made the deal.

568
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:41,553
- Have you bought the boat?

569
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:42,640
- Yes kind of.

570
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,410
- What kind of type?

571
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,200
- No, but I bought the boat.

572
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,760
- Have you bought the boat?
 You bought the boat!

573
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Good!
 You bought the boat!

574
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,400
Yes.
 What do we do now?
 How do we celebrate this?

575
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
- No, we have to go to Oslo I think to take a sprinkler.

576
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
- Cheers!
 Bowl!
 Bowl!

577
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
- Cheers!

578
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,310
Then Johan insisted on running Sten Sax's bag for 20,000.

579
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,800
I won, even though I suspect he let me do it with diligence.

580
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,252
And since I am now 10,000 plus again, so you should write what I should do for the money.

581
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:23,313
Who should I donate them to?
 Why?
 Write in the comments field.

582
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:27,029
Then Johan and I went and drove some Norwegian karaoke.

583
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,080
And I could say that although he has absurd a lot of money and in many ways lives in a completely different world than us other-

584
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,080
-So he is in many ways a very ordinary guy and it makes me happy.

585
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
- Now we are on our way home from Norway again!

586
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
- Yes exactly!

587
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
- What happens now?

588
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
- Yes you thought I would invite you to a small party.

589
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
- I'll go to a party!

590
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
Yes, party!
