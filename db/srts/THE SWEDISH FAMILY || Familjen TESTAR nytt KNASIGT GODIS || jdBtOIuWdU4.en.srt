1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,760
It smells awful.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Psych!

3
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:04,360
It's sour.

4
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:06,040
5 points.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,481
I'm a little fart.

6
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,313
Yaaaaaay!

7
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:20,933
Hey, hey!

8
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:23,240
Today we are going to try...

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,049
Crazy candy!

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,944
YAY! "OUII!" (candy)

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,273
- Laura has already started.
- She's cheating.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
Little cheater!

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,518
- But it's fine, she's only 2 years old.
- Yes, she's excused.

14
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:44,240
Here's the thing...

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,600
We often go to the store and see candy
that looks a little crazy and funny.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,249
Yaaaaay, yaaay!

17
00:00:54,156 --> 00:01:00,022
And then Alma and Harry asked if we can try crazy candy.
So, not from a particular country.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,680
No, exactly. Just crazy candy.

19
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:07,680
- So now we have gathered...
- A bunch of crazy candy.

20
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,040
YAY, YAY, YAY!

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,231
- Let's start right away.
- YAY!

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,680
"Lamp Spray"

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:22,612
It's a candy spray...
with a light in the package.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,795
Sour.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
More.

26
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:36,892
- Very sour. Do you want to try it, Laura?
- No.

27
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,040
You don't want to try it?

28
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:45,040
- But it was good.
- I don't know, I've never understood liquid candy.

29
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,100
It's like squash concentrate
that hasn't been properly diluted.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,240
There's something about it being a spray too.
It feels like you're spraying hairspray in your mouth.

31
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:56,840
You think?

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,503
- Do you want to try mine?
- Yes.

33
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:06,520
- My spray tastes like raspberry.
- But it's blue?

34
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,640
I know, but there's a raspberry on the package, so...
Yeah, it's raspberry.

35
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:15,874
This should taste like strawberry,
but it doesn't taste like strawberry. It tastes sour.

36
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:22,640
This one should taste like green apple.
You might notice a hint of green apple.

37
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,040
Do you also want to try it now, Laura?

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,288
How many points do you give it, from 1 to 5?

39
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
5.

40
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,240
- Or wait, 0 to 5.
- Yes.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,600
- 5.
- 5?!

42
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,040
Me too. 5.
I'd buy this for Friday's coziness.

43
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:51,760
- What? Friday's coziness?
- Yes.

44
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:57,640
- Zero coziness factor with...
- I totally agree. Very un-cozy.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,640
- Is this lamp for the coziness, then?
- No, but... Well, a little.

46
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:11,600
I give this 0 points, but it was a lamp
and I like cool stuff, so it gets 1 point for the lamp.

47
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:17,240
Oh, you changed your mind. You rounded up.
I give it 1 point.

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,101
Laura, how many points do you give it?

49
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,760
"Um." One.

50
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,384
One, one, one, one, one.

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,973
"Cotton Candy Buttered Popcorn Flavor"

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,742
It's cotton candy
with the taste of buttery popcorn.

53
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:45,920
- Such nasty texture.
- Are cotton candy in a chip bag a common thing?

54
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:51,360
- I don't know. "Made in the USA," it says here.
- Exciting. Okay.

55
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,520
- Let's try it.
- Let's try it. 1, 2, 3.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,200
It really tastes like butter-flavored popcorn.

57
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:03,520
No.

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,440
How crazy!

59
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,200
- Laura doesn't seem to like it.
- No.

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,440
She's reaching for her candy deodorant.

61
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,040
- I think this was good.
- You like this?

62
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:19,825
It's something completely new for me.

63
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:23,640
Not my thing. Not my thing.

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,440
I mean... I'm shocked.
I don't know what I was expecting, but not this.

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,520
I probably would have bought this candy
if there was no other candy left in the store.

66
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:42,001
Not a very good store, in other words.

67
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:45,083
I think I'll give it 4.5.

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
4.5?!

69
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,212
Whoa.

70
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,159
I give it 1 point. Too messy.

71
00:04:52,308 --> 00:05:01,294
I give it 1 point. I think it was really disgusting, but...
It tasted a little bit like popcorn.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,640
- Mm, that's where the point came in.
- Yes.

73
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,640
I completely agree. I give it 3 points.

74
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:15,040
Way too messy for me.
Completely impossible to have in a home with a bunch of kids.

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,101
But, yeah, it tastes like it says it should taste.

76
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,160
- What do you give it, Laura?
- Are you eating on a wet wipe?

77
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,640
Eww! Yuck.

78
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:28,600
- Laura, how many points do you give it?
- It was quite similar.

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
Om-nom-nom! Yaaaay!

80
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,640
Okay. It sounds like 3 or 4 points.

81
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:38,000
- "Gango"?
- "Gingo!"

82
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,320
- "Gingo."
- What!

83
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:43,954
"Gingo" is "cinco". So, 5 points.

84
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:47,015
"Milka Mmmax Choco Jelly"

85
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,920
It's a chocolate bar filled with jelly pieces.

86
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:02,600
- Oh, this jelly is very rubbery.
- Mm.

87
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,523
- I haven't had any jelly yet.
- No, I only have crackling.

88
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:11,640
- Crackling?
- Me too. It's crackling in the mouth, like popping candy.

89
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,120
- Yes!
- Oh, it's filled with different things!

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes, it crackles and pops in the mouth.
This was a little festive.

91
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,441
Do you think this is available in Sweden?

92
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,760
- No.
- Maybe at the store Normal.

93
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:30,640
- You think? Do they usually have Milka?
- Yes. But maybe not this kind.

94
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,520
Oh, this is kind of fun.
You guys at home...

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,660
We don't know which of these are available Sweden,
so you can comment below.

96
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,462
Good idea. Do that.

97
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,131
Do you hear how it crackles and pops?

98
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,440
- Sticky.
- Sticky? Yes, chocolate makes you sticky.

99
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,536
- "Uaua" sticky.
- Yes. Laura is sticky.

100
00:06:57,046 --> 00:07:02,240
I like this candy.
I think it's festive and maybe fun to share with someone.

101
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:11,186
I give it 3 points because I didn't really like the jellybeans.
They were a bit hard.

102
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:17,562
I also give it 3 points.
Fun with the crackling. Unexpected.

103
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:24,044
- I give it 0 points.
- Oh! 0 points?

104
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,580
- Why's that?
- That's why. It was gross with the jello.

105
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:35,553
Oh. I thought it was really good.
It reminds me of when I was little and made candy in the freezer.

106
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,640
I melted chocolate and mixed it with
pick and mix candy.

107
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,828
I give it 4 points.
It was fun and festive.

108
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,760
"Baby Unicorn Dipper"

109
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:56,240
It's a dipper lollipop that you can open...
and then you dip it in the powder that's in here.

110
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:03,360
- It smells a bit suspicious.
- It smells awful.

111
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:08,760
Oh, Laura, you got a blue nose.

112
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,640
- Oh, it's the unicorn's hair.
- It just tastes like sugar.

113
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:18,304
- I can't even get it in the powder.
- It doesn't fit? Oh no.

114
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:21,842
- How are you supposed to dip it in the powder?
- Like this, look.

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
- Right.
- Oops.

116
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,760
No, what a horrible candy.

117
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,000
Wait! You can put some powder in this...

118
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,588
- Oh, smart. That's how you do it.
- In the cap.

119
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,200
- This is so disgusting.
- Laura, your unicorn has such big eyes. It's really cute.

120
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,440
It tastes like...

121
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,640
It tastes like Dextrosol.

122
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,280
- But this is more sour. It's sour.
- This tastes just like Dextrosol.

123
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,917
This isn't sour.

124
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:04,040
Look, mommy!

125
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,520
You're right! Now I recognize it.

126
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,840
It's Dextrosol.
It's not like Hockey powder. This is Dextrosol.

127
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:17,559
This is as much instant sugar as it gets.

128
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,440
Zerooo! Zerooo!

129
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,640
- I give it fiveee, fiveee!
- What?

130
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,157
- Do you give it 5?
- What? 5 points.

131
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,080
Psych!

132
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,360
- What do you really give it?
- "Psych" means the opposite. Zero!

133
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,200
- You don't like it either.
- Zerooo...

134
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,339
- Zerooo...
- Laura also went like...

135
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,000
"Trolli Jelly Eyeballs"

136
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,620
They come in a plastic bag
and look like eyes.

137
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,840
- There's something sour and runny inside!
- Oh, yuck.

138
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
Stop it.

139
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,763
Hey, you haven't even eaten yours!

140
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:14,132
- This is such Halloween candy.
- Yes!

141
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:18,109
You mean, "such gross Halloween candy"?

142
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,080
Yeah, it's a bit repulsive to eat.

143
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:23,884
- Why is it red?
- That's the blood.

144
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,588
Creepy.

145
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,240
I give this 2 points because I love Halloween.

146
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,122
I also give it 2 points, because it's a good Halloween treat
to give to kids who want to trick or treat.

147
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:43,440
- Eww. 0 points.
- "Eww", as he throws the eye.

148
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:52,040
I also give this 2 points.
Great packaging. Fun and perfect for Halloween.

149
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,160
- Crazy.
- Mm.

150
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:58,520
- How can you like this kind of thing?
- "Konkink."

151
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:05,040
"Konkink", says Laura. She wants to open another one.
I think that means she agrees with us.

152
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,629
"Mentos Fanta"

153
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:13,120
It's completely ordinary Mentos candies, that are orange.

154
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,631
- Wow!
- Wow!

155
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,520
- It really tastes like Fanta.
- Yes, it really does.

156
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:24,160
Put those eyes away now.
What does that in your mouth taste like?

157
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,916
Fanta without carbonation.

158
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,440
Was it good?

159
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:34,780
I think this tastes just like
regular orange-flavored Mentos.

160
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,440
No, it doesn't.

161
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,520
Therefore, I give this 0 points.
It's just a re-branding of an old product.

162
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,040
No, now you're negative. This tastes like Fanta.
I give it 3 points.

163
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,239
I give it 3 points, same as mommy.

164
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:54,040
I give it...

165
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:56,840
0 points.

166
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,640
- What?
- Zerooo!

167
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,789
You don't like it.

168
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,415
"Crazy Roll-On"

169
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:10,840
It's this little deodorant
that Laura has been sitting with.

170
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,040
I have Blue Raspberry flavor.

171
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,640
- Strawberry.
- Green Apple.

172
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,840
Laura has Green Apple,
and this is Blue Raspberry.

173
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,840
- Let's go!
- Yes!

174
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,240
- Such a quirky way to eat candy.
- You think?

175
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,040
Green Apple was so good.

176
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
Love this one.

177
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,760
Can I try it?

178
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:41,160
- So you two like these?
- Yes, I love them.

179
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,703
But it's a useless way to eat.

180
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,640
I also don't understand the roll-on thing.
It's like there were some deodorant bottles left over in the factory.

181
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,240
- And the noise is so unpleasant, like...
- Yes.

182
00:12:55,667 --> 00:13:03,454
- Laura has a good technique.
- Mm. Although the bottle leaks if you turn it upside down.

183
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:11,440
- I think this is one that children like and adults just don't understand.
- No, exactly.

184
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:14,440
- You don't want yours?
- No, go ahead.

185
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:18,078
I give it... ZEROOO!

186
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,699
- Me too. 0 points.
- How could you?

187
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
- What?
- Yes.

188
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:26,440
I give it 5 points. 5, 5, 5.

189
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:30,063
- 5, 5, 5!
- 0, 0, 0!

190
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,200
- 5, 5, 5...
- 0, 0, 0...

191
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,040
- And do you give it?
- 0, 0!

192
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,336
- No, Laura!
- Three against two. It's a 0.

193
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,840
"Milka Oreo"

194
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,040
It's Milka chocolate with small Oreo cookies in it.

195
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Laura is still playing with the eyeballs.

196
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,360
But this one was really good.
Everyone loves Oreo, right?

197
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,000
- No.
- What?!

198
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,440
I don't like Oreo.

199
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,040
I love Oreo, I love Milka. Perfectly mixed.
I've eaten this before. I love it.

200
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,689
- Mm-mm-mm.
- I think it tastes like dust.

201
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,903
- Dust?!
- You are not like the rest of us.

202
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:26,600
- You're a little fart.
- I'm a little fart. I'm a little fart.

203
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:31,040
- I give it 4 points.
- I give it 4 points.

204
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,640
I give it...

205
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,960
...5 points.

206
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:37,440
Five?

207
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,729
Oh my God.

208
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,685
I give this one 1 point.

209
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,960
- ONLY ONE?
- Yep!

210
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:49,876
"XXL Acid Gumetro"

211
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,640
It's some long sausage with... chewing gum!

212
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,040
- It's sour.
- Very sour.

213
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,920
Sour?

214
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:12,120
- Don't you feel it?
- No. Yes, now. It came late.

215
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,640
- Harry!
- Hey, no, no, no...

216
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,840
Oh God, how sour.

217
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,840
Here, you can have mine.

218
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,960
No.

219
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,600
- Horrible!
- I'm crying.

220
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,460
Horrible!

221
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,800
- Eww!
- Ouch, my eye.

222
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:38,520
Eww!

223
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:42,000
- You get sweaty eyelids from this candy.
- You get sweaty everywhere.

224
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,520
I give this chewing gum 3.5 points in terms of taste.

225
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,040
And I actually think this candy deserves crazy points
I give it 4 crazy points.

226
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,068
Yes, it was very crazy.
It gets only crazy points from me, 2 points. But 0 for the taste.

227
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:06,760
I give it, like, 4 crazy points, because it was pretty crazy.
It looked like Shrek poo.

228
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,119
And it was like...
The taste wasn't that good, so I give it 3 points.

229
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:21,895
- Mm. And Laura, what do you give it? Is it good to clean the toes with?
- Why is she putting it on her toes? Eww.

230
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:26,640
She's cleaning between her toes
with Alma's chewing gum over here.

231
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,640
What do you give it, Axel?

232
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:36,240
I give this 0 points.
But I give it 2 points for the packaging, so it gets 1 point.

233
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:42,762
"Boom Vampire Extra Sour"

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,464
They are small hard blue candies.

235
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,440
So hard.

236
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,840
Oh, it's so sour.

237
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,164
- Woho!
- Wohoho!

238
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,040
Oh, you're…

239
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,600
- It says "Mouth Painter."
- It turns your mouth blue.

240
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,240
- Really blue.
- No...

241
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,440
Mommy...

242
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:25,240
Oh, Laura.

243
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,040
- I give this one 0 points.
- What?!

244
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,680
- I didn't think it was fun.
- But it's crazy.

245
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,120
Yes, it was blue and it was very sour.

246
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,221
- Harry, how many points do you give it?
- I give it 500. Getting a blue tongue was super fun.

247
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:45,360
Yes. I give it 5 points. It was good, it was sour,
and I think it's fun that it stained my mouth.

248
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
I give it 3 points.

249
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,760
And you know what? This was our last candy
and the sun is setting outside.

250
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,120
Yes, so we have to wrap up and say…

251
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,440
Thank you for watching this video!

252
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,920
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

253
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:10,240
Mostly thumbs up.

254
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:13,800
- Comment...
- Ask questions, and take care.

255
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,640
And subscribe!

256
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:18,440
Take care until next time!

257
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,840
