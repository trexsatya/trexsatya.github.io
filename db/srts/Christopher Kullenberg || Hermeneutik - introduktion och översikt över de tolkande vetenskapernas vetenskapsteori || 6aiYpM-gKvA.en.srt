1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
I do

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03.072
I thought now

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07.680
Make a

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:13,824
Quick overview of what happened the bitch is and where they come from

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,384
And what there are for different variants of hermeneutics

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
And

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,504
How to be able to sleep three people with music in several ways

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
And how this can enrich

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,112
The qualitative analyzes

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,160
I will make a card

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Translate

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
Of

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Various

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,536
Central figure within hermeneutics

15
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,632
Will all German partner agreements 90s but

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
But

17
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
So

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:46,336
I will go through these quickly it will be a pretty sloppy your historical overview but on the other side so we're not here for

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,152
Idehistoria outside to be better at qualitative method

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55.808
And that's why I will raise this in a way that makes us

21
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:01,184
So that I can go ahead and use her shop in being research methods

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
And

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
Then

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
So will i go into

25
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,400
The concepts of suspicion's hermeneutics and reconciliation and hermeneutics

26
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,472
And the concept of rationality or for something

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
As

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,080
A central component of hermeneutics to understand

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
In which way someone resonates

30
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
And that can be understood in different ways in the same way

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
As I had an accident

32
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27.808
Explanation models

33
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Within the social science social sciences I had caused or the chaos

34
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
Speak the explanation model

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38.560
Caffeine in coffee Thursdays me

36
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,144
To become nicer and more concentrated

37
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
We had a functional explanation

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
The coffee break fulfills an important function

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
For students

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
Days

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,944
Geostorm space to talk small to know each other

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57.248
And slowly with surely establish trust

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03.648
And a friendly attitude to each other where one shares knowledge and cooperate or

44
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07.744
What does the coffee have for function in the social system

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09.024
Or

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10.048
One

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
So to speak

48
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
Purpose statement

49
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Christoffer

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Drinking coffee

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
In order to

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,616
Show their affiliation to this to wash

53
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Culture

54
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
Within the academy too common to stand and lecture with a cup of coffee in hand it is something that makes

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
One expresses

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,648
A way of being scientific academy, etc.

57
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
Okay three examples

58
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
The third of which in any sense and

59
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42.816
Pelvis the functional explanations

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44.608
Requires interpretation

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45.888
While

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Cause the explanations and causal relationships

63
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
The

64
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
So to speak

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,664
Is about measuring weighing and describing the forces

66
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59.712
Which creates a tennis court

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01.248
Important function

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
So

69
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
Hammarviken This music is interpretation theory interpretation theory means that we should understand

70
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Something

71
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
And

72
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,400
We must also understand something about ourselves in order to understand the one where we are to describe

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,496
The background to this

74
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Vitaby

75
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
In the 70s

76
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
So in some sense the modern home store is a

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29.920
Modern

78
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Invention

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
The modern her nail

80
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
Also have over the centuries

81
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
Been in a kind of low -intensity warfare or in what we then call for critical debate

82
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
With

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Positivism

84
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
And on several occasions pointed out that things especially when it comes to it

85
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:57,056
Social or mental life and expressed soulful journey 70's words for

86
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Social Darwinism

87
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Change a little

88
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
To understand people and what they think and think and what they write and what they talk about and so on

89
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09.856
Unable to reduce simple facts such as positivism did

90
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Without

91
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Decree

92
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Something completely different

93
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
And here also this demonstration happens in has between qualitative and quantitative method is lost

94
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
Hard sciences it is someone who eats and roads and looks at simple facts and set them up in table

95
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
Or also further the causal relationship finds one

96
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
While

97
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,735
Hermeneutics yet will represent more soft science

98
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40.063
We look at things that not necessarily

99
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,391
At the place where the mechanical scales such as

100
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47.231
Humans humans conceptions of freedom

101
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,327
Man's conceptions of the social contexts she is part of

102
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52.351
Swedbank

103
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01.567
Is important point of view not because it is important that we have to put the name Schleiermacher on

104
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05.919
The memory to probably so did not ask about it on the exam but

105
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Schleiermacher

106
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Designed

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11.551
Lonely first personally about hermeneutics

108
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Where he then

109
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
First, thought that when interpretative errors the stomach we have when interpreting the material misinterprets

110
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21.535
Not we interpret that text anything

111
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
It is

112
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:29,215
Basically a general ability that I said earlier so when we ride a tram so we know how to behave

113
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
That we know what is deviant behavior

114
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
We all know

115
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
How to ride a tram

116
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,967
It is something that rests and that has the ability to interpret and understand context than anything

117
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
As

118
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,343
Most of us at least have 99 % of all know I go tram and so on

119
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Adulthood

120
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
And so childish self to sit on

121
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,791
But already as a child like this this interpretation the ability to put things into context

122
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
Is universal

123
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01.983
It is clear that we can encounter new situations go to new places on earth where one suddenly makes completely

124
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Other things are running so just yes

125
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09.919
In Tokyo and so I would pay with my card and so handed over different like this

126
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
The card

127
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
And

128
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
Got back the card with a built in with both hands and then I realized

129
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
That I had taken with me completely wrong I had been very unusual as well as slender just raised my card and so on

130
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
And

131
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,399
Really, I would be polite and hand over one and both hands and not be as you are

132
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
When you walk on Seven Eleven on Vasagatan but actually consider that this situation may be different

133
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
When I buy one

134
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
Snickers basement coca-cola at a kiosk

135
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
If I do in Tokyo or with Gothenburg

136
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,087
As one can burst in the center high but we have anyway

137
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52.415
The ability to learn to understand the situation all the time

138
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
What the girls thought I was interested in

139
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
It is only to analyze texts

140
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Above all

141
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00.863
And

142
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04.191
In order to understand a text

143
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08.031
For example, a novel Roman Exercise Park in the 18th century

144
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
But above all what you have previously interpreted very much because you do not call it the hermeneutics modern sentence to be

145
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
Bible texts and religious texts

146
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,343
The Qur'an Torah and the Bible and so on

147
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
Have something that one constantly here interpreting to try to understand what how relate to baby

148
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Live our lives today so on

149
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
And

150
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
Then in relation to the text

151
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,007
So Schleiermacher thought that the goal of

152
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,127
The hermeneutics reconstruct the creation of it

153
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
That is

154
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
As far as possible

155
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
Repeat and repeat them

156
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
Thoughts that were behind

157
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
To

158
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03.071
Wrote about the young burr or that I do not know

159
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06.655
What are there more for novels are not good at reading books but

160
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07.935
Type

161
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09.983
Da vinci code

162
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13.567
Was written what was the writer thought behind then Vinci Code

163
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
When he wrote this way what was it

164
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,943
So which tank operations figure in the head

165
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
I recognize partly from the scientific method is like this that we try to understand

166
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
Why do any coffee drink or why vote someone for an exit from the European Union

167
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,607
Etc that are going on in the heads of these people around Europe

168
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
That makes the Soviet

169
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
We try to reconstruct their

170
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
Thoughtful or how

171
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44.031
Partly in any case

172
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
This can do this with scientific methods

173
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
And

174
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
To do it

175
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55.807
Those who say you can point it out

176
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Where

177
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02.207
If we try to understand why the North English farmer wants to get out of the EU

178
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Why

179
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06.303
Swedish Democratic voters

180
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,679
Skeptical of the after all with his folk party voters are positively attuned to the

181
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,079
Then you can go from my prejudices about Sweden Democrats People's Parties Word English Farmers and

182
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
London -based is the financier or how

183
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
Not say that much money by myself

184
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
Amber says about their performance world

185
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
So

186
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Schleiermacher

187
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Busy with the problem

188
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
Black displays oneself

189
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
If I will understand

190
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Goethe

191
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41.631
Navigate to writes their novels

192
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
You have to penetrate myself

193
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
And get good or maybe but at least to be part of it

194
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
The world of performance

195
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54.431
I have to be part of the world of performance

196
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59.807
That makes the north English farmer we go out after all

197
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02.111
To understand

198
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
The social reality

199
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
From

200
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09.535
The Conditions of the North English Farmer

201
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
How does a word in the English farmer look

202
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
On

203
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:22,335
At Brussels and politicians and how do they see the north English farmer at

204
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
Free market and so on can ask different questions and

205
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
Slowly with surely we know if we train ourselves

206
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Farmer's

207
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
By the way

208
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
And

209
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
Stamp back

210
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
Yr.no

211
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Part

212
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
Putting a whole it is only by understanding

213
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Pay

214
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
The context

215
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
By a Northern English farmer

216
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
As we can understand the individual phenomenon

217
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,223
Participate in Wilhelm Delta in was also finally after

218
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,599
And he builds on the idea you can say that

219
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Have some kind of empathy

220
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09.951
As a method

221
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Solar

222
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
In the same way as that

223
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Schleiermacher

224
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
Chiquito Z Express itself

225
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
So

226
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,287
Workers Bill Time with the initial understanding

227
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,663
To get into someone else's situation Visättra We cannot become the individual

228
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
The farmer

229
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
John Smith

230
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
But on the other hand

231
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,135
So we can live in this person's situation context context

232
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,695
Or social reality

233
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
We can live in what I ask

234
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Yes it borders on empathy one could say

235
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58.847
Absolutely even though empathy also contains is a little more than just

236
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01.407
Understanding or empathy

237
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Yes, just

238
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,599
Lot as well and so this machine components were

239
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
This person is suffering here

240
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
And then i suffer with that person almost

241
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
And also empathy often a prerequisite for doing something about it that a human being lies, etc.

242
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,983
Yes, of course it is quite close to a battery and

243
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
In order to be empathetic and one must be able to get into another person's situation

244
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Absolutely

245
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
Participants and bread for a quote I don't know on German original

246
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
But a discussion here between science and social sciences or natural sciences and those who lived in German

247
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
So Geist Wissenschaft

248
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Kjell's sciences

249
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
As

250
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,983
Decor sometimes translates to the humanities but also is

251
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Includes

252
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01.311
Parts of the social sciences

253
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
We explain nature

254
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05.151
We remember

255
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06.687
Cause explanations

256
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,295
We remember the other plans the types but above all causal explanation gladly

257
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
The causal explanations

258
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,487
To explain why something happens why does the cup fall to the ground when letting it

259
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Yes

260
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
One

261
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,119
You can explain this with gravity Newton's laws

262
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Etc

263
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32.031
Soul life or those who want a little more modern you can call for the social life

264
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Is something that we are going to understand

265
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,223
Explain Understanding to explain science understanding how to science and social science

266
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
The survey

267
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Try again

268
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
One

269
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Distinction

270
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
As

271
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,487
Characterizes much of the philosophical debate of science during the 19th century

272
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
And to Thai

273
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56.607
Is also

274
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
The person behind the mysterious circle

275
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59.935
As

276
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
Wikipedia method literature

277
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04.031
The hermeneutic circle

278
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05.311
What is

279
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07.103
The hermeneutic circle

280
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
Will drive to you when I say that the hermeneutic circle is basically the relationship between part and wholeness through unit is something

281
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
Now is starting to get tired of

282
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
But that's it

283
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
But

284
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
What is meant by this really there is a component in

285
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
The hermeneutic circle as absolutely central

286
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
The understanding

287
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Son

288
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
When I end up

289
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
An Easter bunny

290
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
So

291
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Occurs

292
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,711
Knowledge in a kind of gap between me and they examine

293
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
In the same way

294
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
As the North English Farmer's

295
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,463
Attitude toward the arises between the farmer and the farmer context

296
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
We have

297
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
Double part of the whole relationship here

298
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00.607
And what to do

299
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
If we are to follow dill pie

300
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,079
Is to become part of the farmer's performance world I will live in it

301
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,711
And then I'll get back and have to account for it and then it becomes qualitative science

302
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Odeta

303
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Should I

304
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Idiot do

305
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
A type of

306
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Circular movement

307
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29.535
What do you do at home circle a circle a good concepts i would be spiral that i will soon be made

308
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
It might be one

309
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
Spiral changed a circle

310
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
So

311
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Let's say I travel to England

312
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,567
Trips to northern England and start interviewing farmers and with u

313
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
I'll come then

314
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Understanding

315
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Or prejudice

316
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,503
I come and have my showing world

317
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
If

318
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52.831
What means to be a farmer in northern England

319
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
I come forward

320
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02.047
And is not starting to bid to talk and maybe even live with the farmers here I spend

321
00:16:02.303 --> 00:16:03.071
Months

322
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
In theirs

323
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05.119
What

324
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06.911
Where is working on

325
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,983
How to measure how to sleep how then

326
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,615
The weekends etc I try to gain a total understanding of their social reality

327
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,735
Then my past prejudices will come my understanding

328
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
To

329
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,159
Is characterized and slowly displaced by the fact that I take part in this second understanding

330
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
I get one step closer

331
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
Northern English farmer

332
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
And what happens to my prejudice when I meet

333
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
The light of something new

334
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,799
If you can come home with my prejudice new as well as teach me new things about what means to be an angel

335
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45.567
Peasant

336
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Interpreters

337
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
It changes it in hospital

338
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
It is found on menu knowledge

339
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56.063
And some of my performances that I had

340
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
For example

341
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59.647
All enough English farmers

342
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,743
Smelling strange because they are out and keep up with all day

343
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Maybe it

344
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
Falls in the light of new knowledge

345
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,679
I see that the peasants in northern England they do

346
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:17,055
Very much with paperwork finances to make their companies go around

347
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:23,455
Nordic farmers who are very active in local politics north English farmers perhaps also

348
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
Do completely different things that don't even involve animals they may not deal with it

349
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,207
Just up breeding sheep and such things one can do with tourism and such things

350
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,023
I learn lots of new things about Nordic farmers

351
00:17:38.303 --> 00:17:39,839
And my parts

352
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
And my prejudice

353
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Can be crushed

354
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Others can be strengthened

355
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
But no matter what so my understanding changes

356
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,591
And this is the exciting happy to snack

357
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
And circle movement anyway

358
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
Makes us imagine

359
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
That we start she is the starting point

360
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59.807
Here I have only my

361
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00.831
Performances

362
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07.231
About Swedish peasants English farmers French farmers French Babblarna's notion that they are going and demonstrating in Paris Hill

363
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
A few days now, only two of the French farmers do this but it is the only thing shown on TV about Swedish farmers

364
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,495
That and romantically fine vineyards and such things

365
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,103
Way I have updated resource price mode so I have it the knowledge that

366
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Connects I have

367
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455
I go to England not we have the farmers

368
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29.503
30 back again and

369
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
Clothes and not to the same place

370
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
By far a new flat

371
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:38,463
Turn off new knowledge New understanding maybe new prejudice new knowledge of something

372
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Since

373
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
Passed that they should return to the peasants

374
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Continue

375
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
Based on a new understanding horizon

376
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Are you in

377
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
Commute back and forth and this I don't matter how to do interviews when interviews and in the past

378
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
On reads about that

379
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,735
Think more about what why answer

380
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04.831
Or if i text analysis you return to a text man interpret

381
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,671
Because you read policy decision -making is and will interpret them

382
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09.695
Or

383
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Legislative texts

384
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
Or you read different report

385
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
Etc

386
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:21,215
You analyze these with something special that we focus on something that is already issues

387
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,127
Then you can interpret the text and interpret the text to interpret the text you can keep on this

388
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
The monks of medieval Europe

389
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:35,551
Keeps up with their entire life interpreting the Bible etc. Returned Return Returned

390
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
All the time then

391
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
So change

392
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
The understanding because we fill up a new meeting with the text with man with interviews

393
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,095
With the culture that becomes studying them in anthropologists

394
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Or

395
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:55,775
I return return we return to be heard again and retrieve circular movement that may not be a circular movement

396
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:01.151
Ways we can never get back to the same point a circle walks around around or how

397
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
Rather be seen as a kind of spiral movement

398
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
Where we hopefully

399
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,391
Gain a better understanding of you north English farmer

400
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Or the one

401
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
19th century benefit or a no policy document or yet

402
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,727
Investigation that was made up of a department or whatever it is we write an essay or research on or how

403
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Spiral circle movement

404
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:35,199
Is that as before our knowledge and makes the more scientific literature Petter

405
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,111
We continue into the 20th century and he at home after interface curtains

406
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
His Georg Gadamer

407
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
I think

408
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
And

409
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52.607
Gadamer

410
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
Was very critical of methods where sounds a bit strange

411
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
But Gadamer

412
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
He took home the music

413
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
Further

414
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05.407
To a level

415
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,015
To also include reflection on

416
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12.831
How we as a researcher go about

417
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
In this

418
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,184
The hermeneutic circle or what we should now call that spiral

419
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
About mine

420
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,864
Research you are about Nordic farmers

421
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
So I have a number of method rules because I will do it may have set up interview questions I might have with

422
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,408
Tape recorder i may have different things i imagine this of this this i shall look at

423
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,504
Here my analysis schedule this is my method of accessing you

424
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,344
Is the attitude of the Nordic countries to the European cooperation

425
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
I have

426
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
This

427
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
With me when I sit on the airplane at Landvetter and go to Gatwick 11 Avenue ended up somewhere

428
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,120
And a few hundred

429
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,984
Kilos of carbon dioxide later find me England and I have so to speak too

430
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
Research methods

431
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07.104
Are, after all, impregnated by an understanding

432
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Hello

433
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,992
We create our questions and issues based on something that we

434
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
Have read or

435
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,136
Taken to us at the education etc I learned some method and so yes but

436
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26.304
Qualitative content analysis Jajamen Discourse Analysis This is how you do a qualitative interview so here that people Cup's interview

437
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
It says that you should do this and here and here

438
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
SMS: a

439
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
No

440
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,288
We must also rely on reflecting then her

441
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
To our methods

442
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Namely

443
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
When we

444
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
Meets what we study

445
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,784
If it is Nordängen's farmer or an investigation text or policy document

446
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Which

447
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
So we must be prepared to revise our methods as well

448
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
While we are researching

449
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
It might very well be like that

450
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
That I think I should

451
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,656
Ask five questions to the Nordic farmers that this will give me the answer to why they don't like

452
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04.704
But once I get there

453
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
So i discover to

454
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09.056
The question is misbehaved

455
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
Is not about

456
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,712
Complicated biographical papers from Brussels one had to fill in

457
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,296
It is not at all about what this is about instead

458
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,136
The nation's self -determination and the right to have a

459
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,488
Not to influence so that the decisions are made far away something there

460
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
The question of wrong

461
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
And the way I analyze it on

462
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,448
Nor was it very well in line with the reality I met when I went to northern England

463
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
Saga number said

464
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
We

465
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,640
Must also think about our own methods

466
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
And puts

467
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
As we, so to speak

468
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,552
Transforms a Nordängens peasant game study object

469
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
And

470
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01.024
Because otherwise we do

471
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02.560
Say the mistakes that

472
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08.704
Hemnet Fristad had accused positivism of reducing to study objects

473
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
An English farmer

474
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13.568
Setting to U.

475
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
The

476
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Have

477
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,432
Depends on these they find we

478
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,272
That set a consequence if we ask these five questions

479
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
What if there are six questions

480
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
Or what if it's just a completely different question

481
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
Which is actually closer to the truth

482
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
These

483
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,328
Särdal 5 things on the checklist that we thought we would

484
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Do that

485
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:43,008
We must, so to speak, as her think interpretative and within the qualitative method Anna was soft in

486
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
For the fact of being

487
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,408
Research instruments may have to change during the course of work

488
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,528
And when you conduct interviews, for example, I use qualitative interview

489
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Then you will

490
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,600
Hopefully discover this

491
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:04,000
Bread before we write an essay that we know how to deal with this problem but you return and so

492
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,328
Press Play on the tape recorder and then you get on

493
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,448
Wait now I would I have asked a completely different thing here really it now realizes 41 degrees

494
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,800
We humans and we come on afterwards were mistakes

495
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
Idiot way so we are in a circle

496
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,968
Movement and can return and ask new questions, etc.

497
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,856
Practical reasons so you are kind so they have booked an interview that does not want to disturb people anymore and so you just say

498
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,952
35 weeks to write c-thesis etc so that

499
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,792
This is something that rather must speak reflective before

500
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
One that one can necessarily

501
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
Do if things say

502
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Pam

503
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Another concept as new

504
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
Perhaps encounter in the literature

505
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Whether they read

506
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,040
Method literature or you read as more overall texts

507
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,600
The concept of understanding

508
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Horizon or

509
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Horizon

510
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Fusion

511
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
And

512
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,912
Sometimes harvests a little fluffy concept that it is often used a bit sloppy but

513
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
The goal with

514
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,288
The hermeneutic survey

515
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
Is it completely different

516
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Schleiermacher

517
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
Displacement of oneself

518
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
Horizon melting

519
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,368
Does not necessarily mean that I like this

520
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,184
Will it be the English farmer.

521
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
What thinks just like him

522
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
As I like this

523
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
There are probably opportunities we can become other people and so on because in some sense there is

524
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,520
Individuality that changes this I can never become

525
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Exactly

526
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
I study

527
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Yet scientists are like

528
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
I do not know

529
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59.968
Research about

530
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02.016
Something and

531
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,856
Like becoming very friendly and positively set and perhaps become

532
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07.904
See the messages themselves culture

533
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12.512
What is in anthropology is called go native when one becomes one of

534
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,840
One that culture that one is studying

535
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,448
Without horizon meltdown is rather about

536
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
Atman

537
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
So to speak

538
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,616
Can take to stand on that horizon

539
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
As
