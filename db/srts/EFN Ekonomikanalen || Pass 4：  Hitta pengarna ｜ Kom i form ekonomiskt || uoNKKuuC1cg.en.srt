00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,400
-Today we will talk about income. -Yes.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,480
-You really like income. -You too.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09.040
-You are crazy in income. -No, you are.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,840
I have to keep track of my finances now.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,240
Mia IngelstrÃ¶m is not only an economist, she is also a personal trainer in economics.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,200
Yes, you hear. Should we start this?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,240
Hello. Here Mia and me and "Chitchattar" are about economics.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,800
-Nice. -Yes is not it?

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39.560
-Today we will talk about income. -Yes.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,880
-You really like income. -You too.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,600
-You are crazy in income. -No, you are.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,160
I like expenses.

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,280
-Do you know which ones earn the least? -Women.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:01.040
That's right. According to Statistics Sweden, the average salary for women is 35,100.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06.560
And for men: 39,000. Boring.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,840
-Very. -A structural societal problems in part.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,480
We should not talk about that here. We teach both men and women to maximize their income-

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,120
-So that you can have a safer life and earn some penny here and there.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,280
That's right, but things can be done yourself to reduce the gap ...

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,640
-Jeimability? -Yes. When you want to create a family ...

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39.560
... you should also talk about how you want it within the family.

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,760
You discuss parental allowance, try to share equally on parental leave ...

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
Vab and those parts ... how much you are away from the labor market often determine-

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,440
-How much lower salary you receive. And it remains to the pension.

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00.040
A little tip. What should we talk about more?

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,200
About negotiating and also about investing.

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,280
The red thread is to try to do more of what you already have.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,680
-And make better use of it. -My large income is of course the salary.

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,880
What can you do about it? Is it as it is?

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:27,240
Both. You should start talking about the salary. Taboo in Sweden. We hardly do it ...

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,000
-. even with our partner. -Who should I talk to?

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,720
With friends, colleagues and test ... Is your salary good?

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,120
With my colleagues I should not talk. It creates a boring atmosphere at work.

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,280
-Is it not so anyway? -No.

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,440
Many people wonder about colleagues' salary. That's a problem.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,560
Sure you can choose to talk to some-

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,360
-But you have to get a feeling for the possibility of improvement.

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00.880
And who benefits from not talking about the salary?

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04.560
-The employer. -Yes, and you're probably losing it.

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,600
In order for you to receive incentives to negotiate wage-

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,760
-with the employer and see if you can get other benefits ...

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,440
... you have to start somewhere. And then you need to know how you are.

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,400
"How to negotiate your salary." Many such tips are available.

44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,440
I never succeed. The manager says how much I get according to the collective agreement.

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:40,760
And then it is. I say: Yes, but he earns Si and she so ...

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,520
"Yes, but this is what is there."

47
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Do you know that there is nothing more to negotiate, it is good.

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,400
Then you can choose. "Is it good enough or should I go somewhere else?"

49
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,720
The choice is yours. If you choose to remain, you have chosen it.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,320
You choose to be satisfied with what you have.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05.840
I tried to change it, it couldn't, but I choose to stay.

52
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08.800
Just that, you have to do it. Not be bitter.

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,200
-Just. -Lite bitter coffee, maybe?

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,640
No, but good coffee.

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24.560
It was the salary and some ways to raise it.

56
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,760
But you also have some money that lies and lurks at home.

57
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,920
-Som just lies there ... -Absolutely.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
How much do you have in the wind?

59
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Around 15,000 or more we have on average in the wind or in the basement-

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,600
-What could be realized. Not bad.

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,920
In the short term, but I want to talk about something else ... in the long term.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,600
To invest and make money from it.
