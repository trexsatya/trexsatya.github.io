1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,080
The US economy is tough, but not so much that the Fed must slow down further.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,440
Fed left as expected interest rate unchanged.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,320
And there is no new course switching from Fed when listening to Powell & Company.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,680
The next temperature meter for the US economy will be the country's employment data on Friday.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,200
American "PayRolls" that in September grew significantly faster than expected-

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,120
-All await figures showing a slightly clearer cooling off the US economy.

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,200
And it is needed, still wage growth is for high-

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,680
-To be compatible with the inflation target of 2 %.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,200
And we probably also need a rising unemployment over time.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,160
It is not expected from Friday's figures.
 We'll see what's coming.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,160
We do not expect more interest rate hikes from Fed, ECB, Bank of England or Norway's bank.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,280
But we still expect the Riksbank to raise 25 points in connection with the November meeting-

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
-To because of too high inflation and too weak crown.
