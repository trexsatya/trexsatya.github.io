00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:01,845
Hello

2
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:05,235
Today I was going to talk about the word

3
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:07,965
repertoire

4
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:10,795
and how it can help us think

5
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:13,575
around learning language

6
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:16,515
Both about vocabulary

7
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:19,555
and about the social function of language

8
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:22,305
to get in touch, to get to know people

9
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:23,405
to talk to different people

10
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:27,285
So repertoire, how to explain it?

11
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,365
Well a good example of repertoire

12
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:31,605
It's a musician

13
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:35,335
A musician can have a wide repertoire

14
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:38,695
This means that person can play

15
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:41,515
Many different pieces of music

16
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:44,605
or many different styles of music

17
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,105
Then that person has a wide repertoire

18
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:50,015
A large repertoire

19
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:53,065
If you have a narrow repertoire, then you can only play a few

20
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:56,025
pieces, not so many

21
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:58,615
or maybe just a special style

22
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,715
You are not so flexible, you don't have that many.

23
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:03,115
different ways of doing something

24
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:06,455
So you can think about that

25
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:09,375
in language too, that you have a broad repertoire

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,340
you know many different words and you can talk in

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,320
Many different situations

28
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:15,775
You can cope with many different contexts

29
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,795
Then you have a wide repertoire linguistically

30
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:22,135
If you have a narrower repertoire then maybe you

31
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:25,535
Customers certain types of calls

32
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:27,165
but not so many others

33
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:30,165
my

34
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,795
Teacher buddy Maria Fredriksson

35
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:36,025
usually talk about having a closet

36
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:39,335
so her comparison is a closet

37
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:42,645
where you want many different types of clothing

38
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:45,455
For many different contexts

39
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:48,405
party clothes, musk clothes, workout clothes

40
00:01:48,405 --> 00:01:50,925
perhaps

41
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,975
tough clothes for a special party

42
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:56,025
and so on, you want clothes that fit

43
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,495
In many different situations

44
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:01,355
It's about the same thought, you have a wide

45
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:03,005
repertoire of clothing

46
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:05,815
We can think of repertoire

47
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:08,585
In connection with vocabulary

48
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:11,065
that I want a wide repertoire

49
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,555
of words so I can talk

50
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,905
For example in formal contexts

51
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:17,835
in informal contexts

52
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,735
that I have words that fit at the coffee table

53
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:23,385
at work, that I have words that fit

54
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:26,515
When I study Swedish in school and so on

55
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:29,785
It can be about both understanding formal words,

56
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:33,145
everyday words and hose for example

57
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:36,245
so there is clear and obvious

58
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:39,105
that we need a wide repertoire

59
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,315
of different words

60
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:44,055
But I also think we can

61
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:46,985
Talk about a social repertoire

62
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:50,455
and it is more about a broader social

63
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:51,455
competence

64
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,995
and that we can be socially competent

65
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:57,985
In a situation but less socially competent

66
00:02:57,985 --> 00:02:59,965
in other situations

67
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,545
So for example

68
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,995
for my own part if I go to a concert

69
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:07,855
So I know how to behave and I talk to people

70
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,265
and I talk to people so I have easy knowing what to talk about

71
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,255
I go on a football match so I know

72
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:15,255
not what

73
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:18,305
I'll do there, how it works

74
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:21,255
And I'm not sure about how to talk about football

75
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:24,345
with people because it's nothing I

76
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:25,985
Can be especially good

77
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:29,775
and I think that this is the case that

78
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:32,915
master different types of situations social

79
00:03:32,915 --> 00:03:35,715
becomes a much larger

80
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,145
challenge when learning a new language and it becomes

81
00:03:39,295 --> 00:03:41,905
an even greater challenge if you also

82
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:45,275
comes from a culture that does not resemble the Swedish

83
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:48,665
so this is something you need

84
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,715
think about and I think there is

85
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:54,705
two slightly different situations

86
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:57,845
that you need to think about

87
00:03:57,845 --> 00:03:58,845
And work out

88
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:02,185
One is when a social

89
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:03,725
Context in Sweden

90
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,375
similar to something you recognize

91
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:10,445
from your native language and your home culture

92
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:12,995
Take for example if you usually go to church

93
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:16,405
In your home country and so you want to go to church in Sweden

94
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:19,705
Then maybe many things are about the same

95
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:22,725
But you still need to learn

96
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:25,695
a little cultural things and also a lot of language

97
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:28,135
So how do you say different

98
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:30,345
phrases and sentences

99
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:33,275
and what are different things in a church are called

100
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:36,395
This you need to learn in Swedish but it is a bit more like a

101
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:39,265
translation, you can compare

102
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:41,975
the Swedish context with something

103
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:44,705
that is familiar from your home country

104
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:47,975
But something else is.

105
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:51,325
that in Sweden you will meet at

106
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,315
different social situations and different

107
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:57,765
Types of calls that you can't at all

108
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,105
relate to something

109
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:02,495
In your home culture or in your mother tongue

110
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:06,095
It can be anything from culture

111
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:08,885
to society, to politics, to only

112
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:11,905
special places you meet at

113
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:14,535
or special ways one was hanging out on

114
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:18,295
And then it is a bigger challenge for then

115
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:20,765
Do you need to understand

116
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:23,675
this social situation

117
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:26,485
What do Swedes usually talk about

118
00:05:26,485 --> 00:05:27,675
by the afternoon coffee

119
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,105
which subjects fit to take up

120
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:33,975
How can I take them up

121
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:37,125
What subjects do you usually talk about

122
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:40,435
do I need to get a certain cultural

123
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:43,115
general education to cope with

124
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,665
with this group

125
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,295
in this context

126
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,265
and

127
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,515
Here it will be a matter of

128
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:54,955
what contexts you are in

129
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:58,065
where you are, what people you meet

130
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:01,105
and what people you want to meet and want to get to know

131
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:03,855
for it is clear that

132
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,615
If you want to blend in and be able to participate

133
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:09,215
active in a social context

134
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:12,285
Then you need to start getting those tools

135
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:13,285
that makes

136
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:16,065
you can be involved at real

137
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:18,925
And it's very much about language then

138
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:21,925
And to know both words and concepts.
 and

139
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,495
Ordinary sentences

140
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:26,465
but also know different references

141
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:28,465
that are common in that group

142
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,845
whatever it may be, it may be about

143
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,415
football or it may be about

144
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:36,995
film or it may be about politics

145
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,125
It all depends on

146
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:41,685
But when I listen to

147
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:44,975
calls in different groups

148
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,915
In Sweden I hear all the time

149
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:51,015
How different references

150
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:54,045
to culture and sports and society and so on

151
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,765
It is part of the social interaction

152
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:00,345
and do you want a wide repertoire

153
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:03,215
In Swedish, ie a social

154
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,025
Swedish, a broad social repertoire

155
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,125
In Swedish, then you need to start getting yourself

156
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,495
This type of social general education also because

157
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:15,625
Don't always have to ask: What is it?

158
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,675
I have never heard;
 I don't know that

159
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:21,785
or to become silent because there is

160
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,495
too many things that are new to you

161
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:27,905
This is a long process of course

162
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,745
But if one is aware of it

163
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:32,805
so can you start working on it

164
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:35,675
and just this that

165
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,495
see it as to

166
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,925
There are so many different contexts

167
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:43,445
and groups and different people

168
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:46,645
where different linguistic requirements are set

169
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:49,775
It's not the same language

170
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:53,275
and it's not the same reference world

171
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:56,025
In all these different contexts

172
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:59,695
This can of course be felt

173
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:00,695
null

174
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:02,905
A little overwhelming

175
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:04,895
a bit much

176
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:07,315
But we need too

177
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:10,145
be honest with the challenge as a person

178
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:13,165
is facing if one is to

179
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:16,235
learn to interact with people

180
00:08:16,235 --> 00:08:18,395
In a country on their native language

181
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:22,115
not on the same terms

182
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,915
But on a little more equal terms

183
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:28,515
so anything we can think of

184
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:31,555
perhaps discuss more, that is

185
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:34,895
What strategies can you have, when we now have this map

186
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:38,745
I need a broad social repertoire if I want

187
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:41,815
function in many different contexts

188
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:44,765
It is very difficult at the beginning of a new language

189
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:48,085
so there are strategies we can use

190
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,775
during the trip

191
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:54,095
In the process to do well

192
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:56,765
Before we, so to speak, have

193
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:59,285
provided us this wide repertoire

194
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:02,015
It's a question to you, it's a question to me

195
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:05,055
It is a question we can discuss and return to

196
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:06,515
In a later movie

197
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:08,135
null

198
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:11,455
I thank me for so long, hope that this movie

199
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:14,465
gave some new thoughts, commenting giant

200
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:17,655
come with your input, your reflections

201
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:19,645
and so we'll see you again soon

202
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:22,195
have it so good, hello hey
