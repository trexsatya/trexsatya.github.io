1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,360
Okay, Edwin, we'll pick you up when you're done at the Social Media Agency.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,280
Perfect Beautiful Amazing Digital Media AB? They are fantastic.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,880
-Oh thank you! Thanks! -Absolutely.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,320
What do they want you to do?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,400
I'll just be my amazing self.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,680
They have been very clear.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,800
They are impressed with how natural the fab I am.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,200
What are you going to do then?

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,920
A commercial collaboration? Should you say things for money?

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,280
Probably, but is it not wrong to make some money?

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,000
No, but it may be good if your followers know if you tip about something-

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,720
-Sore you like it or because you get money for it.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,960
If you want to be a free voice-

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,960
-Is it important that there is a limit when you are-

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,400
-And when you get paid to say something.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02.600
We talk a little about the role of money in the modern media landscape.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07.440
-Sure, but late. Now I have to go. -Okay! Call if you need anything.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,400
Ah okay.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,400
They don't seem to have it olyxis.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,920
It was something completely different from the old news editor.

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,920
It has not been so good for the news magazines lately.

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,000
Otherwise it used to be, Åsa!

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,960
Then the newspapers were so lonely about the advertising money.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,960
If the shoe store in Flen wanted to put in an ad they had no other choice-

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,480
-An to do it in the local news magazine.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,280
People subscribed to the newspaper for they wanted to know what happened-

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,880
-And then they saw the ads.

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02.600
You? I didn't know that T-liquor was good for so much.

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08.240
Today when companies want to advertise ... My God, what there are competitors!

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,800
There are social media companies, search engines, influencers.

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,760
And damn and his aunt, my God ...

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,920
The money that went to do journalism-

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,520
-and to make media owners happy now go largely to large tech companies-

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,120
-When Facebook or Google.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,240
It's Edwin. - Hello Hello! Do you already miss us?

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,480
Nah. They think I'm a superstar and want to make a sponsorship collaboration-

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,120
-So I need help with some questions.

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,800
Sponsor, you say. Mm ...

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,480
We just talked about the declining numbers for old newspapers-

40
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,440
-Sitizing new rising tech companies.

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,760
There are social media profiles that flourish at the expense of old media.

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,280
There is reason to talk about it, the old and the new world.

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09.040
Do not worry. I bring you into the new world. You become my advisors.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
-Hurray. -So it is not enough for you?

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,280
Are you too nice to be advertising -financed?

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,200
No, almost all media is commercial.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,160
It has been journalists for a long time.

48
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,880
With the exception of public service, SVT, SR, UR-

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,520
-As paid with tax money, not through business.

50
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
-There the state controls the content. -No! It does the editors!

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,640
As on all media it is the responsible publisher-

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,280
-which is a special role on an editorial ...

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,520
It can be sentenced to prison for what is published.

54
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,880
That person is often quite nippy that everything is getting right.

55
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,240
But in the media houses, someone sits on the money and it decides well?

56
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,160
Well, it determines some things, but not over the content.

57
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06.560
Then there are in the new world a couple of new kinds of media owners-

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,080
-What do not understand that journalists must be independent of the owners.

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,120
It has stormed some around the news site Bulletin.

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,480
They have not respected editorial integrity.

61
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,000
They have exerted pressure on the responsible publisher.

62
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,160
It was intended as some kind of new, large newspaper project.

63
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,120
Sweden's New York Times. Known opinion writers had been recruited.

64
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,840
Then it passed three months, and then the world's conflict arose-

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,400
-And many of the famous writers pulled. They had had enough!

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,400
The conflict was between the editorial staff and the owner.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,640
The owners may not agree, but the conflict was nevertheless.

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
I have to go back now.

69
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,720
Can you notice if something is sneaky advertising on social media?

70
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes, if they write that, often recurring: "Test this!"

71
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,920
"I got this home, and that's the best I've tested!"

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,720
It is difficult if it is a sneak advertising because you should not notice.

73
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,800
You can watch a video and so have someone set up nocco bottles or something-

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,760
-Giantfint in the background. They say nothing, but you see it.

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,320
Or that they have a sweater on and you see adidas. After all, it is visible.

76
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,520
That they talk about their own companies without saying that it is advertising.

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,480
Subscriptions and advertising is not the only way-

78
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,240
-Financing journalism. They can make money through Swish.

79
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,200
Via Patreon, that you get money directly from your readers.

80
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,960
It is made by podcasts, game makers, so why not journalism?

81
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,520
-It gets just as good for that. -The risk is in itself ...

82
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05.920
When you get money for each individual job, the risk is that you just do job-

83
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,640
-As you know that readers react to when it is linked to the money.

84
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,600
This also plays a role in the fake world.

85
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,480
I interviewed a guy who had a fake page.

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,120
I asked why there were so many stories about immigration.

87
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,400
He said it gave him traffic. Angry clicks provide traffic.

88
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,840
People get into the page where he has ads and it gives him money.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,480
That "clickbaita" is something that is done on the entire board.

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,120
This is done by serious media in the same way as on the fake sites.

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,720
Oh, it's Edwin! - Hello Hello! How is it going?

92
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,680
It's going superb! We talk about agreements and sponsors, but ...

93
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,640
Are there any rules? I have some vague memory of talking about it.

94
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,160
Absolutely. This is how it says in the rules of the game for journalists:

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00.880
"Make sure that journalism and advertising cannot be mixed together."

96
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04.440
-No you should not receive gifts. -Just. This applies to journalists.

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08.440
One should not receive gifts, presents or other-

98
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,360
-"which makes it possible to question one's role"-

99
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,520
-"As a standalone, independent, independent journalist".

100
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,760
There must be examples of journalists who have done so. Or?

101
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,080
Yes. So it is, unfortunately.

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,280
But I'm not a journalist. It's a heavenly talk about journalists!

103
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,080
No, but you want credibility to your readers, followers, viewers?

104
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,280
If you are going to advertise, you will have to mark it out clearly.

105
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,320
The Consumer Agency did some review of fifty influencers in the area-

106
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,840
-And found some flaws.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,720
Views are protected by freedom of expression-

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,040
-But if you advertise, the Marketing Act applies.

109
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52.640
Then you need to clearly mark your post marketing something.

110
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,920
Okay! I say "in collaboration with" ...

111
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00.120
And remember that "in collaboration with" does not act as advertising marking.

112
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02.240
Ah! What should I say then?

113
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,720
You can send a signal and hear with them at the Consumer Agency directly.

114
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08.880
Yes!

115
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,920
My name is Charlotte Söderlund and I work as a lawyer at the Consumer Agency.

116
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,920
One can mark up posts in social media-

117
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,040
-for example. By using an explicit marking-

118
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,920
-If the post contains advertising, and that you place the marking-

119
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,160
-Clear and prominent. It is also important to remember-

120
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,640
-The social media channels can both contain personal opinions-

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,600
-and advertising. Personal views are protected by freedom of expression-

122
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,120
-But it doesn't advertise. As a follower one should be able to choose-

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,280
-Do not continue reading a post containing advertising-

124
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,320
-To advertising basically has a purpose to influence us.

125
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,520
We have conducted a review of some fifty influencers posts.

126
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,840
We have seen that there is a great risk that there is post-

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,360
-Which contains hidden marketing, which is not allowed.

128
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,400
Several of the posts have sometimes had a advertising marker-

129
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,200
-But the marking has not proven to be sufficient.

130
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,920
It may have been too small or hidden.

131
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,720
The important thing in an advertising marking is that it becomes clear to followers-

132
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,280
-Th the influencer has been paid to publish the post-

133
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,960
-And the advertising marking is clearly visible. It is e.g. not enough-

134
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
-To use the advertising marking "in collaboration with".

135
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,760
The Court has considered it not to say in a sufficiently clear way-

136
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,080
-That the influencer has been paid.

137
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
In the past, advertising was a little more straight.

138
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,280
For the teeth well, you should buy pepsodent

139
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,800
-No remember ... -Pepsodent!

140
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,240
Right?

141
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,480
Thanks, Sture. And thank you, please Marabou ...

142
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,720
... for the new milk chocolate.

143
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,320
Nowadays it is a little more mixed forms, if you say so.

144
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,320
Suddenly an ad looks like an article on a news site-

145
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,200
-or so you have put in something there-

146
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,840
-To look like the editorial staff has written it.

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,280
"Native Advertising, Advertorials, Branded Content ..."

148
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,600
There are a lot of English expressions in this world.

149
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,400
It is in different ways advertising, and not independent journalism.

150
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,440
It should look like journalism because people are so tired of advertising-

151
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
-So that they instead make it look like journalism.

152
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,080
Therefore, maybe everyone does not print this so superbly.

153
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,520
But you must not do so. Hidden marketing is prohibited.

154
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,160
It should be clear to readers and viewers that it is advertising.

155
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,600
Some influencers have gone there. Most recently Therése Lindgren-

156
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,480
-With a million followers on Instagram.

157
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,960
She was convicted that she had not clearly noticed enough that it was advertising.

158
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01.880
In the new media landscape of influencers and youtubers, etc.-

159
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,440
-To some advertising that risks being addressed to people who are unauthorized.

160
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,720
Surely it was a pretty big campaign for that just recently?

161
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,160
17 consumer organizations in Europe have written a report-

162
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,440
-To show several examples that there is hidden advertising in the app.

163
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,880
In France, laws have been enacted around influencers.

164
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,240
As of April, French influencers risks up to five years in prison

165
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,200
-If they use their children for financial purposes on social media.

166
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,320
There has been a discussion about that in Sweden as well.

167
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,200
How is it okay to show pictures of their children in social media?

168
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,240
Me and the pearl - Alex, my husband - we have discussed-

169
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,800
-and have come to the conclusion that we do not want our son Elvis-

170
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,720
-Do join our social media anymore.

171
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,840
Some are actively trying to become influencers too-

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,960
— because of getting up to a follow-up that makes them current-

173
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,760
-For "sponsored collaborations", etc., and they scares no means.

174
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09.800
On Facebook and Instagram there have been large "shark groups"-

175
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,480
-Where you have boosted each other with followers. They have said:

176
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,960
"Here's my account. Follow me!" And so they have been laid and followed.

177
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,160
Then you have, like divided everyone's followers into a large pot.

178
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,960
It's not exactly the same thing as someone shows genuine interest-

179
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,440
-Alt if there are real people who have pressed the Like button.

180
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,800
No, exactly. Advertisers who want to cooperate with influencers-

181
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,400
-As interested in REACH which is authentic, for real.

182
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,360
They want to reach out to real people. They may not be completely satisfied-

183
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,640
-If it's some kind of divided shock.

184
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,280
Now then? Hello!

185
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,520
-Otherwise, we're ready. I'm safe! -Oh really? Oh, congratulations!

186
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,320
-We drive away and pick you up, then. -Okay!

187
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56.560
When we talk about Källkoll it is important to know-

188
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,160
-If a message is genuine or not.

189
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,000
In some cases, the sender is simply not independent.

190
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,640
It can be about money.

191
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,440
Editorial integrity is important. There are rules for journalists-

192
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,800
-To their independence cannot be questioned.

193
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,280
In the rules of the game for press, radio and television, there are rules against text advertising:

194
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,000
Something that looks to come from the editor-

195
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,640
-But really is a message that someone has paid for.

196
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,640
In social media it is difficult to determine-

197
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,520
-What are sponsored messages and not.

198
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,320
But the rules are clear: one must not be fooled in advertising-

199
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,240
-And you must not be fooled about who is behind the advertising.
