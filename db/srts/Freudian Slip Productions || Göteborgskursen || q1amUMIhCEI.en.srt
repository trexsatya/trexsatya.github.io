00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Every year some people move to Gothenburg, where it is easy to fit in.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,160
But an introduction can be nice,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,340
so that is why we have created the Gothenburg course.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:09,840
Hello or!

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
Welcome to the Gothenburg course!

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,840
So damn pumped to see where you're coming from!

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,500
You can start!

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,420
Stockholm.

9
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,400
Fuck off!

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,780
Fucking cheeky, think they are something.

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,160
We listen to your needs to continuously evolve.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,660
I am a sober alcoholic,

13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,620
so I'm wondering if there are some AA (anonymous alcoholics) meetings?

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,060
Ah I actually don't know,

15
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,380
they are so damn DRUNK on secrets.

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,400
Nah, I think that it is worth a TOAST that you're going.

17
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,400
But it may not be a  WINE-WINE situation!

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,080
We shatter some old stereotypes!

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Everyone is not called Glenn in Gothenburg.

20
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,800
Not me, for example!

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,000
What're your name, then?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,320
Jocke.

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,360
Glennson.

24
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,560
You also get to learn some Gothenburgish.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Yes, you want translation on the following:

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,400
"Hi"

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,700
"How's it going?"

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,680
"How fun to see you it has been long!"

29
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,300
And that is in Gothenburgish:

30
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
"Hello or (what)!?"

31
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,160
How do you translate "What are you doing?"

32
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,380
Ah that would be a whole lot different.

33
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:05,880
That would be

34
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,020
"Hello or or!?"

35
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,000
The course also includes a nice tour.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,620
Brackish water: Entirely damn useless.

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,780
It's called the Best Coast for a reason, right?

38
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,340
Hey, what're you doing?

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,080
When you see stuff like that you have to intervene.

40
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,100
Hello, you can't fucking do that!

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,780
You're fucking up your backs! I'll have to help here!

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,460
I've got it, I've got it.

43
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,420
Take care now then, fellas!

44
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,900
Eh, wasn't that a break-in?

45
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,000
No for fucks sake, they were just some rad fellas!

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,720
Like those guys we helped down to Syria last week!

47
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,600
They were selling ice, it seems!

48
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,920
We are now on the avenue, that shows that Gothenburg is a real city.

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Because it is always filled with people!

50
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,860
Except for Saturday afternoons...

51
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,160
Sundays...

52
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,160
Workday evenings...

53
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,320
Saturdays before paycheck...

54
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,960
When there's nothing going on at Ullevi...

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,140
When there IS something going on at Ullevi...

56
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,880
When it's raining outside...

57
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,880
Some summer weeks...

58
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,520
And we give you important information about local transportation.

59
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,860
This is the tram.

60
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,400
And it is the absolutely quickest way of going somewhere.

61
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,580
If you don't walk instead, of course.

62
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,300
The tour ends on our beautiful island Hisingen.

63
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,560
And now we are in Hisingen.

64
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,380
There is much to see here but you'll have to dodge a little,

65
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,180
you'll have to look quickly!

66
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:12,720
Like so.

67
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,500
Over there lies an Hjalmar Brantning for example

68
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,620
So sign up to the Gothenburg course today.
