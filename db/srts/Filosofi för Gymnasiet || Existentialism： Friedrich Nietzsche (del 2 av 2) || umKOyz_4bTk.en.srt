00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,780
Hello philosophers, my name is Joakim and welcome to the second and closing video

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,140
Where we investigate Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical ideas.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,100
If you haven't seen some, click here.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,540
With the pointed wording "God is dead!" meant Nietzsche that time is coming to see

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,580
The old interpretations - especially the belief in God - for what they are, myths and fairy tales.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,540
But he also realized that many would be despairing of the realization that we are nothing but

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,660
meaningless animals in a meaningless universe.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,220
This newly acquired insight risked leading to a state of nihilism, the belief that everything has no meaning.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52.720
If life is without goals, meaning or purpose, then it easily follows the perception that all the suffering of life is in vain.

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,160
“Nihilism arises now, not because the plagues of life have become greater, but because you have lost the belief that there is someone

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05.800
'Meaning' with suffering ... it now seems that no meaning exists, like everything is in vain. ”

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,700
Nietzsche wrestled himself with nihilism for much of his life

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,780
when he claimed that life lacked objective meaning.

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,460
He even meant that it was not only life that lacked objective meaning,

15
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,540
But that "truth" in itself does not exist.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,620
Thus, objective knowledge becomes impossible and as a consequence thereof

17
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,580
cannot be objective meaning with anything.

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,140
Instead, the individual is always limited by his own interpretation.

19
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:40,320
“The work of painting the image of life, however often poets and philosophers is given on it,

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,800
is nevertheless meaningless: even in the hands of the largest painting benches

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52.040
Is everything that comes from a thumbnail from a life, one's own life - nothing else is possible. "

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,940
Because one cannot possibly flee one's interpretation or perspective on life, Nietzsche meant that one should

23
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:04,280
Give up all attempts to find objective truth and instead interpret the existence in a life -promoting way.

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08.240
Because if there are no truths in the world now, it is not a truth

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,180
That life must be meaningless to the individual.

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,200
The road from nihilism thus goes by creating subjective meaning.

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,040
He called for a change in which people - inspired by the crisis that arises when the objective values die -

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,980
would fill the void after religion with philosophy and art.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,860
According to Nietzsche, the deepest questions you can ask in life are "Why do I live" and "Why do I suffer".

30
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,200
He meant that these two issues were actually one and the same.

31
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,620
Man seeking a meaning or purpose of life precisely because life is a torment

32
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,720
And she wants to believe that this suffering has a purpose.

33
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,360
"Man, the brave of animals and used to suffering, does not reject the suffering as such; he desires that,

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:03.820
Seeking it, provided he is shown a sentence for it, a purpose of suffering. The pointless suffering,

35
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08.340
Not the suffering itself, is the curse that has so far been over humanity. "

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14.560
By pondering his own suffering, he concluded that pain is not something negative.

37
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,960
Instead, he claimed that a life without suffering and misery would be a miserable life.

38
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,460
The suffering is instead a prerequisite for self -realization.

39
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,880
From the pain and suffering one always comes out stronger than before,

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,480
Something Nietzsche formulated as "what doesn't kill me makes me stronger".

41
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:41,000
“You want, if possible - which it is not - abolish the suffering. And we? We want to suffer more and more intensely

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,080
than ever ... because it is suffering that underlies all human development. "

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,240
For this reason he also hated alcohol.

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,640
It relieves and assures us that life is good as it is and that change is not necessary.

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,900
Nietzsche himself only drank water.

46
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,900
On solemn occasions milk.

47
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08.600
Based on the fact that suffering is a prerequisite for progress, Nietzsche believed that we are in need of an ideal

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,540
To keep us motivated in our pursuit of greatness even in the darkest of hours.

49
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,960
His answer to such an ideal was the superhuman, "das übermensch".

50
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,780
In English, the term is often translated into "Superman" and is the inspiration behind the cartoon character with the same name

51
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,860
- But the similarities in general are few.

52
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,900
“I teach you superhuman. Man is something to be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? ”

53
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,680
Superhuman as ideal was a perfect and powerful creature that has overcome

54
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,960
all their inner fears, weaknesses and flaws.

55
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,360
One who floats over the rest of humanity.

56
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,860
The superhuman ideal is only accessible to us in short moments.

57
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,200
It is impossible to maintain this perfection.

58
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,700
After these ecstatic moments, one must always return to "being human, too human".

59
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,120
By comparing himself to the superhuman, Nietzsche meant that we could be aware of our shortcomings

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,240
And weaknesses, and are ashamed of the large gap that separates us from the ideal.

61
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,980
In the pursuit of this perfection, we will start hating our non-perfect self.

62
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,960
This soul hatred, Nietzsche claimed, be the beginning of the Supreme man's self -realization.

63
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,040
For only when we realized our internal flaws, and welcomed our disgust for them,

64
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,140
Are we motivated to grow and overcome ourselves.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,380
In the book "So Zarathustra" Nietzsche describes in a parable how flaws and suffering

66
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,500
are necessary for self -realization.

67
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,660
“I met a young shepherd with suffocation, spasms and a distorted face.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,580
Out of his mouth hung a heavy black snake.

69
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,700
I had never seen so much nausea and fear in someone's face.

70
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,280
I did what I could to tear the snake out of his throat, but in vain.

71
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09.660
'Bit! Bit of its head! Bit! ', I screamed ...

72
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,640
The shepherd bit, and he bit well.

73
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,520
He spit out the snake's head and jumped up.

74
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,480
No longer shepherd, no longer man - changed, brilliant, laughing!

75
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,440
Never have I heard a man laugh like he laughed!

76
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,440
O my brothers, what I heard was no human laugh. "

77
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,840
Here the shepherd represents a man in his darkest moments and the black snake

78
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,320
is the despair and fear that plagues him in life.

79
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
But when he bites the snake's head, he overcomes his demons

80
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,620
and appears for a moment as the superhuman himself.

81
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,560
His laughter symbolizes power, perfectionism and an affirmation to life.

82
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,040
There is somewhat unclear if Nietzsche imagined the superior as the next evolutionary phase

83
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,280
(After all, he was inspired by Charles Darwin and Evolution Theory)

84
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,900
Or if he rather referred to an individual moral development.

85
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,520
To affirm life was the highest state a man could achieve, and Nietzsche presented two concepts

86
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,480
To describe this: Amor Fati (love for fate) and eternal repetition.

87
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:26,240
To affirm life, we must first accept it just as it is, live in harmony with fate.

88
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:33,520
Amor Fati is an approach characterized by fearlessness, sadness and power of action.

89
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:41,860
Where the weak passively waits to be loved, the strong unconditionally loves from his inner power.

90
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,600
Amor Fati is a characteristic of the superhuman,

91
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,940
"My formula for greatness in a human being is Amor Fati," Nietzsche writes.

92
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,700
But in order to love fate, one must first affirm life and it is among the most difficult there is.

93
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02.880
The difficulty lies in the fact that existence contains so much evil, pain, suffering and tragedy.

94
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,200
So how can you affirm life in the presence of so much ugliness?

95
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,320
As we have seen, Nietzsche claims that large amounts of suffering and pain are needed to develop.

96
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,640
"It is from the deepest of depth that the highest comes to its height".

97
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,020
With this insight, the strong understand that the evil, painful and tragic

98
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,860
In fact, has an inherent beauty.

99
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,400
In these aspects of existence there is the potential for growth and self -realization.

100
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,120
Only when a black snake crawls down your neck can you bite off its head

101
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,120
And laugh like no man has laughed before.

102
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,460
“I want to learn more and more to see the beautiful in the necessary;

103
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47.560
Then I will become one of those who make things beautiful.

104
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51.660
Amor Fati: Let it be my love from now on!

105
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,980
I don't want to wage war against the ugly ...

106
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,400
And everything and on the whole. One day I want to be a yes-sayer. "

107
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05.020
To determine if you are a yes-sayer, that is, in a state of complete life-affirming,

108
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09.800
Nietzsche created a psychological test which he called eternal repetition.

109
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,000
“What if a demon suddenly seeks you in your loneliness and says:

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,520
'The life you are now alive, and have lived, you will be allowed to live through and countless times;

111
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,720
It will contain nothing new, every moment of pain and joy, every thought and every sight,

112
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,060
All the small and all the great things in your life comes again - in the same consequence ... '

113
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,480
Do you want to throw yourself down and squeeze your teeth and curse the demon? Or have you ever experienced such a large

114
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,340
moment that you answer him: "You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine". "

115
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:50,800
The superhuman confirms life and realizes that his greatest moments are born out of his darkest experiences,

116
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56.560
And therefore perceives the inherent beauty in suffering, tragedy and evil.

117
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,380
With this insight, he does not condemn life like a pessimist, despite the suffering he has endured.

118
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,460
Instead, he celebrates the tragedy as a happy yes-sayer.

119
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,360
When he then approaches his death, the superhuman does not want to rest.

120
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,260
Instead, he wishes for eternal repetition and to live about his life again forever.

121
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,280
On his deathbed, should you say “Was it life? Once again, death! ”

122
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:29,040
Concepts such as "übermensch" and "the will to power" were used extensively by Hitler and the Nazis

123
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,960
To describe his idea of a biologically superior Aryan or Germanic gentleman.

124
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,800
Nietzsche's thoughts thus came to be regarded as a philosophical basis for the national socialist ideas.

125
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,880
This connection is largely due to Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth, who was a dedicated Nazi,

126
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,160
counterfeit a number of texts to suit Nazism's ideology.

127
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:59,080
Nietzsche himself was very critical of both anti -Semitism and German nationalism during its lifetime.

128
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,580
According to him, the superhuman was something that could occur in all cultures.

129
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,260
He, on the other hand, was an elitist and said that some people were better than others.

130
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,880
But this had nothing to do with race or nationality.

131
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,540
His questioning of "old truths" has influenced both existentialism

132
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,420
as the descendant postmodernism.
