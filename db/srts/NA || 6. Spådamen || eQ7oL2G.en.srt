1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Sven-Eric's "every little dream"

2
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.640
-What a nice time that the a-box is back.
 - It was three damn tough months.

3
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.240
You have hardly been able to eat.

4
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.720
Check, Leif.
 What a idiocy!
 Imagine people go on such hocus pocus.

5
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.760
- No, Leif.
 -Quiet!

6
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.320
I'll just look what she can do.

7
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.240
Don't get rid of the entire A-box right away!
 - Oh my God...

8
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.600
Hello?

9
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.520
Hello!
 What can I help you with?

10
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.120
Can you look into the future?

11
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.040
I can look into the future.
 Sit down!

12
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.480
Okay.
 I would like to see twenty years into the future.

13
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.840
How I look, how much money I have, if I have children and wife.

14
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.160
It's just running!

15
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.280
-It costs money.
 - Yeah, how much?

16
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.640
- Two thousand SEK.
 - It's pure robbery.

17
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.600
I can do a tarot reading for 400 bucks.

18
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.000
No, nothing like that.
 Wait, then I'll see ...

19
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.080
Don't get rid of the entire A-box.

20
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.880
Run, then!

21
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.000
Okay.

22
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.240
- Then I want you to close your eyes.
 -Okay.

23
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.880
And then you have them closed throughout the session.

24
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.120
Nasty laugh

25
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.760
What the hell?!

26
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.040
After all, a shit has not happened here.

27
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.560
Same old fucking shit stuff.

28
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.320
RATTLING

29
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.520
I may have a small family anyway.

30
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.160
- Tjena, Leif!
 - What is the food ate?

31
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.360
- To you and me.
 - It's a lot of food to be ...

32
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.320
-What?
 - You look like a ...

33
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.360
A pregnant hippopotamus?
 A crowbar with obesity, a waterlike-

34
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.960
- Something with sex lines in the stomach?
 What will it be this time?
 Come on something new!

35
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.400
Move!

36
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.480
No!

37
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.240
Oh my God.

38
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.480
Oh no, Billy ... - Can you change the future?

39
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.960
Obvious.
 But we have to steer our lives in the right direction.

40
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.720
All the choices we make affect our future - more than we think.

41
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.360
Thanks.

42
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.200
How did it go?

43
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.520
-What the hell are you doing?!
 - Release the sausages!
 Oh my God...

44
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.360
- You can't throw out the sausages.
 - There are things you don't understand.

45
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.680
We have to change some things in our lives.
 Just be quiet!

46
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.120
Now there is mustard on the gear lever.

47
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.840
-Hello?
 What are you looking for?
 - Father's old training trunk.

48
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.880
-Hello!
 Leif.
 - Fuck!

49
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.120
- Come, Billy!
 -Oh my God...

50
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.920
- See!
 - I don't intend to eat that.

51
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.000
- See, Billy!
 -Okay.

52
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.280
One?

53
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.040
But what...?
 Ouch!
 Leif.

54
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.720
Swallow!

55
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.800
Then you take this and then you train.
 Continuously.

56
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.840
You will thank me, the brother.

57
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.480
Ouch!

58
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.560
-You are back.
 - I have made changes.
 Watch me!

59
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.680
-Money.
 - Can I get a discount?

60
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.720
Well.
 Yes Yes...

61
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.520
Look, get started!

62
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.240
What the hell...?
 What the hell am I somewhere?

63
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.680
Billy.

64
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.320
- Little brother ... - don't touch me, fucking pig!

65
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.560
What the hell do you want me, Leif?

66
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.560
What the hell are you doing on Kumla?

67
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:17.520
-Are you kidding me?
 What do you want from me?!
 - Why are you in prison?

68
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:24.480
Don't play games with me, your rat!
 You made me become anabolic cod.

69
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:31.280
Then you forced me to sell, and now I'm sitting here.
 It's your fault!

70
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.760
- Conduct, I didn't know.
 - Are you here to have fun with me?

71
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:45.200
You are dead to me.
 I never want to see your fucking Nylle here again.
 Do you understand?

72
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.040
Sorry, Billy.

73
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.800
I'm finished!
 Open!

74
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.680
Leif, what the hell do you want me?!
 Respond!

75
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.760
Oh no!

76
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.240
This is fun.
 I have passed 30 in line.

77
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.040
- No, get it here!
 - Slip!
 What are you doing?

78
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:30.800
-What are you doing?
 - You will never understand.

79
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.360
–Leif ... —Sist!

80
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.520
What are you doing?

81
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.720
-What the hell are you doing?!
 - We should not do things like that.

82
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.760
There are many bids now.
 What the hell am I going to do?!

83
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:58.560
Lend a hand!
 Use the brain for something good, but we should not exercise.

84
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.320
You are good on your computer.
 Can't you do anything good on the computer?

85
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:09.880
- Play, or?
 - No, no fucking game.

86
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.640
I don't want you to end up in some fucking gaming abuse.

87
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.040
Shares!

88
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.920
- Shares, Billy!
 There we have it.
 -Shares?

89
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.480
I have 300 on the card.
 Insert it on the web and try to make money.

90
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.760
Post them on some fucking site.
 This is going to go, the brother.

91
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.480
Watch me!

92
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.560
- It costs two thousand, you know.
 -Oh my God!
 Don't be so fucking greedy.

93
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.520
Give me some quantity discount.

94
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.760
I can give you a tarot reading or crystal healing.

95
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:10.760
- I want to look into the future.
 - Then two thousand apply.

96
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.800
You are welcome.
 Look so, come on!

97
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.640
Set up the damn ritual now.

98
00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.280
I managed.
 YES!

99
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.040
Billy.

100
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:03.760
Well, what about everything, with work and health and so on?

101
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.360
How does it feel to run a stock empire?

102
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.520
Yes, it feels damn good, if you say so.

103
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.640
Wow, run stock empire ... Leif, your devil, you did.

104
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.120
-What did you say?
 - No, I didn't say anything.

105
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.040
- Fun to see you, the brother.
 -The same.

106
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.600
Do you remember when we had such a scrap truck?
 We traveled around like two takers in town.

107
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.560
–What do you mushrooms?
 It's your car.
 –What my car?

108
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.800
You have been driving around that fucking scraper for 40 years.

109
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.000
But is that our house?

110
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.240
Leif, it's my house.
 You have your house left in Sörbäcken.

111
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:09.280
- Have you stopped the medicine again?
 - We share brotherly on everything?

112
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.360
Yes, we did it - until you threw me out.

113
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:20.960
I probably would not have been able to pay for all the food you are pouring into you.

114
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.320
What do you swam about?

115
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.160
Yes.

116
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.440
I look like a pregnant hippopotamus.

117
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.920
Quiet.
 You have looked like that for 15 years.

118
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.440
Oh my God!
 No...

119
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.640
-Sit down.
 You can't stand up.
 --Neej ...

120
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.480
What happened?
 What did you see?

121
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.040
I will be back soon.

122
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.080
Hell, hell ...

123
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.440
-What the hell...?
 - She went 20 minutes ago.

124
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.840
- She has been able to throw again.
 -Who?
 Spåtanten?

125
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.800
-Yes.
 She has gone around and cheated people.
 –What, how do you mean?

126
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.080
She uses a drug, so people think they can look into the future.

127
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.120
A scam.
 Have you had contact with her?

128
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:10.120
No, I haven't ... Such a fucking mumbojumbo I don't do.

129
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.640
-Good.
 - Jaw?
 - Yes, easy!

130
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.960
- What are you going to do with them?
 -Nothing.

131
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:27.080
-Good!
 I deduct it from your debt.
 - Snip, I need the money.

132
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:34.040
You have been criticizing me for three years.
 Time to start paying back.

133
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.160
-Come on.
 -I do not want to hear!

134
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.960
Oh!

135
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.920
Now the bills have come.

136
00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.120
We have expenses at 14,300. Not gracious.

137
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.440
Lucky you got the A-box.

138
00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.480
