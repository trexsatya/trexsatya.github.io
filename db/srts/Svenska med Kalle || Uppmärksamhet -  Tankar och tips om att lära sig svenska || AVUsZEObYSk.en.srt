00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
Hello Hello

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,300
And good morning

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09.240
Today it is Long Friday so I have to wish all happy Easter

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,600
And I want to talk a little about something I think is very important

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
When you practice language

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,280
And that's what we call attention to Swedish attention

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,920
Attention, it is simply that you

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,240
concentrates you

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Focus

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,720
Listens carefully

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,240
And read carefully

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,840
that you think about what you do

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
And simply

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,360
Listens for details and ...

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,240
thinking about details, ie the little things

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03.640
for if you do

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,200
So will you see more things in the language and hear more things in the language

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
It applies to all things

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
It applies to how the words are written ...

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,140
It applies to how the words are pronounced

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,620
This applies to grammar

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,940
For example, order

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:31,280
I would think that the most important thing to train on: It is to listen carefully

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,480
Both on the order

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,420
..... brain drop ....

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,440
As I forgot to cut away

27
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,200
Both on the pronunciation

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,700
How we pronounce words. How we pronounce sentences.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,300
And then on which words use

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Which grammar people use.

31
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00.940
What different expressions people use in different situations

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05.440
Anything this can teach you very much

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,000
And I think that those who learn Swedish faster are them as

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,720
are more attentive and think more about what they hear and read

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,000
If you think about it then you will perceive more

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,080
And you will learn only from listening to the language and reading the language

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37.560
And I think it's something you can train on

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,320
So if you know for yourself that you are not so attentive and concentrated

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,400
So when training in Swedish and when you use Swedish

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,880
so try to decide you

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,800
A few minutes maybe, for a while, a few times during the day that ...

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01.440
Now I really will try to think about

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,920
What others say or what I read in a book.

44
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,840
Maybe, in a way that it is easiest to exercise when you read for then you can also

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,280
decide to read a little slower and really look at the words and grammar

46
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
and which expressions are used

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Which word sequence is used

48
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
the spelling

49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36.560
for you will learn just from thinking about what you do simply

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,760
And then of course: when you have the chance to speak Swedish. When you have the chance to listen to Swedish.

51
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,240
So really listen and you can almost talk a little quiet with yourself

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,720
When you hear a new expression ... note it (you say)

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02.840
It's like: make a small note in your head

54
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,120
Think "Aha!", He or she uses that word in that situation

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,120
That expression means the same thing as that expression

56
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,360
I think it can help to become more attentive. It's almost like you talk to yourself a little.

57
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,060
When you listen to someone

58
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
Who speaks Swedish

59
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,180
It may sound simple but it's not always that simple

60
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,360
And anyway, I think we can all be more attentive

61
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,180
Exercise our attention

62
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,980
So do it!

63
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,460
I remind me to text my videos

64
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
So you haven't seen this video with text

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,920
so find the setting that allows you to watch the video with text

66
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,200
and it will be easier for you to understand what I say

67
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05.660
Like the video, please share it with friends if you think it was good

68
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,780
Feel free to check out my blog too. I usually write something almost every day

69
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,120
There you can get more tips and learn more words and expressions.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,220
And so everyone who sees this now gets this weekend

71
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,920
Have a really nice Easter weekend and so we'll see you again soon

72
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Have a nice day! Bye!
