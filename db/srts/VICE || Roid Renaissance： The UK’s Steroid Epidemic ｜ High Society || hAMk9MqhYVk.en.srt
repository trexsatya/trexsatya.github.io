1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,379
You can go into any single gym

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,715
and buy steroids within five
minutes of being in there.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,843
If you train properly, diet
properly, take this shit,

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,428
you’re going to feel indestructible.

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,471
Who doesn’t want to feel like that?

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,224
They’re very powerful hormones.

7
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,142
But with any drugs,
there’s always payback.

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,977
But when there's a drug
that does the job,

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:22,022
it’s a hard argument to say,
‘well, don’t use it.’

10
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,526
Every time you take this shit,
you're risking your fucking life.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,027
You know, it's a lottery.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,280
Fucking hell.

13
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,754
An estimated half a million
young men in

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,506
the UK are addicted to steroids.

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,009
In fact, the Class C drug is
the second most used drug

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,052
after cannabis.

17
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,720
-Mate, so when you train,
-I’ve never done it.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,888
the pump is unreal.

19
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,100
But steroids come with some pretty
alarming side effects,

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,352
including liver and kidney failure.

21
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,395
We’ve got a lot of medication
for the heart failure

22
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,396
and the heart attacks.

23
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,691
As well as mood swings
and increased estrogen,

24
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,443
which results in men needing
breast reduction surgery.

25
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:11,196
I want to take a look inside
the steroid epidemic

26
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:14,366
from the dealers selling it to
the young men taking it.

27
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:18,161
Why is a generation of young
men getting hooked on roids?

28
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,668
I'm just outside Cardiff in
the valleys right now,

29
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,712
and we're about to see Tom Powell.

30
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,838
If it sounds familiar,

31
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,507
it's because he was in season
two of Love Island.

32
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,468
He's been openly taking steroids
for a number of years now.

33
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:37,681
Do you still think there’s like
bad connotations with steroid use

34
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,100
and that whole stigma of your balls
will shrink?

35
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,436
That’s not a stigma.
That’s fucking true.

36
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,437
Yeah, my balls are tiny.

37
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,815
Well, my balls are pretty small.

38
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,861
He uses his platform to teach young
men how to take them safely.

39
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:57,909
Tom, take me back. What was your
physique like before steroids?

40
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,788
Back in school,
I was a chubby little kid.

41
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,999
So for years, for years, I was.

42
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,834
Until I realized girls don’t like
fat guys.

43
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,087
When did you start taking steroids?

44
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,214
Five months after Love Island.

45
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,426
Was being on camera, did that
affect how you saw yourself?

46
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,470
Yeah. I felt pressure to
stay in shape more.

47
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,263
It wasn't the reason why
I jumped on steroids.

48
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,806
It was a contributing factor.

49
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,683
Obviously, I wanted to look good
all the time,

50
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,185
because you’re
constantly in the public eye.

51
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,895
The main reason
why I went on Love Island

52
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,688
is because I wanted to become
a sponsored athelete.

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,940
I met the guys that I wanted
to become, you know,

54
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,485
and I asked them straight away.

55
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,278
I was like, ‘Boys, talk to me about
steroids. Are you on them?’

56
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,279
And they said,

57
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,698
‘Yeah, you can’t get anywhere
in this industry without them.’

58
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,450
You can go into any single gym

59
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,827
and buy steroids within five
minutes of being in there.

60
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,245
That's nuts, man.

61
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,039
They're very, very available.

62
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,166
So what's the biggest
you've ever got?

63
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,251
120 kilos lean.

64
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,005
Five, six years ago,
when I first started taking steroids

65
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,549
I wanted to be these topless
influencers that were shredded.

66
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,634
I wanted to be that.

67
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,053
And now I realize that that was
the wrong way to go about it.

68
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,389
And that's not what the fitness
industry should be.

69
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,768
I take TRT now, which is called
testosterone replacement therapy.

70
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,354
It's a very low level
of testosterone.

71
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,524
It's not for muscle gains, it's
just for replenishment of me.

72
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,734
I’ve actually got a jab now
if you want to see it.

73
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,277
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

74
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,531
Long term steroid use impairs your
testosterone production,

75
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:22,577
resulting in symptoms like fatigue,
anxiety and low libido.

76
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,913
Tom has to take TRT,

77
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,166
a prescribed light steroid,
to help balance his hormones.

78
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,751
Where would you inject it?

79
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,629
Today is my bum.
Unfortunately for you.

80
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,880
I’m here for the ride. Let’s go.

81
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,884
There's a certain V in your ass
where you're not supposed to go.

82
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,220
So I’m going to be going
around here.

83
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,513
Wipe the area first.

84
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,057
I never thought I’d be
staring intently

85
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,434
into someone’s bum cheeks today,
but...

86
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,646
Cap off, push all the air bubbles 
out.

87
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,107
And that’s ready to go.

88
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,407
There we have it.

89
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,617
And then I’ll go wipe.

90
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,245
Wipe all around the area.

91
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,789
And that is all done.

92
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,374
And that didn't hurt?

93
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,542
At all.

94
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,003
When you first started taking it,
what were the side effects?

95
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,547
This is when I was taking tren
in my third cycle,

96
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,507
so I had a lot.

97
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,051
My mood swings were
up and down, night terrors,

98
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,013
which is horrible dreams
every single night.

99
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,223
-Couldn’t keep a hard on.
-Damn.

100
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,434
I looked incredible. I looked lean.

101
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,020
I was full. I was, you know, it was
great. But I felt like death.

102
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,564
You did something mad recently,

103
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,274
like you were having a surgery

104
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,693
and then you live streamed it.

105
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,153
Yeah. I had gyno surgery.

106
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,447
Gyno is a buildup of estrogen
behind the nipple.

107
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,865
I'm estrogen sensitive.

108
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,450
So when I was taking steroids,

109
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,661
my estrogen built up and stuck
behind my nipple, basically,

110
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,662
and it was causing pain.

111
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,831
-Ugly pec.
-Minging titties.

112
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,708
Why did you live stream it, bro?

113
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,835
To raise awareness.
I know it was a bit crazy.

114
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,629
The more people that sees,
the more people it reaches,

115
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,839
the more people are going to see
it and maybe get checked out.

116
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,382
So I thought, yeah, why not go live?

117
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,887
I’m trying to enlighten people
about the use of steroids,

118
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,388
bodybuilding and they get
so shredded

119
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,473
they lose their sex drive.

120
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:10,894
And we as a community epitomize
these these people with six packs.

121
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,772
And actually these guys
are so not healthy.

122
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,399
Women lose their periods for
life sometimes not just

123
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,610
a couple of weeks just by doing a
couple of bodybuilding shows.

124
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,861
And people don't realize this.

125
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,448
Let's say I'm a young person trying
to get into the fitness industry

126
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,492
and I want to be the
next gymfluencer.

127
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,036
Would you advise me
to take steroids?

128
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,746
Find your own path.

129
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,957
I wanted to be in the industry
so much

130
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:35,085
I listened to what anyone else did.
Do your own journey.

131
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,921
Thomas suffered numerous side effects

132
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,131
from his years of steroid use,

133
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,634
including having to do breast
reduction surgery

134
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,594
as a result of gynecomastia.

135
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,514
The surgeon who performed
Tom's operation,

136
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,433
the self-proclaimed King
of Gyno, Dr. John,

137
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,562
warns that tens of thousands of
men are now at risk

138
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,981
of needing the surgery
due to steroid use.

139
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,484
How many gynecomastia surgeries
would you say you do in a week

140
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,485
due to steroids?

141
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,988
I do about 2 to 3 a day.

142
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,033
So if we say half of them are
due to steroids,

143
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,245
we're talking about 15 in 5 days.

144
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,248
So about 7 or 8 probably from
from steroid use.

145
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,374
Wow.

146
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,126
But I'm the king of gyno. I mean.

147
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,548
Dr. John is letting us film his
next breast reduction surgery.

148
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,259
His patient, Grant, is already
in the waiting room.

149
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,094
Hey, what’s up, bro?

150
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,637
-You alright?
-I’m all good. I’m all good,

151
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,598
-how are you feeling?
-Nervous.

152
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,099
Why are you getting this done?

153
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,810
Everyone I speak to,
no one notices it on me.

154
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,688
But for me, it's a self
confidence thing.

155
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:40,400
I've always had like, a little
bit of it when I was younger.

156
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,651
So as soon as I hit like 16,

157
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,529
you get it when like some people
hit it through puberty.

158
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:48,325
And then I started using steroids
and it just kind of never left

159
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,660
and just got worse and worse
and worse as I got bigger and bigger

160
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,287
But as you’re a big lump,

161
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,455
you don't really think about it.

162
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,833
But if you go into places
like Ibiza and Marbella

163
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,335
and stuff like that and you're
taking your shirt off

164
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,378
and you're surrounded by other
people that do steroids that

165
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,213
haven't got it, people notice it.

166
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,090
Talk us through your steroid use.

167
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,508
When was the first time
you started taking it?

168
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,260
-Eighteen.
-Eighteen?

169
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,595
Yeah. So I’ve been on and
off it for ten years.

170
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,931
I started going to the gym, seeing
nothing, seeing nothing.

171
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,974
And I was like, ‘Do you know what?
I’m just going to jump on a course.’

172
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,893
Took some tablets and started
getting bigger

173
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,144
and kind of never looked back.

174
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,188
Is it more for fitness or is
it more of like an aesthetic?

175
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,981
I am so unfit.

176
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,483
Honestly.

177
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,526
At my biggest I was about 17.5 stone.

178
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,570
I couldn’t walk up stairs.

179
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,739
Generally, my breathing was terrible.

180
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,867
I was just carrying so much excess
weight I didn't need.

181
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,410
It’s never about the fitness.

182
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,829
It's about the recovery so I
can get bigger and bigger.

183
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,082
And when all your mates are
sitting at like 70 kilos,

184
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,000
you look like the biggest
in the group.

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,044
And it’s nice. It’s a nice feeling.

186
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,463
-Are you still on steroids right now?
-Yeah.

187
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,798
This hasn’t stopped you?

188
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,091
No.

189
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,760
I think the problem is,
I’m so far into it now

190
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,304
and I wish I’d never started,
but now I’m on it, it’s too late.

191
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,348
Dr. Jones is ready for you now.

192
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,891
-Good luck my guy.
-See you later.

193
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,976
-You got this, man.
-Yeah.

194
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,817
Grant, how do you feel?

195
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,652
Nervous, currently.

196
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,572
Is it ticklish right now?

197
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,865
No, it's alright at the moment.

198
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,992
This is the stuff that’s hanging out

199
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,660
and here is the actual glands
we’re going to remove.

200
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,537
After applying a local anesthetic,

201
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,665
the surgeons have filled
Grant’s breasts up with a liquid

202
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,000
to help with the procedure.

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,169
What are the dangers
and risks of this operation?

204
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,506
I would think that the most common
risk is getting a hematoma.

205
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,341
So the body wants to heal it

206
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,926
and wants to push blood
into your chest.

207
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,721
Other risks; nipple inversion.
Nipple necrosis.

208
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,931
But there’s different ways to
prevent that.

209
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,350
Alright, just going to set
the vaser now,

210
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,436
melt all the fat and break apart
the gland as much as possible.

211
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,980
Next, they’re going to 
extract the fat

212
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,440
like they would with liposuction.

213
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,902
So what this does
is break apart the fat

214
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,989
and the pseudogland inside
is partially fat

215
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,824
and partially fibrous tissue.

216
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,535
So we break apart the fatty parts.

217
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,162
You’d be surprised at how much fat
is in there.

218
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,455
To be fair, I did offer somebody

219
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,956
a grand if they drink some of that.

220
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,834
Can we up it to five grand?

221
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,766
That’s so fucking painful.

222
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,768
Fuck.

223
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,811
Fucking hell.

224
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,480
It's a girl!

225
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,606
Yay!

226
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,400
Oh wow!

227
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,571
That is fucking horrible.

228
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,366
I never knew that this is
what a gland looks like.

229
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,288
Urgh, that is such a weird thing.

230
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,956
Urgh.

231
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,918
That's making me feel ill.

232
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,256
I genuinely can’t believe

233
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,176
those massive glands
came out of Grant’s body.

234
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,429
Honestly, if that doesn’t
put you off taking steroids,

235
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,348
I genuinely don't know what will.

236
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,268
Since steroids are illegal
to sell in the UK,

237
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,353
where do they come from?

238
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,524
I'm in an undisclosed location
and I'm about to meet

239
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:12,278
an international steroid dealer who
makes steroids in his kitchen.

240
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,200
Yo,

241
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,285
What’s going on right now?

242
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:24,749
So basically, add a solution
of nandrolone or ‘deca’.

243
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,626
We've got the raw powder here.

244
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,419
Put a couple of chemicals in there

245
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,756
and I’m just finishing it off with
some seed oil.

246
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,299
This is the carrier.
This is the solution.

247
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,677
But how do you get
the right ingredients for it?

248
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,555
Well, I mean, if you're
buying it, you know,

249
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,099
over the Internet or even from
from your local dealer,

250
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,559
you don't know what the
fuck you're getting.

251
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,769
Especially when you're injecting
it straight into your muscle.

252
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,020
Has it got hairs in it?

253
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,981
Has it got bits of fucking shit
floating in it

254
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,691
that’s going to give
you sepsis?

255
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,401
What’s the wildest things
that you’ve heard

256
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,362
being put inside steroids?

257
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,865
Well, I've seen some very
dirty conditions.

258
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,867
You know, smoking cigarettes over it

259
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,076
and the ashes dropping in.

260
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,327
It's not getting filtered.

261
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,873
I’ve seen people have injections
and them go bad,

262
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,250
they have to have their whole
leg cut open and drained.

263
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,919
It’s fucking risky. It’s risky.

264
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,630
There's not a lot of people
actually making this shit.

265
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,507
So the guy in the gym
who’s telling you,

266
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,717
‘Yeah. Yeah. This is the best gear.’

267
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,886
How the fuck do they know?
Do you know what I mean?

268
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,387
Every time you take this shit,

269
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,805
you’re risking your fucking life.

270
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,182
You know, it’s a lottery.

271
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,058
Unless you’re making this yourself

272
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,227
or getting it from
a pharmaceutical company,

273
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,520
you don’t know what the fuck
is in it.

274
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,232
You're the most honest drug dealer
I've ever heard in my life.

275
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,361
Not everybody who makes and sells
drugs is trying to kill people

276
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,362
and rinse them.

277
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,530
Do you know what I mean?

278
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,824
You know, it’s, it’s a gray area,

279
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,367
You know what I mean?

280
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,702
Ethical drug dealer. Yeah.

281
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,954
What would you say is like,
your demographic?

282
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,166
It breaks my heart to say it,
but 16 to 24 year olds.

283
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,167
Sixteen?

284
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,628
Just as they sort of coming
through puberty and there’s,

285
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,672
you know, young guys wanting to
just be buff or whatever.

286
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,550
If you train properly,
diet properly, take this shit,

287
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,968
you're going to feel indestructible.

288
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,220
Who doesn't want to feel like that?

289
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,723
All of these ingredients are, like,
easily sourced?

290
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,099
Yeah, easily.

291
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,268
The chemicals are
just household everyday items.

292
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,729
Sourcing the raws, you have
to order them from abroad,

293
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,855
get them shipped in.

294
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,941
And that’s the
riskiest part if customs sees it.

295
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,442
But that’s all they’ll do.

296
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,445
The risk reward, if you’re comparing
it to other drugs, I mean,

297
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,113
It’s insane, the returns
you can get.

298
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,283
It wouldn’t be uncommon for us on
a bad month to make 50 grand.

299
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,035
On a good month. Make 100 grand.

300
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,621
On a bad month, fifty grand?

301
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,668
So easy. This filter paper on here,
it's just a very fine membrane.

302
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,712
If this is not filtered, you are for
sure going to have big problems.

303
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,090
Okay? You're going to have
gaping holes in your ass

304
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,426
or in your shoulder or whatever
with poison coming out.

305
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,887
So this step is very important.

306
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,057
You’ve got here, finished product,

307
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,267
just do it by eye.

308
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,768
So now you’ve got your bottle

309
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,521
that goes on. There you go. Okay.

310
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,189
This is nuts.

311
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,358
And if you put a light through it,
you should see it's clean.

312
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,860
There should be no particles in
there. That's a that's a good tip.

313
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,196
Actually, if you do buy gear,
get a light on it.

314
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,366
If there’s shit floating in the
gear, don’t take it. Don’t take it.

315
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,118
Cap comes off.

316
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,494
There you go.

317
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,913
Made in what, 30 minutes?

318
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,123
No time at all.

319
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,124
That's crazy.

320
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,293
Powerful shit.
It’s not to be abused man.

321
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,878
So what would you say

322
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,423
to any young person

323
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,842
who’s thinking about taking steroids?

324
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,802
Don't fucking take it.
It'll ruin your life.

325
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,139
No fucking teenage boy anywhere in
in this fucking world

326
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,308
needs to be takin anabolic steroids.

327
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,728
Unless they’ve got
a real medical issue

328
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,523
that needs it, you know?

329
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,151
But I mean, kids taking
fucking Tren?

330
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,528
Come on, man, You're going
to fuck yourself up.

331
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,821
You're going to fuck yourself up

332
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,615
and you’re not going to come back
from it and you’ll look like shit.

333
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,617
You can’t fucking shag your bird.

334
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,578
You know what I mean?

335
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,705
You've got no interest in life,
you know what I mean?

336
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,457
It's like, do you really want it?

337
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,548
John is making 50 to 100,000
pounds a month

338
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,258
from making steroids in his kitchen.

339
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,887
Who’s to say other dealers aren’t
doing the same thing but worse?

340
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,972
You don’t know what
they’re putting in there

341
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,932
just to try and increase
profit margins.

342
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,311
So a lot of steroids that
are available in the market,

343
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,897
might be unsafe and it
could lead to,

344
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,690
definitely infections,

345
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,692
septicemia

346
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,986
and you might even
have limbs removed.

347
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,238
It worries me that even the dealer

348
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,657
is warning people
not to take steroids.

349
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,911
But for some athletes competing
in the bodybuilding industry,

350
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,456
they would argue that taking
steroids is a necessity.

351
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,251
Okay, every single athlete today,

352
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,796
it will be their first time ever
on a bodybuilding stage.

353
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,256
So we do need to give them
lots and lots of support.

354
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,759
We have our first athletes ready,
I believe.

355
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,019
With the bodybuilding community,

356
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,480
do you think any of them would have
been using steroids

357
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,481
in their preparation?

358
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,775
At this particular show,
I imagine most people will.

359
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,152
Oh, ok. So is it like an open
secret with bodybuilders?

360
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,530
Yeah, so there’s two different
types of federation.

361
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,242
So Fit X is a federation that
doesn’t drug test the athletes.

362
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,077
There are certain ones who do.

363
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,703
So obviously no one there will be.

364
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,249
But at Fit X, I imagine it’s most of,
if not everyone

365
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,293
Ok. So as you said,
no drug testing,

366
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,628
-probably no stigma towards that.
-No, no definitely.

367
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,921
Have you ever tried steroids?

368
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,216
Yeah, I think it was 22 when I
started taking it properly.

369
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,264
What's your stance on some of your
athletes maybe taking steroids?

370
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,390
Do you advise it or not?

371
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,144
It’s a good question.

372
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,812
And I feel like it’s something

373
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,981
that someone needs to come to
the conclusion themselves.

374
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,567
I'm going to then try best advise
you to do it in a safe manner.

375
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,861
A lot of men definitely
have body dysmorphia

376
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,447
and they take the steroids
to make themselves feel better,

377
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,449
but it ends up having
a negative effect.

378
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,326
Have you or anybody else,
do you know,

379
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,662
are they taking steroids for
preparation for this?

380
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,164
-I do take steroids.
-Oh, you do take steroids?

381
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,248
I do take steroids, yeah.

382
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,834
Yeah, but it's all controlled.
It's not abused.

383
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,586
I have my bloods taken,

384
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,881
before and after a course

385
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,467
to minimize any risks they may pose.

386
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,470
Would I promote it and advise
somebody to do it? No, I wouldn't.

387
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,806
But for me, I'm competing against
others that do it.

388
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,641
-Yeah.
-You have to stand a chance.

389
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,393
-Even the playing field for you.
-Exactly.

390
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,440
If competitions don't test for
steroid use, hence allowing it,

391
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,150
those competing often think

392
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,194
that they won’t stand a chance
without it

393
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,154
since every single user 
I’ve spoken to

394
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,282
says that they wouldn’t advise
anyone to take roids,

395
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,951
surely they should be banned from
competitions altogether.

396
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,663
David Crossland, a former steroid
user and bodybuilder,

397
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,749
has turned his efforts
to harm reduction.

398
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,251
So Dave, what do you do nowadays?

399
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,086
Probably the easiest way
to describe E-Val

400
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,213
is a blood testing company

401
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,881
for people
with alternative lifestyles.

402
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,508
It's just about minimizing

403
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,468
the harms that people expose them to.

404
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,721
Be that steroids,
or be that recreational drugs.

405
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,556
Let's get into your story
in particular.

406
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,517
You're a pretty big lad,
I'm telling you,

407
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,519
like the biggest guy
I've seen so far.

408
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,273
How did you first get
into using steroids?

409
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,025
I started steroids at 19.

410
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,903
I finished steroids at 24,

411
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,821
at which point I was very large,

412
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,198
not in bad condition,

413
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,117
and had the potential to turn pro
as a bodybuilder.

414
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,119
And then I tore my left pec
completely off.

415
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,580
That sort of ended that.

416
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,959
And then I spiralled into depression.

417
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,004
The renal specialist basically said
I outgrew my kidney’s capability

418
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,673
of managing my physique,

419
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,383
so I’m stage four kidney failure.

420
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,343
And that will never get better.

421
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,179
Is that a lot of medication now?
Like a whole lifestyle change?

422
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,806
No, not really. Not
from the kidneys.

423
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,516
I’ve got a lot of medication
for the heart failure

424
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,059
and the heart attacks,
but not from the kidneys.

425
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,435
Heart attacks.

426
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,479
Plural. Heart Attacks.

427
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,648
Well I had a heart attack,
an official heart attack,

428
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:49,652
an official myocardial infarction
in end of November last year.

429
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,990
Do you know anybody who's died
because of steroid usage?

430
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,911
It's difficult to say that someone's
died because of steroids.

431
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,997
Are there people that have pass

432
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,833
that steroids may have played
a significant role in it?

433
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,917
Yes, without doubt.

434
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,128
You can’t O.D. on steroids,
you know what I mean?

435
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,838
You can’t go and take too
many and drop dead.

436
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,840
-Yeah.
-It’s a time thing.

437
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,050
It’s a constant abuse situation.

438
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,721
So what advice would you give

439
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,641
to an 18 year old possibly
considering taking steroids?

440
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,768
I have people come to me
on a weekly basis

441
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,229
that I’m telling them
they’re now testosterone dependent

442
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,732
or they’re now infertile.

443
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,526
And  they’re shocked
by that revelation.

444
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,361
You know, there is risk
with these drugs.

445
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,947
Learn the risks you're taking

446
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,575
and then decide if those risks
are worth those rewards.

447
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,955
Steroid use is rife in the UK

448
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,499
and it’s extremely easy to
get your hands on them,

449
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,502
trapping men in a cycle that
seems hard to break.

450
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,004
From what I've learned,

451
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,257
a lot of men turn to steroids when
they're feeling self-conscious.

452
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,386
With social media platforms often
perpetuating the narrative,

453
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,639
feeding us unrealistic body images.

454
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,726
Ironically, the side effects can
sometimes make men even more

455
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,104
self-conscious and in
some cases be fatal.

456
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,149
There needs to be more
education available

457
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,818
on the impact steroids can
have on men’s lives,

458
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,738
because if people are aware
of the potential risks,

459
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,199
I doubt so many would take them.

460
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,507
Good work out, bro.

461
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,386
I’m tired, man.
I wanna go to sleep.
