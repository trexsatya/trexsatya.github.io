1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.760
In tonight's section of Ifs, the question of all culture in Sweden ...

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.200
Gothenburg's best Somalier, Assia Dahir.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.680
With the pockets full of fresh zucchini, Thanos Fatas.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.400
The world's Swedishest Arab, Elaf Ali.

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.840
The almost lawyer and carpentry snack artist Filip Dikmen.

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The humor slaughter from Serbia, Branne Pavlovic.

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.240
And Sweden's most fun Chinese, Evelyn Mok.

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.480
Our fucking brother, Yousif Jawad.

9
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.640
The legend that rips northern B since -93, Douglas "Doggelito" León.

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.480
And now, the man you are all waiting for: host Ahmed Berhan!

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.920
Welcome to the IFS, the program where no one pays the radio and TV fee.

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.120
I am Ahmed Berhan, your program leader, and this is our competitors.

13
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.880
Player Malmö: Matilda.

14
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.280
The man in green: Martin.

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.560
And at the far end, but not last, but not least: Caroline.

16
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.320
It is possible that a competitor chooses one in the panel -

17
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.000
- which answers a question, and will then decide whether it is true or false.

18
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.560
Caroline, you are a middle school teacher.
 Which are messiest:

19
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.720
–You class or panel?
 - Hundred percent the panel.

20
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960
So which of the messy do you choose?

21
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.920
There is one who has something in common with me, so I choose Dogge.

22
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.080
I'm as old as Dogge's career.

23
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.680
It's a good thing.
 A compliment.

24
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.360
If you are as old as his career you should have died 20 years ago!

25
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.760
- Oh, wow ... –Oh no, what a nasty!
 Now I took.

26
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.040
- We start sharply.
 Dogge, how are you?
 - Giantbra.
 Thanks so much.

27
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.800
A blatte ran around in the 80s and sprayed down ... No, I'm kidding.

28
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.320
- This is a family program, brother.
 - Do you talk about yourself?

29
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.160
It is a syringe with vaccine that gives a scar that you see on immigrants -

30
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.080
- And immigrants' children.
 That scar is called the Blatte Stamp.

31
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.400
What do you say, Caroline?

32
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.800
It sounds as unreasonable as my food habits.
 I say it's false.

33
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.160
We're going to amuse you, you should not amuse yourself!

34
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.400
- You're pretty good at that otherwise.
 - She's sharp, this one.

35
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.400
- She's sharp.
 - You thought Dogge lied.

36
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.840
Unfortunately.
 No point.
 It's true.
 It is a scar after tuberculosis vaccine.

37
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.320
It does not mean that you are born abroad, but at least one parent-

38
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.480
- Has its origin in a country where tuberculosis is more common than in Sweden.

39
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.120
Can everyone in the audience pull up their right arm?

40
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.760
- I have one here.
 -I have.

41
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.400
You said turbo colos.

42
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.320
It is a very fast disease.
 - We move on to you, Matilda.

43
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.960
You said you are from a village of Skåne, and had not seen an immigrant -

44
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.160
- Trees you moved to London.

45
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.360
A little exaggerated, but kind of yes.

46
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.240
You needed to become an immigrant to see an immigrant.

47
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.560
Matilda, who do you choose?

48
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.720
I've been in love with this person for a long time.

49
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.320
Dogge again.
 It's not possible.
 You can only choose the panelist once.

50
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.680
- Night, it's Branne.
 -Oh!

51
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.880
-I blush.
 Now it gets hard.
 - You are white.
 How can you be red?

52
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.360
- It's makeup.
 - Branne ...

53
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.000
In the Balkans kitchen you will find vegetable.
 What is it?

54
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.960
"Vegeeta."
 It's a shotgun.
 Or as we in Serbia say:

55
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.400
Problem solver.

56
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.360
Argumentation winner.

57
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.680
It is a wedding present that you get from your father -in -law when you get married.

58
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.440
Then you get a shotgun as a gift.

59
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.400
-Oh!
 - It is a ballet tradition.

60
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.880
The shots in Sarajevo.

61
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.800
It was a wedding that went wrong.

62
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.800
Matilda calls her dad: "We have to buy a shotgun!"
 - What are you saying?

63
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.960
One thing I learned in London was that you can't trust jugger guys.

64
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.400
But...

65
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.440
- But it sounds very Balkans.
 - It sounds the Balkans?
 You believe in Branne?

66
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.960
- Fan, I don't want to be naive again.
 - Matilda has been hurt before.

67
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.280
Matilda, if this is to work, you have to believe in me.

68
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.720
-What are you saying?
 True or false?
 - False.

69
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.320
You say falsely.
 Congratulations, Matilda, you have received a point.

70
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.040
Vegeta is a spice mixture that
 Used in soups and sauces.

71
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.320
Martin, time for you to shine.
 Who do you choose?

72
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.120
--Assia I start with.
 - A classic clip from Idol.

73
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.920
You think we're racists?
 I am half -palestinians.
 Here is no racist!

74
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.680
- That was not said.
 -You can go.

75
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.560
Because she fucking is a racist.

76
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.560
You can't be Rasse if you are blatte.
 It doesn't work.

77
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.160
We blast love each other, right?

78
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.560
Joking aside.
 It was an applicant who was rejected and became a shit.

79
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.840
Was crossed at Laila and called her racist.

80
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The sick thing was that this person himself was Palestinians.

81
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.560
And who was the person?
 Well, namely a young Gina Dirawi.

82
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.400
I think it's partly true, but not that it was Gina, but a man.

83
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.680
I don't really remember the clip.
 So I say it's ...

84
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.360
- So you say ...?
 - I say it's false.

85
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.520
Awesome, Martin.
 We are checking.

86
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.920
Hello!
 What's your name?

87
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.920
Filip Dikmen.
 My mom says I sing nicely as a bird.

88
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.400
"Sings nicely as a bird."

89
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.640
“ÄFRY” NIGHT IN MY DREAM

90
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.120
I See You, I See You

91
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.040
-It does not sound good.
 - All others say it, just not you!

92
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.080
Martin, you said it was false.
 Congratulations, you've got a point.

93
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.320
An applicant was rejected and called Laila racist.

94
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.840
- But it was our own Filip Dikmen.
 --Walla, it was Suleyman, not me!

95
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.960
- Caroline, who do you choose?
 - Then I take Filip.
 The roaster.

96
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.880
-Hello Hello!
 - Filip ...

97
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.600
That's what Elaf means to me.

98
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.880
You got embarrassed for real.

99
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.960
The man, chill, I'm sarcastic!

100
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.320
Habibti is the girl variant of Habibi which means darling.

101
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.960
To guys you say Habibi, to girls Habibti.

102
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.120
Arabic has not developed sufficiently so they or non binary-

103
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:14.000
- Neither he nor she, you call Hmar.
 Otherwise it means darling.

104
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.280
Did you have to bring the last one?
 There it burst.

105
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.120
I've seen fast cash, so I know all the resorts.
 So I would say ...

106
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.680
Oh my God!

107
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.360
Let him lie down.
 Leave him left!

108
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.520
If he dies, he dies.

109
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.280
You just need to keep track of Habibti and Habibi.

110
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.840
Then I say true.

111
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.800
You think Habibti is the feminine version of Habibi, "my darling"?

112
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.960
Just right, Habibti.
 Congratulations, you've got one more point.

113
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.800
- Congratulations to your first point.
 - Thanks, fast cash.

114
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.080
We're with you, Matilda.
 Who do you choose?

115
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.560
Thanos.

116
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.320
- Tjena, Ahmed.
 - Tjena, Thanos.
 The situation?

117
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.160
I feel like a dry svenne today.

118
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.880
- But the hair is moistened.
 It is good.
 - It's always.

119
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.080
From the Kalabalikistan, of course.
 Well, you understand ...

120
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.680
No, but Kalabalik comes from Turkish.

121
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.720
It means crowd.
 Is it a crowd of Turks -

122
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.600
- Then they know it will be a calabic.
 Is it good?
 Yes...

123
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.200
- It's my final answer.
 -What are you saying?

124
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.400
Can you say that you know that is true?
 It's true.

125
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.600
Did you hang out with Turks in London too?

126
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.800
- How do you know it's true?
 - A friend is Turk.

127
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.480
Please...

128
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.600
Every time he is with Matilda, it becomes calabal.

129
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.120
Martin.
 I heard that you at work ... you work a lot with immigrants.

130
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.600
- It's right.
 -What do you work as?

131
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.480
Defense Attorney.

132
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.600
- Who do you choose to talk to?
 -Oh...

133
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.440
–Yousif.
 - My fucking brother.

134
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.560
–What are you taking an hour?
 - Like to hear you say so!

135
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.760
Yousif.
 The suburban hose Brösta took a difficult task -

136
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.560
–And entered the new word list in 2022. Where did the term origin?

137
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.760
Breastfeeding.

138
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.960
Breastfeeding, brother.

139
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.760
They said to my mom, "Do you really want to brush this child?"

140
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.440
No, I drive.
 Seriously now.
 It comes from football.

141
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.520
When someone adds a post and you receive it, you chest it.

142
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.840
It actually sounds reasonable, so I say it's true.

143
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
-It's true.
 You trust Yousif?
 - No, but ... I think it's true.

144
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.160
Unfortunately, it's false, so there will be no points this time.

145
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.480
Originally “to crowd” or boast, but are also suburban hose -

146
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.560
- To accept something, for example: "Who picks up the food? - I chest it."

147
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.920
Martin's clients have been browned for many years.

148
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.120
- Caroline, we move on to you.
 - I take Evelyn.

149
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.840
Evelyn, 2017, the radio channel Mix Megapol suffered a coup.
 What so?

150
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.680
Under "Gry Forsell with friends", the frequency was cut by jihadists.

151
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.920
So is basicly hijacked Mix Megapol's radio frequency -

152
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.760
–And played a jihadist song in type half an hour -

153
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.920
- Till's mix got the frequency back.

154
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.440
Salil al-Salam ...

155
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.200
- Caroline ... - I am a jihadist in my spare time ...

156
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.840
... so I happen to know it's true.

157
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.120
She has seen fast cash.

158
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.680
Caroline, great work.
 You got one more point.
 It's true.

159
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.360
Mix Megapol's Malmö frequency was cut by pirate transmitters.
 Surprise, Surprise.

160
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.520
- Matilda, do you feel ready?
 - Yeah.

161
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.680
- What do you choose?
 –Alaf.

162
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.000
Elaf, time for a picture question.

163
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.720
It is Evelyn's mother who burns Evelyn's inheritance -

164
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.920
- For it will not be grandchildren.

165
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.160
She kill your entire tribe, the man!

166
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:20.360
No, that was another Chinese aunt.
 She burns pretend money.

167
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.760
Chinese believe that if you burn paper copies of something -

168
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.960
- So they reach their dead relatives.

169
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.480
They also burn brand bags and branded shoes, iPads and iPhones -

170
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.640
—To the dead relatives not to miss the technological development -

171
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.280
- and have fomo in heaven.

172
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.320
I have no idea.
 It sounds...

173
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.520
So, you can't burn iPads.

174
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.680
- But there are paper copies.
 - Yes, but then it's true.

175
00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:59.640
Then it's true?
 Okay.
 Then it became true.
 Matilda, do you know what?

176
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.800
You just got full pot: 3 out of 3.

177
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.800
It is done at the holiday Qingming, the Day of Death.

178
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:15.040
You burn paper versions of things you want to send to your ancestors.

179
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.400
Martin, as you can see, is all panelists selected.
 Therefore, your panelist becomes ...

180
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:24.560
... randomly selected.

181
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.280
- Filip.
 - Hit me!

182
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.480
The cock.
 - Ey, BRE, help me.

183
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.160
Shall I help you?

184
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.320
That's a lot ... heres.

185
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.600
It's very much heres.
 It's very much heres.
 It's very much heres.

186
00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.000
The area is ... maybe not the cock, but wrote.

187
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.840
- This area?
 –Yes.

188
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.480
Yes, but I think you have seen that, that kind of dance.

189
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.920
Martin pretends that he himself does not usually whina.

190
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.440
I have tried, but no one wants to see, so it is better that you do.

191
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.600
You seem to know it, so it should be reasonable.
 - Or what do you say?

192
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.880
But do you think it's true?

193
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.680
He tried to drive a lawyer.
 "It's reasonable."
 He wanted to get away.

194
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.840
I don't want to go out.

195
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.680
I say it's ... true.

196
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.960
You say it is true that the focus in the Eskista dance is written and cock.

197
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.160
It's false.
 Unfortunately.
 There will be no point for you.

198
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.080
It is the focus on the shoulders in the Ethiopian dance Esskista.

199
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.160
No, it felt like a hate crime.

200
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.200
Dogge drives a car, brother.

201
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.120
Ahmed, show!

202
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.200
Unfortunately, I don't get paid for it.

203
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.360
Martin, you do not follow the final.

204
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.880
But Matilda and Caroline are on to the final.

205
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
It's about coming first to five.

206
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.520
But if you answer wrong, the score goes to your opponent.
 Are you in?

207
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.120
-I am with.
 - What do you start the final round with?

208
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.240
Yes...

209
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.040
–Eh ... —You get Branne.

210
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.200
Yes, I thought so.

211
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.840
Branne, you are a nice Andrew Tate.

212
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.680
I'm going now.

213
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.520
- He is lying, but you take him anyway.
 - I didn't lie!

214
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.720
- You did.
 - Okay, I lied to her.

215
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.120
Not only patchwork distributes fines in the resort.
 Who else can you be fined?

216
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.680
SL.

217
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.760
That's it.
 No, joking aside ...

218
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.760
It is religious uncles acting as a police officer.

219
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.440
They go around in Ford Escort.
 Look how you behave at the mosque.

220
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.720
- Do you sprinkle outside ... - She don't know what Pipas is!

221
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.360
Sorry.
 Sunflower seeds.
 See if the name is correctly spelled on your designer clothes.

222
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.680
If you show ankles.
 You are fined and have to leave gifts in the mosque.

223
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.920
Dates.
 A lamb if you fucked up properly.

224
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.000
-What are you saying?
 - The end, then ...

225
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.600
No, that can't be true.

226
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.280
- You think Branne is lying to you?
 -Yes.

227
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.800
Nice that you learn from experiences.
 Obviously it's false.

228
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.960
Your first point in the final round.

229
00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.440
It is not religious as a fine.
 However, it is not unusual -

230
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.000
- That a criminal with violence capital puts a debt on you.

231
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.200
Congratulations to your score.
 - Caroline, we move on to you.

232
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.640
-Thanos.
 -Thanos.

233
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.320
Hairdresser, dry cleaner and wedding fixer.

234
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.000
No, but Hovsjö is called Lilla Lagos.

235
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.080
It is because that lives many Nigerians, Somalis and Finns.

236
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.280
–Dogge: Finns.
 - Do you own Finns?
 Sorry.

237
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.440
-Eh ... -nigerians, Somalis and Finns.

238
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.000
- They are the three dominant groups.
 - You don't have to translate.

239
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.040
- Clearly I needed it.
 - Or that's what he needed.

240
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.880
What can it be?

241
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.040
Haven't you seen fast cash?

242
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.240
They are in completely different places.
 I say it's false.

243
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.640
False.
 You don't believe in Thanos.

244
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.840
If you are wrong, the point goes to the opponent.
 It doesn't.
 False.

245
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Congratulations, Caroline.
 You get your first point in the final round.
 It's false.

246
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.480
The ethnicities are Assyrians/Syrians, Armenians and Sweden Finlanders.

247
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.960
Syrians.
 Do you understand?

248
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.200
You said there were Somalis in Södertälje.
 We don't do that.

249
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.080
Matilda, who do you choose to talk to?

250
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.000
- Then I was going to take Filip.
 -Hello Hello!

251
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.040
Filip, it's time for a picture question.

252
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.800
For the hospital's V-undone t-shirts-

253
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.040
- So he had to flase his fucking chest hair.
 What the fuck is that?!

254
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.200
He wrote that he was very grateful to all white people -

255
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.480
- Which has been involved in creating the Swedish democratic welfare society.

256
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.320
If I don't remember, he's a Swedish Democrat, so it may be true.

257
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.840
- Sant.
 -You say true?

258
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.440
Damn, what your memory doesn't fail you.
 Just right.
 Congratulations.

259
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.520
Good!

260
00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.440
- We will check out the real tweet.
 - I've probably seen it.

261
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.040
He was extremely grateful for all the whites who built the Swedish welfare.

262
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.600
He looked at Hanif Bali: "Hold My Beer, Buddy."

263
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.960
Caroline, we're going back to you.

264
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.120
--Assia.
 -Hello!

265
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.360
Assia, 2016, a department store chain got to taste the annual Lucia Break.

266
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:15.080
-What was that about?
 - They sold Lucia crowns that were hijabs.

267
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.240
No, sorry.
 I'm kidding.
 They went full multi-culti-

268
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.440
- And had a little black boy like Lucia in his Christmas catalog.

269
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.800
-What are you saying?
 -I recognise that.
 It's true.

270
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.800
Congratulations, you got one more point.

271
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:44.520
Åhléns had a black boy in an advertising campaign and it became a drive.

272
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.840
Hundreds of racist comments on social media.
 - Matilda.

273
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.280
- I choose Elaf.
 -Elaf ...

274
00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:03.680
These are the four members of a boy band called Waheed.

275
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.440
They have become a symbol of a united Middle East.

276
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.520
They live in Berlin, but come from different countries in the Arab world.

277
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.360
They consist of two Muslims, a Jew and a Christian.

278
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.600
Eh ... Was it the name of the members you said, then?

279
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.920
-Yes.
 What were the names?
 - As you have listened ...

280
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.360
–Ojava, baking watch, basur, rojhel.
 - Yeah.

281
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.080
It's on her Spotify.

282
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.920
I try that is true.

283
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.800
You believe in Elaf, that it is a project to combine MENA.

284
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.320
- It's false.
 - Fuck!

285
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.800
Congratulations, Caroline.
 You have received points.

286
00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.960
It's false.
 It is the four parts of Kurdistan that coincide with -

287
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.160
- The Kurdish minorities in Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran.

288
00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.320
- Can you tell them again?
 -Absolutely not.

289
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.760
It sounds like a hogwart role formula.
 Rashigorarshira ...!

290
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.600
–Ojava, baking watch, basur, rojhel.
 --Oooh!

291
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.680
Caroline ... we look at the score.
 It stands 3–2 to you.

292
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.760
- What do you choose?
 –Evelyn.

293
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.040
Evelyn ...

294
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.440
Shoo.
 VGD?

295
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.840
What are you doing?
 No.
 The thing is...

296
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.680
Big, rapper, is actually pronounced right -

297
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.840
- So he contacted the Moderates and wanted to write a campaign song for them.

298
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.760
But the Moderates refused, because they do not want to be associated with the resort.

299
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.920
- Caroline, what do you say?
 - Yes, that is the question.

300
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.760
Hearing greatly to Kristersson to offer a campaign song?

301
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.520
I think I recognize it.
 I say it's true.

302
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.880
You choose to believe in Evelyn.
 Which then means that ...

303
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.240
Matilda, you've got one more point.

304
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.640
It's false.
 Large urged their followers-

305
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.040
- Writing "Hédi Fried" on Ulf Kristersson's Instagram -

306
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.280
- As he promised her to never have anything contact with SD.

307
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.440
- They would be a good duo, big and Ulf.
 -Big and small.

308
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.640
Who, Matilda?

309
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.480
Now I choose Dogge.

310
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.560
- DOGGE.
 –Yes.

311
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.120
It was Bert Karlsson, but it was the elephant who rode on Bert.

312
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.840
No I'm joking.
 It was Sean Banan 2014.

313
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.760
And the song was called ...

314
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.280
... "bananas in the concrete" if I remember just right.

315
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:17.200
Yes, I have absolutely no idea.
 Can you even ride an elephant in Sweden?

316
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.880
- In the resort you can get everything.
 - It wasn't Sean Banan, so false.

317
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.120
- You say it's false?
 - No, I say it's true.

318
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.880
Unfortunately, it is false, Matilda.
 No point to you, but to Caroline.

319
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.840
To answer if you can rent an elephant to ride: Yes, you can.

320
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.560
The year was 1999. The artist was Ayo and the song obviously "The Concrete Jungle Book".

321
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:54.360
Never feel the prisoner in the suburban concrete

322
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.560
- You know who it is.
 - In the suburb you ride on camel.

323
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.560
Caroline.
 We should not think about animals anymore.
 But do you know what to think about?

324
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.800
You have 4 points.
 This means that if you answer correctly, you take home the whole thing.

325
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.240
–Yousif.
 –Yousif.

326
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.400
What are you saying?

327
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.640
Stand.

328
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:29.080
Abow, that's true too.
 No.
 The real answer is bargain.

329
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.200
If you bargain loudly and it smells, you have to "reset" and redo everything -

330
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:40.440
- Hold yourself and ask for.
 But some, who are not really trained, say -

331
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:46.280
- That if you are fishery and there will be no sound or smell, you will get away.

332
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.680
So ... it's unreasonable to have a prayer ritual that stimulates the intestines -

333
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.920
–And you lie down in a typically bargain -friendly position -

334
00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.240
- To say "if you bargain when we exposed you to this" ...

335
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.000
The position, not the prayer.
 "Then you have to start over."
 It feels unreasonable.

336
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.200
It feels more reasonable for it to be a nice and enjoyable moment.

337
00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.240
You say it's false.
 You choose not to believe in Yousif.

338
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.960
Unfortunately, it cost you a point.

339
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.560
Then the score goes to Matilda.

340
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.440
It's true.
 You must not hustle during the prayer.

341
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.160
You know what?
 We are in an extremely exciting and fun location.

342
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.840
As you can see, it is 4–4.
 We have no panelists left.

343
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.360
- We run the rash issue closest to wins.
 -Ooh!

344
00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.160
Are you ready to show your answers?

345
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.560
- This is exciting!
 - Matilda, you guess at 1608.

346
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.000
Caroline guesses at 1523.

347
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.400
The correct answer is ...

348
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.600
... 1983.

349
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.280
This means that Matilda was closest.
 You don't just win the round -

350
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.040
- You win the whole competition!
 Congratulations, Matilda!

351
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.640
Here you have your fine IFS diploma.

352
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.920
Here you have a lot of Chinese fake copies to burn to the ancestors.

353
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:43.640
A large applause to the winner Matilda and to Caroline and Martin.

354
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.920
Our fantastic panel!

355
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.200
Our wonderful audience and all of you at home: Thank you!
 See you again soon!

356
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.560
