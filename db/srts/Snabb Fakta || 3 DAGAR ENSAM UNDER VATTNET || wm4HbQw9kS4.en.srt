00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:25,580
On May 26, 2013, a towing boat with a crew of 12 people went about 32 km off the coast of Nigeria.

2
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:37,760
The boat towed at the time a large oil tank vessel when the waves outside the boat began to become more and more violent.

3
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,060
Suddenly, a big wave hit the small towing boat and the towing line is torn off.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:01:02,860
This got the boat to edge and it was turned upside down in the water and now began to sink down to the bottom.

5
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:17,060
Water poured in everywhere and the panic looked into the crew that was locked up in its cabins at this time.

6
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,060
Why were they locked up?

7
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:29,980
Well, because the area they were on used to be regularly affected by pirates who rob and sometimes steal the ships.

8
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:37,780
It was a security measure so that they would not be injured or ended up hostage to the pirates.

9
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,000
Unfortunately, this security measure became their death.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,100
But not for the boat's chef Harrison Olene, 29 years.

11
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,960
He was in the toilet when all this happened and suddenly feels how the boat turns.

12
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:08,680
He is thrown out from the toilet and around the different spaces in the boat while at the same time becomes darker and darker

13
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,100
As the boat sinks and is filled with more ... and more water.

14
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:19,960
In the end, he manages to find a small air pocket in one of the rooms where he can finally get air.

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:30,380
What he did not know was that the boat was now completely up and down and was down to the bottom of 30 m deep.

16
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:44,780
The air bubble that Harrison was in was about 1.2 meters high and had enough space to move reasonably free.

17
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,380
But there was a big problem.

18
00:02:48,380 --> 00:03:03,980
After all, when we humans breathe in, we breathe in oxygen, but when we exhale, the lungs emit a gas called carbon dioxide.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,300
Slowly but surely, the air bubble would be filled with more and more carbon dioxide and in the end Harrison would die from it.

20
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:26,140
The air bubble had enough volume to make the oxygen last for about 60 hours before he would start to suffer carbon dioxide poisoning.

21
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,880
However, this was not something he himself knew about at this time.

22
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:45,900
In total darkness, Harrison manages to tear off some wooden panels from the walls and finds a mattress that he could use to build a small platform that he could sit on.

23
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,340
And there he would be sitting.

24
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:59,820
Dressed in only their underwear in the cold sea water, without food or fresh water to drink and in a cold and wet room

25
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:11,900
With a slow but surely declining oxygen supply and in total darkness, Harrison seemed to survive not so great.

26
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,900
Hour after hour passed.

27
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,640
Every little sound scared him.

28
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:27,160
He could hear how fish at the bodies from the crew members and everything he could think of ..

29
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,300
..What it was his turn soon.

30
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:39,820
All he could do now was to wait and hope someone would find him.

31
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
60 hours later.

32
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:01,800
A dive team is down to the depth where the boat was located to retrieve the bodies from the crew.

33
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,420
They look for themselves in the boat and it was difficult to navigate because the boat was up and down.

34
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:17,540
All of a sudden one of the divers sees something in the water.
 One hand extends towards the diver.

35
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,580
The diver grabs his hand and his hand grips back.

36
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,960
"He's alive!
 He lives, ”the diver shouts on the radio.

37
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
It was Harrison.

38
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,300
Both were equally surprised.

39
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:47,020
The diver had not expected anyone to survive and Harrison had almost given up hope of being saved.

40
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:59,920
Unfortunately, after Harrison spent almost 3 days at 30 meters depth, he could not only take him to the surface.

41
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:11,520
There is something called scuba diving, or even "pressure drop" that can occur in all people who are suddenly exposed to a pressure cut.

42
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:22,420
When you dive, the body's different tissues absorb nitrogen from the breathing air which is in proportion to the pressure in the environment.

43
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:33,180
This is no problem as long as you stay at the same depth or the same pressure, but the problem arises when the pressure is reduced too quickly.

44
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:41,700
The nitrogen inside the body then turns to a gaseous form and forms bubbles in the tissues and blood.

45
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:54,880
It can lead to loss of sensation, paralysis and even brain damage.
 In the worst case, this leads to a coma and that the person dies.

46
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:08,260
Harrison had to spend about 2 and a half days in a decompression chamber to get used to his body at the pressure on the surface.

47
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,860
Harrison had no idea how long he had been down in the boat.

48
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:30,280
He guessed in 12 hours and was very surprised that he almost spent 3 days all by himself in total darkness.

49
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:37,380
Harrison is very grateful that he survived but is still plagued by nightmares.

50
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:47,440
He describes in his own words that "sometimes it feels like the bed I sleep in suddenly is sinking and then I think I'm in the sea again."

51
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,240
Then I wake up with a jerk and scream.

52
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,780
Of the 12 people on board, Harrison was the only survivor.

53
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,800
He describes it himself as a miracle.
