00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,260
Good morning everyone in the group.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,440
Hope you have a good Sunday.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,320
I hope I will have time to continue recording these ...

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,240
Small films

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,140
and I have thought about that

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,400
the question that almost all the time comes in the group

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,660
of new members are

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,340
How can I speak Swedish?

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,260
How can I get better at speaking Swedish?

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
How can I practice it?

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,900
And many want Swedish friends or they want someone to talk to

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,360
But it might be difficult to meet someone.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,940
So this is an important issue and it is a difficult question

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,640
Many who seem to think about this.

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,660
So I would like to discuss this in the group.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,040
That we can help each other with different ideas.

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:08,740
about how to practice talking more and exercising in different ways

18
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,340
And I believe a word that is important here

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,280
It is to be creative

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,900
creative

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,400
It means to think in different ways

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Think about new ways.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Use their imagination.

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,980
Find different solutions to problems.

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,820
And I sometimes think when we practice language that ...

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,260
That we just do the same thing.
 We get stuck in some ...

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,720
Some patterns.
 We exercise the same way all the time.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,800
And this thing about talking is something that many people think is hard.

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,120
So then maybe it will be to get stuck

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,220
In some things

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,380
You may not exercise at all because you are shy or nervous.

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,940
Or you exercise the same way with the same people.

33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,640
because one does not get new ideas

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,140
I would like to try to give you some tips

35
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,760
and I want you to give tips to each other in

36
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,980
In the comments and in the group.

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,100
So that we can get better at practicing talking.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,220
Next movie I will try to talk more about this.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Right now you can only, if you have any comments ...

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,900
or thoughts, or want to write something about this so ...

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,500
So do it in the comment to this group

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,980
To this movie, to this post

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,020
so

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
so we'll see what we come up with

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
What ideas we get

46
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,300
Okay, have a great Sunday and then we will hear again soon.
