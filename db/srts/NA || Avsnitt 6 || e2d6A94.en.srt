Landskrona's most fun Syrian - Filip Dikmen!

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.520
Abracadabra!
 He's back - Megic Mike!

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.360
If you cross Angola and Degeberga you get Petrina Solange!

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.600

Rågsved's musical July child, who has a heart of IS - Naod!

9
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.880
And IF's brother from Jordbro - Big O!

10
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.040
And now, the man with big A and even bigger B - Ahmed Berhan!

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.800
IFS - The program that helps Swedes charm immigrants at Tinder.

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
My name is Ahmed Berhan, and it's semi -finals -

13
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.280
- In the quiz about all culture in Sweden!

14
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.840
Our semi -finalists:

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
He was looking forward to the truth and he is here again - Jonas!

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.040
She loves to pop a frill, but today she will try to win - Zoofie!

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.200
And last but not least, the only Gunilla Persson IFS admits:

18
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.480
Countess from Hässelby - Gunilla!

19
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.160
The contestants choose one in the panel that I ask another question.

20
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.440
The panelist answers, the contestant decides whether the panelist is lying or not.

21
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.840
- Jonas, is it just as easy today?
 -I hope so.

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.840
- What are you starting with?
 - It I meet in everyday life - Big O.

23
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.840
Jalla, big o!
 What kind of clock?

24
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.480
No idea, but I think the clock maker has really good Äzi.

25
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.160
This is what the bells look like in Ethiopia.
 Wallah, it's COK Smart.

26
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.040
You start the day when the sun rises, at six in the morning -

27
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.880
- And when the sun goes down, six hours later, you start from one again.

28
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.960
- This sounds totally sick.
 -Yes.

29
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.200
I go on the gut feeling: False.

30
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.560
You pulled a rivet, because the big o said is true.

31
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.080
That is why Eritreans and Ethiopians never arrive on time.

32
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.880
The clock counts from when the sun rises, and at twelve it has gone down.

33
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.840
- Zoofie, who do you want to start with?
 -Thanos.

34
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.400
Liberal Carl B Hamilton left Parliament after a statement.

35
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.280
- What had he said?
 - "Allahu Akbar."

36
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.280
No, he had said that prostitution is okay, as long as she is foreign-

37
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.480
- For then it is not counted as Swedish labor.

38
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.040
- It's the Liberals.
 - Free labor market, "and what not".

39
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.560
It's sounds too sick to be true, and that's why I think ...

40
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.720
I think you speak the truth.

41
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.560
It sounds too sick to not be true.

42
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.720
You think it's true, and that means ...

43
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.400
... no point to you either!

44
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.760
- We start strongly.
 - It was false.

45
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.080
Liberal Carl B Hamilton was allowed to leave Parliament after he had said -

46
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.360
– That the limit for L's cooperation with SD goes -

47
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.720
- When they start talking about Jews as they talk about Muslims.

48
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.280
Can you repeat?
 I did not understand.

49
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.920
Racism against Jews - no.
 Racism against Muslims - yes.

50
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.800
Okay, now I understand.

51
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.280
We move on to Gunilla.

52
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.680
- Who do you want to start the evening with?
 –Evelyn.

53
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.960
Hi, Gunilla!

54
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.760
–Evelyn Mok.
 - Hed Berhan.

55
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.840
Some Koreans, Japanese, perhaps Asians -

56
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.800
—The need not use deodorant, because we have a gene -

57
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.600
- This means that our apocrine glands produce less of that sweat ...

58
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.560
- What?
 --... that smells bad.

59
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.760
- Apocrine glands.
 -What does it mean?

60
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.560
- I didn't know either.
 - Basically: I don't smell sweat.

61
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.640
Yes, I notice.

62
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.240
Koreans, especially, have this gene and their sweat does not smell.

63
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.720
- So we don't use deodorant.
 - No, I don't think you smell sweaty.

64
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.840
- You don't need deodorant.
 - So that's true, what she says?

65
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.520
You have received the first point of the evening.
 Congratulations, Gunilla!

66
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.040
It's as Evelyn said.
 Some Asians have a variant of this gene -

67
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.240
- Which makes them not smell bad.

68
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.880
- Jonas, who do you choose?
 - I take the beautiful - elaf.

69
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.640
King Carl Gustaf once managed to make Pakistan very varnish.
 How?

70
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.800
Well, our Swedish king had a dog and he named it Ali.

71
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.200
But Ali is the name of one of Islam's holy men.

72
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.800
Then Pakistan became shit, because they are Muslims and hate dogs.

73
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.080
Then he had to change his name on his dog, and poodle.

74
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.680
This should have heard of this - it is totally sick.

75
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.160
- That he named his dog for Ali?
 - Yes, that too.

76
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.080
I say it's false.

77
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.960
- He did.
 - Fucking hell.

78
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:46.640
That's right.
 The king baptized his dog after Ali after boxer Muhammad Ali.

79
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.040
Because people became lacquer, the dog is now called Charlie.

80
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.720
- Zoofie, who do you want to talk to?
 - Petrina.

81
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.840
John Bouvin was a politician for New Democracy.

82
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.520
He said that the children died in Africa of disasters -

83
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.760
- And that they were eaten by lions.

84
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.680
Then they provided Africa assistance and then the people survived -

85
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.200
“But it was not good, because then it was overcrowded, he thought.

86
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.400
"It was bad with assistance," he said.
 - I think what Petrina says is true.

87
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.280
You do that right in. Congratulations, you get a point!

88
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.800
In the past, two to three kids died of different disasters-

89
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.960
-for example.
 they were recognized by some wild animal.

90
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.800
Now we help them, so there will be no deaths, and then there will be a disaster.

91
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.600
–Wooo ... - is he racist or not?

92
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.640
No, that's good.

93
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.600
Megic, do you know many who have been eaten by lions?

94
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:10.280
Yes, there are many who have been eaten by lions.
 My uncle.

95
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.520
-For real?
 -Yes.

96
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.920
-What happened?
 - He was on his way to school.

97
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.120
- Zoofie, congratulations!
 - Why are you laughing?

98
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.600
- Gunilla, who do you choose?
 - Filip.

99
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.480
Wedding.

100
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.600
When someone goes away at a young age -

101
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.120
- It is a bit celebrated, especially if it is an unmarried teenager.

102
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.240
You can kind of shake the coffin a little, and do ...

103
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.800
-I can not.
 Anyone in the audience maybe?
 -I can!

104
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.920
/Ululates/

105
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.160
Allah Sawa, dose dose!

106
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.480
You celebrate on his behalf, because he couldn't do it himself.

107
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.640
-Which age?
 - When someone is generally young.

108
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.920
- Get like if someone gets murdered?
 - If anyone is attacked by a lion.

109
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:16.800
Aha ... my uncle was eaten when he was 32.

110
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.920
Why did your uncle went to school if he was 32?

111
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.320
It's never too late to learn.

112
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:36.520
- Gunilla, true or false?
 - I think it sounded a bit beautiful.

113
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:43.240
- I think it's true.
 -You are absolutely right.
 Congratulations!

114
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.600
That's right.
 It can happen if someone is unmarried and young-

115
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.200
- That you throw in small Wedding at the funeral ceremony.
 Why not?

116
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.480
- Jonas.
 - I take "The Rapper" - Naod.

117
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.640
Which Swedish rapper had plans to rob the Swedish hip hopelitis?

118
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.760
Big O.

119
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.280
No I'm joking.

120
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:15.640
It was money 'per.
 He was the cartel before the cartel-a hip-hop pioneer.

121
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.280
But he was tired of Para-Knas, some money, and such stuff-

122
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.120
- So he realized that he would start taking money from other rappers -

123
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.720
- As had already started making money.
 He was going to start with Mange Schmidt.

124
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.480
-Do you know what Para-Knas means?
 -He is a police officer-he has been para-one.

125
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.360
I have listened to hip hop all my upbringing - I should have heard about it.

126
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.560
This is false.
 I'm ashamed if I'm wrong with this one.

127
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.920
- What are you listening to for hip hop?
 - snoop.
 Snoop Dogg.

128
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.480
How can you listen to Snoop Dogg?
 You are aina!

129
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.640
He goes against his profession.

130
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.800
Jonas, you say it's false ...

131
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.960
... and it's false.

132
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.720
You got a point.
 However, the story is true, with modification.

133
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:26.160
The story does not come from money 'per but from Ken Ring's autobiography -

134
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.680
-There he told me he had plans to trick the hip-hop elite-

135
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.840
- And then force them to overwrite their royalties.

136
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.080
Najs.
 Congratulations on the point, Jonas!

137
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.840
Zoofie, it's time for letters from Botkyrka.

138
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.480
YES!
 We are in Alby center on fruit and vegetables in Northern Botkyrka.

139
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.840
- What fruit do you sell most of it?
 - Watermelon from Morocco.

140
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.640
And the potato, what way does it have?
 Germany or Peru?

141
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.640
You should not answer that - the contestants will answer that.

142
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.080
Wasn't it mango?
 Was it potatoes?

143
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.840
- Wallah, I thought it was mango.
 - No, but ... Germany?

144
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.960
Ein potatoes?
 Zoofie thinks the potato is from Germany, which means ...

145
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.200
There will be no point to you.

146
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.400
The potato comes from Peru.

147
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.760
The Spaniards found it when they were there and toured.
 - Gunilla ...

148
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.520
- Frequently SKINA!
 Who do you choose?
 - Megic Mike.

149
00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.240
Which Swedish comedian was fighting in MMA - and became known on humor sketches?

150
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.680
It was Anis Don Demina.
 He started with Youtube sketches-

151
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.000
- And he hung out with Samir and Viktor.

152
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.560
They made a "hang around" and then he drove some fight, right left.

153
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:21.480
But he thought he was too thick, so he put the MMA gloves on the shelf.

154
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.680
- What was the person called?
 - Ananis Don Demina.

155
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.920
- Did you, Gunilla?
 -Yes.

156
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.880
- I don't think he has been a boxer.
 - not boxers - MMA!

157
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:40.640
He said it was an MMA fighter that was too overweight, so he left.

158
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.800
Brother, that's enough!
 That's my question.

159
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.840
Absolutely right, Mike!

160
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.920
- I can take the question if you want.
 - No, thank you, I'm trying to think.

161
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.640
It's hard in this company - to think.

162
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.800
No, I think it's false.

163
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.800
You don't think Anis Don Demina has had a career in MMA?

164
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.920
-No.
 - Gunilla, why?!

165
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:18.080
- I am sad, Megic.
 - No, you just got one more point.

166
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.960
Gunilla is finished in the first round.

167
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:27.560
The Swedish comedian who has a fighting background within MMA ...

168
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:34.000
... before he became a humor end ice cream, is no less than our own Megic Mike!

169
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.080
Well!

170
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.880
- How did you get into these fights?
 - Card History Facts:

171
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.840
I came to Sweden 2018.

172
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.160
My friends cheated me on an underground fight.

173
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.600
They said the winner gets 10,000, the loser gets 7,000.

174
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:15.080
I said, "Okay, I need money."
 I went in, I won the match -

175
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.280
- And I became known.
 "Let's go!"

176
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.320
"Pound for pound."
 Thanks for that!

177
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.480
Zoofie and Jonas, you have a point each.

178
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.280
We need a rash question, so it's time for us to drive closest to win.

179
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.840
The question is: Uppsala is Sweden's most expensive kebab city ...

180
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.840
- Are you kebabi enthusiasts?
 - I love kebab.

181
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.120
May we see your answers?
 Three, two, one ...

182
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.800
-Oh!
 -Oh!

183
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:07.720
The kebab in Uppsala costs SEK 132.
 Zoofie is a point away.
 - Congratulations!

184
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:14.440
You have made it to the next round.
 - Jonas, thank you for joining!

185
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.600
Gunilla and Zoofie, see you in the duel.

186
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.480
Zoofie, you know how it goes, so we drive!
 You get Big O and Filip.

187
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.760
This drink recognizes most Turks again.
 When do you drink it?

188
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.400
Thus, brother, this drink is called Lohusa Serbeti.
 Do you understand, brother?

189
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:51.000
It is made of cinnamon, manel cloves and the guys Yani.

190
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.280
When a woman gives birth to a child, when she gets inhabited yani ...

191
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.160
... when she drinking it, she producerish breast milk.
 Do you understand?

192
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.200
When it becomes Jetski, brother.
 Do you understand?

193
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.360
-Do you understand?
 - I understood you.

194
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:14.080
Incorrect.
 The correct answer is that it is a Turkish version of Viagra -

195
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.640
- As a drink during the wedding evening for the groom to perform better.

196
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:25.760
- So it's a "magical drink".
 -Thanks so much!

197
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.840
Or ... break.

198
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.920
When I think about it, I agree with Big O. What I said is not true.

199
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.040
Pause.
 Pause.

200
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.480
Frankly, all love, but Filip speaks the truth.

201
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.560
-Reverse psychology!
 - I'm confused now.
 Who is right?

202
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.360
Do you think it is drinking as a potency -enhancing means -

203
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.720
- Or to make the breasts go "squirt, squirt"?

204
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:10.120
I believe in the first option.

205
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:16.520
- So you believe in Filip?
 -Yes.
 I don't usually trust him.

206
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.760
–The Same Applies To You, Shaitan.
 - Chalas.

207
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.080
You should have gone on your gut feeling, because Filip lied to you.

208
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.960
It is not a potency -enhancing drink.

209
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.440
The truth came from Big O. It is a drink you give to new mothers -

210
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.040
- To help with milk production.

211
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.440
It wasn't Viagra?
 Damn, the man, I would buy it.

212
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.520
Gunilla, you should get your duel.
 You get Petrina and Megic Mike.

213
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.360
Petrina and Megic ... the proverb "fits like the hand in the glove" ...

214
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.400
What does "verbatim" mean?

215
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.760
Should we rename the show to SFI?

216
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:27.440
But come on, I can't Swedish.
 Should you put Finnish too?

217
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:37.560
But yes ... Finnish makes snuff of everything -

218
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.280
-And the "hand in the glove" means "the hand on the rod".

219
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.960
Or if you are African: "Hand on Medingo".
 You understand what I mean.

220
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.880
No, this means "fits like the knife in a childhood friend".
 No...

221
00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.960
What the f ...?

222
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.400
No, but that means "fits like the fist in the eye".

223
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.520
Finns are a little more straightforward, so it means fits like the fist in the eye.

224
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.920
I don't think Petrina speaks the truth.
 I believe in Megic Mike.

225
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.840
- Why Megic Mike?
 - You believe in the "hand around the rod"?

226
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.960
Yes, I believe more about the Finns than that, than they get a fist in the eye.

227
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.120
They have knives instead.

228
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:38.240
- It sounded too good for the Finns?
 - Yes, it sounded a little kind.

229
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.760
- So you go straight on ... - Yes?
 - Yes, sorry ...

230
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:49.080
- Can you pronounce the Finnish word again?
 - As you will understand it.

231
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.560
"Sopia Kuin Nyrkki Silmään."

232
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.480
"Supri Koin Numros Selema."

233
00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.160
This is the first time someone applauds when someone gets a stroke on TV.

234
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.520
You chose to believe in Megic Mike, that it is hand around the rod -

235
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:17.120
- For Finns are filthy.
 But, Gunilla, you are wrong.

236
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.360
Megic Mike lied to you.
 Petrina gave you the truth.

237
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.680
The Finnish may have had a good deal, but that means "like a fist in the eye".

238
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.000
Okay.
 None of you got points, but you have a chance for points.

239
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:39.440
Zoofie, your duel goes over to Evelyn and Naod.

240
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.160
Then my question is to you: Last year Sweden beat an unusual record -

241
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.000
- There only Mexico was ahead of us.
 What was that?

242
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.400
Who has the world's most fairly big cock.

243
00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.160
What happens, the man?
 This is not IFS, it is porn.

244
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:06.720
It is blasting it is about, which is crazy.

245
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:14.080
But last year was Mexico, of all countries that are not at war -

246
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.040
- What is only type three countries ...

247
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.160
They had the most blasts per capita-

248
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.400
- And Sweden is second on that list.

249
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:32.840
So ... in a survey, Sweden had gone about the United States, and countries in South America -

250
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
- In eating tortillas, per capita.

251
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.240
- Otherwise, it sounds a bit prejudiced.
 - Who doesn't like tacos?

252
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:47.400
Yes, but that it would be the investigation - most tortillas.

253
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.480
- Swedes love their tacos!
 - Yes, Taco Friday.

254
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.200
Do you know how much Sweden loves its blasts?

255
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.520
What is Taco for something?

256
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.800
- Zoofie, who do you choose to believe in?
 - I put my vote on Naod.

257
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.040
But I don't listen to you.
 I choose Evelyn.

258
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.280
I choose Evelyn, because Filip said I would choose Naod.

259
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.400
- So if I go out it's Filip's wrong.
 - Come at me, bitch!

260
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.720
Imagine when Filip will present her red -haired girl with satan tattoos -

261
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.000
- For her mother!

262
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:36.400
So you believe in Evelyn, that Sweden stands out with -

263
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.280
- Is the number of blasts we have in Sweden.

264
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.560
You blasted up to your first score in the second round.
 Congratulations!

265
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.600
The man, before we move on ... what is tacos?

266
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.040
Nobody believes that you haven't cooked tacos - there is nothing you haven't chewed!

267
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:02.680
Gunilla, you are in the last round, the last question.

268
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.040
If you take this, we will play, but if you answer the wrong ...

269
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.240
Then I can say "Bye, Bye".

270
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.800
Last duel: Remains are no less than Thanos and Elaf.

271
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.720
Here we have a good question: When Usama bin Ladins ... /Laughter /

272
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.680
... computer was confiscated after his death, so did you find what in his computer?

273
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.720
Do we have any anime fans here?
 That was what was found in his computer.

274
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.600
He liked anime, and he gave a lot of time.

275
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.880
You are a big Animefan, so you and Usama had a lot in common.

276
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.760
They found, among other things.
 Dragon Ball, One Piece and Naruto on his computer.

277
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.440
So he was a nerd.

278
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.240
When you didn't think you could like Usama bin Laden more ...

279
00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.560
Elaf Ali.

280
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.760
Gunilla, you hear ... he talks shit as always.

281
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.640
I know this best, I'm from Iraq.

282
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.520
The truth is that they found a folder on his computer -

283
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.000
- which was called 9/11.

284
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.480
It did not contain secret material with maps and so, as one hoped -

285
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.760
-It contained a lot of 9/11 and Usama memes.

286
00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.920
Gunilla, Gunilla ...

287
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.760
Should you believe in someone who spends so much time in front of the mirror?

288
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.360
She probably doesn't need much time in front of the mirror - she's beautiful anyway.

289
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:48.200
I have never seen any disarmed people so much with love.

290
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.920
We're here to talk truth.
 Please may we be late.

291
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.440
- Yes, I'll take Thanos.
 - you?!
 Why?

292
00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:03.200
If it is Zoofie who wins, then congratulations to her.

293
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:09.160
- Gunilla!
 She gives up, the man.
 - Gunilla, you're too cute.

294
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.680
You chose to believe in Thanos - that Usama bin Laden is an animen nerd.

295
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.600
You've received a point.

296
00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:27.960
That's right.
 When the CIA revealed the material from Bin Ladin's computer -

297
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.920
-They invented everything from wedding videos to Disney movies and video games.

298
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.480
- I think my answer was better.
 -It was really 50-50.

299
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:47.360
- You are so credible ... - it's called manipulative.

300
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:53.000
Gunilla, if anyone calls you and asks about your bank ID-Spend!

301
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:59.480
Add at once!
 I love you.
 That's my tip for you.

302
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.680
Awesome work!
 Both got a point, but only one can move on to the final.

303
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.560
It's time for the closest win.

304
00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.360
The question is:

305
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.800
How about you show what you have written on your paintings?

306
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.840
You have written 200,000. - And you have written 500,000.

307
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.240
The correct answer is: 1.2 million Swedes left.

308
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.640
Congratulations, Gunilla, you have made it to the final!

309
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.880
Come, Gunilla, and you'll get your price!

310
00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.280
You have won nothing less than Megic Mike's signed glove.

311
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.760
- We love you, Gunilla!
 - We are seen in the final.

312
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.160
Next week we will pick up the three worst participants from the season.

313
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:08.320
Then it will be time for summer school.
 An applause to Gunilla!

314
