1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08.800
Before the year 1450, virtually all books are made by hand.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,720
One writes by the works words for word-

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,680
-Side for page and chapter for chapter.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,320
Most often it is monks that do it and it can take a year to get a book.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,480
This means, in addition to cramps in the hands, that books are rare and expensive.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,960
It is said that the King of Portugal in 1400 has only nine books.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38.560
He is not close to filling a bookshelf.

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,520
But after years of attempts inventing the German Johannes Gutenberg-

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,240
-A technology for printing books.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,320
He uses loose lead types that can be joined into text lines.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
Now books from rare go to mass -produced.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,680
The art of letterpress was an invention that changed the whole story-

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
-and and humanity's way of being.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
Texts and ideas can spread on a new way-

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,440
-In the period called the Renaissance.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,000
It is a time when you look both back and forward.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,680
What did you write and read at the time-

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,600
-Then literature suddenly could reach many more.

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35.560
The Renaissance is a period that can be difficult to put on a timeline-

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,960
-But it takes over after the Middle Ages and continues until the end of the 17th century.

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,760
"Renaissance" means "rebirth" and one rediscovered the ideal of antiquity-

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,400
-When you thought had been forgotten during the dark Middle Ages.

23
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00.600
Renaissance is a restoration or look back to the ever-

24
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03.040
-In this case to antiquity.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,480
You want to return to what you thought of as the cradle of civilization.

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,960
You not only rediscover the old one but also discover new things.

27
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,040
Europeans are going for them new parts of the world-

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,400
-while you conquer and colonize-

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,360
-And you look out for the first time into space.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
However, the discoveries do not protect against illness.
