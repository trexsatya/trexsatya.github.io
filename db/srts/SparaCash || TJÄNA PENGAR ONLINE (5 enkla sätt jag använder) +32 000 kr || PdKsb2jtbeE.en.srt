1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03,328
In this video, we came through five ways

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,632
Which I use to make more money

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,448
My name is Marcus and I run SparaCash

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,080
SparaCash is for you who want to learn how to invest your money in equity funds and much more!

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,128
Now we jump into way number 1

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,968
It is that I invest in dividend shares

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,784
Dividend shares are a company

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
Who gives out part of their profit

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,672
This means that the company in which I own shares in them shares

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
of the profit to me

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
Because I invest in them

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
In other words

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,816
The more money I invest in the company

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,608
The more money I get back

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:45,240
For example, I own 569 shares in Castellum because Castellum pays approximately SEK 6.50 per share

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
That's how I get out roughly

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,400
SEK 3,700 just this year just by owning castellum's shares

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
With this dividend

19
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
So I can buy more shares

20
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,088
And next year Yes, but then I get a higher dividend

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,392
Because I own more dividend shares like this

22
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
It is called interest on interest

23
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
And it's very

24
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,792
Powerful in the long run to earn even more

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,144
Since 2014 so I earned about SEK 32,000

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
On this kind of profit sharing

27
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,216
By owning different shares

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
Put number 2

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
It's that I use credit cards when I shop

30
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:23,456
I use the complete card when I shop And then I get up to 4% in bonus back

31
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
When I shop for different things

32
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,040
For example, I ordered a new camera

33
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,320
And then I got

34
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,624
SEK 100 back straight in my pocket

35
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
As Thank you for using the complete card

36
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,048
In total, the last twelve months have received just over SEK 1,100 back

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
Because I used the complete card

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,960
This is money that you can set off on the next invoice, so it is pure money

39
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
This means that you do not need to use them on for example

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,616
Airlines or specific store or other that many other cards require

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
But it's money you can set off

42
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
and use. So pure tax-free money.

43
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,320
And now there will be someone who comes and whines

44
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
"Do not deceive people and take credit cards and get into debt"

45
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
I'm not trying to do that

46
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
If it's not you

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
can handle having a credit card

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
Then you should not have a credit card either

49
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
another credit card for you

50
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Who knows how it works

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
read on before applying for a credit card

52
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
But

53
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,616
There is a lot of money to be made if you use a credit card correctly

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,992
I forgot to pay the invoice last month and I had to pay SEK 130 in fees

55
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Or in interest

56
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
And it sucks

57
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
So

58
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
Make sure you keep track

59
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
How credit cards work but do you use it right

60
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
That way you can make a lot of money

61
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,304
I like the complete card because there is no annual fee on the card either

62
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
And that's a great bonus

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,192
Way number 3 is that I invest peer to peer loans (P2P loans)

64
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
And then you might be wondering

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Yes but what is

66
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
P2P Loan for something?

67
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,080
Well P2P loans are quite simple

68
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
So that you lend your money

69
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,736
To a company or private individuals or what for a small interest rate

70
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
And I

71
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
I use Savelend and Mintos

72
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
When I invest in P2P loans

73
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,720
These two actors are two that I have done some analysis on that I trust

74
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
In addition, I am a shareholder in Savelend

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
So there I have a little extra control

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,376
There are more players out there such as

77
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Brocc, Lendify

78
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
And they can also be used

79
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,056
But I am not investing anything there right now but there are links below to the various players

80
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
Keep in mind that there are some p2p players out there who have

81
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
went bankrupt that has escaped with investors' money

82
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
so it is a risk, it is not a risk-free return

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
There is no risk-free return

84
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,296
There is no risk-free return

85
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,976
I have invested just over SEK 6,500 in mintos for about 2 years now

86
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
And they are now worth about eight thousand

87
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
My annual return has gone up to about 10% on Mintos

88
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
And this is before tax

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
At Savelend, I have invested SEK 14,000

90
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
And now the money is worth just over SEK 15,500

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
And this is after tax

92
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
Way number 4 is that I have my savings in a savings account with interest

93
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Many people have their buffer in their regular bank

94
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
A salary account with zero interest but it actually exists

95
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,928
savings accounts out there with up to 1.2% in interest

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
Avanza has a restricted savings account

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
with 1.2 percent interest

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,607
and Komplett bank has a savings account up to 1% in interest

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
Very many people forget that it exists

100
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Savings accounts with interest today

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
But quite a few Dom all have their money

102
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,079
In a savings account that has no interest at all

103
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
so you are losing money on having savings there

104
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Because inflation eats up the value of your money

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
Make sure you always try to get interest on your money

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,623
It's not that much but it gives an extra hundred bucks in your pocket

107
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
per year

108
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,463
Put number 5 and it's pretty fun it is

109
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
that I'm talking about making money

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
So of course there is

111
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,583
opportunities for me to make money

112
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
On learning just how to make money

113
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,495
And secondly, it is if you use any of these links

114
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
To these different companies

115
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,871
Which I'm talking about in this video and my other videos of course

116
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
On my website SparaCash.se

117
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
That's how I make money helping people

118
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Find different services

119
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Through affiliate links

120
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
And this is something I'm trying to do

121
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
in as neat a way as possible

122
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
Because I test the different services and then I see what works and what is good

123
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
And there I use a link

124
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
So I can help you make more money

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
As a thank you, you use my links if that is what you want.

126
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
And if you do not want to do it then it is absolutely fine!

127
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
You absolutely do not have to do it, it's completely calm

128
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
But I would very much appreciate it if you did

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,920
And this is called affiliate marketing

130
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,295
And is it that you want to know more about how to start with that or something

131
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
