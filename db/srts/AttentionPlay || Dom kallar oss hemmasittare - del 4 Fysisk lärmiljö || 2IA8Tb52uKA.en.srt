1
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,759
I would have needed a place for rest because one became very,

2
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,280
very tired very fast and then it would just be nice

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,960
Being able to go into a room and just be able to breathe and hear

4
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,119
yourself and think.

5
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,119
Everything affects one in school.

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,520
I at least much more sensitive at school for

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
Fragrances, light.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,679
How big a room is.

9
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,320
I don't like rooms that have high ceilings.

10
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01.079
I don't like too bright lights.

11
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03.039
I don't like different types of light.

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,159
I don't like different scents.

13
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,480
I'd rather all rooms look similar.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
I don't like when the benches are different in every room I go

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,040
In because then are unsure where to sit.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,120
I want to be able to sit at the back of the classroom but still be able to see

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,040
And hear the teacher.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,719
Loud noises in the classroom I think is, it can be

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,680
very disturbing because I already have as well,

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
concentration difficulties and such.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,680
And then also that you have a place you feel

22
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,239
Safe with.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,040
If you want to sit yourself, it should be possible to solve.

24
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,120
And that one should not have to sit with someone you do not know

25
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:45,680
Self safe with.

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,239
Because I vision problems later,

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,959
So all life really.

28
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,239
So I got to sit at the front of the classroom for me to

29
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,079
be able to see the board.

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,879
But this resulted in my ADHD wanted to look around

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,239
In the classroom, check the back and so on.

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,359
And that noticed the teachers immediately.

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,879
It was very strange light input and it was

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,120
Really not sound -adapted so that all the sound outside came in

35
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,080
And you simply couldn't focus at all.

36
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,439
At the municipal school, I thought the dining room was,

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
very bad.

38
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,240
There were a lot of people, there was little room.

39
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,319
There were people who always came and went and had lessons and.

40
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,759
I was not sure where I could sit and, -are I

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,520
Strange if I sit alone even if I want to sit alone.

42
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,840
And if so, what can I sit with?

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
-Where can I sit?

44
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,560
And there are no written rules.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,639
The best thing for me would be that everything is

46
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,919
The same every day.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
One does not have to have lots of variety and change things

48
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,159
all the time and stuff like that, without it to be the same place

49
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,439
And the same routines every day.

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,639
It worked very well for me.

51
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00.159
When I went back to school, to plug in,

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02.120
fulltime.

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04.840
Or go back like a normal person.

54
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:11,080
Then it was important to me, especially in the beginning, to have a

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,000
place where I could really pull myself back and sit

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,879
Yourself and reload for the next lesson.

57
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,039
A good time I remember it was in grade one.

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,680
Then it was a classroom that had been built out in the school yard,

59
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,360
For our class and then we had pedagogy.

60
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,719
And this helped me incredibly much.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,360
The educators they told my mom and dad that they noticed

62
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37.560
Such an incredible difference in how I concentrated in the classroom

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
And I concentrated outdoors.

64
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,080
So what I feel I would still need

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,000
Of is to be able to sit in a group room.

66
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,360
And get to discuss with friends about it when we are going to plug in to

67
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,240
a sample or if there are any questions to answer.

68
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
That you can sit in smaller groups and discuss.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,879
Then get my new school so it was very much

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,199
sound insulation and one could not hear from the door and

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05.039
It was very good so you can't lose

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,199
The focus at all type.

73
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09.159
And it wasn't a lot of windows at all, was just on

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,479
The page and it was easy to turn from.

75
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,400
And yes, everything just works well there.
