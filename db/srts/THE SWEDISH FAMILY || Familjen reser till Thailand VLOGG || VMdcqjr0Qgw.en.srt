1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,580
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,000
We are in...

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,060
Thailand!

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,060
Yes!

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,220
If you follow us on Instagram you already know that.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
We post pictures and stories everyday!

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,940
Yes.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,480
Anyway, this is a Youtube vlog of the journey
from Sweden to here...

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,340
- To...
- Khao Lak.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,940
Oh, I was about to say "Thailand".

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, Khao Lak is located in...

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,820
- Thailand!
- Exactly.

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,700
Here it is!

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,740
Ugh, it's so cold!

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,300
How are you feeling?

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,860
Fine.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
- Are you stoked?
- Yep!

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,140
You're smacking quite a lot.

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,360
Rocket...

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,180
How many bags do we have?

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,960
Three bags are checked, and the children's...

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,000
- It wasn't Alma and Harry. I thought it was!
- Yeah, like...

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,460
We've checked three bags,
and then we each have a...

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,580
...carry-on bag.

25
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,260
I have a backpack, Joanna has a backpack,
and the kids have...

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,160
Yeah, we have a backpack each.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Then we have this thing with our passports.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,720
We also have these. We don't know how to check them,
they might need to go as special baggage.

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,040
We'll ask when we get to the check-in counter.

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,760
Come on, friends!

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,240
Yes! Let's swish off!

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,560
Let's go!

33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,760
- What do we do with these? Should I ask over there?
- Yes, do that.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,960
- The scooters are special baggage.
- Yes.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,920
- Axel got a bag.
- Mhm.

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,820
Now we're on our way
to check them at another place.

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,720
Yes!

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,140
Daddy, look what I can do.

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Oh, that's so good!

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,160
There... Now Alma's.

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,360
Ouch!

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,520
What's the matter?

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,500
I hit my, like... knee bone.

44
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh, no.

45
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,180
QUIET! Be quiet!

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,160
They will speak like that all the time
while we're at the airport, you see.

47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,360
We've left the children's scooters, and are about to
go through the security check, but we can't film that.

48
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,340
We'll see you on the other side!

49
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Oh, wow!

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,740
- You've got a lot to choose from!
- Yes, so much.

51
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,240
What is this?

52
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,340
That's Scooby-Doo.

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,400
We watched Scooby-Doo at Tanja's house.

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,900
That one, I think.

55
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,860
But that's not a magazine, is it?

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,940
- Do you want that instead of a magazine?
- Yes.

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,140
I have decided on this one.

58
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,340
Good!

59
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,060
- We're kind of in a hurry, so let's go to the checkout.
- Yes, we're in a big hurry.

60
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,660
- We're in a big hurry?
- We're in a big hurry.

61
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,040
The time is now 4:10 p.m.
and our flight leaves at 4:40 p.m.

62
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,220
So we've got 30 minutes.

63
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,120
- I want to open...
- I want my scooter!

64
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,400
- Mom, can I open the gift I got on the plane?
- Yes.

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,040
- We'll make it.
- We'll make it.

66
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,500
Good!

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,120
It's been so stressful these past few days.
It's hard to even explain.

68
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,120
I'll fall into a coma on the plane, I feel.

69
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,260
Yes. Not wake up, and just like...

70
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,160
- Do you know what that is behind us?
- No?

71
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,740
- That's our gate, and it's boarding time!
- Yes!

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,760
Yay!

73
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,960
- Now we're off! Bye bye, Sweden.
- Yes, we're so ready!

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,840
Bye bye, Sweden. I'll miss you!

75
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,040
Should I tell you what I will not miss?

76
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,620
What's that?

77
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
The darkness.

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
You don't like the dark,
because on camera it gets all like...

79
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,540
Yes!

80
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,780
Then we can't use the footage
and need to quit the entire vlog.

81
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,860
For that reason, and many other,
I don't like the darkness.

82
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,400
- It's not even 5 p.m, and it's black as night outside.
- Yes.

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,200
It's not nice! That's outside...

84
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,600
- Joanna has a fixation on the darkness.
- Yes, I know.

85
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,440
- Hey, hey!
- What are your seat numbers?

86
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,100
- 6 C through F.
- Yes. Go to...

87
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,260
- That way?
- Yes!

88
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,020
- We're stopping here?
- Yes, we're going in there.

89
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,940
What's this? It's a blanket!

90
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,300
Harry chose...

91
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
...instead of a magazine...

92
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,220
- ...a Turtles...
- A Turtles figure.

93
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,440
Look!

94
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Oh! Show it.

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,320
Oh, what a tongue!

96
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,640
I know, you do like this...

97
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,160
- Look what I got with the magazine, dad!
- So fun!

98
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,540
I got this with the magazine.

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,140
Oh, wow. What is it? Hold it higher.

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,460
It's a little thing you can hang somewhere.
I can hang it on my backpack, or somewhere else.

101
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,320
The airplane took off a bit later, just after 5 p.m.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,500
All the lights were switched off,
which they need to be when you take off in the dark.

103
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,300
Then they turned the lights back on,
and this funny bunch each pulled out a screen.

104
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,440
The time is now 6:30 p.m.

105
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,940
I hope they'll bring out the food soon.
We're all hungry.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
- Yes, this is us.
- This is for you.

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,020
Alma...

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,640
Harry, the food is here!

109
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,860
- What's that?
- That's a dessert. It looks like lemon cake.

110
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,420
- It looks tasty.
- But you're eating this first.

111
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,300
Meatballs and mashed potatoes, that's tasty!

112
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,180
Where's the dessert?

113
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,920
What's going on over there?

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,840
He's being grumpy and rude.

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,820
- Tired.
- Yes.

116
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,540
That's how it is with kids, when they're tired and on a flight and it's uncomfortable, and things like that.

117
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,600
It's like that sometimes, not always. Sometimes.

118
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,180
The water isn't for drinking.

119
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,320
- Is it written in English?
- Yes.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,220
Vat...

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,720
...er... Vater.

122
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
- "Water".
- Good!

123
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,320
Water...

124
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,060
Not...

125
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
For...

126
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,440
Drink...

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,320
...ing.

128
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,380
The time is now 8:45 p.m.,
and we're getting ready to sleep.

129
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,980
At least we're hoping to get some sleep.

130
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,960
Good morning. We have just woken up.

131
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,780
Alma is watching The Boss Baby,
and Harry is still sleeping on the floor.

132
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
What time is it?

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:15,000
It's 8 a.m. in Thailand - I've changed my watch.
The time in Sweden is two o'clock at night...

134
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,300
- I feel it in my body and in my soul. I'm really tired.
- Yes...

135
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,880
The positive part is that we've got 2 hours left
of an 11 hour long flight.

136
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,020
Soon it will be over. That's nice!

137
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,800
- It's really hot here, mom!
- Yes!

138
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,020
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

139
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,600
Do you know what we are waiting for now?

140
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,740
No.

141
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
I actually don't.

142
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,700
- Passport stamp!
- Yes!

143
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,660
- A stamp in my...
- It's called passport control.

144
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,780
Yes!

145
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,180
- They're having some trouble letting each other be.
- Yes.

146
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,260
They're teasing and taking digs at each other.

147
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:46,260
It will be better when we arrive. There are other kids there, and they can swim and play.

148
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,320
Oh! It's so hot!

149
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,800
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

150
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
- Welcome!
- Thank you!

151
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,080
- Where are you going for a swim? At which hotel?
- The Sands.

152
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,360
The Sands...

153
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,440
I just have to say; I actually know who you are!
I watched your videos the other day.

154
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,800
Oh really, how fun!

155
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,160
Actually we haven't mentioned that
this trip is a collaboration with TUI.

156
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,560
- They are sponsoring us these two weeks in Thailand.
- Yes.

157
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,140
This is the start of our long trip.
We are going to other countries after this.

158
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,920
This is a really nice start which we are very happy for!

159
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
- Oh!
- Oh!

160
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,740
I stepped on something.

161
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,880
- Now we're taking a bus to Khao Lak.
- Yes!

162
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,960
- It will take two hours.
- I think he said two and a half hours.

163
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,940
- We landed at the airport in Krabi.
- Yes.

164
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,960
That's the bus we were on.

165
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,180
This is our hotel.

166
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,740
That bus ride took three hours.

167
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,280
Harry fell asleep at the end of the ride.

168
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,940
- Which one is a hotel?
- This is our hotel.

169
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,580
- Our hotel is right here.
- This is where we're staying. Finally, Harry!

170
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,980
- Welcome to The Sands!
- Hi!

171
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,220
Thank you, yes.

172
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,440
This looks like a safari car.

173
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
The space around the hotel is large.

174
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,780
It looks really large.

175
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,780
This is the Kids Club pool over here.

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,880
And behind the Kids Club...

177
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Oh! Alma and Harry, look!

178
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,500
What did you think of that?

179
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,600
Super cool!

180
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,220
Oh, it almost touched...

181
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,900
- Alright, here we are!
- Yes.

182
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,460
- Welcome to your room!
- Thank you!

183
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,060
Thank you!

184
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,840
- Straight out to the pool!
- Oh, how nice!

185
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,540
- You can just jump right in!
- Yes!

186
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,020
This is an interesting solution...

187
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,000
...for the bathroom.

188
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,660
This is where Alma and Harry will be sleeping.

189
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,040
And you can close... with this.

190
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,660
- And it has stars!
- Cute, right?

191
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,880
And this is mom and dad's!

192
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,580
We've been here for a couple of days now,
and we will of course post more vlogs from here.

193
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,800
Yes!

194
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,080
We've got a Question of the Day.

195
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,000
"Fotbollstjej07" asks:

196
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,640
"What does Alma and Harry think
of you guys being away for so long?"

197
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,320
For super long!

198
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,680
How do you feel about that?

199
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Good!

200
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,260
I actually think it's totally fine.

201
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,980
I don't think that Alma and Harry understand
how long we're going to be away.

202
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,580
We are talking about four months.
Even I have a hard time understanding it.

203
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,460
Yes, me too. It feels really strange.

204
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:05,660
At the same time it feels super nice to start with
more like a holiday - a vacation - for two weeks.

205
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,740
Yes, indeed!

206
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,240
Thank you for watching this video!

207
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,880
Please leave a thumbs up...

208
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,920
...or down!

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,100
Preferably up!

210
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,600
Leave a comment, ask questions,
and have a great time until we see you next time!

211
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,980
Bye, bye!
