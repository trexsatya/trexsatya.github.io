My name is Max Halbwachs and I am a PhD student in the Versam- project

2
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,567
-Which is about regional collaboration processes.

3
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:23,800
In my research I look at the collaboration of private employers-

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,633
-With municipalities and regions when it comes to sustainable commuting.

5
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:29,900
I'll tell you more about this inside the elevator.

6
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:38,567
61 percent of Swedes live within 10 kilometers from their workplace.

7
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:42,933
Still, many people choose to take the car there. Employers may have great impact-

8
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:45,733
-To switch to a more sustainable mobility.

9
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:50,633
They can take measures that facilitate, for example, cycle, walk or go collectively.

10
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,167
But usually no such measures are taken.

11
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:57,167
Therefore, our research will investigate how Sweden's municipalities and regions-

12
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,933
-Can get more workplaces to participate in the transition.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,533
This is to be done by identifying the “intermediate” actors-

14
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,833
-What spreads knowledge and ideas about work commuting.

15
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,867
For example, it can be associations or corporate networks.

16
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:14,433
The aim of the research is to provide the municipalities and regions tool-

17
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:17,033
—while, they can support such an intermediate-

18
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:20,133
-And thus facilitate regional cooperation.
