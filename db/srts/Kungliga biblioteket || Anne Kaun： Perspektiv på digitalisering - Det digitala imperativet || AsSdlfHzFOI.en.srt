1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,820
- Thanks so much.
 I am also curious about this task.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:13,320
To lead a research circle and discuss digitization in libraries.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:23,780
I was going to tell you about my own research and why it is exciting to be here

4
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:33,000
And discuss your texts in a way that I have not worked with much in teaching form.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,300
Is it okay with the sound?

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,400
I have no powerpoint this time.

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,720
What have I researched in recent years?

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:55,860
You mentioned some popular concepts: automation, algorithms, digital media.

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,540
What does it really mean?

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,680
When I try to describe my core interests in my research

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:10,480
I always return to a concept that may not mean much anymore - democracy.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,040
Participation in society, and how it is related to media.

13
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:27,820
All my research has been about it - how do we feel involved in society?

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,400
How can the media contribute to or limit the feeling of participation?

15
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:46,760
A concrete study that I have done in connection with it looks at various political movements.

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,500
One can think about participation and attitudes to the media in different ways.

17
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,000
One can think of ethics, emotions, physicality, sweating.

18
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,180
But you can also think about political issues.

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,240
What kind of politics?
 How does it limit citizens?

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,100
To relate to some with media ecologies.

21
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,660
There I have taken a historical perspective and over time tried to follow the change process.

22
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,220
From the 30s and the labor movement.

23
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:30,480
Their printing press, their own flyers, and what role such expressions played,

24
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,060
Until the 2010s, and the digital present we are moving in.

25
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,180
What it makes you have to relate to media infrastructures

26
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,720
Which constantly requires content production.

27
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:51,240
You may not have so much time to think about the content and message.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:59,260
A kind of time change that comes with the media we use as political activists.

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,100
It was a project I was doing for a few years.

30
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,480
Right now I have two projects that can be linked to this discussion.

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,480
The first is a project that started with an interest in the digital imperative.

32
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:28,800
We must all relate to digitalisation as private individuals or at work.

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:42,000
As Jonna uses the philosophers in the past to contrast the present

34
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:50,840
So I want to explore the digital imperative through environments that are perceived as non-digital.

35
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,960
What are the environments today?
 Are they at all?

36
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,060
Prisons, I thought.
 There are no digital media, right?

37
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,480
The inmates have no access to the Internet, and so on.

38
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:18,860
Then I began to approach this environment, which to me feels far away from everyday life.

39
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:27,760
I have no experience with it, but I am beginning to be able to see the digital imperative

40
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,800
Through an environment that from the beginning feels far away from the digital.

41
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:44,440
There are ideas about smart prisons, both regarding surveillance, data -find the inmates,

42
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,800
monitor them and try to predict conflicts.

43
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:00,300
There are different ideas about prisons where new technologies can be developed.

44
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,880
Some restrictions that exist in society at large are not found in prisons.

45
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,720
There are also questions about access to digital media

46
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,360
as a rehabilitation opportunity for the inmates.

47
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,960
It's a way for me to approach the digital imperative.

48
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,580
By looking at environments that may be perceived as non-digital.

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:36,120
There I can clearly see change processes that apply to society at large.

50
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,680
Another project, which is linked to the library environment and digitalisation,

51
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,540
is about automated decision -making in the public sector.

52
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,720
Automation in the public sector where you delegate different decisions

53
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,840
to algorithms and technological infrastructure.

54
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:09,220
I am conducting interviews with people working in the public sector.

55
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,680
Specifically, I interview people at the Employment Service at different levels.

56
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,240
In the leadership, in the group that develops artificial intelligence and algorithmic solutions

57
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,020
To be able to delegate information to the robots.

58
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,260
But I also talk to the administrators.

59
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,200
I am trying to approach a digitization process

60
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,540
through concrete stories from their everyday lives.

61
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,200
How does it feel to work with some infrastructures?

62
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,140
What are the restrictions?
 How can the organization get better?

63
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,920
Where do you lose in interpersonal contact?

64
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:06,040
When talking to the administrators, they say it is no problem.

65
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,400
It is a logical consequence.

66
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:16,440
We as bureaucrats should not think ourselves, we should be algorithms.

67
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,960
We must follow the rules and not see the individual in our work.

68
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,040
It should not make any difference if I meet you or you.

69
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll always follow the same rules.

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,020
An algorithm is ganke much better than a human

71
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,960
Which has judgment, emotions, and sweat.

72
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,560
Who has problems, and sees different things at the same time.

73
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,840
It is perhaps this process that Jonna has talked about that you experience.

74
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,960
Actually, the algorithms may be better than we are.

75
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,580
It is interesting to see how they wrestle with it.

76
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,900
On the one hand, the administrators have an idea of themselves with values.

77
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,700
They have democracy in the self description.

78
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,640
They understand as mediators in a democracy, between the state and the citizen.

79
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:34,720
What happens if you perceive yourself as rule -controlled, and the information is then delegated to the machines?

80
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,940
What happens to the relationship between the citizen and the state in the automation process?

81
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,740
That's what I'm interested in.

82
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,220
In all my research I have with me the citizen's perspective.

83
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:59,860
I try to approach the clients.
 How do they experience the change process?

84
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:08,460
How do they feel that the relationship with authorities changes if they meet a digital interface?

85
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,760
If the meeting is about guidance remotely?

86
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:23,380
On Melja, having phone calls and attending online courses remotely.

87
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:31,580
The Employment Service strives to have as much as possible at a distance.

88
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,900
There it is difficult to find a way to approach the citizen perspective.

89
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:52,640
I interview associations that help to facilitate government contacts.

90
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,040
Help build trust in authorities, and so on.

91
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:07,900
Last week I interviewed the process chain, where prison and automation meet.

92
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,880
Process chain is an organization that helps young

93
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:21,800
which is about to end up obliquely, or who come from different institutions, out into society again.

94
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,860
One step in their work is to help with government contacts.

95
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:37,240
How they handle extended digitization, and how it changed over time,

96
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,980
Be interesting to talk to them about.

97
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,020
For them, it is a lot about trust that is built through personal meetings.

98
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:56,040
Which they perceive as difficult to manage through digital meetings and interfaces.

99
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:06,500
Library becomes a place where many aspects must be captured.

100
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:18,040
Building trust is a long and intense process that requires many exchanges.

101
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:25,260
The first contact usually starts with BankID.

102
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,500
They must help with such simple first steps.

103
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,620
It is not really their core business.

104
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:40,720
But the first contact with authorities begins with the Swedish Social Insurance Agency or the Employment Service,

105
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:52,040
In the stories I have taken part in Mirror's aspects of something that may feel greater.

106
00:11:52,260 --> 00:12:02,780
A sense of participation in society that breaks down to a first step

107
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,820
Which can be BankID, which opens access to other tracks.

108
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:18,300
It will be exciting to discuss more how the role of the library has changed.

109
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,440
In the same way that the process of the chain's work has changed with digitization.

110
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,900
There has been a shift from core business to something else.

111
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:40,080
How can you incorporate it into a larger project that means more than downloading BankID?

112
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,280
Thanks so much.
