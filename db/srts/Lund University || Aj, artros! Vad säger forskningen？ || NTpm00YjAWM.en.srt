1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07.366
There are as many as 1 \ hillion Swedes who have osteoarthritis and more and more people are affected

2
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:12,100
of this joint disease that can cause both pain and restrictions.

3
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,166
But what can you do and what does the latest research say?

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,600
About this we shall speak here in the studio

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,433
With Martin Englund who is a professor and physician at Lund University

6
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:24,433
and Andrea dell'isola who is a physiotherapist and associate professor,

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,733
And my name is Kristina LindgÃ¤rde.

8
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:29,800
And now once again welcome to you who listen.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,666
Hope you are there!

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,500
We have received several questions and we will

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,933
answer them and we hope it comes in

12
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,933
Some questions in the chat and we will also do our best to answer.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,766
But first of all, we'll go through and put the picture

14
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:48,200
and explain what osteoarthritis is for something.

15
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:53.066
Thanks for being here, great fun to sit and talk about this disease.

16
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54.666
Yes, osteoarthritis

17
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,300
can you say is a result

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,500
by an imbalance between build -up processes

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,333
And disrupting processes in the trail.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09.667
It is not as many people think a pure wear so that one mechanically wears

21
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:14,867
away the cartilage without it depends on a biochemical change that makes

22
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,233
that the trail is redone and

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,167
The tissue is affected.

24
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:24,600
And why does this trail come in imbalance?

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,633
There are a number of different causes and then you usually talk about risk factors

26
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,967
And one of the most common risk factors

27
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,967
is overweight

28
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:40,500
And it is partly because the load itself can exceed

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,900
what the tissues can handle if one carries a large body mass,

30
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:47.233
but also that adipose tissue is metabolic active and may

31
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,833
affect pain processes in the body, among other things.

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,033
Another common risk factor you talk about, then it is age.

33
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:58,333
As a rule, osteoarthritis does not affect young children.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,533
But you can see it in young people after a sports injury for example.

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08.433
But as a rule, it is after the middle age that the illness increases.

36
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:12,300
And age can partly stand for processes related to aging itself,

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,400
that genes are expressed so that the tissue becomes weaker

38
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:18,634
The more we age, but also age stands for time.

39
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:19,867
Time you have gone

40
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:24,767
Around and been overweight or time that has passed since you injured their joint.

41
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:27,100
And damage is too

42
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,934
A very strong risk factors especially for the knee joint.

43
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:34,667
When fighting can harm structures such as meniscus or cruciate ligament and that is then

44
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,934
associated with a greatly increased risk.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,867
Another risk factor that I would like to mention that is then

46
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:45,500
Genes we carry with us from our parents.

47
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,534
They not so much we can do anything about,

48
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:53,334
But they are also important as it is too many of these diseases.

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,034
The genes control a little different depending on the type of joint that is affected.

50
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:02.067
One could say that hand arthrosis is quite strongly genetically conditioned

51
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:06,600
And likewise hip arthritis.

52
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,434
While knee joint arthritis there are more environmental factors, ie injuries and such as

53
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:15,167
as explaining its emergence.

54
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:18,234
A fifth factor to mention it is also gender.

55
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:19,434
It is so that

56
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:23,467
Osteoarthritis is more common in women and it is especially after transitional age.

57
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:26,334
And why it is so is not entirely clear,

58
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:30,134
But I think it has to do with hormonal adjustments.

59
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:36,467
But it is probably not quite that simple anyway, because you haven't had any special

60
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:39,234
promising results or seen any clear finds here

61
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:43,367
by replacing estrogen and that it would lead to less osteoarthritis.

62
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:46,167
So there is also more research to be done to understand

63
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:50,901
Why women are hit just after the transition age.

64
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:54.001
Another thing that I think is important to mention it concerns osteoarthritis then also

65
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57.067
is that often you have

66
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,201
not only osteoarthritis but it is common to be affected as well

67
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:02,234
of other diseases.

68
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:05.767
And I know that Andrea is particularly interested in co -morbidity in osteoarthritis

69
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07.901
And you might be able to tell you a few words about it.

70
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09.001
Yes absolutely

71
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:15.501
What we see is that around 70 \ h% of people who have osteoarthritis also have other diseases.

72
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:18,701
So it is very common.

73
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:22,834
The problem of course lies in

74
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,534
risk factors so these diseases

75
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:28,768
are common risk factors. But also when you get osteoarthritis

76
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,834
So you become less active because you have pain in joints. And when one is less active,

77
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:36,968
So there is a higher risk that you may become overweight and also get other diseases.

78
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:40,634
For example, diabetes or heart disease.

79
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:44,934
What we see is that people who have more than just osteoarthritis,

80
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:48,401
They report more pain. So they have a worse

81
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51.601
Lead disease and this can also affect.

82
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:55,134
You become even less active and it becomes more difficult to move.

83
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,201
So you could say it's a

84
00:04:58,268 --> 00:05:01.168
Bad spiral so it's hard to break.

85
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02.168
It is an evil spiral, that is.

86
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,434
So it's not that diabetes triggers

87
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:06,734
Osteoarthritis without it is a kind of a package of welfare diseases.

88
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:07.401
Or you should say.

89
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:11,434
There is certainly some evidence that there is also relationship directly

90
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:15,668
between diabetes and osteoarthritis.

91
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:19,701
The relationships are complex. On the one hand, you can say that you have osteoarthritis, becomes sedentary and

92
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,134
collects more overweight so

93
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:24,901
Increases the risk of type two diabetes, so we talk about age diabetes.

94
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:28,168
But there is also some evidence that there are other relationships as well,

95
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:31,168
There also increases the risk.

96
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:35,035
It can go in both directions there.

97
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,435
And it is research that is going on.

98
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:40,801
To try to clarify a little more about the mechanisms.

99
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42.268
But I just want to underline

100
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:46,335
what Andrea says it is important to

101
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,135
Just that one does not end up in it

102
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:52.068
Here downward spiral then. That you become sedentary,

103
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:57.368
One can get overweight and which increases the risk of

104
00:05:57,368 --> 00:06:00.368
Cardiovascular disease and type two diabetes and more.

105
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:03.001
So it is

106
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:05.401
the basic step in treating disease.

107
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:09.535
To try to review their lifestyle and become a little more mobile.

108
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10.568
Yes, then we will come to the next question.

109
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:15,268
Just mobility. Those who go and get osteoarthritis

110
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:19,235
Often get pecific movements and exercises to do.

111
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:24,135
How to think about increasing one's mobility and activity?

112
00:06:25,035 --> 00:06:28,635
The most important thing to understand is that even if one is in pain, it is not

113
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,268
Bad to move.

114
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:34,201
You do not need to rest when you have pain in the joints.

115
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:37,635
It is very common for you to think that one can

116
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,702
Tighten on and damage the joints because you are in pain.

117
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42.068
It is interesting indeed,

118
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,168
We see that it is much worse for the trail

119
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:48,168
to just rest.

120
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:52.535
It is important to stay active and

121
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:55.602
You can think a little what happens when you do not exercise a muscle.

122
00:06:55,602 --> 00:07:00.068
A muscle becomes weaker and the same happens in the joint. If one does not use the trail,

123
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:01.602
So it becomes weaker.

124
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:05.935
So it is very important to meet a physiotherapist who can

125
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:10.568
give some suggestions on how to become more active even if it

126
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:13,502
hurts the trail.

127
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15.535
What one can say is that even if one has

128
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,535
evil when doing an exercise or a workout,

129
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:19,502
That which is important

130
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:24,035
is that the pain goes back to the same level

131
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:27,202
After 24 hours, so you can think of.

132
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:28,602
So they can think of, a little bit evil.

133
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:31,535
Exactly, and it goes back.

134
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:36,702
The problem is when one is in a lot of pain

135
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:40,402
and cannot exercise or move in several days,

136
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:43,468
You understand that it is not so easy when you are in pain.

137
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:47,935
But if the pain goes back for 24 hours then one can the day after

138
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,202
go shopping or walking or exercising.

139
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:55,235
And many have asked if there is a specific workout.

140
00:07:55,235 --> 00:08:00.602
We don't know that. The research cannot point to a

141
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:03.669
Exercise that is best for osteoarthritis.

142
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07.602
The most important thing is to do something that is lasting and fun.

143
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:10,702
So you don't sit at home all the time even if you are in pain.

144
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:15,135
Without maybe go out, meet other people so it gets

145
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:20,002
A more healthy lifestyle, not just be sitting all day.

146
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:23,869
It is a relatively simple message, you can say anyway.

147
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26.302
Whatever you get started.

148
00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:28,869
It is more important than doing specific exercises.

149
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:30,269
Yes absolutely.

150
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:30,969
It is interesting too

151
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,469
our ancestors, they moved very much

152
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:37.302
For thousands of years ahead, we were hunters and collectors.

153
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:39,902
And these are the genes we inherited so that the body is

154
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:43,069
After all, built to move and stay started.

155
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:46,935
And there are also theories that it is our changed lifestyle that

156
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:53,102
has been done for the last 40-50 years with more sedentary and diet that contributes

157
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:57,636
Also to why osteoarthritis increases as much in scope as it does.

158
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:00.402
But if we look further back in time so

159
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:04,536
If you moved so much and had a completely different diet than we have today.

160
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:07.502
Sure, one has seen that also prehistoric people

161
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:10,836
got osteoarthritis actually, so that this is this that one of

162
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:13,869
Our oldest known diseases.

163
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:18,569
You have even seen it on finds from dinosaurs.

164
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:22,636
On skeletal parts, on finds that indicate that it is like at osteoarthritis.

165
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:27,502
One has also seen on prehistoric people who lived 40 \ h000 years ago

166
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:32,336
in caves in France that there were osteoarthritis on

167
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:37,769
In that case on the spine of an individual. So it's an old disease.

168
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:42,836
But we also know that incidence is increasing sharply in modern communities,

169
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:47,236
And it is probably very lifestyle -related and that we become sedentary,

170
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:51,002
Our body mass is increasing and we don't get that exercise

171
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:54,802
We need and then the tissue does not get the quality.

172
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:58.669
And once we then move on, it is too weak to cope

173
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:03,203
body mass or what we do, so it is important to find a healthy

174
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06.036
And right, such a Swedish word,

175
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:11,003
Lifestyle where you move daily in a natural way.

176
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:14,036
And you can definitely get help with that if you meet someone.

177
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15.303
Such as a physiotherapist

178
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:17,269
Who can help a little and get over this.

179
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:21,403
For one is very scared when it hurts,

180
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:24,069
And we understand that it is hard.

181
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:27.569
But, as I said, you can guide on what is reasonable.

182
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,769
Can you cure osteoarthritis?

183
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,703
There is no cure in the biological sense.

184
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:38,603
When dealing with the final stage in osteoarthritis, when you have tried all other possibilities,

185
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,203
This is when you insert a prosthesis.

186
00:10:40,203 --> 00:10:43,669
But there is no cure in the biological sense.

187
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:46,403
But there is needed

188
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:51,769
more research and there is a number of different in the world

189
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:53,869
actors to find

190
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:57.703
Especially drugs that can affect the disease process itself.

191
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,669
For the treatment we have today available,

192
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:04.303
it is really basically symptom relief

193
00:11:04,803 --> 00:11:08,670
And you would like to find something that can slow down this one

194
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,536
the process or get the trail in balance.

195
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,036
I talked before about constructing forces and degrading processes.

196
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:16,903
To get them in balance again and to

197
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:20,203
prolonged this process or even stop it.

198
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:23,870
Or at best to reverse, that's the ultimate.

199
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:26,903
And one already has today

200
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:30,536
In research contexts there are a number of candidates that are examined

201
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,770
in different clinical studies, but it is a long way to go and that is also

202
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,270
Many challenges to make these work.

203
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:42,236
Because very high demands are placed on drugs precisely.

204
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:45.570
This should partly lead to structural changes in a positive direction.

205
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50.003
But the structural changes should also have an impact on the symptoms themselves.

206
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,170
For classic speaking, the connection between what it looks like is

207
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:56,503
In the trail and how much symptoms you have, quite bad.

208
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00.703
It is also one thing that may be good for you at home to take

209
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:03,070
that it doesn't matter that much how an X -ray

210
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06.203
Looks, the important thing is how you feel.

211
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:10,003
I myself have seen that there are those who have an X -ray image that sees

212
00:12:10,236 --> 00:12:13,437
âToo fuckingâ, but they have almost no problems or very little trouble.

213
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:17,703
And there are those who have very small changes but have a lot of pain.

214
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,470
What is it?

215
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,937
Pain is complex.

216
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:26,737
Pain is not just due to structural changes

217
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:30,070
Without it, it is a very psychosocial process as well.

218
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:33,137
A pain that is important and that is why

219
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:35.803
In the case of symptom -relieving treatments, it is

220
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:39,837
Like not a treatment that works on everyone but one can try out

221
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:43,603
And find something that works for this particular person.

222
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,003
And it can be different ways what the treatment looks like.

223
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:50,370
But the first step that is important, this is exactly what Andrea is talking about.

224
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,637
Getting information about the disease and you can get this in an osteoarthritis school.

225
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,437
Get to know what it is and meet others who have

226
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:58,070
and exchange experiences.

227
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01.337
But also to look over their lifestyle and try to get started and be a little more

228
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:07.403
moving and give the joints the exercise they want to feel good.

229
00:13:07.503 --> 00:13:09.703
And these curative drugs not today,

230
00:13:09.703 --> 00:13:12.603
You have before that in 10-15 years, maybe the first will come?

231
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:17,037
Yes, I think so, because there are already promising candidates today.

232
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:21,370
But it is important to point out that these drugs are quite specific

233
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,204
Which may work for a particular type of osteoarthritis or for a particular joint.

234
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:25,870
So there is no one

235
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29.604
Miracle cure that helps for everything. Without one can say that osteoarthritis

236
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:33,837
It's almost like a collective name for when the trail fails, which it can do

237
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,870
For many, many different reasons. Such as

238
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,504
A joint may fail for having a previous joint injury

239
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:45,370
Where you may have lost meniscus tissue and there then overloaded.

240
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,270
But biomechanics play a big role.

241
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,637
But there is also other osteoarthritis that are more hereditary.

242
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:53,737
It comes in several joints and in fingers and hips and there may be others

243
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:56,570
Mechanisms that are important.

244
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,104
So probably you will see in the future,

245
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,770
a number of different drugs with the target

246
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,004
to change these different processes in different ways.

247
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07.804
You have osteoarthritis X, you have osteoarthritis Y.

248
00:14:07.804 --> 00:14:13,604
Yes, you talk a lot about different subtypes of osteoarthritis in research right now.

249
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:18,604
Ways to divide, but it's not easy either.

250
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,237
But it is an ongoing process to learn more about the different

251
00:14:21,237 --> 00:14:24,370
The types of osteoarthritis. And then not just different types of osteoarthritis,

252
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,504
Why it sits in different joints.

253
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:29.904
Without even within the same stage there may be different kinds of osteoarthritis.

254
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:31,504
So today, what you do is relieve?

255
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:36,837
It's exercise and so maybe cortisone?

256
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:40,437
Yes, the basic treatment is then

257
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:43,537
osteoarthritis school by reviewing one's lifestyle

258
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:47,104
look over one's weight can be reduced weight if you are overweight or can

259
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:51,004
At least make sure you don't increase anymore, this is a good condition.

260
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:52.971
And it helps many.

261
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,837
But we should be honest with that many have a lot

262
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:56,871
trouble even after being in osteoarthritis school.

263
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,237
Osteoarthritis school is an arrangement, a training program.

264
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01.871
Yes exactly.

265
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:05.337
There are many who of course have trouble after that too, and then you can

266
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:09.037
Talk about additional treatment and there are a number of different ones.

267
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:10,637
I should not say cortisone in the first place,

268
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:14.304
It is a rather controversial treatment,

269
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:17,704
But I know it is common.

270
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:21,071
But it is very directed just at the inflammation,

271
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:22,437
And some kind of osteoarthritis

272
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:26,404
can cause severe inflammation. But otherwise not

273
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:31,171
Inflammation The main cause of pain.

274
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:32,771
And partly so gives cortisone syringe

275
00:15:32,771 --> 00:15:36,971
a fairly short -term effect, and there are also reports that

276
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:40,738
It may have undesirable consequences for the joint

277
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:44,704
If you give it on repeated occasions. So that one might save it

278
00:15:44,704 --> 00:15:46,638
the treatment to when you are in the latter stage.

279
00:15:46,638 --> 00:15:47,804
As one begins to approach and

280
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:50,971
maybe a candidate for being prosthesized and one has not so

281
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:54,238
much more to take and you see that it is a powerful inflammation

282
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:58,338
involved, then I think you can try cortisone and evaluate how it works.

283
00:15:58,404 --> 00:15:59.971
But otherwise there are, there is,

284
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:03.938
The most common thing you use otherwise these are the NSAIDs.

285
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:07.238
Anti -inflammatory medication

286
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:11,171
But again, it is directed at inflammation and

287
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,471
There is often a certain low -grade inflammation of the osteoarthritis.

288
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:17,638
It may help, but that is also what one as a patient in consultation

289
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:20,638
With his doctor comes up, to try out and evaluate.

290
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:22,804
Does that help me? Try putting it out.

291
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:26,604
Will the pain come back? And so on.

292
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:27,371
One should also be honest

293
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:30,871
and say that the symptom -relieving treatments we have,

294
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:33,171
the greatest effect of them

295
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:36,004
This is what you really call the sugar pill effect.

296
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:39,204
Placebo explains the biggest improvement no matter what treatment we give

297
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:42,638
Partly that and partly the natural course.

298
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:43,305
Because most often it is like that

299
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:47,738
That you start taking treatment when you are in a bad phase of the disease.

300
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:51,405
Artrus pain often fluctuate over time and people tend

301
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:54,871
To seek care when you are a bad phase and that is when you get treatment.

302
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:59.938
So no matter what you have given pre -treatment, it is often a little improved.

303
00:17:00,038 --> 00:17:02.505
So that there are actually very nice research data on it,

304
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:06,171
one has seen over many of those

305
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:09.405
symptom -relieving treatments, one has done

306
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:14,271
proper clinical trials. And it has been seen that approximately on average 75 \ h%

307
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:18,138
of the improvement that occurs after the treatments is explained by

308
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:23,171
Placebo and natural fluctuations. So only 25 \ h% is attributed to an actual

309
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:26,938
Effective effect and the treatment itself as it was directed.

310
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,038
And this applies to all these treatments in principle.

311
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:32,505
It also speaks about what need we have today

312
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:35,438
To find better, more effective treatments.

313
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:40,171
Because we want to find treatments that are more effective than a sugar pill.

314
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:43,905
Do not underestimate the effect of the sugar pill,

315
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:46,005
But you want to find something better.

316
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:48,838
Is it related this psychological about pain that you were in?

317
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:50,072
Yes, that's a big effect.

318
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:54,438
Pain sits inside the brain too,

319
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:57,472
so many of the treatments that work

320
00:17:57,472 --> 00:18:03,172
Is a lot of a body and mind type of exercise.

321
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:06,738
One can mention yoga, tns, acupuncture - to believe that it works

322
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:09,572
And the context around it makes you feel better and that is an important part.

323
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:13,505
And it's totally okay, but what to think about maybe as a patient

324
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,372
is what is the cost to me?

325
00:18:15,372 --> 00:18:19,672
Is it reasonable? Is it associated with some risks and so on.

326
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:20,538
Then you can say

327
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:23,472
That of these is, after all, training is probably one of the best, for it

328
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:26,705
Has so many other positive effects on heart and lungs.

329
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,572
Therefore the basic step in treatment is

330
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:32,738
to become more physically active.

331
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,472
And it can also help in other diseases.

332
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:36,638
Yes exactly.

333
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:40,572
And I can say that we have already answered some of the questions that have come in,

334
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:45,638
But we go ahead and graze on questions more clearly.

335
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:50,872
And a little fireplace then is that you do not have the opportunity

336
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:54,205
to answer from the context that a doctor can do,

337
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:55.805
Because it is so individual -based.

338
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:58.805
But on the other hand, you can give a general reasoning.

339
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,639
You mentioned the previous diet and there it is after all

340
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,872
As I said generally good held diet I guess,

341
00:19:04,872 --> 00:19:08.905
Or is there something special to think about connected to osteoarthritis,

342
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:12,072
What is the cost of diet?

343
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13.305
Yes, none of us is really

344
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:17,172
Knowledgeable in diet, it is not our research areas.

345
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:20,439
But I can say that it is clear that the diet is affecting

346
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:24,072
The risk of osteoarthritis is generally speaking.

347
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:26,572
If you eat classically unhealthy diet,

348
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:29,105
with a lot of sugar, carbohydrates and fat

349
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:29,939
So you get a lot of calories,

350
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:33,605
Then body weight increases and then the risk of osteoarthritis increases.

351
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,972
But I am not aware that there is someone special

352
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:39,605
type of diet that would

353
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:43,539
Reduce the risk, in addition to general dietary advice.

354
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:48,005
Eat healthy diet because your well -being in itself is important.

355
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,505
Do you have anything else to add?

356
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:54,505
No, the best thing is not to eat too much

357
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:58,572
And try to eat good food, not too sweet.

358
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00.506
So one should think as usual,

359
00:20:00,506 --> 00:20:03.306
As you do not always do, but you should always try.

360
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:06.872
One can well also take the look back to our ancestors

361
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:12,472
They ate a much healthier diet than we do today.

362
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:13.306
Today we eat

363
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:16,306
very very fast sugars

364
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,439
and it

365
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:23,072
affects the risk not least for type two diabetes.

366
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,672
So we were healthier in the past simply.

367
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:26,806
We go.

368
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:29.306
But we can go up!

369
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:32,172
There are connections to stress and low -grade inflammation,

370
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,872
As a cause of osteoarthritis?

371
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:40,272
Yes, absolutely that is a cause for many diseases.

372
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:47,372
And we see that osteoarthritis is linked to multi -illness.

373
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:51,672
Stress and low -grade inflammation are common risk factors.

374
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:54,472
So there is another risk factor in some sense?

375
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:59,172
Absolutely, and it is linked to diet as well. What one eats can affect,

376
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:03.906
How to move as well as the weight. Everything affects very clearly

377
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:08.239
the inflammation found in the body.

378
00:21:08.306 --> 00:21:10,773
I agree that the particular pain experience

379
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:17,073
can be greatly affected by mental stress.

380
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:19,506
But I don't think there's a lot of evidence

381
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:24,706
which indicates that mental stress accelerates the process and degradation in itself,

382
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:27,106
But on the other hand, the experience and the pain.

383
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:29,073
is clearly dependent on

384
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:32,273
Our well -being and if you have a life in balance.

385
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:34,906
Good to find out.

386
00:21:34,906 --> 00:21:38,773
This is also why training can help because we know that training affects our mood.

387
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,239
So even if it's the same pain,

388
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:45,339
So you experience it in a better way and it is also very important.

389
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:48,373
Exercise often makes that

390
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:53,173
allows one to form body -by -endorphins

391
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:56,806
Especially at high cardiovascular workouts

392
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:58,873
Where you get a high pulse and such.

393
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:00.839
Many may recognize themselves in that

394
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,539
You feel quite satisfied afterwards.

395
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,473
It may be hard but afterwards you feel the endorphins

396
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:10,573
Who kicked off and gives this prosperous feeling.

397
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:12,139
Walking is good, but you have the opportunity to do

398
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:13,506
Pulse -raising stuff is even better.

399
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:16,340
Yes, but you have to do what you can do.

400
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,906
Because there are those who have very much pain and cannot

401
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,273
get outside the door almost.

402
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,506
Here one who wonders: has osteoarthritis in the hip since

403
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:27,506
A few years and feel that there are better and worse periods.

404
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:32,040
What is happening in the body when it suddenly gets worse again?

405
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,606
It is a great and difficult question.

406
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,340
It often goes in forests,

407
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,040
The pain and

408
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,673
There are certainly things

409
00:22:42,673 --> 00:22:46,473
Who triggers this but there the knowledge is lacking today.

410
00:22:46,473 --> 00:22:50,373
But one can say that one thing that can trigger

411
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:55.806
Is an overload simply.

412
00:22:55,873 --> 00:23:00.606
You may have a joint that has not really managed what you have entered into.

413
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,740
One may have run a marathon on asphalt, because

414
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,373
Take something extreme, and then it can trigger.

415
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:10,440
But otherwise, depending on the trail, there are also many patients

416
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,873
as reports that it has to do with climate, that it hot

417
00:23:12,873 --> 00:23:17,306
or cold and so that it can also affect

418
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:18,673
the pain or process.

419
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:22,973
That you become more swollen in your joints in some type of weather.

420
00:23:23,073 --> 00:23:26,273
But this is a pretty unexplored field, but also quite difficult

421
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:29,273
to study such forests, because it requires one to have

422
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:31,907
Many patients who report their forests.

423
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:33,907
What exactly did then?

424
00:23:33,907 --> 00:23:38,340
But it is a very interesting field to actually look at.

425
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,473
The recommendation one can give

426
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:43,507
It is well that you are observant yourself as a patient.

427
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:47,873
Can one see any relationships yourself, and try to adapt

428
00:23:47,873 --> 00:23:51,773
Or avoid the torque or what you have done now.

429
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:54,873
Maybe it's good to think that when it gets a little worse,

430
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:56,740
So it will not continue with time.

431
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,573
It can get better because the pain goes a little up and down.

432
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:06.007
So there is something to think about when experiencing

433
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:09.440
that it might have been a little worse last week

434
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,640
But that does not mean it will be even worse.

435
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:18,440
But as I said it goes in the forest that

436
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21.807
Is part of the usual process, so nothing unusual.

437
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:22,940
There are also those who have

438
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:29,140
More chronic pain, which sits evenly. Especially at a later stage of the disease.

439
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:31,374
But does it go in the forest but still down?

440
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,340
Are there some who have a forest and so can it be better?

441
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,340
Yes, that one has osteoarthritis does not need to

442
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,974
mean that it will only be worse and worse.

443
00:24:38,974 --> 00:24:43,074
There are many patients who have lighter symptoms and it has the life out,

444
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:45,974
And you can do it. It doesn't happen that much and it doesn't happen that way

445
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:48,574
Very structurally without it going quite stable.

446
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:53,040
Then there are the patients where it goes fairly quickly that the joint is broken down

447
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,540
You get more and more symptoms and it ends with dentures.

448
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,974
And there are certainly also the ones that improve a little.

449
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,374
For example, if you have succeeded in losing weight,

450
00:25:04,374 --> 00:25:06,374
It is perhaps one of the most important things

451
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:10.607
As you have seen, it can actually affect the course of the disease.

452
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:11,640
If you have

453
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,740
severe overweight and can reduce weight so can

454
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:21,640
Provide favorable results even on structural changes.

455
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:25,140
Some questions about connections here.

456
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,640
Virus, viral infection and someone asks about Crohns.

457
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,907
Gastric disease Crohns.

458
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:39,174
Yes, there are two separate questions there.

459
00:25:39,274 --> 00:25:44,941
Me, of course, there is no known virus that triggers osteoarthritis

460
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:49,241
However, there are a number of other related diseases

461
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:52,274
which may be associated with infections in the body.

462
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:56,574
A classic example is that one has a bacterial infection like salmonella

463
00:25:56,574 --> 00:26:00.541
or campylobacter, unless you have cooked the chicken properly then it can trigger

464
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:04,274
Start a joint reaction where you get severe swelling and pain.

465
00:26:04,274 --> 00:26:05,474
But it's not osteoarthritis without it

466
00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:09.241
is another more inflammatory acute rheumatic disease.

467
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:13,274
So there are connections between infections and joint pain.

468
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:17,174
But as far as we know today there are no viruses as you know

469
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:20,374
is associated with osteoarthritis.

470
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:21,241
And when it comes to

471
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:25,374
Crohn's disease, which is an inflammatory bowel disease,

472
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:29,574
There is a very strong connection with joint pain.

473
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:31,541
But it is

474
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,741
not osteoarthritis but it is another

475
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:36,741
Type of inflammatory joint pain.

476
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:39,741
However, it may be that you have osteoarthritis even if you have Crohns,

477
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:43,074
For osteoarthritis is so common.

478
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:46,208
But if you have crohns and you get joint pain

479
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,208
And the first thing you and the doctor should think about, it's probably this one

480
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:52,574
second type of disease that often comes with

481
00:26:52,774 --> 00:26:54.608
This inflammatory bowel disease.

482
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:57.608
And it is an autoimmune reaction that

483
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01.841
trigger the immune system and then it becomes an inflammation of the joint.

484
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:04.841
There are many different types of joint pain.

485
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:06,774
Yes exactly.

486
00:27:08,241 --> 00:27:10,374
Osteoarthritis is the clearly dominant, but then has

487
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:13,741
We a group of diseases that involve very severe inflammation.

488
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:18,174
Type example is what is called Arts Rheumatism or

489
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:21,574
Rheumatoid arthritis in medical language.

490
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:29,108
There are a number of other diseases that are

491
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:33,641
closely related to that group.

492
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:36,274
I saw a question about what is arthritis and what is osteoarthritis?

493
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:41,108
And there are many different ones that are similar and some overgrip each other.

494
00:27:41,174 --> 00:27:44,274
But arthritis is more a general word

495
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:48,608
for inflammation in a joint

496
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:51.941
And osteoarthritis is more of a specific disease in this case.

497
00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:54,375
Then there is a great conceptual confusion as well

498
00:27:54,375 --> 00:28:00,475
Internationally, for osteoarthritis in English is called osteoarthritis.

499
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,975
In some countries, osteoarthrosis says.

500
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,141
It is a certain conceptual confusion.

501
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:09.408
But there are many different diseases

502
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:12.608
which goes by the term arthritis.

503
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:16,341
There is someone wondering, there are alternatives to surgery,

504
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:20,008
Which one does if it has gone quite a long way, except

505
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:24,475
Palliative physiotherapy?

506
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:28,708
As we have said so we talk about

507
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:32,108
the treatment as a pyramid, one starts with exercise

508
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,708
And if it doesn't work,

509
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:39,408
can you add any type of drug, and at the end comes

510
00:28:39,408 --> 00:28:45,375
the operation, you have tried all the treatments and there is no

511
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:48,208
other alternative then you have to talk to the doctor

512
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:51,675
and decide if it is possible to get

513
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:54,275
A prosthesis for example.

514
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:58,975
It is these supplementary treatments, and there are a variety of strategies.

515
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:01,242
It also depends on which joint is affected and so on.

516
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:05.608
But orthoses, ie rails if one has

517
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:09.608
pain in a finger, there may also be some for knees

518
00:29:09,608 --> 00:29:10,675
and so on

519
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:14,142
that can be aids that can make the troubles become smaller and which can

520
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:18,108
help one in everyday life. Largely.

521
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,375
But that's what Andrea says,

522
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:22,708
The important thing is to give

523
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:26,842
To be physically active a chance, to get started a little.

524
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:30,642
For it may, if nothing else, delay and the symptoms

525
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:32,642
becomes smaller.

526
00:29:32,642 --> 00:29:35,408
And maybe the prosthesis will come later in life.

527
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:38,642
You also do not want to put in a prosthesis too early.

528
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:41,542
For there are also many young people who have osteoarthritis early

529
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:45,208
in life. There are 30-year-olds and

530
00:29:45,308 --> 00:29:48,808
Then you want to try to delay

531
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:50,642
the operation litigran, because

532
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:53,342
a denture does not last forever, although it is very long

533
00:29:53,342 --> 00:29:56,875
survival for the prosthesis and it maintains good quality, so it always

534
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:59,375
More trouble to replace a prosthesis.

535
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:02.009
We live for a very long time today.

536
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,275
So that's why you sometimes want to wait for surgery?

537
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:07.209
Sometimes you may want to wait.

538
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:12.909
The position is an important process that depends on

539
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:16,742
How much symptoms you have and what disability you have.

540
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:21,075
So you get a weighted image.

541
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:23,642
There are no absolute dimensions.

542
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:27,375
It is a discussion between treating physician

543
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:30,742
or the orthopedic and patient.

544
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:31,842
And it is important to say also

545
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:35,909
That the pain does not disappear completely for everyone who receives prosthesis.

546
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:39,842
Some are still in pain afterwards

547
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:43,809
Therefore, it is important to try other treatments. To be sure

548
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:48,009
on that they do not work and then

549
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:51,842
If you get a prosthesis, even if you can have a little pain after.

550
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:54,909
But then you know that you have tried everything.

551
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:57,675
And it is also not risk -free with prosthesis.

552
00:30:57,675 --> 00:31:02,975
It is around 20 \ h% that still have symptoms after surgery.

553
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:06,575
It is a relatively large operation

554
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:10,842
All operations are associated with risks.

555
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:12,776
You then look at co -morbidity,

556
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:16,742
Do you then have severe obesity, you have diabetes type two and you have heart problems

557
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:21,609
Then the desire to put in a prosthesis becomes a little less with us doctors.

558
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:23,276
Because one knows that

559
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:25,242
Then the risk increases significantly for problems

560
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:29.309
And complications and infections and that there will be bad results.

561
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:32,442
So that's why it is important regardless

562
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:36,476
that one looks over over one's lifestyle

563
00:31:36,476 --> 00:31:40,842
and their body mass, trying to train the muscles and be prepared

564
00:31:40,842 --> 00:31:44,742
as possible for an operation. One gets better results

565
00:31:44,742 --> 00:31:47,409
If you have a strengthened up

566
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:50,476
Your muscles a little even before surgery.

567
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:54,142
Someone wonders here about alternatives to surgery,

568
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:58.609
For example, cultivate cartilage and you do this in some sense.

569
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:04,476
Yes there are stem cells after all

570
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:08,676
Almost a fashion word for many years in many diseases,

571
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:13,076
There is research going on with stem cells

572
00:32:13,142 --> 00:32:14,609
In principle, inject them into the trail.

573
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:16,576
To grow the cartilage.

574
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:20,676
Unfortunately, the studies have so far not been of particularly good quality

575
00:32:20,676 --> 00:32:23,676
and did not produce any convincing results that it has

576
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:27,143
Effect beyond what you call the sugar pill effect.

577
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:30,409
For it is a very strong placebo effect that

578
00:32:30,476 --> 00:32:31,843
costs a lot of money.

579
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:33,543
If you get high expectations and then you feel

580
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:34,943
Certainly a little better after getting it.

581
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:39.043
But in science there are no enough today

582
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:43,909
Evidence that it has any effect beyond placebo.

583
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:44,876
Is it placebo

584
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:48,576
Or is it that you do not know if there is anything else?

585
00:32:48,643 --> 00:32:51,576
It has not been made any

586
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:54,276
Well -controlled placebost studies.

587
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:57,409
It is going on now in Australia I know, so results will

588
00:32:57,409 --> 00:33:00.609
Once within a couple of years, which we look forward to.

589
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:04,076
It is done under real controlled forms where one

590
00:33:04,176 --> 00:33:07.109
according to all the rules of art.

591
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:09.009
With the Lotten's help you decide who to get placebo

592
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,776
and who is to receive active treatment

593
00:33:11,776 --> 00:33:13,843
and so on.

594
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:16,009
So one has seen

595
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:19,743
In some other less high -quality studies that it might give

596
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:24,043
Some results on cartilage growth or some form of tissue are formed.

597
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:29.043
But results on that it should be better than one

598
00:33:29,143 --> 00:33:30,243
did any other treatment,

599
00:33:30,243 --> 00:33:32.043
It's not today.

600
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:36,243
There is much left to prove from that type of treatment.

601
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:39,443
But one cannot fully write it but we are still waiting for better

602
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:41,876
studies in order to see

603
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,243
What it entails.

604
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:47,176
But then it is also a treatment method that is directed

605
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:51,176
more to a specific type of osteoarthritis where one might have a

606
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:55,010
Local cartilage defect that you want to repair and so on.

607
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:59,476
The hard thing is to use it in a joint that is very long time

608
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:02,310
And totally lacks cartilage.

609
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,343
Focus today is mainly on a younger patient who may have had a

610
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:09,376
joint injury where you have damaged the cartilage, where it has died on a

611
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:12,076
Some surface and so you want it to grow back.

612
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:15,410
There was someone who wrote that I got my shoulders

613
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:18,010
And it works perfectly.

614
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,143
It is great with a patient who thinks it works perfectly.

615
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:26,710
But that said, I am not convinced that it has that effect depends on

616
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:30,877
a therapeutic effect of the stem cells themselves, but it may be that it is

617
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:35,177
Just being taken care of, get a syringe and paid money for it.

618
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:40,043
This makes you expect to feel better.

619
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:44,410
But as I said today in science, there is no evidence and

620
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:45,677
This is why it is not one

621
00:34:45,677 --> 00:34:48,543
recommended treatment from the National Board of Health and Welfare for missing

622
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:52,010
Simply is evidence that it is effective.

623
00:34:52,077 --> 00:34:55,777
The same goes for other type of experimental treatment

624
00:34:55,843 --> 00:35:00.577
with platelets or PRPs that are often marketed very hard.

625
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:05,110
There you have not been able to show any effect beyond the sugar pill effect

626
00:35:05,143 --> 00:35:06,410
In the studies that one has reported,

627
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09.510
Without there, placebo has provided similar improvement.

628
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,543
Is it also one to say fashion treatment?

629
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,943
You can say. It is an expensive treatment that is located

630
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:16,877
A little in fashion.

631
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:18,610
Do you have to pay private then?

632
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,743
You have to pay that privately.

633
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:24,977
This is a huge market for people to make money from.

634
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:27,210
This is a very grateful market.

635
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:33,110
It is not only these experimental treatments, it applies to all forms of

636
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:35,110
supplements and nutritional supplements that exist.

637
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,410
There are more or less serious players

638
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,210
Because it is a grateful group to make money from.

639
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,844
People who are in pain are desperate and want to find a treatment.

640
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:44,077
Yes, for supplements there have also been questions.

641
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:50,010
Is there anything to say about it?

642
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:53,144
You can not

643
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:56,977
Completely written off that there is a health food that can help with the pain.

644
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:58,477
Absolutely not.

645
00:35:58,477 --> 00:36:02,577
But again, there is no evidence,

646
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:06,944
Good studies that show that they have a better effect than placebo.

647
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:11,877
But at the same time, if you can get a placebo effect and it is safe,

648
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:14,944
And it doesn't cost that much, that's good.

649
00:36:14,944 --> 00:36:16,877
Yes now you have said it so now it disappeared!

650
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:20,310
And i can't either

651
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,310
exclude that there are certain types of nutritional supplements or

652
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:27,010
Health food preparation

653
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:32,244
Which, for example, has anti -inflammatory properties.

654
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:35,344
Turmeric to take an example,

655
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,877
has been shown to have some anti -inflammatory properties.

656
00:36:39,877 --> 00:36:45,577
So it is possible that if you have inflammation it can help.

657
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:48,111
I cannot rule out that it acts a lot

658
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:51,844
about as a person to consider what I am prepared to pay

659
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:55,444
And I think it works. But to be critical too, do you feel better?

660
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:59,244
One can try to put it out, put in again and then make a balancing if you

661
00:36:59,244 --> 00:37:04,877
I think I feel better about this and the cost picture is okay.

662
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:05.577
So, take it!

663
00:37:05,577 --> 00:37:08,577
You have to observe yourself, and test yourself.

664
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:12.011
Yes. And as I said, there is not a pill that helps for all kinds

665
00:37:12,044 --> 00:37:15,911
Except that you have to try out a little what you think.

666
00:37:15,977 --> 00:37:19,411
Do you want to add something there when it comes to health food?

667
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:22,211
No what you say is right.

668
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:25,777
The same goes for exercises and training.

669
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:26,777
When we don't know

670
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:32,011
so you have to try some different types

671
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:36,544
And if it helps, you can continue.

672
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:38,111
If one has osteoarthritis is then

673
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:43,777
Greater risk of getting it in several joints?

674
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,344
Yes and no.

675
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,444
One can say that

676
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:50,444
Do you get osteoarthritis

677
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:53,711
in a knee joint because you have damaged it

678
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:57,844
But rehabilitation goes well and so on.

679
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:59,644
But you have developed osteoarthritis

680
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:03,344
you keep body weight normal and you are active and

681
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:06,978
So it is not necessary that the risk increases for other joints.

682
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:10,111
Then it is no.

683
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:13,111
But at the same time it can also be yes because if you get to osteoarthritis

684
00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:16,278
In a joint or hip, then you are happy to be a little more sedentary,

685
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:17,511
And then the weight and then

686
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:21,444
Maybe the risk is increasing because you will be osteoarthritis elsewhere.

687
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:25,144
Or that if you have been osteoarthritis in an joint then maybe it is an indication

688
00:38:25,144 --> 00:38:28,744
on the fact that you have some heredity in the family and then maybe it will

689
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:34,678
In others, I also lead, so that I would say both yes and no on that question.

690
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:37,211
It is common to have osteoarthritis in several joints, absolutely.

691
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:45,278
But it doesn't have to be so, it's both yes and no.

692
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:47,144
Here is another question.

693
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:50,811
Wondering what the research says about preventing osteoarthritis after

694
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:57,511
Difficult Ledtrauman, such as severe knee fracture?

695
00:38:57,611 --> 00:38:59.311
Maybe sports injuries and other things?

696
00:38:59,311 --> 00:39:00.611
Yes, what we know is that

697
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:03.811
When you get an injury, the risk increases.

698
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:07,978
The greater the damage, the greater the risk of osteoarthritis.

699
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:11,311
So what we know is, to take care of the trail

700
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:15,678
After injury can help prevent osteoarthritis.

701
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:19,878
But for example now there is a lot of research trying to understand

702
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:23,411
If it is better to do just rehabilitation or surgery.

703
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:26,778
Often when harming the meniscus or ligament

704
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:30,845
so you often get surgery to try to repair the knee

705
00:39:30,845 --> 00:39:35,245
Or the trail, but now is it a little uncertain what is best?

706
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:40,878
It seems that exercise is as effective as surgery

707
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:47,078
And there is some surgery that you should not do.

708
00:39:47,078 --> 00:39:49,978
For example, peepholes where you go into the knee,

709
00:39:49,978 --> 00:39:55,678
It can be good when you go in to cook the damage,

710
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:58,678
But if it has been many years if you got the injury

711
00:39:58,678 --> 00:40:01.845
When you were young, and you have gone without the operation for 10-15 years

712
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:03,512
Then you should avoid.

713
00:40:03,512 --> 00:40:07,378
Because there can be brokenness in progress, and then you should not operate.

714
00:40:07,612 --> 00:40:10,645
Maybe Martin can explain further?

715
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:15,545
The important thing I think is not to overload the joint

716
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:19,545
In the acute stage without letting the damage heal

717
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:23,712
well as possible and then gradually train your LED again.

718
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,178
Because when you have damaged a joint and become still, you lose muscle strength,

719
00:40:27,278 --> 00:40:30,445
one loses stability and perhaps the injury in itself has caused one to have

720
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:35,412
Lost stability. And in this case it was a fracture then

721
00:40:35,412 --> 00:40:39,612
In the cartilage surface and it needs to heal as well as possible and then you get then

722
00:40:39,612 --> 00:40:44,245
gradually increase the load.

723
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:47,178
We still know that overload is a strong risk factor.

724
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,178
For osteoarthritis.

725
00:40:48,178 --> 00:40:51,312
So biomechanics are important.

726
00:40:51,312 --> 00:40:57.045
But again as I said initially,

727
00:40:57,612 --> 00:40:58,978
that it is

728
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:03,978
not so that one mechanically wears down the trail, but it becomes a

729
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:07.212
imbalance between constructing molecular processes

730
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:10,212
and degrading molecular processes.

731
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:12,612
And there is biomechanics and the load

732
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:16,145
An important part of controlling this balance.

733
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:19,845
And there is after all

734
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,979
in occupations with very high heavy load

735
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:25,979
So it is also an increased presence of osteoarthritis.

736
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:29,445
One -sided high load, carrying heavy things

737
00:41:29,512 --> 00:41:31,145
And it is also something you can think of.

738
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:32,145
Do you have an injury so maybe

739
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:35,879
You should review, if you are still professional,

740
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:37,845
what is it for

741
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39.545
work task you have.

742
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:42,679
Talk to his immediate boss and tell us about this.

743
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:45,079
That I need to find alternative tasks for me

744
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:47.412
or resolve it in a different way in order to avoid

745
00:41:47,412 --> 00:41:52,979
Just to strain an injured joint unnecessarily incorrectly.

746
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:54.945
Then we are in on movement and training.

747
00:41:54,945 --> 00:42:00.412
And we already that the best training is the one who gets rid of.

748
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:04,512
And when it comes to running, is there anything more fellow there?

749
00:42:04,512 --> 00:42:07,512
Because there is one who says I got worse when I quit.

750
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:10,445
Yes, you have already said that it will be.

751
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,079
Is there anything about how to run for example?

752
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,779
Or any tools?

753
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:18,479
It is very specific and depends on each person.

754
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,646
My suggestion would be to meet a physiotherapist

755
00:42:22,646 --> 00:42:25,912
And get an evaluation of all the muscles and how to run.

756
00:42:25,912 --> 00:42:30,279
For example, is there a muscle that is weak because one has

757
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:33,812
had pain and as one might get a specific exercise for

758
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:37,879
that reinforces the muscles and that can help one run properly.

759
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:41,546
And it is very important how to plan your training.

760
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:46,179
Not to run a lot just a day and then get a huge pain.

761
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:52,079
But maybe make it a little more gradually, try running and see

762
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:56,312
how much you can and maybe

763
00:42:56,379 --> 00:43:00.212
Run a little more every day and build up their workout.

764
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:03,546
There are support bands, can it help?

765
00:43:03,546 --> 00:43:11,046
Yes support bands and there are different shoes that can help because we all run in different ways.

766
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:12,912
Because it stabilizes.

767
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:17,812
And also applies even if you can't run, if you are older so

768
00:43:17,812 --> 00:43:21,646
is it important to have good shoes, a pair of great jogging shoes

769
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:24,646
and not go out in anyone

770
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:27,579
bad sole or high heels.

771
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:32,313
Really have comfortable shoes that have good cushioning and stability.

772
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:37,479
It facilitates, and you can also take aids such as orthoses or support.

773
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:41,413
Here is one who got the advice to go on uneven ground

774
00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:43,613
In the forest for example. Is it good?

775
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:48,179
Yes, it can be good if you can and do not have too bad.

776
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:53,446
It is good for stability and balance because the muscles have to work a little harder

777
00:43:53,446 --> 00:43:56,979
And it's a type of exercise.

778
00:43:56,979 --> 00:44:00,279
You can start by walking in town where everything is flat and light.

779
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:01.213
And when it gets okay,

780
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:05,979
So you can try something that is a little more difficult, for example walking in the forest.

781
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:09,546
But you can say that you have very large osteoarthritis and have

782
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,113
hard to go so may not be that

783
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:14,913
the ground one should give up first without there maybe it is better to have

784
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:19,746
Flat soil so that you do not risk falling over or being damaged.

785
00:44:19,813 --> 00:44:25,246
So it depends on what phase

786
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:28,613
Also, one's illness is.

787
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:31,680
Many also ask about osteoarthritis of fingers or wrists.

788
00:44:31,746 --> 00:44:34,146
What else can you do than exercise?

789
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:37,246
A little grip exercises and such?

790
00:44:37,246 --> 00:44:40,480
Here, tools are very important.

791
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,780
There are many tools that can help a person open a can

792
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,580
in ways that load the joints less

793
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,546
so that it gets easier

794
00:44:50,546 --> 00:44:54,980
in everyday life.

795
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,313
Finger arthritis

796
00:44:58,313 --> 00:45:01.813
has been a challenge to treat.

797
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:04.613
There are not so much alternatives. One can also imagine

798
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:08,580
There is local anti -inflammatory gel as one

799
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12.013
can try lubricating with for example,

800
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,513
But in some cases it also ends with surgery.

801
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:17,046
Especially at tumbas arthritis.

802
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:23,846
Then the operation can help if you have really severe problems.

803
00:45:23,946 --> 00:45:26,946
But it is known to

804
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,713
one has tried some rheumatic drugs in the hope that it

805
00:45:30,713 --> 00:45:34,480
should reduce the symptoms, but it has been a

806
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:38.947
Quite a big disappointment. It came very effective drugs toward

807
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42.447
Art Rheumatism 25 years ago

808
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:45.247
who revolutionized the treatment of that disease.

809
00:45:45,313 --> 00:45:48,713
And many of those preparations have been tested on hand arthritis.

810
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:52.947
But the results have not been so promising there.

811
00:45:53,047 --> 00:45:57,280
Someone asks, as a matter of drugs,

812
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03.913
Is there research on LDN, low-dose naltrexone?

813
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05.713
Yes it is

814
00:46:05,713 --> 00:46:09,580
an opio blocker that is really

815
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:14,013
A medicine used to wean addicts

816
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,713
What I understood.

817
00:46:14,713 --> 00:46:18,347
I quickly looked what was there,

818
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:20,413
And there is nothing we are researching for ourselves.

819
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:23,280
But I looked a little quickly in literature what the research says,

820
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,913
There have been some reports there

821
00:46:24,913 --> 00:46:30,247
This treatment is tested on different types of chronic pain conditions.

822
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:31,213
What I could see,

823
00:46:31,213 --> 00:46:36,080
so the results were not particularly compelling, but it is needed

824
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40.047
As usual more studies and more research.

825
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,880
There are many different types of pain.

826
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,314
It cannot be excluded

827
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:47,114
that such treatment may have an effect on a particular type of pain,

828
00:46:47,114 --> 00:46:50,014
A certain type of arthropod patient.

829
00:46:50,014 --> 00:46:53,080
But as I said, in the studies have been done so far

830
00:46:53,080 --> 00:47:01.814
have not been so compelling.

831
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,114
Connected to the hands and pain,

832
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:09.014
If you have severe pain that you cannot tie your hand,

833
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,847
is it just the pain one can fix or exist

834
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:14,514
Something that can stop this degrading process?

835
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:18,314
Yes, there comes again this degrading process and it is going on

836
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:23,480
Intensive research to find drugs that can slow down this process.

837
00:47:23,547 --> 00:47:24,880
We are not there yet

838
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,714
but the fact is that at the last meeting I was on so

839
00:47:28,714 --> 00:47:32,580
was presented some interesting results where you just looked

840
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,647
on hand arthritis with a treatment directed at bones.

841
00:47:36,647 --> 00:47:39,914
There are subgroups of hand arthritis where

842
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:43,414
The leg is affected

843
00:47:43,514 --> 00:47:45,580
and erosions are used

844
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,747
Talk about, the group is called erosive hand osteoarthritis

845
00:47:48,847 --> 00:47:52,381
And there you see some promising results

846
00:47:52,381 --> 00:47:55.947
with reduced erosions

847
00:47:55,947 --> 00:47:58.947
in the leg at that hand artist.

848
00:47:58,947 --> 00:48:03,314
But as I said, it was a pilot study you need to do

849
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:07,514
About it in another group to see if it can be confirmed and so on.

850
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:09.914
Then was a bit unclear too, I don't really remember

851
00:48:09,914 --> 00:48:12,247
whether this also affected the symptoms or not,

852
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:13,214
I think it was doubtful.

853
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:17,747
You want to see that changes that you make can lead to feeling better.

854
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:19,447
That is that

855
00:48:19,514 --> 00:48:20,581
Patients care about.

856
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:23,947
That the pain gets better, as you would like to have that result as well.

857
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:27,847
And the hope is, of course, that you can influence the structure in a favorable direction,

858
00:48:27,847 --> 00:48:31,847
that in the long run it should at least lead to minor symptoms.

859
00:48:31,914 --> 00:48:32,881
That's what you hope.

860
00:48:32,881 --> 00:48:34,781
But these are difficult things.

861
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:38,814
It takes many, many years to do studies to get credible results.

862
00:48:39,014 --> 00:48:43,581
And as I said, research is constantly going on.

863
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:46,981
If all the cartilage is gone pretty much

864
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:52,514
In the trail, what result can you get from physiotherapy or exercise?

865
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:55.814
We have not found a connection between the pictures,

866
00:48:55,881 --> 00:48:59,514
How the knee or trail looks, and results

867
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:03,514
from training. So you can't

868
00:49:03,714 --> 00:49:07.381
say before you have tried training, whether it will be good or not.

869
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:11,181
You can also think about, in some pictures when you see the cartilage,

870
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:17,114
So there are no nerves there so it can't hurt other parts of the trail.

871
00:49:17,181 --> 00:49:22,514
So what we recommend is

872
00:49:22,514 --> 00:49:27,414
to exercise no matter how much pain or how

873
00:49:27,514 --> 00:49:29,714
The bad trail looks according to pictures.

874
00:49:29,714 --> 00:49:33,781
As we said before, don't worry about the X -rays.

875
00:49:33,914 --> 00:49:38,281
Exactly, we did in a study together with,

876
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:42,714
it was implemented in the US many years ago, where we took

877
00:49:42,714 --> 00:49:48,814
MRI images of randomly selected people from the population both with and without symptoms.

878
00:49:48,814 --> 00:49:53,614
They were aged 50 to 90, thousands of people.

879
00:49:53,614 --> 00:49:57,381
There we took magnetic camera image on their knee joint

880
00:49:57,448 --> 00:50:00.348
And looked at what was in it.

881
00:50:00,348 --> 00:50:04,781
And there we found broken meniscus, in about half of them.

882
00:50:04,848 --> 00:50:07,381
And the vast majority were

883
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:10,615
People who had no symptoms at all.

884
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:12,348
So the risk of man

885
00:50:12,348 --> 00:50:17,281
finds such finds is huge if you take

886
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,715
Takes pictures too generously.

887
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:24,348
So the image diagnostics in osteoarthritis is really for that partly

888
00:50:24,415 --> 00:50:28,581
exclude other diseases, if you have suspicions.

889
00:50:28,581 --> 00:50:32,715
It may be another joint disease, which you want to exclude.

890
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:33,248
The second reason

891
00:50:33,248 --> 00:50:34,515
to take mainly

892
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:38,115
X -ray is also that if you are a candidate

893
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:41,948
To be operated on with prosthesis so you want to look how

894
00:50:42,015 --> 00:50:46,948
The anatomy looks in the pictures and we see the structural stage.

895
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:51,015
Then it is important to have a camera, but also to confirm the diagnosis.

896
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:55,248
But otherwise there is nothing that you as a patient should strive

897
00:50:55,381 --> 00:50:59,081
Asking for, that's not the important thing.

898
00:50:59,148 --> 00:51:00,981
The important thing is how you feel.

899
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:04.681
And there is a pretty big drive

900
00:51:04,781 --> 00:51:08.348
still from patients, that I want my X -ray

901
00:51:08,348 --> 00:51:13,282
I want to know what it looked like. But it's wrong, don't worry about it.

902
00:51:13,382 --> 00:51:15,948
It's a bit hopeful.

903
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,982
Although the X -ray image looks a bit "screws"

904
00:51:19,982 --> 00:51:23,748
Or if you happen to have an MRI image where there is a little screw on the cartilage and the meniscus is

905
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:28,248
A little tabby, there is no great drama about it.

906
00:51:28,315 --> 00:51:32,782
Especially if you have come a little to the age, because we all age.

907
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:36.048
When I look in the mirror

908
00:51:36,048 --> 00:51:39.048
So I don't look like I was 20 anymore.

909
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:44,082
I have a gray beard, dropped my hair, I have wrinkles.

910
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:44,915
It's not that weird,

911
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:47,482
It is the same with taking a picture on my knee and comparing it

912
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:49.948
With when I was 20, you get some screws with age.

913
00:51:49,948 --> 00:51:54,715
It does not have to mean that it is illness, but we age.

914
00:51:54,815 --> 00:51:57.748
And the interesting thing is, we have talked about placebo.

915
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:01,515
There is also something called Nocebo. That when taking a picture,

916
00:52:01,582 --> 00:52:07,182
And sees that it doesn't look like when you were 20,

917
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:10,015
Then you get worried,

918
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:13,415
and begins to feel, the knee is a little different

919
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:16,315
one thinks very much on the knee or on the trail all the time

920
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:20,682
And it can also be bad.

921
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:23,749
Yes, and it can crack and burst the neighbor without having to be anything.

922
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:24,982
Yes, it is very common.

923
00:52:24,982 --> 00:52:26,415
It is cracking and breaking in joints.

924
00:52:26,415 --> 00:52:28,682
It is normal.

925
00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:32,915
Sure it can crack a little extra if you have ended osteoarthritis

926
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:36,049
But that it bursts a bit in a joint, it is completely normal.

927
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:41,282
You don't have to worry about that, there are so many other structures that can slip

928
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:46,715
And tendons and other things that can give away such sounds.

929
00:52:46,782 --> 00:52:49,082
We'll see, we continue a bit to

930
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:53,782
And look at the issues that have been received during the broadcast.

931
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:56,549
We probably won't be able to do with everyone,

932
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,582
But we can see if we can take a few.

933
00:52:58,582 --> 00:53:01,349
First question, is there research on great impact

934
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:06,149
The constant pain has on the quality of life of the arthropodic patients?

935
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:09.049
Yes, there are pretty good studies showing on

936
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:13,549
that it is a high impact on the quality of life in arthropod patients.

937
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,615
There is that.

938
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:20,482
I remember a study that said it was

939
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:24,482
in class with a rheumatoid arthritis, another disease that I

940
00:53:24,482 --> 00:53:28,249
mentioned earlier, that it was least at least equivalent

941
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:31,682
in the influence as that group of patients. But I think it almost shifted,

942
00:53:31,682 --> 00:53:35,149
Now there is very good treatment for that type of rheumatoid arthritis,

943
00:53:35,182 --> 00:53:39,982
While arthropodic patients still lack such a type of treatment,

944
00:53:40,082 --> 00:53:42,116
So the impact of quality of life is huge.

945
00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:43,982
We know about that.

946
00:53:43,982 --> 00:53:47,649
And much more research is needed.

947
00:53:47,649 --> 00:53:52.882
To be able to take better care of patients.

948
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:53,982
Now I jump a little.

949
00:53:53,982 --> 00:53:57,582
Two questions about how horses are dealt with for osteoarthritis

950
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:01.916
And if you see improvement in horses, can the placebo effect be excluded?

951
00:54:01,916 --> 00:54:04,549
Now I don't really know which one

952
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:07.849
Treatment it refers to.

953
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,649
Maybe you know that?

954
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,982
I know there is a study done

955
00:54:14,982 --> 00:54:18,882
On horseback, a Swedish study.

956
00:54:18,982 --> 00:54:22,482
I do not know at all about which preparations and so on.

957
00:54:22,482 --> 00:54:24,116
One has seen the result in

958
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:28,316
That it gave less heel in the horse among other things.

959
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:33,649
Stem cells were apparently referring to, in treatment on horses.

960
00:54:33,716 --> 00:54:37,949
Yes, it probably wasn't in this case, but anyway.

961
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:41,116
But one can say generally that the step from different

962
00:54:41,116 --> 00:54:45,249
Unfortunately, animals will work on humans are quite large.

963
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:48,949
There are various candidates that you have tried

964
00:54:48,949 --> 00:54:51.949
that has not held once one has taken over them to

965
00:54:52,049 --> 00:54:56,116
Attempts on human beings, because biology differs in so many ways.

966
00:54:56,183 --> 00:54:58,583
And already within man so

967
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:01,549
There are many different roads that carry osteoarthritis.

968
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:05.416
And then you take from another animal species then it is not safe

969
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:08.816
That the mechanisms are the same as in humans.

970
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:12,749
But it is very exciting to follow if you now take on and want

971
00:55:12,749 --> 00:55:13,983
try different types of treatments

972
00:55:13,983 --> 00:55:17,916
with which you have had success with other animal species, also into humans.

973
00:55:17,983 --> 00:55:21,983
We look forward to this very much, to see if it can produce results.

974
00:55:21,983 --> 00:55:28,183
But the problems are many to make it work.

975
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:30,283
Regarding cortisone then

976
00:55:30,283 --> 00:55:33,583
You mentioned short -term effect and that it most dampens the inflammation,

977
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:37,750
But do you see any disadvantage in taking cortisone, for example by osteoarthritis in the shoulder?

978
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,983
In addition to what you have said.

979
00:55:39,983 --> 00:55:42,550
The disadvantage is that there is certain

980
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,483
Evidence for repeated treatments may

981
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,616
Make the cartilage quality worse.

982
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:52,050
There is, but it is not entirely clear

983
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,750
But there is some evidence because there are risks.

984
00:55:55,816 --> 00:55:58,783
Then you have to weigh

985
00:55:58,783 --> 00:56:00,583
The benefits to the risks.

986
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:03,983
Is it that you think you get a great relief under someone

987
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05.516
week or several weeks

988
00:56:05,516 --> 00:56:07,483
and it increases one's quality of life much

989
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:09.616
So maybe you are prepared to take that risk.

990
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:14,550
A slightly increased risk of the structure being affected.

991
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,750
If one has tried other treatments

992
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,850
For the alternative otherwise is to insert a shoulder prosthesis.

993
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,216
And that is a great operation.

994
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:22,883
Precisely, it is important to man

995
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:26,683
not thinking about cortisone as a treatment that one takes life out

996
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:30,483
One can try, maybe it helps at the moment

997
00:56:30,483 --> 00:56:35,216
You can move and it gets better.

998
00:56:35,316 --> 00:56:37,416
So disposable or urgent effort? Yes.

999
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:41,317
We get questions about medical laser

1000
00:56:41,383 --> 00:56:45,483
if it works?

1001
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,117
No, there is no good evidence

1002
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:52,117
because it works

1003
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:56,250
In addition, then the placebo effect.

1004
00:56:57,383 --> 00:56:59,850
And what kind of diabetes is it gives risk?

1005
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:03,450
Type two diabetes.

1006
00:57:04,783 --> 00:57:08,250
Is cold or heat as relief, preferred?

1007
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:10,450
If any of that now helps?

1008
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:14,983
We know that cold has a pain -relieving effect,

1009
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:18,183
So a cooling light?

1010
00:57:18,317 --> 00:57:21,583
Yes, for example. It does not affect

1011
00:57:21,717 --> 00:57:26,683
osteoarthritis or the disease process, but you can get less pain.

1012
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:31,650
For some, heat works, so it's different.

1013
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:35,683
We cannot say exactly, if cold or heat is best for the person.

1014
00:57:35,683 --> 00:57:38,883
You can try both, it can help.

1015
00:57:38,983 --> 00:57:42,150
Just. It is about, that if one has pain

1016
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,217
in a joint, to stimulate it with cold

1017
00:57:45,217 --> 00:57:49,450
or heat, it makes you get input that exceeds

1018
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:52,450
Maybe this pain impulse so that it suppresses the pain.

1019
00:57:52,684 --> 00:57:55,884
Our brain is allowed to handle an input about the cold

1020
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,184
This way you can "fool" it.

1021
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,550
We all know that if you are injured then you want to

1022
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:05,150
Feel free to keep it and then you give stimuli, that you hold.

1023
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:08,084
Then a little pain impulses are attenuated.

1024
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:12,450
It is a bit the phenomenon you use with heat or cold.

1025
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,784
Several wonder if there is a connection between osteoarthritis

1026
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:20,184
And osteoporosis, so weakened skeleton?

1027
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22.517
Yes, that is an interesting question.

1028
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:26,584
There are some evidence that they like

1029
00:58:26,684 --> 00:58:30,784
If you have a lot of osteoporosis then you have less osteoarthritis

1030
00:58:30,884 --> 00:58:34,384
And vice versa.

1031
00:58:34,484 --> 00:58:35,550
And that just

1032
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:39,217
osteoarthritis is connected by having

1033
00:58:39,284 --> 00:58:44,317
The opposite of osteoporosis, thus quite strong skeleton.

1034
00:58:44,384 --> 00:58:46,450
It is probably still one

1035
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,084
open question, but there is some evidence

1036
00:58:50,084 --> 00:58:54.051
Because they are like opposite ends.

1037
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:57,817
Then there is a long gray scale in between,

1038
00:58:57,884 --> 00:59:01,684
But I know that many operating surgeons have noted that they

1039
00:59:01,717 --> 00:59:06.951
Rarely looks very osteoporosic arthropodic patients, but the opposite.

1040
00:59:06,951 --> 00:59:10,917
Often, the skeleton is quite stable built.

1041
00:59:11,017 --> 00:59:14,317
And it may have to do with, for example, that many who get

1042
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:18,317
Especially knee arthritis is former athlete who may have been injured.

1043
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:22,051
They have been very active, have built up a strong skeleton.

1044
00:59:22,151 --> 00:59:26,284
So there are difficult things to study.

1045
00:59:26,384 --> 00:59:29,384
Ask about training. Should you train if the trail is swollen?

1046
00:59:29,417 --> 00:59:31,951
It may be such that

1047
00:59:31,951 --> 00:59:35,251
The trail is swollen a bit all the time.

1048
00:59:35,351 --> 00:59:37,851
So it is best to think

1049
00:59:37,851 --> 00:59:41,684
that if you have huge pain then it is good

1050
00:59:41,684 --> 00:59:45,917
To rest a little and wait for the pain to go down.

1051
00:59:45,917 --> 00:59:50,117
And then work out again. But if the trail is very swollen,

1052
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:53,484
so it means there is an inflammation, something going on

1053
00:59:53,584 --> 00:59:57.951
in the trail. As Martin said, it is bad to burden an injury.

1054
00:59:58,017 --> 01:00:00,484
So, moving is very good,

1055
01:00:00,484 --> 01:00:04.651
But one must learn when it is best to do

1056
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:07.618
And when to rest a little.

1057
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:15,084
So little swollen joints hands often by osteoarthritis, but if

1058
01:00:15,184 --> 01:00:18,418
It is much worse today than yesterday

1059
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:24,418
Then it is good to rest a little, wait for it to go down and then work out again.

1060
01:00:24,518 --> 01:00:27,218
We have to take and round there.

1061
01:00:27,218 --> 01:00:28,351
It might be to

1062
01:00:28,351 --> 01:00:30,551
We can answer

1063
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:33,918
In Facebook threads on there are remaining questions.

1064
01:00:33,984 --> 01:00:38,351
But thank you so much to you who have looked and thanks to Martin and Andrea!

1065
01:00:38,984 --> 01:00:41.018
Thanks so much!
