The word ethics comes from the beginning from Greek.

What is the difference between ethics and morals?

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,660
Simply explained, you can say that morality is the same as action, ie what you do.

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,700
Simply explained, you can say that ethics are the same as one's thoughts on what is right and wrong.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,680
Thinking about what is right and wrong is ethics.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,240
When you do something that can be perceived as right or wrong, it is morality.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:32,040
A person's morality can come from the person's ethics. But since we are human beings, we are not always well thought out.

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,920
We are very much controlled by emotions. Therefore, there can be a big difference between what a person considers to be right and wrong and what it actually does.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,200
Sometimes the words ethics and morality are used as synonyms. It is not really, but some mix the concepts.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,760
You may try to keep track of yourself, but be prepared that everyone does not have as good control as you.

There are thoughts in religions about what is considered right and wrong.

26

27
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,140
Other people interpret that it is man who decides on ethics.

28
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,260
Why is there ethics?

29
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,520
Ethics exists to be able to think systematically about right and wrong.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,280
You should have a system to think.

31
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,740

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,360

37
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,280
Examples of the most common ethical models.

00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:07,180

No man uses only one ethic model in his everyday life.

44
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,320
In an everyday situation, it is common for us to argue if it argues based on the different models

45
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,820
Although we are not aware of what they are called.

46
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,000
It is common for arguments for the same action from different models.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,280
It may also be that in some situations you use more arguments from a single model.
