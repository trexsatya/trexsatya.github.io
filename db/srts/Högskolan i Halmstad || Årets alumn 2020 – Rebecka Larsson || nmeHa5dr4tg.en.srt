Hello! My name is Rebecka Larsson and I am this year's alumni.

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,000
I feel incredibly happy and honored to receive this award as this year's alumni.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,040
I think it's great fun that after my study time -

5
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,700
- Keep to inspire students at Halmstad University and the health pedagogical program.

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,740
I work today as a supervisor at the individual cooperation team Halmstad/Hylte -

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,740
â€“And works with long -term sick leave and long -term unemployed persons -

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,780
-As is in need of pre-rehabilitation efforts to be able to approach work.

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,360
Linked to my studies I have been given good use of my educational knowledge -

10
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04.600
- For example, my knowledge in the health promotion area.

11
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,500
The health pedagogical program has given me good conditions -

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,500
- To actually be able to take on all the challenges I have met and will face in working life.

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,000
I want to continue to be an inspiration for the students at Halmstad University -

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,700
- And get the chance to continue to share my experiences.

15
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,680
I think the key words as a health educator are to dare, to be curious -

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,820
- And to challenge when you get into working life.

17
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33.540
Because then you come a long way.
