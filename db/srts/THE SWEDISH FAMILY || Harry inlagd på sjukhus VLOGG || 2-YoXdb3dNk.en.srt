1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,960
- Harry is in hospital ... - mm ...

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,540
Dad Axel sleeps with Harry at the hospital.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,960
If you follow our Instagram, you probably already know about this.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,600
We update with pictures and stories daily.

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,320
But if you do not, Harry is in hospital.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,360
- Great fever.
 - Great fever, exactly.
 I dropped like the words.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,780
He has had a fever occasionally for five days.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,640
Great fever, then it went down ...

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,020
Very high fever, then it went down.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,620
In fact, when we recorded our last video;
 Gingerbread house Challenge ...

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,180
... then he had a fever, and then it was gone.

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,040
In all cases.
 On day five - yesterday, he also began to complain about stomach pain.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,180
Then Axel and I felt that this does not feel good, we take him to the pediatrician.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,360
We come to the pediatrician, they take kissing and some other samples, and say that we have to move on to another doctor.

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,540
We move on to another place where they made an ultrasound and saw that his one kidney was swollen.

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,360
It was big.

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,940
Then we had to move on again.

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,520
At Astrid Lindgrens, Harry was hospitalized, and there he remains.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,260
- Mom?
 - Yes?

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,260
- What is the disease that Harry has?
 - It's called renal pelvic inflammation.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,240
How to get it?

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,900
He has had a urinary tract infection that was not treated, and then it went up in the kidneys.

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,660
But he did not show any of the signs I thought were typical of urinary tract infection.

24
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,400
So it stings when you kiss.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,300
It is true that children do not react in the same way as adults.

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,720
This is a very important thing for all parents there at home to remember!

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:09,280
- Have a nice day at school Alma, and we'll see you this afternoon!
 - mm.
 Bye!

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,760
- Now I'm going to Harry.
 - Yes.

29
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Hello!

30
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,580
Hello!

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,680
How dark you have.

32
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,420
- Is Alma here?
 - No, she's at school.
 She is so worried about you!

33
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,500
What have you?

34
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,300
- We have received a Wildlife Christmas calendar.
 - Huh!

35
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,660
We sit and open all the gaps we have not opened.

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,080
- Oh, what a lot of blood.
 - Oh, have they taken new samples?

37
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,920
Check out what a lot of blood, Dad!

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,700
They took a stick in their finger a little while ago.

39
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,420
It hurt even though I didn't cry.

40
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,820
You're so cool, Harry!

41
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,120
- Listen, I have to get hugged with you now!
 - Although I'll throw this.

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,400
- Okay, but you come and hug me then?
 - Yes.

43
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,300
Now you have to tell you what the doctor has said.

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,840
- Do you remember what the doctor said, Harry?
 - No.

45
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,920
- Should I tell?
 - Yes.

46
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,720
The doctor said that Harry is feeling better and that he may be allowed to come home today!

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,240
It all depends on what the blood values say.
 If they feel they want to make one for ultrasound, then we will have to do it.

48
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:18,520
They say he feels so good that they may change to ordinary antibiotics, which you can swallow.

49
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,540
Then Harry can come home!

50
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,220
Yes.
 As it is now, Harry gets his medicine in here, straight into his arm.

51
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,600
Right.

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,240
- Does it hurt?
 - No.

53
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
- Do you see?
 - Yes, I see.

54
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,900
The hose, that hose, flows into my body.

55
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,760
Harry rests a bit.

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:58,400
We were out in the corridor and ate lunch, and then he got another dose antibiotics in his arm.

57
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,940
The staff here is absolutely amazing!
 They are so good with children.

58
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,980
But we can't film anyway at the hospital, of course.

59
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,680
We came across some clowns, but there were other children around so we couldn't pick up the camera.

60
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,160
What is Dad doing?

61
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,360
Blips and blopper with the computer.

62
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,000
Blips and blopper with the computer.

63
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,760
Blips and blopper with the computer.

64
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
- What do you want to do now?
 - Check out CKN Toys.

65
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,780
Check out CKN Toys.
 What is it, Harry?
 Can you tell our viewers?

66
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,220
It is a man who opens toys.

67
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,040
- A child, huh?
 - Yes.

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,520
A child is in itself a human being ...

69
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,000
Should he be able to watch CKN Toys?

70
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Yes, he can do that for a little while.
 One section he can see.

71
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,780
Three programs ...

72
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,580
- Dad, three programs?
 - One.

73
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,200
- No, three?
 - One.

74
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,400
Okay, then it will be two.

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,500
Hard negotiation, ie ...

76
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm going to knit and pick up Alma, then maybe we will come back here, so she gets to meet Harry.

77
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,160
They miss each other quite a lot.

78
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,980
Harry, you are going to go on ultrasound now, said the sister.

79
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,780
We are waiting for the doctor, and Harry is watching a movie in the meantime.

80
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,980
I don't think we will be able to film during the survey itself.

81
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,060
We're back in the room.

82
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,380
How did the survey go, Harry?

83
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,080
Good.

84
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,000
Was it hard to get a batter on your stomach?

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,980
Yes.

86
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,040
The doctor laid translucent gel on Harry's stomach.

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,880
Then she pulled a machine like this to see how the kidneys felt.

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,800
- Do you know what she told me, Harry?
 - No.

89
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,500
That left kidney is not feeling well.

90
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,360
- But ... now we wait for a ... - should I sleep here again?

91
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,120
We don't know that.
 We are waiting for a message if you are allowed to go home, or if you have to stay.

92
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,360
I get sick if I drink all this.

93
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,400
You've been drinking it up now!

94
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,180
Good!

95
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,440
Harry has eaten very bad today.
 Almost just an apple.

96
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,140
Now he drank up such an energy drink.

97
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,200
- Do you see?
 It's a dinosaur on!
 - Yes.

98
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,340
This means that you are getting big and strong as a Dino!

99
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Do you remember what you can do now that you have been drinking it up?

100
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,780
- No.
 - Dont you remember?

101
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,380
- Paste!
 - Right!

102
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:38,080
Harry has got such a book where you paste when you have eaten and drunk.

103
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,780
Should you see if you find that drink?

104
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,580
There it is.

105
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,880
The time is now...

106
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Where.

107
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,540
Soon half past six.

108
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,740
This means it's time to pee again.

109
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,140
Okay...

110
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,240
Where!

111
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,900
And then kiss.

112
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,800
- Here at?
 - Mm!

113
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,480
Just that, I kissed the poop.

114
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,960
The doctors were in here a little while ago and told me that Harry had to stay another night.

115
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:47,140
The bacterium that created the urinary tract infection that then went on to the kidneys is an unusual bacterium.

116
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
They dare not let him home.

117
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,340
Hello.

118
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,560
Hello.

119
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,040
Hello friend.

120
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,780
Oh, what you are bad.

121
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,860
This one is to you.

122
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,420
He is totally groggy.

123
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,100
Yes, he got very tired when he got this medical drip.

124
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,220
Well.

125
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,540
Alma, check down!

126
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,340
Right high up ...

127
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,520
Hello Hi, kids!

128
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,760
This is all the way up, what we can go.

129
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,920
- What are you doing?
 - Eat french fries and go elevator!

130
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,260
♪ Hey Hops, butt fails!
 ♪

131
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,680
♪ When the butt comes, every butt should be happy!
 ♪

132
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,480
You have never been so happy that the children sing about kiss and poop!

133
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
I also want to lie down.

134
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,820
He felt so damn crass for a while, but now the energy came back.

135
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,360
Now Alma and Joanna will go home and sleep.

136
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,080
Harry and I are going to get ready and go to bed.

137
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,060
I have ordered a taxi.
 It is already nine o'clock.

138
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,920
- I am very tired.
 - Me too!

139
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:46,140
We end today's filming now, we will resume it tomorrow, Harry!

140
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,460
- mm.
 - mm.

141
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,360
Okay, then we say ... "good night" I was saying, we don't say ...

142
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,460
We say;
 See you just as soon.
 Then it's a new day.

143
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
What are you holding up in?

144
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,240
A balloon sword.

145
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Where did you get it from?

146
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,980
Clowns.

147
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,040
- Has there been clowns here?
 - Yes.

148
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,840
He feels much better!

149
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,960
He has responded to the treatment, so now his infection value in the blood has gone down.

150
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,540
This means that we may be allowed to go home today!
 Yay!

151
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,520
I killed.

152
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,020
What was that clowns?

153
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:07,400
It was Fjodor and Milda Matilda who knocked on and came in.
 They trolled with balls.

154
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,600
- Yes!
 - And played with pillows and knotted balloons.

155
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,260
They were great.
 Great for him!

156
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Does it hurt, Harry?

157
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,460
No.

158
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,400
Then I pull it out ...

159
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,060
So.
 How good you were!

160
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,920
So, how cool is Harry?!

161
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,500
You do not touch a mine when they keep you and remove sticks and things, huh!

162
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,460
- I think he's superball!
 - Like the worst superhero!

163
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,640
Yes, much cooler than your mom!
 I'm just standing ...

164
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,000
... holds the camera and feels a small tear.

165
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,780
You may be silent.

166
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,540
- Do you know what is happening now, Harry?
 - No?

167
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,020
We get to go home ... we have to go home!

168
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,900
I get a throat.

169
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,520
How cozy...

170
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,620
We're home again.

171
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,920
And it's so nice!

172
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,640
Or what do you say, Alma?

173
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,660
Yes, nice as just that!

174
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,940
It's great!

175
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,240
We have an important thing to do ...

176
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,540
- Cut the hospital band!
 - Just that, as you get when you are in hospital.

177
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,080
- Are you prepared, Harry?
 - Yes.

178
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,620
Bye.

179
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,080
Oh, nice!

180
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,040
Group hug!
 Group hug!
 Group hug!

181
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,940
What an emotional carousel this has been ...

182
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,940
- I'm completely exhausted.
 - Me too.
 Completely finished.

183
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,100
- And grateful!
 - Yes!

184
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,420
- That Harry is home!
 - It is so nice that he is about to recover again.

185
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,740
- I have such respect for all parents with sick children.
 - Yes!

186
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,600
After our short hospital stay, I only know;
 God, there are people going through this ...

187
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,800
Mm ...

188
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,540
- ...day out and day in.
 Year in and year out, for some.
 - Yes exactly.

189
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,800
And who will celebrate Christmas in hospital, with their sick children.

190
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,780
- You are heroes.
 Everyone!
 - Yes!

191
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,400
Thank you for looking at this long vlog!

192
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,560
Feel free to leave a thumbs up if you liked it.

193
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,120
It is quite slow compared to what we usually post.

194
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,480
It is exciting to hear what you think.

195
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,680
- Write a comment if you have time and desire.
 - Yes please!

196
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,000
And...

197
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,420
Excuse me, I'm losing my voice.
 I'm so tired.

198
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,200
- Merry Christmas, from us to you!
 - Have a great time until we see you next time.

199
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,540
- Have a good one.
 - Merry Christmas!
 Bye!
