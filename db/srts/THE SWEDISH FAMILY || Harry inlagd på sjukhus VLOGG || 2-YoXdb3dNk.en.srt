1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,960
- Harry's at the hospital...
- Mhm...

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,540
Daddy Axel is sleeping at the hospital with Harry.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,960
If you follow our instagram (the_swedish_family),
you probably know this already.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,600
We post pictures and stories every day.

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,320
But if you don't; Harry's in the hospital.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,360
- He has a really high fever.
- Exactly. I lost what I was about to say.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,780
He's had a fever on and off for five days.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,640
Really high fever, then it went down...

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,020
Really high fever, then it went down.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,620
When we recorded our previous video;
the gingerbread house challenge...

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,180
...he had had a fever, which had gone down.

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,040
Anyway. Yesterday, on day five, he started complaining
of a stomach ache.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,180
Axel and I didn't like the sound of that,
so we decided to take him to the pediatrician.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,360
We arrive and they take a urine sample and other tests,
and tell us we need to go to another doctor.

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,540
At the next place they did an ultrasound,
and saw that one of his kidneys were swollen.

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,360
It was larger.

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,940
We had to go to another place yet again...

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,520
Harry got emitted at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital,
and that's where he is right now.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,260
- Mom?
- Yes?

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,260
- What's Harry's illness called?
- It's called pyelitis.

21
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,240
How do you get that?

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,900
He's had a urinary tract infection that wasn't treated,
and therefore it traveled to the kidneys.

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,680
He didn't show any of the signs that I thought
were typical for an urinary tract infection...

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,200
...that it stings when you pee.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,300
I've learned that kids don't react
the same way adults do.

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,440
That's a very important thing
for all parents to remember!

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,500
- Have a nice day at school, Alma. See you this afternoon!

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,280
- Yes. Bye, bye!

29
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,760
- I'm going to see Harry now.
- Yes.

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,800
Hi!

31
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,580
Hey!

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,680
It's so dark in here.

33
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,240
- Is Alma here?
- No, she's at school. She's so worried about you!

34
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,500
What have you got there?

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,300
- We got a Wildlife Christmas advent calendar.
- What!

36
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,660
We're opening all the windows
that we haven't opened yet.

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,080
- Oh, it's so much blood.
- Oh, have they taken new tests?

38
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,920
Look how much blood, dad!

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,700
They gave him a finger prick a little while ago.

40
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,420
It hurt but I didn't cry.

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,820
You're so cool, Harry!

42
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,120
- I need to hug you more!
- I'm gonna throw this away.

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,400
- Okay but can we hug after that?
- Yes.

44
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,300
You need to tell us what the doctor has said.

45
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,840
- Harry, do you remember what the doctor said?
- No.

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,920
- Should I tell them?
- Yes.

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,680
The doctor said that Harry's doing better
and might get to go home today!

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,240
It's all up to his blood count, and we might need to
do another ultrasound if they want you to.

49
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:18,520
They say he's well enough to possibly switch to
regular antibiotics, that you can swallow...

50
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,300
...and if so, Harry can go home!

51
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:26,220
Yes. Now when Harry gets his medicine,
they give it here...straight into his arm.

52
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,600
Exactly.

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,240
- Does it hurt?
- No.

54
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,240
- Do you see?
- Yes, I see.

55
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,900
The tube, this tube... goes in my body.

56
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,600
1:30 p.m.

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,760
Harry's resting.

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:58,400
We were in the corridore and had lunch,
and Harry got another dose of antibiotics in his arm.

59
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,940
The staff at this hospital is amazing!
They're so good with children.

60
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,980
But we can't film everything at the hospital, of course.

61
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,680
We met some clowns, but other kids were around
so we couldn't film it.

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,160
What's daddy doing?

63
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,360
Blipping and blopping on the computer.

64
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,000
Blipping and blopping on the computer.

65
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,760
Blipping and blopping on the computer.

66
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
- What would you like to do now?
- Watch CKN Toys.

67
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,780
Watch CKN Toys.
Could you tell our viewers what that is?

68
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,220
It's a person opening toys.

69
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,040
- It's a child, right?
- Yes.

70
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,520
Well, a child is also a person...

71
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,000
Should he get to watch CKN Toys?

72
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Yes, for a little bit. One episode.

73
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,780
Three episodes.

74
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,580
- Daddy, three episodes?
- One.

75
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,200
- No, three?
- One.

76
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,400
Okay, two then.

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,500
Tough negotiation...

78
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,720
I'll pick up Alma, then we might come back here,
so she can see Harry.

79
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,160
They miss each other quite a lot.

80
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,900
Harry, the nurse said you're getting an ultrasound now.

81
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,780
We're waiting for the doctor,
and Harry's watching a movie.

82
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,980
I don't think we'll be able to film during the procedure.

83
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,060
We're back in our room.

84
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,380
How did the procedure go, Harry?

85
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,080
Well.

86
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,000
Was it uncomfortable to get
the wet stuff smeared on your belly?

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,980
Yes.

88
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:24,820
The doctor put clear gel on Harry's stomach. Then she moved a machine around to look at Harry's kidneys.

89
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,800
- Do you know what she told me, Harry?
- No.

90
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,500
The left kidney isn't doing very well.

91
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,360
- We're waiting for...
- I'm sleeping here again?

92
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,120
We don't know. We're waiting for information
on whether you can go home, or need to stay.

93
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,920
I'll get sick if I finish this.

94
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,800
You've already finished it!

95
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,180
Great!

96
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,440
Harry hasn't eaten much today. Almost only an apple.

97
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,140
Now he finished this nutritional energy drink.

98
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,200
- Look, there's a dinosaur on it!
- Yes.

99
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,340
That means you'll get big and strong like a dino!

100
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Do you remember what you get to do
now that you've finished your drink?

101
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,780
- No. 
- You don't?

102
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,380
- The stickers!
- That's right!

103
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:38,080
Harry got this book where you put stickers
when you've eaten and drunk.

104
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,780
Can you see if you can find what you just drank?

105
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,580
There it is.

106
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,880
The time is now...

107
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
There.

108
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,540
It's almost 5:30 p.m.

109
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,740
This means it's time to pee again.

110
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,140
Okay...

111
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,240
There!

112
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,900
Then the pee one...

113
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,800
- On here?
- Mhm!

114
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,480
I peed on the poop.

115
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,840
The doctors were just in here and said that
Harry need to stay here one more night.

116
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:47,140
The bacteria that caused the UTI that then
traveled to the kidneys, is a rare kind.

117
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
They don't feel safe letting him go home.

118
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,340
Hi.

119
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,560
Hey.

120
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,040
Hi, dear...

121
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,780
Oh, you're not feeling well at all...

122
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,860
This is for you.

123
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,420
He's all groggy...

124
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,100
Yes, he got really sleepy when he got
this drip with medicine.

125
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,220
Oh...

126
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,740
(One hour later)

127
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,340
Alma, look down!

128
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,340
Pretty high up...

129
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,520
Hey hey, kids!

130
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,760
This is as high as we can go.

131
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,920
- What are you two doing?
- Eating french fries and riding the elevator!

132
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,260
♪ Oopsie woopsie, the tush is falling off! ♪
(funny changes to a Christmas song)

133
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,680
♪ When the tush is here every tush shall be happy! ♪

134
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,480
We've never been this happy that
the kids sing about pee and poop!

135
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
I also want to lay down.

136
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,820
He seemed very unwell for a while there.
But now the energy's coming back.

137
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,360
Alma and Joanna are leaving now
to go home and sleep.

138
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,080
Harry and I will get ready for bed.

139
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:37,060
We've ordered a taxi. It's already 9 p.m.

140
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,920
- I'm really tired.
- Me too!

141
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:46,140
We won't film anymore today.
We'll resume tomorrow, Harry.

142
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,460
- Mhm.
- Mhm.

143
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,280
Okay, let's say goodnight...

144
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,460
No, I mean: see you soon! Then it's a new day.

145
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,140
What are you holding?

146
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,240
A balloon sword.

147
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Where did you get it from?

148
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,980
Clowns.

149
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,040
- There's been clowns here?
- Yes.

150
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,840
He's feeling a lot better!

151
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,960
His body has responded to the treatment,
so his white blood cell count has gone down.

152
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,540
That means we might get to go home today! Yay!

153
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,520
I died.

154
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,020
What kind of clowns were here?

155
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:07,400
Fjodor and Milda Matilda knocked on the door,
and started doing tricks with balls.

156
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,600
- Yes!
- They played with whoopee cushions, and tied balloons.

157
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,260
They were great. Very good for him!

158
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,680
Harry, does it hurt?

159
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,460
No.

160
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,400
Now I'm removing it...

161
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,060
There! You did great!

162
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,920
How cool is Harry?!

163
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,240
You didn't even flinch when they were sticking you with needles, and removing needles, and such!

164
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,300
- I think he's totally awesome!
- Like a superhero!

165
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,640
Yes, way cooler than your mom! I'm like...

166
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm holding the camera and feeling a tear fall.

167
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,780
Let's be quiet.

168
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,380
- Harry, do you know what happens now?
- No?

169
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,020
We get to go home... We get to go home!

170
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,900
I'm getting a fart on my neck.

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,520
How cozy...

172
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,620
We're back home again...

173
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,920
And it's so nice!

174
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,640
Don't you agree, Alma?

175
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,660
Yes, it's nice as can be!

176
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,940
It's so cozy!

177
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,240
We've got an important thing to do...

178
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,540
- Cut off the hospital wristband!
- Yes, which you get when you're in the hospital.

179
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,080
- Harry, are you ready?
- Yes.

180
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,620
Goodbye.

181
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,080
How wonderful!

182
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,040
Group hug! Group hug! Group hug!

183
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,880
What an emotional roller coaster it's been...

184
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,940
- I'm completely drained...
- Me too. Completely exhausted.

185
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,100
- And grateful!
- Yes!

186
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,280
- That Harry's home!
- Yes, it's so nice that he's getting better.

187
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,660
I have so much respect for parents
with children that are sick.

188
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,800
Yes!

189
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,600
After our brief hospital stay I'm thinking;
God, some go through this...

190
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,800
Mhm...

191
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,860
...day in and day out.
Even year after year!

192
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,800
Exactly. And some will celebrate Christmas in a hospital,
with their sick children.

193
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,720
- You are heroes. All of you!
- Yes!

194
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,400
Thank YOU for watching this long vlog.

195
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,560
Please leave a thumbs up if you liked it.

196
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,360
It's slower paced than what we normally post,
so it's interesting to know what you thought of it.

197
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,680
- Leave a comment if you want to and have time.
- Please do!

198
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,000
And...

199
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,420
Sorry, I'm so tired I'm almost losing my voice.

200
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:30,200
- Merry Christmas, from us to you!
- Have a great time until we see you next time!

201
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,540
- Take care!
- Merry Christmas! Bye, bye!
