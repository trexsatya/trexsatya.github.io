1
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,200
What if...

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,260
...what the farmer saw...

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,880
...was what Dad's been looking for.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,416
What took him.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,550
You're one black mark away from jail.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,400
And you want to join those idiots again?

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,220
At least they believe me.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
Dad calculated that something was out there.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,100
He knew exactly where and when
the phenomenon would occur.

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,400
Have you got a plan?

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,300
It's incredible!

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,100
Jump in!

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,760
Do you want to know a secret?

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,400
I don't think we're alone.
