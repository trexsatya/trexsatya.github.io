00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Qualitative analysis of interview transcripts

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,940
Step 1: Read the printouts.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,440
Eye through all the prints.
 Write down your first impressions.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,160
Then read through the prints again, more carefully-row-by-line.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,140
Step 2: Mark relevant parts.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,480
Mark words, sentences or paragraphs in the printouts.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:39,020
It can be about what is happening, ie.
 Activities but it can also be about perceptions, processes or basically anything that you think is relevant.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,520
This process is called to code or index.

9
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,360
Here is an example of an interview printing that I have coded.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,100
"But Kent! How do I know what to cuddle?", You wonder.

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,315
My answer is that you can decide to encode something because:

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,120
It is repeated in a number of places, it is something that surprises you,

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,480
It is something that the interviewee himself says is important,

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,180
It may be something that reminds you of something that you have read about in previous research,

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,180
for example in scientific articles or dissertations

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:21,900
It is something that reminds you of a scientific theory or concept

17
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,440
Or it may be for any other reason that you think is relevant.

18
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,700
In your coding process you can start from specific previous research and definite theories and concepts.

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,700
Or work more openly and exploratory.

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:43,040
You can code to create a superficial description or to concept the underlying patterns.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,320
How the process is implemented is up to you.
 It is your study and your choice of methodology.

22
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,720
You are the one who interprets, summarizes and analyzes.

23
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,020
It is your study and it is you who highlight the phenomena that you think are important.

24
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:12,040
However, ensure that you tell the reader about your methodology and the choices you have made and you usually do this under the heading method.

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,600
When encoding, try to be as factual and neutral as possible.

26
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,520
Stay close to data ie
 What is actually in the printouts.

27
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,740
Do not hesitate to encode many phenomena.
 You can have lots of codes, even hundreds.

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:38,980
Step 3: Decide which codes are most important, group those who think are associated and create a number of categories or themes.

29
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,520
Go through all the codes you have created so far.
 Have a pen in your hand as you read through everything.

30
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,880
If you want, you can create new codes by combining two or more codes.

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,220
You do not need to use all the codes you have created.

32
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,080
In fact, most people can be sorted away from now.

33
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,560
Keep the codes that you think are important and group them in the way you think fits well.

34
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,180
You create categories or themes, which they can also be called.

35
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,260
Here is an example.
 I have grouped these codes together and created a category.

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,200
Here is a second example, and here a third.

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,320
You are open minded and creative as well as factual and neutral when you create your categories.

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,300
These categories or themes need not be of the same type.

39
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:42,660
They can be about objects, processes, differences, similarities, emotions or basically anything.

40
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,240
Your work process now, compared to previous steps, is more general and abstract.

41
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:58,060
The categories you create, which also become the main result of the study, must be of general interest to your future readers.

42
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,680
Step 4. Name your categories, determined which are most relevant and how they belong together.

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,100
Name the categories.
 In my example, I have three categories or themes.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,260
I call the first constant adaptation, the second information search and the third problem solving.

45
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,500
In my case there were three categories, but it could just as well have been two or four.

46
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,060
You should also describe how the categories and their content are interconnected.

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:42,120
That said, these categories, or themes, as well as the connections between them, are your study's main result.

48
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:50,360
It is new knowledge about the world seen from the participants' perspective that you reproduce under the heading Results.

49
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,200
Step 5. Here are some possible options.

50
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:01,160
If you want, you can decide and describe the hierarchy that you think you see between the categories.

51
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,260
You can also decide if any category is more central than the others.

52
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,000
It is also possible to draw a figure to show them and their relationships.

53
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,480
Here is an example that I have created.

54
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,000
Step 6: It's time to write everything together.

55
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,420
Under the heading Results you describe your categories and how they are connected.

56
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,000
Use a neutral voice and do no analyzes of your results.

57
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:42,560
Under the heading discussion or analysis, you do your interpretations and discuss your results.

58
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:52,300
You can do this in the light of, for example, similar results that have been presented in relevant scientific journals or dissertations in the current research area.

59
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,020
Or in the light of theories or concepts from the area.

60
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,180
Or other relevant aspects.

61
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,760
Part 2. Finishing notes.

62
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:15,440
My starting point for this video was that you had raw data in the form of interview prints and that you want to bring order into them.

63
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:24,760
It wants to saga, create a result chapter where you tell us what you have found as well as a discussion chapter where you interpret and analyze these results.

64
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:32,340
However, I would like to remind you that everything I said in this video also applies to qualitative analysis in general.

65
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:41,600
In other words, you can use the steps and the tips and advice found in this video to interpret and analyze notes from-

66
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:48,940
-Observation studies, contain in documents, texts and web pages or other types of qualitative data.

67
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,260
There is quite a lot written in this area, but here are at least four books that I recommend.

68
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,940
Thank you so much for watching the video.
 Don't forget to subscribe so I get spurred on to make more movies.

69
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,440
Hello then and good luck with your writing!
