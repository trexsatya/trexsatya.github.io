00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,040
Do you ever think, "Math is just not 
for me"? You're not the only one.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,000
But the right strategies can help anyone 
get better at math. These are a few tips.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,240
Learn the words. 
Math has its own language-

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,640
-and like with any language, you have to 
look up the words you don't know.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,560
So, when you have a math test 
coming up, study up on the words.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,880
That will help you 
understand the problem faster.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,840
Ask questions.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,960
But try to make your questions specific. 
Instead of saying, "I don't get it"-

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,760
-think about what it is specifically 
that you do and don't understand.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,400
That helps you formulate the question, 
for example:

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,360
"Why is there an equals sign there?" 
"What does that word mean?"

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,880
"What do I have to do?" 
"What are you asking here?"

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,880
Take it easy. 
You're not supposed to do math quickly.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,640
You have to think carefully, and be 
thorough when you solve the problem.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,600
Trying to solve problems quickly 
by just guessing-

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,360
-will make us get stuck, 
trying solution after solution.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,120
That can make us freeze up, 
panicking because we can't get it right.

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,520
Solve problems slowly and methodically. 
Take your time, and really think.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,160
Simplify, and divide up.

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,560
Maybe a problem looks 
super complicated and long.

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,200
Take the time to divide the problem up 
into smaller pieces, and simplify it.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,920
A large problem may need 
to be broken down into many pieces-

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,760
-to be solved individually.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,880
Double-check. 
Always double-check your answers.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,840
Try using your answer 
in the equation you just solved-

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,400
-to make sure it works both ways.

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,160
If something's not right, 
you have to investigate.

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,840
Start by reading the problem again. 
Did you understand it correctly?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,960
Read it again 
to ensure you didn't miss anything.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,720
Blank page.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Write down the problem 
on a blank page, and solve it again.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,400
If you get the same answer twice, the 
issue is unlikely to be an accidental slip.

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,440
Compare your answers. If you got 
a different answer the second time-

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,080
-compare your solutions 
and try to figure out what went wrong.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
The right method. Ask yourself 
if you chose the right solution method.

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,200
Maybe you could try a different way?

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
Symbol errors.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
Make sure you didn't make a counting 
mistake or used the wrong symbol.

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,440
Maybe you forgot to add a parenthesis 
or subtraction symbol?

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,040
When we challenge ourselves 
and learn new things-

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,160
-it helps our brains develop 
and get stronger.

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,440
So don't give up. 
Math\h can  be for everyone.

43
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,680
Good luck!
