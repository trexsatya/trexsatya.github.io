1
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:04,791
In my job

2
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:06,833
Do I make sure that air combat leaders and pilots

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,125
can talk to each other.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,541
During a flight, information must be able to flow between

5
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,125
us in the combat management center and the aircraft.

6
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:18,291
Through Data Link we send mode updates to the pilot

7
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,166
And with radio, the air combat leaders lead the air battle.

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,458
My job is to make sure all systems work.

9
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,833
In order to do that I need to understand both

10
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,708
the tactical and the technical.

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,041
I get an insight into everyone's details

12
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,583
And we become a welded team.

13
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,708
The special thing about my job is that I am where it happens.

14
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,791
On my screens I have constant surveillance over our technical systems

15
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,375
And I see the air situation throughout Sweden.

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,666
My name is Hampus

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,666
And I'm a management system officer.
