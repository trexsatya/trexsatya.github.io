1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07.040
The biggest attack against Kiev since the start of the war-

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,880
- And the Wagner Group leaves the broken Bachmut.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,640
Swarms of Iranian Kamikaze drones attack Ukraine's cities.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,080
What do they fulfill for military function? This is the "war of the week" -

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,880
- As the latest news development deepens in the Ukraine war.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,240
Kiev has been attacked by a record number of robots and drones.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,760
Several people must have died in the attacks, which began at the celebration of Kievdagen - -

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,200
- The anniversary of the city's founding over fifteen hundred years ago.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,320
That you see these attacks during the day, when you simultaneously see school children out -

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,960
–And people try to live the everyday life that exists in Kiev-

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,160
–As clearly connected with Russian attempts to spread horror -

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07.640
- Among residents in Ukraine's capital and Russia's psychological warfare.

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,840
These images from a car camera show how a downed robot -

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,200
- Hits a road in Kyiv.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,360
But the constant air attacks have not produced the desired result for Russia -

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,800
–Noly the British Department of Defense, which writes -

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,280
- That the goal was probably to knock out the Ukrainian air defense.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,520
A hospital in the city of Dnipro has been completely destroyed in a Russian robot attack.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,120
At least two people must have been killed and more than 30 injured -

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
- In what Ukraine describes as a war crime.

21
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45.840
Dnipro is one of the larger cities in eastern Ukraine-

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,040
- And its geographical location also shows its importance.

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,080
Therefore, Dnipro has also become a kind of logistical hub.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,680
Both militarily, for Ukraine's military, but also for civilian organizations -

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,960
- As aid organizations or media.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09.680
Many are based on Dnipro in their work on eastern Ukraine.

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,320
Fortezza Bachmut!

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,920
Pictures from Russian news agency Tass provide a rare insight from inside Bachmut.

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,680
In this picture with the gate, you see how it stands -

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,480
–Ad bachmut ... that the city is open, or "opens for the good" -

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,720
- But it is not directly what you see to take place in the pictures.

32
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Of course, it is striking how total destruction is -

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,120
- And how empty the city has become.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,040
This silence and calm is due to the fact that the battles have reduced drastically -

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,840
- Cut central Bachmut, but also because people have moved.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,080
The battles in the city must have calmed down since Ukraine lost control.

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,600
Something that is now confirmed by several Western analysts.

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,920
But Ukraine, of course, has a continued presence in the area around the city -

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,480
- And from Ukrainian perspective, one expresses the hope of regaining the area.

40
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,960
Today we were hit by one of the biggest Russian attacks -

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,080
-With 54 shahed drones at the same time.

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,440
This is what they look like, the Iranian Shahed drones-

43
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,560
which attacks Kiev and other cities around Ukraine.

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,480
The Kamikaze drone is called at Swedish patrol robot-

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,680
- And militarily fulfills a function in the middle of a drone and a robot.

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,960
What mainly defines them is that a drone normally shoots a projectile -

47
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,120
- While a patrol robot is the projectile itself with a battle tip.

48
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,120
The main advantages of such patrol robots are first ...

49
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00.800
One: they have the ability to fly around - for an extended period of time -

50
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,400
- And look for a suitable target.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,920
Two: They are relatively inexpensive and easy to produce.

52
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,760
Three: They are relatively small and therefore more difficult for air defense to detect.

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16.560
The drones have become a well -known detail during the Ukraine War -

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720
- And made the light directed against Russia and Iran's relationship.

55
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25.560
Western countries point to in -depth military cooperation between Russia and Iran-

56
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,720
- Not at least around these patrol robots.

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,320
This is nothing that Iran disputes in substance, but on the other hand describes man - -

58
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,080
–Wester reactions as hysterical or as an attempt -

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
- Keeping Iranian products away from the Russian market.

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Stop for Iranian drones!

61
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48.560
After the last attacks, Ukraine has now introduced -

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,720
–50 year long sanctions against Iran, including Total Trade Ban with the Land-

63
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57.040
- And a travel ban for Iranians through Ukraine.

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00.400
Ukraine says this will have consequences and western countries -

65
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,200
- Have tried to push Iran not to send these patrol robots to Russia.

66
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09.440
In fact, experts - admit the experts -

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,000
- It is very difficult to do something about this, for example with sanctions.

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,120
One of the main causes is that there is an open transport route -

69
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,840
- Between Russia and Iran across the Caspian Sea.

70
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,840
Russia's capital Moscow has been attacked with several drones -

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,080
- Computer Russian authorities.

72
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37.560
Two buildings must have been met, but no one should have been seriously injured.

73
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,080
These continuous attacks, such as Russia and Russian media-

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,480
–Not can ignore, becomes a kind of reminder of the war -

75
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,760
- And that the war is closer than you want to believe or claim from Russian.

76
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,920
In addition, it fulfills some practical functions.

77
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,600
Not that the attacks themselves did any major material damage.

78
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,280
However, it can force Russia to redistribute its forces -

79
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08.440
- To e.g. secure their boundaries-

80
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,440
- Or increase the defense against drones or robotic attacks against Russian cities.

81
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,320
New drone attacks against a Russian oil -refinery and border town of Belgorod -

82
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,320
- Has got Russia to once again accuse Ukraine for shootings.

83
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,520
More recently, we have seen more and more attacks even in Russian territory.

84
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Normally, Ukraine has tried to keep this a bit at arm's length -

85
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,400
- And deny a direct involvement in the attacks.

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,920
But here most recently we saw how to from Ukrainian perspective -

87
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,440
- Warned that Russian attacks on Ukraine would have consequences.

88
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,080
The Wagner Group has announced that it has begun to hand over positions in Bachmut-

89
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,640
- To Russian regular forces.

90
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,520
But exactly how and when to happen is still unclear.

91
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02.560
According to Prigozjin, you need to "regroup" before a long war.

92
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,760
What role will the Wagner Group get in the future?

93
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09.600
As long as the Wagner Group is a useful tool for Russia -

94
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,720
–And Russia has a need for military capacity and forces that can fight -

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,000
- So the Wagnergruppen will continue to play a role.

96
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,240
About the Wagner Group, or Yevgenij Prigozjin thereby -

97
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,360
- In one way or another, be seen as a load -

98
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,520
–On if there are other forces one would rather use -

99
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,960
- So the role of the Wagner Group will also be fond of.
