Hello

2
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:04.505
i got one so ba ask

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07.605
As I want to try to answer

4
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:10,595
The question is: How can I take

5
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:13,585
better notes on the lesson

6
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:16,575
when the teacher talks

7
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:18,745
It was Farhia who asked that

8
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,185
and I think that is a very good question indeed

9
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:23,745
and

10
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:27.705
I was going to link that question to

11
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,115
the words

12
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:32,925
objectively and subjectively

13
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:35.865
So I want to discuss the words objectively

14
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:38.805
And subjectively little

15
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,815
and connect it to what you are looking for

16
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:44.865
When you listen to a lesson

17
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,235
what you should record and

18
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:50,575
what to focus

19
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52.585
and concentrate on
