00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,280
Welcome to International Writers Stage Gothenburg!\h
My name is Tone Schunnesson and I'm a writer.\h\h

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,240
Today I'm here to talk to "V", formerly\hEve Ensler, about her new book\h\h

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,360
"The Apology" or "Förlåt" in Swedish,\hpublished at Ordfront förlag.

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,648
Welcome V!

5
00:00:29,648 --> 00:00:33,606
Thank you, I´m very happy to be here!

6
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:34,560
Thank you for being here.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,640
You are most famously known for the\h
iconic play "The Vagina Monologues". A piece that\h\h

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,040
explores sexual experiences, body image and several\h
other topics through the eyes of different women.\h\h

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,080
It's translated into 48 languages and has\h
been performed in over 140 countries. It's\h\h

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,960
like a cultural fixture and a feministic and\h
political groundbreaking piece of writing.\h\h

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:12,640
The play laid ground for your non-profit V-day\h
movement. The V-day movement raises money\h\h

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,680
and educates people about gendered violence and\h
makes an effort to stop it. You raised over\h\h

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,600
100 million dollars. Besides that you've\h
written several other plays, books and movies.\h\h

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,480
Among others "I'm an Emotional Creature", "The Secret\h
Life of Girls round the World", the book made\h\h

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,600
The New York Times bestseller list. You've also\h
written "The Good Body" which starts\h\h

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,240
with your own tormented relationship with your\h
aging body and then introduces us to women around\h\h

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,920
the world who have found peace with their bodies.\h
2013 you wrote a memoir "In the Body of the World"\h\h

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,920
which dealt with you getting cancer. You also\h
made a book into a theatrical performance in 2018\h\h

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,280
You received numerous awards, like a million of\h
them! Among them a Tony Award in 2011. But today\h\h

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:21,200
we're going to talk about "The Apology". "Förlåt" in Swedish and the first of your books\h\h

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,840
published in Swedish. I hope it's not the last\h
since you have such a big and exciting production.\h\h

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:37,760
"Förlåt" is a very touching book. It's an apology\h
from your father, written by you. An apology from\h\h

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,920
your father's point of view that you waited\h
for your whole life and never received.

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,200
An apology from your father's point of\h
view that you waited for your whole life\h\h

25
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and never received. Your father and perpetrator\h
who sexually and physically abused you never\h\h

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,840
owned up to his wrongdoings. When writing the\h
book he'd been dead 31 years. You decided\h\h

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,640
to give yourself what you needed. Him taking\h
accountability for his actions and him explaining\h\h

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,840
what led him to treat his oldest daughter this\h
way. This book is a letter to Eve from Arthur.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was deeply touched by your book "Förlåt"\h
and it resonated with me in more ways than I\h

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
would have imagined. I was\h
so filled with strong emotions\h\h

31
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,320
when reading, it was like\h
a physical experience reading it.\h

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,240
Since it's so hard to read Arthur\h
recounting the events, I was filled with sadness,\h\h

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,680
relief but also anger and rage. One thing\h
that kept coming back to me was the extensive\h\h

34
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,240
emotional labour behind your method. To bring\h
back your father from the dead and evoking his\h\h

35
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,080
voice couldn't have been easy. Can you please\h
tell me about the process behind this book\h\h

36
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,830
and how the book came to be?

37
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:27,920
Thank you so much\hfor that introduction and for the response to "The Apology". It's funny that you're saying\hthat about the physicalness of your response,\h\h

38
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,840
because writing this book was so physical.\h
It was so physical in so many ways.

39
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,800
I've never had an experience\hlike that, writing before.
 I've written a lot of\h\h

40
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,200
books and a lot of plays but it felt as\h
if I went into a kind of trance state.\h\h

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,680
My father, my dead father was very, very present\h
through the whole thing. I really learned\h\h

42
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,480
a lot about the dead. The dead are always with us.\h
They're always around us and often they long to be\h\h

43
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,680
in communication with us to help them understand\h
where they are and to help them get free and other\h\h

44
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:18,240
zones where they live. But the experience of\h
trying to climb into my father, to live inside\hhim.

45
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,320
The book is a conjuring,\hit's fiction. I don't know if\h\h

46
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,280
a lot of it's even true because my father really\h
never talked and he never told me about himself.\h

47
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,840
But it feels like it's true because his presence\h
and being inside him felt so real while I\h

48
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,760
was writing it. It was excruciating, it was\h
liberating, it was terrifying, it was maddening.\h\h

49
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,200
I had moments where I was literally curled up\h
in a ball, like just weeping. But it was

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,600
incredibly cathartic. I always say,\h
there's a line at the end of the book\h\h

51
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
which I don't know if my father\h
says or I say because by the end of writing\h\h

52
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,080
the book I didn't know who was writing\h
it, but the line is "old man be gone"\h\h

53
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,520
When that line got said. it\h
really felt like my father just went\h\h

54
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,200
into the ethers, like he was gone and to be honest\h
he hasn't come back. He is gone from my\h\h

55
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,040
life, gone! He's no longer possessing me. He's no\h
longer occupying me. He's no longer determining\h\h

56
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,720
me. I'm no longer his consequence, which is one of\h
the reasons I changed my name. I felt like\h\h

57
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,160
that name was part of that narrative and that\h
story and I'm now writing a new narrative. \h

58
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,600
We're\hgoing to talk about the ending of the book later\h\h

59
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,840
but I absolutely loved the last line of the book.\h
It was very freeing for me as a reader as well.\h

60
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I thought a lot about that\hwhen reading your book because,\h

61
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,840
for me as a writer, I always think that\h writing is a way to connect to the dead\h\h

62
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,120
and make the dead a part of the living and\h
so much of writing is trying to reach the dead.\h\h

63
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Can you say something more about\hhow the dead are living\h\h

64
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,120
with alive people and what is literature's\h
role or writing's role in this relationship?\h\h

65
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:31,280
I feel like our ancestors are all around us\h
all the time and it's a question of whether we\h\h

66
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,840
tune into their presence. But I think because\h
I was writing this book in my father's voice\h\h

67
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,680
I was calling him in. I needed him to talk\h
to me and literally I would be asleep\h\h

68
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,000
and he would wake me up at four in the morning. I\hwould wake
up and he would say, go to your office,\hI'm going to tell you a story!

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,204
So I would get\hup in the middle of winter
I'd go to my office and he would start to talk to me.

70
00:07:57,204 --> 00:08:06,254
And I\hstarted to understand,\hthere's a whole passage in the\h
book, like the dead are all around us.

71
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:12,874
And if we are willing to open ourselves to them and feel them and to listen to them and be in dialogue with them

72
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:24,822
and embrace them,\hthey will speak to us. And they will let 
us know what they're feeling. And they will also instruct\hus and direct us and help us.

73
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:31,040
I feel like they're here and and I feel a lot\h
of people leave this world very incomplete.

74
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,400
They leave, my father for example left very\h
arrogant, he left very prideful, he refused to\h\h

75
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,960
look at any of the things he had done wrong.\h
So he literally had been stuck for 31 years spinning\h\h

76
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,720
in this terrible, terrible limbo which was really\h
him having to deal with all the undealt things he\h\h

77
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,720
hadn't dealt with. I think by my summoning him\h
here, in a literary and emotional way gave him\h\h

78
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,720
an opportunity to really work through what he\h
was going through, wherever he was. It certainly\h\h

79
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,320
did it for me. So that is is my imagination.\h
I think the imagination often is so much more\h\h

80
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,205
truthful than reality.

81
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:25,760
I always think about truth\hwhen writing fiction. Even when writing fiction you know what the\htruth is. You can see what's truth and what's\h\h

82
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,240
not the truth. So that's interesting,
the fantasy is like more connected to the truth.

83
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,360
I also thought about anger
when reading, because I was angry.

84
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,720
I thought about two different kinds\h
of anger. Anger, as the feeling consuming\h\h

85
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,880
the narrator, your father, and making him\h
like a horrible person, impossible to reach,\h\h

86
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,240
impossible to connect with. Like anger as lacking\h
empathy. But there is also another kind of anger\h\h

87
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:07,920
and that's Eve's anger in the book, fuelling\hher survival

88
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,920
and anger as a maker of boundaries.\h
There's a harrowing scene when she smiles at him\h\h

89
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,099
when he's been beating her. It's so angry, it's full of rage

90
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:29,520
but it makes her her own. So I'm curious, what are your thoughts\h
on anger? Is it destructive or is it helpful?\h

91
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,080
It's such a brilliant way of\h
putting it. Both those two types of anger...

92
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,600
I think, as women, we're so often\h
taught we're not allowed to be angry.\h\h

93
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,480
Oh, you're just an angry woman or\h
the b word, or you're all this. 

94
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,480
Men are so trained to be allowed to have their anger\h
and also to learn how to direct their anger\h\h

95
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,640
into achievement and into all kinds\hof things.
For me,

96
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,040
I've always been very, very angry. 
I'm just\ha raging person and I think my rage\h\h

97
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,800
is what helped me survive.
If I hadn't had\hthat anger, if I hadn't had that defiance, if\h\h

98
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I hadn't had that refusal in me, just the\h
furiousness at him, he would have wiped 

99
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,240
me out. He would have just run me over.\h
So I think anger is very\h\h

100
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,440
healthy. It fuels revolutions, it fuels resistance,\h
it fuels risings and and people 

101
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,680
speaking truth to power and refusing to be\h
oppressed and refusing to be slaves and refusing\h\h

102
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,960
to be undone. There's also a point when\h
you have to start looking at your anger 

103
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,960
and there's a line in there where his mother\h
says to him, anger is a poison you mix\h\h

104
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,160
for a friend and you drink yourself.There becomes\h
a point where that anger becomes toxic to you.\h

105
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,760
One of the reasons I wrote this\h
book, there are many reasons, but I heard myself one\h\h

106
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:04,160
night just going on and on and on about my rage, about men. I don't accept\h\h

107
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,840
any kind of homogenized or generalized monolithic\h
response to any group. If anybody said, I hate

108
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,440
a group, I would stand up and say, how can you\h
possibly say that? That's racist!

109
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,680
But why was I allowing myself to
feel perfectly entitled to go on about men?\h

110
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,720
I realized that I didn't want to be that person.\h
I didn't want to be that person who was going\h\h

111
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,160
on about raging at men for my whole life.
That\hwas one of the reasons I wrote this book. To just\h\h

112
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,880
say, okay let's go in, let's see what what is\h
this controlling rage doing and is it serving my\h\h

113
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,080
life anymore? Is it really moving me forward? 
The answer was it wasn't serving my life anymore.\h\h

114
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,240
It was keeping me attached to a notion of myself\h
as this perpetual victim. Which i didn't want to be\h\h

115
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,560
anymore. I was only in reaction to my father. I was\h
only in response to my father which meant I was\h\h

116
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,600
still in my father's story.
I was still within his\hconstruct or his narrative. I wanted\h\h

117
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,284
to be in my own narrative.

118
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:22,320
That's the big wonder of this book. It's not an angry book. It's a book filled with understanding,\htrying to understand or even an act of\h\h

119
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:31,360
compassion. That is what makes\h
this book so curious in a way.

120
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,520
Another thing that was so interesting\h
with your father or the voice of your father\h\h

121
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,920
in the book, in your writing, is him trying to\h
explain how he became such a violent person. 

122
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:50,160
Early on he talks about how he as a teenager went to\h
the movies and discovered the American movie star.\h\h

123
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:59,360
And charm. He decides to become a charming man.\h
To use this charm as a shelter from\h\h

124
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:07,920
the violence he himself is experiencing at home. And\h
after this he becomes almost this image of a man,\h\h

125
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:16,320
instead of a real man. I was so\h
intrigued about this picture, this image. 

126
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,960
How is that related to lying versus telling\h
the truth? And also this obsession\h\h

127
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,000
with the image or the picture in western culture\h
or American culture? Could say something\h\h

128
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,364
about that?

129
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:36,080
From my father's\hearly years, 
my father was obsessively adored.

130
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,880
I think adoration of boys, adoration\h
of anyone, is a devastating and destructive thing\h\h

131
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,365
because it doesn't allow them to be a human being.\h
It forces them to be...

132
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:48,094
Why is that?

133
00:14:48,094 --> 00:15:01,120
When you're adored for this\hidealized image of yourself, so you have to always be performative. You can't be doubtful, you\hcan't cry, you can't express weakness. 

134
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,320
It's also very lonely when\h
you're adored because you're this perfect person.\h\h

135
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,440
And in my father's case no one was good\h
enough to be your friend because you're so perfect.

136
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,520
And I think it made my father really anxious and\h
crazy early on. And I think he was abused by\h\h

137
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:25,840
his brother. So when he found moviestars and images of 

138
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,720
Valentino and Cary Grant and all these\h
people in the movies, he suddenly had this\h\h

139
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,400
veneer. He had this image of himself that he could\h
portray and bring into the world. But it didn't\h\h

140
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,040
take care of all the feelings that were underneath it, 
which were rage and which were self-hatred and\h\h

141
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,520
which were never feeling loved for\h
who he was but for this idealized idea that his\h\h

142
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,240
parents had of him. Nothing having to do\h
with who he really was. America\h\h

143
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,400
is this place that creates these images. Then it exports these images, both\h\h

144
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:09,440
internally all through the country and into the\h
world of this kind of fantasy idea of ourselves.

145
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,320
Right now there's this new\h
thing going on in movies here which

146
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,760
feels like wealth porn. All the movies\h
are filled with these unbelievable clothes and\h\h

147
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:28,720
unbelievable houses of the wealthy. All these\h
TV-series are just exporting this notion of\h\h

148
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,920
of the rich and what it's like to be rich. 
So everybody starts comparing themselves to that\h\h

149
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,400
and starts looking at their own shabby house and\h
feeling like, oh my God, look where I live, it's so\h\h

150
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,120
pathetic! And it feels diminished and feels\h
like they're less than, it feels like they're not\h\h

151
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,840
enough. This is what this country\h
is known for, the manufacturing of fantasy.

152
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:59,520
We elected this crazy predator in chief.\h
Who was the king of that. He was a\h\h

153
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:07,200
television show, he was a hologram. That was the ultimate in an American kind of\h\h

154
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:14,400
projection. So my father
was charming and he was handsome.

155
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,920
Everybody wanted to look like him and\h
be like him and he was a bastard and he was horrible.\h\h

156
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,080
This is so true of so many. Whether
you look through all of what happened in the\h\h

157
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:34,160
recent metoo exposure in Hollywood, if you look\h
at all of these people who are so called charming\h\h

158
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,880
and delightful. I've been\h
reading Hannah Arendt lately because she's one\h\h

159
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,480
of my favorite writers. She always talks about\h
the fact that the evil don't look\h\h

160
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,240
like evil. The evil looked banal, the evil looked
regular, the evil looked charming, the evil looked\h\h

161
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,800
like just like everybody else. And I think\h
this notion of charm is something that\h\h

162
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,400
is very confusing and distorting and crippling.\h
It took me years to be able to really say,\h\h

163
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,720
this man who appears to be charming to all of\h
you, is destroying my life.

164
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,440
Even I couldn't believe that this person who was\h
so charming would be doing this to me. 

165
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,880
Culturally we also have great faith in the 
charm or in the picture of charm.

166
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,400
It's a spell, charm really means a spell. People\h
put a spell on you through their charm.

167
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,840
That's very interesting. There's a\h
beautiful scene in the book\h\h

168
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,960
where Eve's father has been dead for a couple\h
of days and he sees Eve sitting in his closet\h\h

169
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,920
with her face buried in his shirt. He's\h
reading this as a sign of Eve's willingness or\h\h

170
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:00,560
her efforts to remember some form of tenderness\h
between them. This made me think of making\h\h

171
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:08,400
room for grief when grief is not easy. How do\h
we grieve the people we hate or have hated\h?

172
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,040
It's such a good question. 

173
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:27,840
It took me so long to grieve my father.\hOne, because my father was so 
ungenerous. When you have a memorial or a funeral, it's an act of generosity.\h\h

174
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,040
You're allowing the people who loved you to have\h
a way to process the loss of you. My father didn't\h\h

175
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,600
believe in any of that. So there was no funeral, there was no memorial. There was no way to grieve\h\h

176
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,280
for my father. He found them petty and he found them loathsome.\h\h

177
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,080
Like things that human beings would\h
do. So after my father\h\h

178
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,480
had died and I was at my parents house, I
didn't have any way to to experience\h\h

179
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,520
the disappearance of my father. The evaporation\h
of my father. He was here and he was gone. But\h\h

180
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:09,120
there was nothing, there was no ritual, there was\h
no process to integrate that into myself. \h\h

181
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,760
So I just went into his closet and I remember\h
he had this yellow cashmere sweater that\h\h

182
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,800
he wore all the time. I just took it down\h
and I sat in his closet and I just smelled it.

183
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,960
As a way of at least having the memory of him and\h
the loss of him all at the same time.

184
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,880
To be honest with you, my father died 31\h
years ago. It wasn't until I wrote this\h\h

185
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:40,640
book that I truly grieved my father. Grieved who he was in life and\h\h

186
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,160
grieved the loss of him. Because I
was too angry at that time, I was too angry.\h\h

187
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,720
I'm glad he's dead. I was\h
just brusque and I was glib.

188
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,440
I hadn't seen my father in years. He'd been\h
horrible but there\h\h

189
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,200
were layers and layers of feelings under there\h
where I had once loved my father deeply. I was\h\h

190
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,720
once very attached to my father and through the writing of this book\h\h

191
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,080
I finally untangled those feelings. I just dismantled them so that I could go on\h\h

192
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,460
clean.

193
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:29,840
There's a change in\hhow he sees what he's done, through the book, In the beginning he tries\hto give Eve as a five-year-old some kind of agency.\h\h

194
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,760
Almost claiming that she's been flirting with\h
him as a five-year-old, and this just made me\h\h

195
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,840
boil! I almost couldn't read it.
It was so painful to read. But then he\h\h

196
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:55,360
starts to abandon this idea of Eve's agency and he\h
starts to recognize the truth. That Eve's agency\h\h

197
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:03,440
was a lie. This is when the pain\h
starts to affect him or the consequences of what\h\h

198
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,840
he did to you starts to affect him. For me this was a victory functioning as an image in my\h\h

199
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,080
own life. There is this small possibility that\h
a perpetrator would admit his wrongdoing\h.

200
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:24,160
It was also bittersweet, because as you also\h
talked about, it made me realize how the apology\h\h

201
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,686
is missing in the patriarchal\h
society. During and after

202
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:33,600
metoo there was this big

203
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,040
void opening between all of us. Countless\h
women came out and told their stories

204
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,520
and shared their trauma publicly, which is very\h
hard, with hope that something would change.\h\h

205
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,840
For me it was never about cancelling men\h
out, it was about trying to start a conversation.\h

206
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,160
But now there's like this open wound. All of\h
us still waiting. What are your

207
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,840
thoughts on this? Why can't toxic\h
masculinity hold space for the apology?\h

208
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,360
It's such a good question! Since I've written the book,\h

209
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,040
it's been amazing, because I am surprised\h
to see how men have responded to the book.\h\h

210
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,920
A lot of men have had me on shows.\h
I've received lots of letters from men\h\h

211
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,720
who have written me apologies. They have written\h
to their perpetrators, I mean to their victims\h\h

212
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,000
which has been really moving. But what I want\h
to say is that, except for maybe one example of\h\h

213
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:47,440
a couple on TED, I have never heard a man make a\h
public apology in a true way for sexual violence.

214
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,520
Nobody has in the history of humankind.
I've gone back, back, back centuries. Never.\h\h

215
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,680
What I discovered writing this book is\h
that it's actually a column that holds up\h\h

216
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,880
patriarchy, the non-apology. As long as\h
men refused, and I'm not going to say men,\h\h

217
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,720
as long as perpetrators, because there are\h
women perpetrators too. As long as perpetrators,\h\h

218
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,480
but I'm going to say again, that one out of three\h
women on the planet will be beaten or raped. And\h\h

219
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:23,280
that is by men, so that's a lot of men. As long\h
as men refuse to apologize\h\h

220
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,480
patriarchy stays in place. Because\h
once one man begins to say he's sorry\h\h

221
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,080
and he knows it was wrong, then all the men have to\h
begin to say they know what they're\h\h

222
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,480
doing is wrong. And one once that begins to\h
happen this methodology, which is violence, which\h\h

223
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,760
is the thing that keeps patriarchy in its place\h
will begin to collapse. So I believe it's\h\h

224
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,440
truly significant, the apology. It's a core\h
to dismantling patriarchy, it's at the core.\h\h

225
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,240
Because you have to make yourself vulnerable. You\h
have to say you were wrong. You have to acknowledge.\h\h

226
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,760
First of all, what went into making you? What\h
are the patriarchal ingredients that allowed\h\h

227
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,240
you and and pushed you to become a\h
man capable of rape, capable of violence?\h\h

228
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,240
Then you have to feel what your victim felt,\h
actually climb inside her and see the impact of\h\h

229
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,760
what you did to her. You have to look at the actual\h
things that you did to her. What exactly did you do?\h\h

230
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,680
And then you have to take responsibility\h
for that. All of those things work against\h\h

231
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,440
everything that patriarchy is. It keeps\h
its distance so it can maintain its power.\h\h

232
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,000
It's always about the father is right no\h
matter what. It's always insisting\h\h

233
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,760
on domination rather than cooperation and dialogue.\h
So I believe that at the core, if we really want\h\h

234
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:59,520
to dismantle patriarchy, we have to start\h
to have apologies and reparation, processes, groups\h\h

235
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,200
everywhere in the world. It has to begin\h
to happen. And I think there are more men willing\h\h

236
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,480
to undergo that process than we think, having seen\h
letters that are starting to come in from the book.\h\h

237
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,080
I saw your TED\htalk and I really liked you\h\h

238
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:24,880
talking about calling men in after calling them\h
out. That takes some effort to be\h\h

239
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,360
willing and able and have the courage to do so.
Can you just explain what calling men in is?\h

240
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,840
My friend Tony Porter, who runs this organization,\h
called a man and he was the one who\h\h

241
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,040
actually coined that phrase. He was like saying,\h
and I just loved it because I feel like, okay\h\h

242
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,320
we have now exposed, not just with metoo, I've been working 23 years\h

243
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,880
in a movement called V-day where what\h
have we been doing but calling out men! Calling out\h\h

244
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,120
stories, telling our stories, breaking the silence.\h
breaking the silence breaking the silence telling\h\h

245
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:05,840
the stories. We've done that. The next stage of this\h
movement has to be that men begin to talk about\h\h

246
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,000
what they've done. Literally why they've done it.\h
What's in their history, what it feels like and\h\h

247
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,440
what they're going to do to change. Otherwise we're\h
going to be stuck here forever. 

248
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,440
One of the amazing things about the ending\h
violence against all women movement\h\h

249
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,840
is that women took this on. This actually isn't\h
our movement. It should be a men's movement.\h\h

250
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,360
It should be men saying, we are going to stand\h
up and we are going to fight to end violence\h\h

251
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,520
against our mothers and our sisters and our wives\h
and our girlfriends and our best friends and our\h\h

252
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,000
aunts and our grandmothers. We care that\h
women are being violated, it disturbs us as much\h\h

253
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,560
as it disturbs them. And there's something holding\h
that back from happening called patriarchy.\h\h

254
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,240
Because as my friend Tony Porter also says,
there's something called the man box and every\h\h

255
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,200
man is born into that box. And when you step out of\h
that box you risk other men judging you. Other men\h\h

256
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,920
exiling you, not being a part of the group. All\h
I can say is those of us who were feminists at the\h\h

257
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:18,800
beginning back then when it wasn't popular, when\h
people called you names and threw\h\h

258
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,880
things at you and made fun of you, we took the risk\h
of standing up so that women could be liberated.

259
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,800
Men need to take those same risks now so that\h
men and women can be liberated from this horrible\h\h

260
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,920
tyranny of patriarchy which is destroying so many\h
lives and morphs into fascism everywhere you look.\h\h

261
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,990
It's the seeds of fascism.

262
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,040
I love that\hyou're saying liberation because 

263
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,320
again in the book, your father gets in\h
a way liberated when he admits to the\h\h

264
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,800
consequences of his crimes. And the lack of\h
accountability is keeping him stuck in limbo.\h\h

265
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,640
And when he starts writing he's been\h
there 31 years and when he finally admits to what\h\h

266
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,040
he has done, he is transformed\h
to something else.

267
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:22,320
This was so beautiful to read. I was so touched\h
by it because he's actually transformed into Eve\h\h

268
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,120
in a way. It's an absolute beautiful scene\h
that ached in my body as I was reading it.

269
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,760
Can you please speak about this image and\h
how the sincere apology changes not only the one\h\h

270
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,035
receiving it but the one giving it?

271
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:49,280
I don't\hthink there's anything more transformative than owning your misdeeds truly. And really going\hthrough that four-step process that I just quickly\h\h

272
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,760
outlined. There's no one\h
who's done something terrible to somebody else\h\h

273
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,240
who isn't the direct result of it. Their lives\h
have been changed by, it their character has\h\h

274
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,040
been changed by it, their emotions, their spirit,\h
their soul has been changed by it. You don't get\h\h

275
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,960
away with it. When you begin to take\h
responsibility for it, when you begin to process\h\h

276
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,560
it, when you begin to own it, when you begin to\h
really let the person who you've harmed know\h\h

277
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:25,440
that you feel what they feel something amazing\h
begins to release inside you. You get to be free,\h\h

278
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:34,960
you get to be reconnected to the world,\hyou get to come out of, you see it all the time where somebody does\hsomething really horrible to somebody\h\h

279
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,640
and then they go on a path in their lives where\h
they start to do more and more horrible things\h\h

280
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,920
because they're so possessed, they're so\h
occupied by the darkness or by the guilt\h\h

281
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:55,040
or by the plague of what they've done. 
Apologies are just these amazing roots to freedom.\h\h

282
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,200
They give us the possibility of transformation.\h
I don't believe in prisons, I

283
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,200
believe in transformation. I believe we\h
all are part of an evolving kind of human story.\h\h

284
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:19,760
We've all been brought up in racist, sexist
classist patriarchy so we're all contaminated and\h\h

285
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,320
we many of us do terrible things. It just happens.\h
How are we going to create a world where people\h\h

286
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,520
can do bad things and then change and become\h
other kind of people? That's what's most\h\h

287
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,880
interesting to me. I don't want to hold anybody\h
fixed as one permanent mistake for the rest of\h\h

288
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,960
their life or one permanent bad thing. I'm not\h
into vengeance. I think punishment is foolish,\h\h

289
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,800
I think all it does is create more bad things.\h
So what are the mechanisms we're going to create\h\h

290
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,480
that allow people to become other kinds of people?\h
Also so much of what happens to people that\h\h

291
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,520
brings them to prison is class situations, is not\h
having money, is being abused themselves, is being\h\h

292
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,720
abused by racism, So how are we going to\h
cure those things and heal those things so\h\h

293
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,720
that people aren't forced to do bad things? 
Once you begin the apology process and you look at\h\h

294
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,320
what brought you to do those things then you have\h
to address those things so we stop doing them.

295
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,720
As a last question I just want to talk\h
about your dedication in the book to\h\h

296
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,760
all the women still waiting for an apology. 
If we're not talking about the power in\h\h

297
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,480
giving the apology, I want to talk\h
about power in receiving an apology.\h

298
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,760
What is the power in\h
receiving an apology and how did it change you?\h

299
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,840
What I can say is this, I couldn't get\h
my apology from my father because he's dead.\h

300
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,960
So I wanted to see if by writing his apology, it\h
would help me. And maybe by doing that I\h\h

301
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,920
could create a path which might help other women.\h
And the truth of the matter is, if you sit down and\h\h

302
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,120
you climb into your perpetrator and you write a\h
letter from him to yourself, whether it be a woman,\h\h

303
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,680
man, whoever that is. And you really, really do it.
And then you sit with somebody who will help you\h\h

304
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:29,680
with it, because you shouldn't do it alone. Because\h
it's very, very hard emotionally - you can get free!\h\h

305
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,920
It is possible. lt is possible. That's\h
not to say I wanted to take people off the hook\h\h

306
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,360
of their responsibility, but there are cases where\h
you can't get an apology from someone. Either you\h\h

307
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,120
don't know where they are or whether they're dead\h
or you're too scared of them. This exercise\h\h

308
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,720
is a very, very powerful exercise. I've been hearing from different people,\h\h

309
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,120
which is also very moving to me, that they're\h
using the book now with people who are coming\h\h

310
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,480
out of prison to help them begin to write their\h
apologies. And they're using them in women's groups\h\h

311
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,960
like at our our City of Joy which is a sanctuary\h
for recovering women in the Congo and a\h\h

312
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,680
revolutionary center. They're actually doing this\h
exercise as part of the program where women write\h\h

313
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,320
apology letters to themselves. It's been highly\h
successful in women releasing a lot of the toxins\h\h

314
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,205
and rage and that feeling of being occupied by\h
their perpetrator.

315
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:31,505
Thank you so much V.

316
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,639
Thank you so much, such wonderful questions, loved talking\h
to you!

317
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:49,120
I loved your book and I could´ve been talking about it for another hour. Thank you\h
so much for all your hard work, it's appreciated around the world. And thank you\hfor coming to Gothenburg Writers Stage!

318
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:55,840
I love to be in Sweden and my love to all the\h
Swedish people, I'm happy to be here. Thank you!
