00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,720
Hello,

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,520
My name is Lydia Sandgren.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,120
I am a writer and have written a book called collected works,

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,460
Which came very recently, this is my first book.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,020
And I'll read a small piece out of it.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,200
This story is pretty much about young people trying to become adults.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,352
And how they then become adults and try to deal with the life they get.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,440
And get through it in different ways.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,960
The paragraph I will read is about one of the main characters, Martin,

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,920
When he is young and has just taken the student.

11
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
And not really, he has a bit like that,

12
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:57,856
Big dreams that he will become a writer and so he is left alone in Gothenburg.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,800
His best friend Gustav has stuck to France.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,200
And he pulls around and has nothing to do for himself.

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,540
So I'll read a little distance away.

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,320
Then it turned out that the summer that was supposed to be the beginning of everything was mostly about waiting.

17
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
Martin was waiting for letters from France.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
He waited for him to be able to cook.

19
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,016
He was waiting for the admission message from the university.

20
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,856
He was waiting for the post -terminals slavery to begin.

21
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
He was waiting for his salary.

22
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,464
He was waiting for the new issue of BLM.

23
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,328
He waited for it to be autumn, although it was too depressed to admit to himself.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
He was waiting for inspiration.

25
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,420
He was waiting for the postman.

26
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,540
He waited, although he tried not to think about it, for the notice of pattern.

27
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
He was waiting for someone to call but didn't know who.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,248
He probably would have been craving if it wasn't because he had given it to write a novel.

29
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
During high school things had always come in between.

30
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
After the student, he had thought.

31
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Then it's time.

32
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,232
It would be easily autobiographical and sharp.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Shake the old one, wrap all the old cobwebs and crap.

34
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,216
He saw in front of him with a room with floor -to -ceiling and a desk under a large window.

35
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,056
On the desk there was a typewriter and piles of paper,

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,420
and reverse a spinning chair, in black polo shirt and

37
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,980
with growth hair and a cigarette glowing between point and middle finger

38
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,260
Sit Martin Berg.

39
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,360
He started with a story about a man and a woman

40
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,208
At a hotel in Pamplona, vaguely inspired by Wallace.

41
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,328
There was an atmosphere of imminent threats in the hotel room that is quite satisfied with,

42
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
But the dialogue became flabby,

43
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,960
Maybe because he didn't know what his protagonists were trying to say to each other.

44
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,568
Besides, he had never visited Pamplona;
 He had not been further away than Denmark.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,360
He had chosen the city because of its sound of sun -roasted streets, lethargic siesta hours,

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,580
bullfighting and vibrating evening under dusty dark blue skies,

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,920
and he never got rid of the thought

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,480
On what a person who had actually been in Pamplona would say about the text.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,328
Then he was more satisfied with the novel Skansen Kronan at two.

50
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,980
It was more autobiographically held, based on an evening

51
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,320
When Martin was about to get it together with a girl just as her ex went on strike

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,040
Of some Örgryte guys with white jeans.

53
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,220
The girl had taken care of her former boyfriend, who seemed strangely satisfied

54
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,440
In spite of its vigorous nosebleeds,

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,740
and it all ended with Martin and Gustav sharing on a bottle of disgusting sherry

56
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,900
While they saw the sun rise from the hill where they sat.

57
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,380
In that short story he had

58
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,440
got to a kind of chaotic feeling that was quite successful,

59
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,500
And it had also been printed in the school newspaper.

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,660
But it was a short story,

61
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,420
And what was a short story other than a strength test for the inevitable novel.

62
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,420
He had not pondered any intrigue, because he thought it all

63
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,060
would resolve in the meantime.

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,140
And by the way, the intrigue was not the important thing.

65
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
The important thing was,

66
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
Yes, what was the important thing really?

67
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
What did William Wallace really write about?

68
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,904
Everything that happened in the stories did not seem very important.

69
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
That was not what they hung on.

70
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,327
He thought that the intrigue had to be arranged then and wrote what fell him in,

71
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,423
Which mostly consisted of escapades with Gustav during the fall and spring.

72
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:29,311
Martin had provided yourself with the cover name Johan but did not come up with anything that really suited Gustav,

73
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
So far he got hot G.

74
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,640
Johan and G drove around, went to a museum, ignored the student party and

75
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,280
instead climbed some height, where they sat in the grass

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,120
While the sun went down and had philosophical conversation about the meaning of life that extended over several pages.

77
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,520
The phone rang, with Martin just had to write a little more about how G snatched snuff on the attendance set

78
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,780
so that they had to

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,360
just run off hell

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,760
And how they had taken back on the slope below the Kungsladugårdsskolan,

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,820
And how Johan sniffs the first time.
 Which was fun for five minutes

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,880
Before it took its end in a magnificent spya that got some aunts and glow in a general disapproval.

83
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,900
When he didn't know how to continue, he browsed any of Wallace novels

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,860
To see how he had done.

85
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,920
In Patagonia days there was a piece that gave him scams.

86
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,791
The book's main character, the young Bill, had just come to Paris.

87
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,423
He was as determined to succeed as he was hungry, alone and recently rejected.

88
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,287
Bill pulled around on the streets in what Wallace called "the ink malaria fever"

89
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,919
And longed for the desk in the hotel room as much as he feared it.

90
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
And this is how Martin reads then in

91
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,260
William Wallace Book.

92
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,000
"Given how demanding the author's profession is, it may seem strange that it exerts a

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Such attraction to young souls.

94
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,660
No one, not even Bill Bradley,

95
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,340
could fully and firmly imagine ever -inspired at the desk,

96
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,400
pouring out of sources as never -sitting, possessed, feverish, driven forward by forces he did not understand

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,780
and could not control.

98
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,360
No, there was an ever -present doubt.

99
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,180
A balancing on the border of an abyss.

100
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,780
And some evenings they fell asleep at the strip of the depths,

101
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,540
And when you woke up, darkness was the first thing you saw, and you knew:

102
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,900
If I fall now there is no return.

103
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
If I fall now I am lost.

104
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
Few professions attract happiness seekers with such headings:

105
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
It is well gold digging and writing.

106
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Yet they are looking for themselves.

107
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,780
They sit down at a table with paper and pen.
 They are looking within themselves for the first sentence,

108
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,340
The spider -thin fishing line they are going to testify.

109
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,967
They understand how long it will take, what work is in front of them, but still they continue.

110
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
And why?

111
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
To write,

112
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
It is to conquer the world.

113
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
To make it his and herself to God.

114
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,791
In writing you get free access to all rooms, to hearts and souls, and the most sacred;

115
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,095
The unknown is laid for one's feet.

116
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,660
You get a chance at eternity.

117
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,200
To write is to refuse die. ”

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,320
Early when I started writing this, I was determined that it would take place Gothenburg.

119
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,140
A lot because I lived here,

120
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,720
but also because I felt that

121
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,060
There was also not really a good and great Gothenburg depiction.

122
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,600
A writer that I had read a lot of,

123
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,680
And likes a lot, is Hjalmar Söderberg.

124
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,640
And I, like got to know Stockholm,

125
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,580
via Hjalmar Söderberg's novels, so I

126
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,919
Felt someone missing that there was nothing similar with Gothenburg.

127
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,580
And for some reason, which I don't really understand myself completely,

128
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,200
So I had some kind of longing to explore a time that I myself did not know.

129
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,520
It was easier

130
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,360
and I felt freer when I wrote about

131
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,760
A city and time that was just outside my own experience.

132
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,040
I moved here, I was not raised in Gothenburg,

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,840
But I moved here when I was

134
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,240
Teen in the early 21st century.

135
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:26,367
I somehow wanted to rewrite the city that lay right away

136
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,720
in the corner of the eye or just outside the field of view in any way,

137
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,620
and felt freer with it -

138
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,020
To find out and tell you about something that I had not really experienced myself,

139
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,160
than when I tried to write about my own now and my own environments.

140
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,200
I could do that,

141
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,760
It became easier to do anyway,

142
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,300
now at the end,

143
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,120
When it has actually been almost ten years since the book's now.

144
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,000
It takes place in 2012, it is the "now" year, or the contemporary plane.

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,940
It was much easier to write now that I have worked with the text

146
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,440
At the latter part of the writing

147
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,800
for some reason

148
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,080
so it is a bit, when there is distance both to the place

149
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,280
And at the time it is easier to find I think.

150
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,280
My entrance to the psychology profession and my entrance to the literature

151
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,260
- both reading and writing - have been some kind

152
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,140
Knowledge hunger or willingness to understand me why people are as they are.

153
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,260
I am, like curious basically

154
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,860
who we are and how it becomes as it becomes and

155
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,960
what the human life,

156
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,280
What is the conditions we live under and so on.

157
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,860
I had some kind of humanistic entrance you can say

158
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,480
in both writing and in psychology activities.

159
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,220
So i who consider it as litigrana parallel tracks or

160
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,640
two different branches on the same tree perhaps,

161
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
which is in constant dialogue with each other.

162
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,660
I really believe that

163
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,500
reading and writing

164
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,580
Have enriched my clinical work.

165
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,660
That there is a communication

166
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,000
In that direction too.

167
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
But all I do -

168
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,300
both my work as a psychologist and my intellectual work -

169
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,200
to the extent that I am doing it - and my writing and the artistic

170
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,840
revolves around the same issues in any way

171
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,320
and to stand in dialogue with people, to communicate with people and that

172
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,100
put me connection with the outside world and other people

173
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,167
and to try to understand something about

174
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
how it is

175
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
to be that person

176
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,120
And myself too.

177
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,180
It's a little hard to say how I have,

178
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,540
If psychology activities have affected the writing, or if writing has affected

179
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,920
psychology business, without i feel that it somehow

180
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,360
expression for the same desire for knowledge

181
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,600
and willingness to understand and curiosity as I have

182
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,191
Went and been drawn since I was a child in principle.

183
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
One thing I have thought of is

184
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,740
something like Joseph Conrad

185
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,140
says or

186
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,340
writes somewhere that is to

187
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,231
The author owns only half the novel and the other half is the reader's.

188
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
I think

189
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
certain

190
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,880
Some types of books may be easier to as readers

191
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,380
Do something creative with yourself.

192
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,280
For my own part so one of the great

193
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,460
the large stock, and that which also makes reading

194
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,940
is something that I regarded as a lifeliness,

195
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,535
Both to recognize something in myself but also to discover something new.

196
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
To the novel

197
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
lies there and vibrates between

198
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,543
the unknown and the known between one's self

199
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
and the larger world

200
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,400
and that it is at the same time may be some kind of return

201
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,800
And thus also very comforting to read.

202
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,460
At the same time as there is also a kind of discovery journey into something new and unknown.

203
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,900
What it is that makes those as readers be able to get to that kind of creative process,

204
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
As you are, a kind of co -creation

205
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
Where you make your own book.

206
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,920
There are some works that have read about since the late teens,

207
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
Hjalmar Söderberg among other things,

208
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,520
And often I find myself returning to a whole new novel.

209
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,135
I naturally recognize the intrigue and story even though I have often forgotten

210
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
how it ends and so

211
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,780
But depending on where I found myself in life and what entrance I had in the reading

212
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,140
So I think I can discover something new there.

213
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
Maybe there is something that can happen with all books, I actually don't know but

214
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,060
I believe, I some kind of feeling that

215
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,800
this kind of novel that is quite

216
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,400
that depicts development not only

217
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,535
a fragmented state or

218
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,887
a subjective experience

219
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,740
Without a big life process is what it actually follows

220
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,460
from childhood and teens, development and adulthood

221
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,540
And to have children and to lose people and such.

222
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,620
We humans are always in some kind of development

223
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,580
I think it might be easier in some way hook in

224
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,927
himself not one of the story, in a such narrative

225
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
and if

226
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,680
I have succeded

227
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,560
Write something

228
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Like a human being

229
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,983
can one use to make your own story

230
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,287
and do something creative with self

231
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,260
that may be something completely different from that as

232
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,460
I intended to lie there in

233
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,720
or as I myself have thought that I want to try to achieve

234
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,060
Then I'm happy.

235
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,880
If it can get

236
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,920
Brand new novels that arise

237
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,600
with each reading.

238
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,880
Well, that's probably what I might hope for most actually.

239
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,680
Now it is, like finished

240
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,540
now you are not mine anymore now it is after all

241
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
Out in the world

242
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,960
So now you have to do what you want with it.
