1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,740
To die

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,440
is something we all people will do sooner or later.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,220
But sometimes this goes faster than we might have thought.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,300
Sometimes an unlikely event can

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,000
or a bad decision to lead to death.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,720
Today we will look at ten unusual and maybe too

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,940
A little stupid way people have died.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,640
We can start in Sweden in 1771.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,240
The then king of Sweden, Adolf Fredrik,

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Had for some time had problems with their health.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,060
Headaches, migraine attacks, stomach pain and colds that came and went.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,820
And a beautiful day, February 12, 1771

13
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,400
ate the king to death.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,640
Yes, you heard right.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,600
The meal that became his death consisted of sauerkraut,

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,000
Meat, root vegetables, lobster, caviar, Böckling.

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,280
The kind of fish and rinsed everything with champagne.

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,800
But it did not end there because it was also fat day.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,600
So the king finished his meal by eating bran,

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Or hot wall as it was called at that time.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,700
It is when you eat a trout in a deep plate of warm milk.

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,100
Anyway, the king pushed 14 pieces of bran

23
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,980
And a little later in the evening he felt dizzy

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,980
and fell lifeless to the floor.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,960
The big meal had given him a stroke and he

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,860
is now forever known as "the king who ate to death"

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,520
Garry Hoy

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Was a lawyer in Toronto who in 1993 was involved in an accident.

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,120
He worked on the 24th floor of a skyscraper called Toronto

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Dominion Center and Gary was fascinated

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,860
over how large the windows the building had.

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,560
While working there he had come to a small party trick there

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,660
He threw himself at the windows to show how safe and robust they were.

34
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,200
One day July 9, 1993,

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,460
Had the law firm study visit and Garry gave law

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,860
Students a tour and decided to make their party trick

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,060
to impress the students.

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,620
They took the batch, threw themselves against one of the windows,

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,740
But instead of bouncing against the window as usual

40
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,240
So the window loosened from the frame where it was stuck

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:05,040
And Garry went out and fell 24 floors down to his death.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
January 6, 2015 in Taiwan.

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,820
A 32 year old man whose last name was "Hsieh", stepped into an Internet café.

44
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,380
He was a regular customer there and often played for several days in a row.

45
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,640
Employees have said that when he got tired he slept in his chair.

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,620
But this time his visit to the Internet Café would be the last.

47
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,200
Hsieh sat down at a computer and started playing.

48
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,360
He played nonstop for a whole three days.

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,020
After these three days the body was able

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,700
no longer the physical and mental stress.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,440
Without any break for food or sleep.

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,440
And he collapsed over the desk.

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,300
The heart had stopped beating.

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,600
The staff and visitors were completely

55
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,980
Unaware of this and thought he was asleep.

56
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,580
He lay dead on the desk for several hours before one of the staff

57
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,160
Discovered that he did not breathe and brought him to the hospital.

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,480
But it was already too late.

59
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,340
Then we go to France and in 1912.

60
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,940
A man named Franz Reichelt, who was a tailor,

61
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:26,080
had invented something he thought would revolutionize the aviation industry.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,680
He had invented a type of parachute suit.

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,500
It was supposed to act as a normal flight suit, but that it quickly

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,920
could be triggered to be used as a parachute in an emergency.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
It could save life

66
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,200
on pilots whose aircraft suffered any technical error.

67
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,980
February 4th of the 20th century he would demonstrate his invention

68
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,100
Public and the demonstration would be carried out from the Eiffel Tower.

69
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,940
From the beginning he had intended to conduct the test with a doll,

70
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,340
But decided at the last moment to conduct the test itself.

71
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,300
It would seem more convincing, he thought.

72
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,560
So February 4th he climbed up to the Eiffel Tower

73
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,780
First ledge that is about 60 meters above the ground and threw themselves out.

74
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,740
But the suit did not work and Franz

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,380
fell straight down into the ground and died immediately.

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:30,060
In front of audiences and journalists who had gathered on the site.

77
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,600
Tycho

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,800
Brahe was a Danish astronomer who lived late

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,020
during the 16th century and just in the early 17th century.

80
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,640
October 13, 1601 participated

81
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,600
He at a big dinner event in Prague.

82
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,460
According to this story, Tycho drank a lot during this party,

83
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,760
but refused to leave the dinner table to go to the toilet

84
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,860
Because he felt it was rude to leave the table before the party was over.

85
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,800
This made him held from urinating for several hours

86
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,060
And it led to a massive overpowered fermentation in the bladder.

87
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,860
When the party was over he could not urinate properly even though he

88
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,960
really needed, and eleven days after dinner he died

89
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,680
only 54 years old.

90
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
The cause of death may have been urine poisoning

91
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,980
and/or urinary tract infection.

92
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,080
In 1958 happened

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,340
something tragic during a live TV broadcast in Britain where

94
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,620
Gareth Jones, a British actor, was in the middle of a performance

95
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,480
of a play when fate took another turn.

96
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,640
The character of Gareth Jones was playing

97
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,640
In the play, a heart attack suffers.

98
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,760
By an incredible coincidence, Gareth began to feel ill

99
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,820
During the performance and just like the character in the play

100
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,760
So he was also really hit by a heart attack.

101
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,740
His acting colleagues around him and even the audience was impressed

102
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,820
over his convincing way of acting a heart attack.

103
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,940
But pretty soon it became obvious that something was wrong and the broadcast was stopped.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,820
Ambulance was called but it was too late

105
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,360
and Gareth Jones died behind the scenes

106
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,880
A couple of minutes later.

107
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,220
Isadora Duncan,

108
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,260
born 1877 in San Francisco, USA, was a

109
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,280
Well -known dancer who was considered to be the founder of modern dance.

110
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,840
But it was not only her dance that made her known, but also her death.

111
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,980
September 14, 1927, in Nice

112
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,140
In France, she was on her way home after an evening out in town.

113
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,020
She sat as a passenger in her Amilcar

114
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,740
CG SS that she had given the nickname Bugatti.

115
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
A car that had no roof.

116
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,140
That night, IsaDora wore a long scarf of silk and as she sat

117
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,780
There in the car and went, the long scarf blew with the wind behind her.

118
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,380
Somehow the scarf managed to get stuck in one of the rear tires.

119
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,420
She quickly wrapped herself around the deck.

120
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,420
The scarf stretched back and stretched her

121
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:35,920
And with a violent force, she was withdrawn from the open car.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,780
She died immediately.

123
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,240
Can a straw lead to someone's death?

124
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,740
Elena Strasser injured a 60 -year -old retired professional race

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,620
Riders from the UK were involved in an unlikely event.

126
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,160
One day when she was in her home, she held a drink.

127
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,140
The drink was inside a glass jar with screw cap

128
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,200
And with a metal straw therein.

129
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,860
When she was on her way from one room to another room she stumbled

130
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,120
to and fell forward straight down

131
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,120
On the drink she held in her hand.

132
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,080
The straw went in through her one eye and then

133
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:30,540
into the brain which caused her death.

134
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,180
19182i Arizona, USA, was basically man

135
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,060
And his friend out in the desert to shoot cacti.

136
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,480
A little for fun like that.

137
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,880
They used to do this activity together and their goals were the

138
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,360
so -called saguaroaktus that can be up

139
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,300
to twelve meters high and weigh several tons.

140
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:03,040
When David shot one of these cacti, it was broken by ... fell ..

141
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,240
..and crushed him.

142
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,920
Clement

143
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,040
Vallandigham was a lawyer and politician from Dayton

144
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,360
Ohio in the United States during the mid-19th century.

145
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,320
In 1871 he defended a man

146
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,300
named Thomas McGehean, who was accused of murdering a certain empty myrs

147
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,180
by shooting him under a brawl in a bar.

148
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,480
Attorney Clément Defense was based on Tom Myers

149
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,760
had pulled his own weapon from his pocket in an attempt to scare or

150
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,540
injury Thomas, but had happened to shoot himself

151
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,520
unintentionally and happened to kill himself.
 To persuade

152
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,080
The jury about this theory decided Clement to recreate the incident.

153
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,860
He used a weapon that he thought was unloaded and put it in his pocket.

154
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,140
Then he tried to show how he thought Tom Myers had done.

155
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,920
Unfortunately, Clement had chosen a weapon that was charged

156
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,420
and instead of performing a harmless demonstration

157
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,640
Then the weapon was fired and he shot himself in his stomach.

158
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,880
He was taken to hospital immediately, but his injuries

159
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,060
Was too serious and he died the next day.

160
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,220
Ironically gave Clements unfortunate demonstration

161
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,920
the convincing evidence needed by the jury.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,780
They freed Thomas McGehean.
 Convinced that Tom Myers could have been able to

163
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,400
shooting himself in the way Clement had demonstrated.
 His death..

164
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,620
..Tragic as it was, in some way managed to achieve the result he hoped for

165
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,060
in court.

166
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,140
There were ten strange ways people have died.
