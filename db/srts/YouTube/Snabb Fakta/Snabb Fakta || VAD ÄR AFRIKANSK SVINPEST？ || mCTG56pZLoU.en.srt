00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,020
September 6

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,920
In 2023, the first case was discovered by African swine fever in Sweden

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,940
From several dead wild boar found in Fagersta in VÃ¤stmanland County.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,180
An area of just over 1000

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,460
square kilometers have been blocked off and if the infection continues it can

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:31,180
affect food production and have major financial consequences.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,800
But what is African swine plague for something?

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,080
Where does the disease come from and can it

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,340
infect people?

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,960
African swine pest, also known as ASF (African Swine Fever)

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,320
is a viral disease that originally comes from Africa.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,020
The disease mainly affects tam pigs and wild boar and can spread

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,400
between the animals through direct contact or through contaminated items.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,520
What is meant by that is that the virus

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,800
is a very resistant virus that survives long in the environment,

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,760
In stool, in the blood and in flesh from infected animals.

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,200
Although the meat has been frozen,

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,300
African swine fever does not infect humans or other animals,

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:26,140
But as they survive for a long time in the environment, people can be born the infection.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,060
For example, if a person has gone into stool or if a gear

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,440
Have been in contact with body fluids from, for example, an infected wild boar.

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,140
But again, people and others

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,260
Animals cannot get sick from the virus.

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:43,980
But if

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,000
The disease cannot be prevented from spreading within Sweden

26
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,300
would it cause any damage among tame pigs and wild boar

27
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,120
And it would be very expensive to fight.

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,920
Infected animals exhibit a variety of symptoms

29
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,740
such as high fever, loss of appetite.

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,580
Signs of weakness in the body.

31
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,760
For example, the animal may have difficulty standing up.

32
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,560
Vomiting, diarrhea, red or bluish skin,

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,400
Most often around the throne and ears.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,920
The course of the disease may vary but in many cases lead

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,240
That to death within about 5 to 10 days.

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,000
The disease was first discovered among tame pigs

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in Kenya in the early 1900s.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,140
The disease spread was limited within Africa until 1957

39
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,240
When it was reported to be in Lisbon in Portugal.

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,400
After that, the disease spread to Spain and sporadic outbreaks

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,040
happened in France, Belgium and then to other European countries.

42
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,880
During the 1980s

43
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,560
we flush until today by 2023 so have

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,460
Cases of African swine plague were reported for the first time in Sweden.

45
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,660
We do not yet know exactly how the disease has

46
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,780
come here but preventive action

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,200
To prevent further spread of infection has begun.

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,220
On the Swedish Agricultural Agency's website you can read that

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,640
September 11, they decided that all Tam pigs within the infected zone

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,440
would be killed, which is around 50.

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,200
This is, as I said, a preventive measure,

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,920
For the fewer pigs found in the area

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,140
The greater the ability to limit and fight the infection.

54
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,460
At present, there is no effective vaccine against African swine fever.

55
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,420
Research is ongoing to develop one,

56
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,420
But so far, no successful solution has been found.

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,720
The best way to prevent dissemination is through strict hygiene actions,

58
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,600
monitoring and control of animal transport.

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,420
I hope you have learned a little more about what African swine plague is for something.
