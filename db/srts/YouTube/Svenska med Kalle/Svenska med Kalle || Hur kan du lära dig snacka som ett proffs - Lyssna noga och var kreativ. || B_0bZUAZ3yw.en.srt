1
00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:03,545
My suggestion is that you

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,845
Learn Swedish as a photographer

3
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:10,045
Like a documentary filmmaker

4
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:12,205
As an author, as a poet

5
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,525
I will explain a little more how I mean

6
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:20,475
Hello and welcome to Swedish with Kalle

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,960
The movie is texted so turn on the subtitle

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,525
so it becomes easier to understand what I say

9
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:27,525
yes

10
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:30,675
In this movie I want to talk a little about

11
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:33,395
that the language is around us

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,980
continuously

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,860
only we are attentive

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,320
So if we are curious

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,575
And pay attention

16
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:44,960
and notice things

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,020
and think about what is around us

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,000
and what is happening

19
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,765
so can we also learn

20
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:56,040
much more language by thinking about

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,255
What things are called

22
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:01,055
and how to express different things

23
00:01:01,335 --> 00:01:04,555
I think it's a bit like a

24
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:07,785
maybe a writer or a photographer

25
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:11,055
working, they look all the time, they listen all the time

26
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:14,005
They think a little all the time: what is this?

27
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:17,075
What does this tell you?

28
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:20,315
How can you say this?
 how can I

29
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:23,235
Catch this feeling in a poem?

30
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:24,765
And a little so

31
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:28,155
can you think or you can be inspired by

32
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,895
This when you practice Swedish

33
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:34,315
and I do it above all

34
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:37,745
When I work with my Instagram account Swedish with Kalle

35
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,465
for almost always when I walk in town

36
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:43,345
or when I listen to some who talk

37
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:46,195
So I have it in the back of my mind

38
00:01:46,195 --> 00:01:47,845
that I always think a little that

39
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:50,465
How can you say this?

40
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:53,415
Or what is this name?

41
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,500
or there is a broken stick on the ground,

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,920
what expressions are there as

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,275
who uses this?

44
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:04,905
so that there is a concrete situation

45
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:07,535
But then there is also something more abstract

46
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,940
or an expression or a metaphor

47
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,740
As we use in everyday life perhaps

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,400
So then you can connect this concrete situation to

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,440
to one more

50
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:20,475
poetic or metaphorical use of language

51
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:23,475
and we do it all the time in everyday life

52
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:25,745
and I think that

53
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:29,015
If you arouse your curiosity

54
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,975
If you sharpen your attention

55
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,815
So can you learn more Swedish

56
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:35,815
in this way

57
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,905
like only when you sit down at

58
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:41,965
the table in the morning and will

59
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:44,005
eat breakfast

60
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:47,505
What is it really called?
 How do you say this when you take the sandwich and ...

61
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:50,545
For it to the mouth aha ...

62
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,865
one can bring the food to the mouth

63
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:55,135
What is it called when you

64
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:58,075
sets and puts different things on the table

65
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:01,455
What do you do when breakfast is over and you ...

66
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,425
Smits away

67
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,875
Can you all these expressions?

68
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,525
How do you say in your language?

69
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:11,405
What expressions exist in Swedish that express the same thing?

70
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,635
When you go out the door

71
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,745
and you are looking up at the sky

72
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:17,400
and the sun shines brightly

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,860
What synonyms are there for that?

74
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,840
What expressions do we use?

75
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,520
or when you get to school or work

76
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,140
and you are a little delayed

77
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,400
and you feel a little stressed

78
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:31,765
and the heart beats a little fast

79
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,940
How can you say that?

80
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,280
Yes you can say that the heart is pounding

81
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,540
or you feel a little stressed

82
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:42,825
you open the door fast, you

83
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,965
rushes you in

84
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:48,135
Yes you know, you can find as much as possible

85
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,145
and if you think about your own language

86
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,505
How to use ordinary verbs

87
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:57,265
In more metaphorical expressions

88
00:03:57,355 --> 00:04:00,085
How to use different adjectives

89
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:03,455
to perhaps describe feelings or

90
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:06,325
the atmosphere in a room or

91
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,395
How the weather is or something like that

92
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:12,435
The clouds in the sky were dark

93
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:15,915
they threatened up threateningly

94
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,060
I mean it doesn't say in the sky when you go out through the door

95
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,640
and

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,800
Looking at the sky and thinking: Oh, it may start to rain today

97
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,995
So it doesn't stand in the sky the expression

98
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,065
"The clouds are threateningly threatening in the sky"

99
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:34,115
But if you are curious then you can start to become more attentive

100
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:37,105
* for* on when people use

101
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,875
More advanced language

102
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,695
And when you see it in books, but you can also ask

103
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:45,775
What are there to express that

104
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:48,575
say that it will soon start raining

105
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:51,515
What are there for different phrases and sentences

106
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:54,115
You can use when it's hot?

107
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:56,555
Great hot so it feels hard

108
00:04:57,335 --> 00:05:00,225
This I think is a little more creative

109
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,255
attitude to learning language

110
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:05,485
and it requires you to think

111
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,645
and reflects and is curious

112
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,495
and looking for the language and

113
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:13,395
finds a joy in finding

114
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:16,275
More words, more expressions

115
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:17,985
null

116
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,840
Sometimes turn on that:

117
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,280
"It's so hard that there are so many words"

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,360
for one must learn so many words and expressions

119
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
It may feel really busy

120
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,015
But that is also the one that is

121
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:31,015
the wealth of language

122
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,500
That's what makes the language so rich

123
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,360
that we have so many different ways of saying things at

124
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,140
To describe exactly what we want to say

125
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,485
so you could say that you

126
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:45,175
cultivates its curiosity

127
00:05:45,175 --> 00:05:48,195
just as you grow plants or you grow a fruit tree

128
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:51,135
you make it grow and then comes the fruit

129
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,935
then will it you can eat

130
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:56,125
so can you cultivate your curiosity

131
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,515
You can make your curiosity grow

132
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,075
and it will help you to

133
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:03,625
learn more language

134
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,665
and it will make it more fun to learn the language

135
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:10,445
So that's my little tip today

136
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:12,060
cultivate your curiosity

137
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,480
Open your eyes and ears

138
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,420
And think about "how do you say that?"

139
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,480
what is it called?

140
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,680
How can one express such a thing?

141
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,835
What metaphors are there?

142
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:28,095
If we take this simple situation

143
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,065
can one use it in any other way

144
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,115
To describe something more abstract

145
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:34,585
Or emotionally

146
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:36,285
yes

147
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:39,775
It was this "tip"

148
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:43,085
Feel free to comment, do you already do this?

149
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:44,085
how do you do?

150
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
How do you think about this?

151
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,580
To learn language

152
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,200
In a more imaginative and creative way

153
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:54,285
I would like to hear your comments

154
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:55,825
or if you have questions

155
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:57,825
So.

156
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:01,305
It was it hope you have a good

157
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:04,645
creative language day and so we'll see and hear again soon

158
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,585
Have a good time so long, hello hey
