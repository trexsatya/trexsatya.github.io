00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:01,275
Hello

2
00:00:01,915 --> 00:00:04,505
i got one so ba ask

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,605
As I want to try to answer

4
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:10,595
The question is: How can I take

5
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:13,585
better notes on the lesson

6
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:16,575
when the teacher talks

7
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:18,745
It was Farhia who asked that

8
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,185
and I think that is a very good question indeed

9
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:23,745
and

10
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:27,705
I was going to link that question to

11
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,115
the words

12
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:32,925
objectively and subjectively

13
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:35,865
So I want to discuss the words objectively

14
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:38,805
And subjectively little

15
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,815
and connect it to what you are looking for

16
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:44,865
When you listen to a lesson

17
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,235
what you should record and

18
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:50,575
what to focus

19
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:52,585
and concentrate on

20
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:54,905
null

21
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:59,475
If I should explain those words a little neighbor then

22
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,355
so are

23
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,785
What is objective is

24
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:06,955
not dependent on your

25
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:09,115
Opinions and feelings

26
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:12,005
so

27
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:15,675
We take a simple fact that

28
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,315
Sweden is in Europe

29
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:21,555
It's just true, they don't matter

30
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:24,475
what you think or feel

31
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:27,455
It is so that Sweden is in Europe

32
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:30,445
It's just one

33
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:32,485
Definition of the word Europe

34
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:35,915
and you cannot influence it

35
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:38,795
It doesn't matter how it feels

36
00:01:38,795 --> 00:01:40,455
or what you think

37
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:43,815
So it is objective that Sweden is in Europe

38
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:47,175
But for example, a valuation that

39
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,105
it is good

40
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:52,185
that Stefan LÃ¶fven is prime minister

41
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,185
in Sweden

42
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:56,225
It is a question that is subjective

43
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:59,215
If you think it's good or you think it's bad

44
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:01,395
it is connected

45
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:04,415
with your values, with your political

46
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,275
opinions and securely with your

47
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,945
Emotions too

48
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:11,995
so there is nothing where one can say that

49
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:15,445
It is obviously right or wrong, true or false

50
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:18,535
Without it more about opinions and feelings

51
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:21,535
it is subjective, the subjective

52
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:24,585
is connected to you and yourself

53
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:27,595
Okay, so what does this have to do

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,280
with how to record on the lesson

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,620
Well, I think like this

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,480
the best way to study a language

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,400
And the best way I believe

58
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,800
to go to school

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,120
is to all the time

60
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,080
be active

61
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,625
and search for what you need

62
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,605
Look for the words and look for that grammar

63
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:56,395
And look

64
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,875
After the expressions and the phrases

65
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:02,865
And the sentences

66
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:05,915
and the material, the texts

67
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:08,995
As you need right now

68
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:11,725
not to passively wait for a teacher

69
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,355
or that someone else should tell you

70
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:17,575
that you should learn this or you should learn this

71
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:21,065
without you constantly trying

72
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:23,435
drive your process

73
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:24,975
that you try

74
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,145
sit in the driver's seat

75
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,955
If you say in Swedish, it is you who control

76
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:33,345
It is you who gas and brakes

77
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:36,135
and holds the steering wheel, and you use

78
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:39,245
your teacher and your textbook and your

79
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:42,075
your study supervisors

80
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:45,205
your classmates for help

81
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,345
And guidance

82
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:49,775
they are a support and they help you find

83
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,275
the right path but that you are always active

84
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:56,055
And yourself is trying

85
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:59,065
have the initiative

86
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:02,005
to study independently

87
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:05,465
I see it as you are looking for

88
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:08,585
the language you need, you are looking for it

89
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:10,555
You are like hunting

90
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:14,215
you are active and attentive

91
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,955
and focused, on Swedish there is an expression

92
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:18,945
on the toes

93
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,325
and that means, during a lesson

94
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,515
that when the teacher takes up things that you know

95
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,395
That you need

96
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:31,165
or you know that you are interested in

97
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,455
You know it's something hard for you

98
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:37,635
or you know it is something that is important

99
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,565
for you to teach you

100
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,525
Then you are focused on it

101
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:45,915
Then you understand that aha this is important

102
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:48,595
the hot here I will write down

103
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,355
for

104
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:52,935
You can't learn everything at once

105
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:56,405
and you can't concentrate

106
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:59,925
focus, on everything at the same time

107
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,965
so you become a more effective

108
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:07,215
Student or students or language teachers

109
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,635
if you choose

110
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:12,535
what you focus on

111
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:16,065
So the teacher speaks, the teacher writes down different things

112
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,105
and you all the time

113
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:22,005
chasing for what you need right now

114
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:24,135
that is important to you

115
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:27,715
and that's what you also choose to write down

116
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:31,605
in the first place, because you may not be able to

117
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,935
Make a note of everything, you

118
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:38,045
Don't have time, you are not fast enough

119
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:41,345
and it's not meaningful either, because if you just copy

120
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:42,765
Everything the teacher says

121
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:46,215
so you probably won't catch

122
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:49,205
and be able to read all that, but it is better

123
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:51,665
to choose some things

124
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:54,805
maybe just a few support words, some

125
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,855
central important words or

126
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:01,135
some important examples that the teacher takes up

127
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,245
They are you writing down

128
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:05,505
They study at home yourself

129
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:08,765
and then you try to remember the other

130
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:11,465
You are trying to activate the knowledge

131
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:14,405
the subject or content

132
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:17,435
as the teacher discussed by the fact that

133
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:20,395
Look at your notes

134
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:23,405
where you have the most important

135
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,135
one might call it support words

136
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:28,715
Yes exactly

137
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:31,785
So there I think you have the structure, the important thing is to

138
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:34,775
work on understanding what is important to you

139
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:37,685
and then find an effective way to

140
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:40,705
Write it down so that after the lesson

141
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,705
can remember, what it was

142
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,555
you thought were important

143
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:47,445
null

144
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:50,995
and here we will eventually come back to this with

145
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:53,425
objectively and subjectively

146
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:57,175
Because if we take it objective, it is in some way easier

147
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:01,025
There are some things that are

148
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:03,425
important if you want

149
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:06,425
Speak and write good Swedish so that others

150
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,535
Understands you, such as word order

151
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:13,005
so to have a good order

152
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:15,955
is important, you cannot

153
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:18,805
choose or select it

154
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,165
Do you want to be good in Swedish

155
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:23,600
Then the order is important to you

156
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,720
However, you may not be able to learn everything at once

157
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,115
So if you are fairly new in the language then the most important

158
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:33,245
That you learn to understand where is the subject?

159
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,905
Where is the verb?
 where is the item =

160
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:39,375
in a common sense.
 When you become at a higher level

161
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:42,335
Then it starts to become important to understand

162
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,925
where to place not

163
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:47,125
How you build a bye

164
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:50,675
How to make different types of more

165
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:53,745
special sentences and then you should focus on it

166
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:57,165
and thus record it when the teacher takes it up

167
00:07:57,735 --> 00:08:00,325
But word sequence is objectively important

168
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,145
you can't cheat with it, it's the same with

169
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,955
to bend verbs in different times

170
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:09,365
It is the same with bending nouns for example

171
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:13,115
so there is the objective part

172
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:16,075
grammar and most

173
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:18,975
common words, you just need them

174
00:08:19,205 --> 00:08:22,015
It's just about to

175
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,315
try to learn just in a lot at a time

176
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:28,025
and try to understand what is basic

177
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:31,185
As you need to be sure first

178
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:34,365
and what is more advanced, as you can wait for

179
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:37,735
wait with;
 So it's all about

180
00:08:37,735 --> 00:08:40,355
Understand;
 What level am I at?

181
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:43,075
What should I focus on?

182
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:45,235
What should I prioritize?

183
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,125
So what should I choose?

184
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:51,235
It is the objective, it is about self -insight

185
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:54,835
Then you can also choose what to note

186
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,415
and what to repeat

187
00:08:57,165 --> 00:09:00,005
the second, the subjective

188
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:03,235
It's more about your feelings and your interests

189
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:06,045
and what makes you curious

190
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,005
and gets energy and feel enthusiasm

191
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:12,005
over learning the language

192
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:14,725
For example, for me it could be to learn me slang

193
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:17,695
I love slang, so that if I

194
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:20,295
had a teacher

195
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:23,225
For example, in Somali, then I would be careful

196
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:25,445
by writing up all the hose expressions

197
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:28,045
As that teacher taught

198
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:31,565
If they do

199
00:09:31,565 --> 00:09:34,645
for it may not be important for everyone, but for me it would be important

200
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,765
because I think it's funny

201
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,765
and it gives me some extra energy to learn

202
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,495
the language and it is fun to use it

203
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:44,685
When talking to other people

204
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:48,585
another area for me personally could be

205
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,475
I would like to be able to talk about music

206
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:54,725
In a new language because I am interested in music

207
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:57,685
and then all the words that deal with it

208
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:00,445
important, for another person may not

209
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:03,335
is so important, they don't want to talk about music

210
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:06,005
they are not interested in it, there is something

211
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,045
they would not prioritize

212
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:12,145
for another person maybe it is politics

213
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,285
or a very academic language

214
00:10:14,695 --> 00:10:17,675
For another person it may be the everyday language

215
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:20,515
that is the most important thing, to be able to do well

216
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:23,635
in ordinary situations, but again

217
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:26,675
It is about having self -insight

218
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:29,825
To know: Who am I?
 What do I want?

219
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:32,865
What do I want to be able to do?
 What do I want to say?

220
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:36,165
What conversations do I want to be able to participate in?

221
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,445
What do I want to be able to read and understand and so on?

222
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:42,545
and what makes me go on

223
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:45,685
that I get energy

224
00:10:45,685 --> 00:10:48,060
that I get peppered

225
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,500
that I become enthusiastic and that

226
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:53,785
bring it with them when you are on a lesson

227
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,755
Wait a bit, now it's something extra exciting here

228
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:59,455
now i'm not going to sleep

229
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,395
those things the teacher writes at the far end of the edge of the board

230
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,795
that may be just a little extra

231
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:07,475
they are important to me now so they write up

232
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,245
and they learn so

233
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:12,425
The goal awareness is

234
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:15,285
The key to everything

235
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:17,560
that you have clear goals

236
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,215
Both big goals

237
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:23,105
and more specific goals

238
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,555
and that you are aiming and focusing on them

239
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:29,005
on a lesson, so I think

240
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:31,935
that one will learn and do well

241
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:34,805
Notes, because if you know what you want

242
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:37,805
and what you need, so you will

243
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,605
find a way to get it

244
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:43,625
to remember that, that

245
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,395
insure yourself

246
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,625
that you remember the most important thing for you during a lesson

247
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,625
Yes

248
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:53,685
This was my answer to the question

249
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:56,275
How can you be better at noting

250
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,375
on a lesson

251
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:00,885
Feel free to ask if I

252
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:03,895
told something strange or used some

253
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:04,895
difficult words

254
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,575
And please react

255
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:13,445
on what I say, whether you agree or disagree

256
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:15,945
or tell me how you do

257
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:21,055
In order to take advantage of teaching in the best way

258
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:23,145
Yes

259
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:27,325
One tip is to follow me on Instagram as well

260
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:30,585
I do pretty much there "Swedish with Kalle"

261
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,845
called the account, it's just searching

262
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:36,425
Right now I'm talking a lot about how to get in touch

263
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:38,015
with people

264
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:41,635
But I make posts about everything possible

265
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,845
grammar, words, culture

266
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,045
Lots of different things

267
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:51,025
So feel free to keep up there too and so I hope

268
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:53,375
to see you again soon

269
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:55,285
farewell

270
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:56,595
bye
