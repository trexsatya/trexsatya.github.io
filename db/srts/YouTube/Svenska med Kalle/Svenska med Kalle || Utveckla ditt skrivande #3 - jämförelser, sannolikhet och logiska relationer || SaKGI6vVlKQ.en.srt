00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:02,185
Hello Hello

2
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:05,565
Hope you have a good Sunday

3
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:09,385
and I was going to keep talking a little

4
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:12,435
about writing and how you can think

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:15,285
about writing, how you can develop

6
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:16,585
your writing

7
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:20,235
how you can practice writing and what you

8
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:22,545
need to get better at

9
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,405
and what you need to exercise

10
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:28,105
And last

11
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:31,085
The time I talked a little about

12
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:34,315
this with that or

13
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:35,315
My tip can be said to be that

14
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:39,145
preferably do not translate from your own language

15
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:42,085
but it is better

16
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:45,215
to look for expressions in

17
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,175
Swedish texts that you read

18
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,815
so that you are looking

19
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:53,455
by expression you need

20
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:55,195
In order to express you

21
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,325
in Swedish texts

22
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:01,085
And my example in the last movie was place after all

23
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:03,965
and time, so I said it is important

24
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:06,525
to be able to explain or show

25
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,615
in a clear way was

26
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:12,505
something happens and when

27
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,325
something happens and to do it in a good way

28
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,325
so do you need a lot of words and expressions

29
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:21,595
and I believe the best way to

30
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:24,935
learn those expressions are to

31
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,375
simply read texts and

32
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,265
note

33
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:31,425
When you find good things

34
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,975
that you can use

35
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,465
You can't learn everything

36
00:01:34,815 --> 00:01:38,165
you can't write down or memorize everything

37
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,665
but you can step by step collect

38
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:45,035
on you a toolbox of expression

39
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:46,725
that makes you can

40
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:50,165
Write and express yourself better

41
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:54,045
And I also believe that

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,480
that is good and try

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,460
get a sense of how they

44
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:04,175
Here the expressions are used

45
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:07,185
as well as when fits them

46
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:09,925
What feeling is in them, there is, for example

47
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:12,695
Some expressions like

48
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,725
signaling that you are

49
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:18,685
very sure what you say, or are there some

50
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,625
expression that signals that you believe something

51
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,375
But are not safe and so on

52
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:28,005
In all such words and expressions there are also

53
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,915
a kind of feeling or

54
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:33,585
degrees of

55
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:36,915
whether something is likely or secure

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,380
There are also different degrees of formality

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,840
how officially or how relaxed something is

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,195
and by reading texts and

59
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:51,185
thought a little bit on this so you can develop your

60
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:52,185
feeling for

61
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:54,085
which

62
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:57,325
words and expressions that fit in which

63
00:02:57,325 --> 00:02:59,515
situation and in what type of text

64
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:03,435
All these things are very important we can talk a lot about it

65
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:04,915
but

66
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,555
I'm not afraid to repeat and repeat a little

67
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,585
so this is such a thing

68
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:12,205
that is important to consider

69
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,645
In what context do you write?

70
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:18,165
who are you writing to?
 It affects

71
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:21,355
what words and expressions that fit

72
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:24,685
And last time I talked about time and place

73
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:27,655
Now I was going to talk about some others

74
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,405
things, some other aspects

75
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:32,875
as one can think of

76
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:36,265
and I believe just when you think about

77
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:39,325
to learn language and develop one's language

78
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:42,455
that it is very easy to think a lot about grammar

79
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,575
and grammar is important but

80
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:47,815
that i talked about last time

81
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,940
that had with space and time to do

82
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,455
I would rather call that rather

83
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:56,225
feature

84
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:59,345
and by function I mean: what do you want to express

85
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:02,415
What do you want to say, what do you want

86
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:03,815
do with the language?

87
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:07,025
and I think one should not get stuck in that

88
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,545
think of the language that just grammar

89
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:12,365
Without I think you should go ahead and

90
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:15,545
back between the level function and

91
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:18,305
the level grammar and they are interconnected

92
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,605
with each other too but

93
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:22,705
If you know that

94
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,815
you want to express time in a better way

95
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:30,215
Then you can find the different expressions

96
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:33,625
you need to express time

97
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,175
and

98
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:38,775
Then you have to master the grammar

99
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:41,705
for those expressions, there may be a little difference

100
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:44,605
on if using the expression in the present or past

101
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:47,285
It is difference if you use the expression in

102
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:48,705
plural or singular

103
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,545
and so on

104
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:54,965
But you can't become

105
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:57,965
better at writing just by beating up

106
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,955
Let's say one

107
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:04,285
table with adjectives and so learn

108
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,995
good, better, best - bad, worse, worst

109
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,445
It's like a good start

110
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:12,475
or part of what it is to know a language

111
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:15,275
But then you need to know how

112
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,145
you should use these parts

113
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:21,355
and how you use expressions and how you use words

114
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,965
it's often

115
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:26,145
several words together, it is quite rarely

116
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:28,825
As you can do by just keeping track

117
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:31,835
on a bunch of words alone

118
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:34,615
You have to know what other words they fit together

119
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:37,665
with and how those words

120
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:40,195
in group, in combination

121
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,905
What they mean then, the words, this is very important

122
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:45,345
and

123
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,715
It is a good thing to carry with you when exercising

124
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,625
language that one is not just getting stuck in

125
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:54,365
Words and lonely

126
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:57,805
word grammar without one must also understand

127
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,615
word in a context

128
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,875
Words are often included in some expressions

129
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,665
and then they mean a special thing

130
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,805
and they together in other words

131
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:09,805
so can they mean something completely different

132
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:13,375
And as I said, here I think reading is a big key

133
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,415
to this because then you see how the words are used

134
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:18,395
How does authors use

135
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:22,175
Words when writing, very important points

136
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:26,305
Except for location and time then

137
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:28,865
so can you say a lot of others

138
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,675
things that one needs to be able to do

139
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,435
As one wishes to be able to do

140
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,485
and I brought up three things here that I was going to give

141
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:40,395
Examples of, and this are just examples

142
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:43,405
It is like small tips on what you want to be able to do

143
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:46,205
and what you can look for with some

144
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,815
examples of words and expressions

145
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,845
so one thing you need to be able to do while writing is that is to compare

146
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,245
And value

147
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:55,065
so

148
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:58,195
For example, do you want to be able to say is something equal

149
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,115
or not alike

150
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:03,755
and i wrote up some expressions here, you can say

151
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:06,555
similarly blah blah blah blah

152
00:07:06,845 --> 00:07:09,685
Or, however, ....

153
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:12,155
So something is not the same

154
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:16,055
you also need to be able to value

155
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:18,985
And say for example "in the first place ...."

156
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:20,665
null

157
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,345
So to show that this is important

158
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:24,525
or

159
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:27,085
"It's not as important that ...."

160
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:31,595
and so whatever it is for topic you are talking about

161
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:35,685
You may also need to explain if anything is

162
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:38,365
likely or not likely

163
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,680
So for example, you can write "Probably ..."

164
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,760
or the opposite "it is not likely to ..."

165
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,135
and you need to gather many of these

166
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,015
Express then that allows you to

167
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,720
compare things that are equal and different

168
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,560
evaluate what is important and not so important

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
and what is likely and what is not likely

170
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,860
And how can you say it in different ways in Swedish

171
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,700
Then I wrote causal relationships

172
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,300
in other words

173
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,880
cause and effect

174
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,940
Why does something happen

175
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,840
What makes something else happen

176
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,260
Then, for example, one can say

177
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,140
"due

178
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,640
so this happened '

179
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,980
or "as a result of ...

180
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,100
A so B 'happened

181
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
as a result of

182
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,860
or "These events are related to ..."

183
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,640
and so do you explain what they are up to

184
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:49,105
or

185
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:50,625
“The change

186
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,480
was made possible by .... "

187
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,380
bla bla bla

188
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,400
So this can be said, it's about cause

189
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,225
and the effect and what words and expressions you can

190
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:05,295
use to describe and tell

191
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,525
about it

192
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,360
Then I wrote logical relationships

193
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
logical relationships

194
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,940
logic is more about thinking

195
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:21,215
If you agree with me about 1

196
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,260
So you have to agree with me about 2 too

197
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,860
The two are logically interconnected

198
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,375
And this is important, for example

199
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,655
in debating and argumentative texts where you want to say

200
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:37,735
To the one who reads your text that ....

201
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:41,655
you have to agree with me about this

202
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:45,495
do you do that then you have to agree with me too

203
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:48,595
If this because they are logically interconnected

204
00:09:49,185 --> 00:09:52,245
and i have three examples here, you can say

205
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,660
"of this follows"

206
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,920
So you present an argument first

207
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,220
and then you say “of this argument

208
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,625
follows

209
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:06,215
that something else is true too

210
00:10:07,655 --> 00:10:09,045
or you can say like this

211
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,235
“If this is true

212
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:16,405
so this must be true too

213
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:21,365
or “an consequence

214
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:23,805
of this argument

215
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:25,285
is

216
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:27,485
that ..... "

217
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:30,135
Just that, I had one more here

218
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,600
A pretty good "conclusion will be ...."

219
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,580
“The conclusion is that

220
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:38,975
we have to

221
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,445
give more money to school ”for example

222
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:45,095
so that you have your arguments: 1, 2, 3

223
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,220
how many arguments you now have and then you say that

224
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,900
the conclusion is

225
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,280
Or my conclusion is that ....

226
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,585
so all this I gave examples of now is

227
00:10:58,585 --> 00:11:02,680
Features, so it is "I want to do this"

228
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,900
In my text

229
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,660
What words and expressions can I use

230
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,100
To do it and then the question comes

231
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,095
How exactly does the grammar work

232
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:18,135
For this term, just one example

233
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,255
The last thing I said there: The conclusion will be ....

234
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:24,685
the conclusion - determined form but

235
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,460
My final

236
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,295
yeah when you have mine you say conclusion in indefinite

237
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:33,165
form so that ... it's such a thing

238
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:36,175
is important if you want grammar to be perfect

239
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:39,025
But first you have to know that

240
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,995
you want to tell us about a conclusion, these are the ones you want

241
00:11:41,995 --> 00:11:42,995
do

242
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,300
since the grammar is this

243
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,820
it is the more the last finish to

244
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:52,155
The reader will surely understand

245
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:55,285
And that it should be neat and right and good:

246
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:56,285
null

247
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,415
right

248
00:11:58,655 --> 00:11:59,845
so

249
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:03,935
my tip, my homework now is that

250
00:12:04,145 --> 00:12:05,335
Take a text

251
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,385
look at it

252
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:09,385
how do

253
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:13,395
the writer different things in that text

254
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:16,215
How does the author "place" explain?

255
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,395
How does the writer explain time?

256
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:20,895
How does the author show

257
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:23,025
What he or she thinks is important

258
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,560
How compare

259
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,620
the writer different things and

260
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,865
How to explain the author

261
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:35,835
Causal relationships, why

262
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,885
something happens and how explains the writer

263
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:42,075
logical relationships

264
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,325
So how different things are interconnected

265
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:48,845
When we think about arguments and

266
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,595
conclusions

267
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:52,595
null

268
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:53,595
comment!

269
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
null

270
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,660
Ask, please like if you like the video

271
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,440
and maybe give examples

272
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,615
If you give up and are looking for expression

273
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Can you write examples in a comment

274
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,555
orf ask me if there is something you think seems interesting

275
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:14,845
that you don't really understand

276
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:18,155
It will also be a tip for others who read the comments.

277
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:21,295
Keep in mind that Youtube is also a social media

278
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:24,485
If you comment then others may

279
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:27,515
Get help from your questions and your comments.

280
00:13:28,815 --> 00:13:31,395
and we'll see you again soon

281
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:35,005
Have a good time so long and a good start on next week

282
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:38,235
If you looked at this now on Sunday

283
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,235
Bye!
