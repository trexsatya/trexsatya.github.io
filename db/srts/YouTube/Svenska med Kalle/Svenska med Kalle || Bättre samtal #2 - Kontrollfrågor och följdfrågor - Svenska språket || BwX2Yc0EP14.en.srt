00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,620
Hello Hello

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,280
I hope everything is fine with you

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,100
I was going to do part 2

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,080
In my little series about oral

5
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:13,975
interaction

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:17,805
So how you can work out

7
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,465
To make a call better

8
00:00:21,465 --> 00:00:22,655
so you

9
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:26,365
can get longer and more

10
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:29,165
varied conversations with people

11
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,735
and i think there are some different things you can think about

12
00:00:32,735 --> 00:00:35,615
And work out

13
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,155
To make your calls better

14
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:42,185
and in the last video I talked a little about

15
00:00:42,185 --> 00:00:45,305
To reflect the other person

16
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:47,975
to react to what that person

17
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:51,005
saying so for example say

18
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:54,015
What fun or what a hard

19
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:57,035
such things, ie show that you are

20
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:59,155
Interested, show that you care

21
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:02,135
what the other person is saying

22
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:04,245
react with emotions

23
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:07,545
get involved

24
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,435
in what the other person says

25
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:13,325
another important

26
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,225
And basic thing

27
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:18,835
Thinking I am asking questions

28
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:22,835
so that you ask questions to the other

29
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:23,835
the person

30
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,865
To make that person tell

31
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:29,835
more or to check

32
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:32,635
that you certainly understand what it

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,160
The other person says

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,195
and this is important to

35
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:41,635
talk and for social reasons, to get good calls

36
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,155
Get good contact

37
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,165
in Swedish

38
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:48,685
But it is also important when reading

39
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:51,445
SFI and SAS and high school courses

40
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:54,385
the oral interaction, ie

41
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:57,515
the ability to interact while talking

42
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,695
and create good calls

43
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:04,295
is important to get grades

44
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:07,275
In school too

45
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,485
so there are two different

46
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:11,245
causes or reasons for

47
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:12,765
Why this is important

48
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,965
and yes, ask people then

49
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:20,015
So ask questions, I think there is

50
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,335
maybe two different types of questions

51
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:27,005
and one would then be control issues

52
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:28,995
verify

53
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:32,085
what the other says that you have understood

54
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,895
or that the other understands you too

55
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,175
and the other would be more

56
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:43,385
follow -up questions, ask about

57
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:46,475
More information, ask for

58
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:49,705
that the other person should develop

59
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:53,105
its story or whatever it is

60
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:56,535
thus obtain more information

61
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:59,405
Get more details, help

62
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:01,795
the other to tell more

63
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:05,735
So control questions

64
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:07,325
and follow -up questions

65
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:11,205
and control questions I think can be

66
00:03:11,205 --> 00:03:14,355
Things like "What did you say?"

67
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,340
or what do you mean?"

68
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,120
Or what do you mean by ........

69
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:25,015
It may be a special word or a

70
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:27,055
expressions that you do not understand

71
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:31,255
so you can say, what do you mean by

72
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,255
hm hm hm ;-)

73
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:36,045
What can it be more for control questions

74
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,045
control issues

75
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:39,075
it could be

76
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,615
For example, if someone says a place

77
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:45,775
So you ask, "Ah, is it in Gothenburg?"

78
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:50,715
Because you are not sure about that place.
 *if*

79
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:54,555
Located in Gothenburg, so you ask a yes/no question

80
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:57,195
"Is it in Gothenburg?"

81
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:58,835
or maybe

82
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,435
Was this yesterday?

83
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:04,825
Was this yesterday?

84
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,015
So you check that you understand what time

85
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,725
As the other is talking about

86
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:13,385
or it may be

87
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:17,475
Well, is that your husband?

88
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,955
so that the person

89
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:23,805
Talking about a person and you ask

90
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,225
Yeah this person you are talking about

91
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,935
Is it your man

92
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,695
So if we think about the grammar

93
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:34,685
If there is a lot of yes/no questions

94
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:37,205
Is it in Gothenburg?

95
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:40,215
Was it yesterday?
 Is it your husband?

96
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:43,475
but also questionword issues such as

97
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:46,495
What did you say?
 What do you mean?

98
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:47,915
and so on

99
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,295
right

100
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:53,035
and

101
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:56,305
Because only this is because

102
00:04:56,305 --> 00:04:57,925
verify

103
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:01,355
If you have heard correctly or because

104
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:04,315
get the other to repeat so it is after all

105
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:07,535
Very important to pronounce

106
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:09,855
these little phrases right

107
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:13,985
thus pronounce them with good pronunciation

108
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:16,985
and to be able to say them quickly, not have to think

109
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:19,085
And don't have to

110
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,915
say them very slowly, without just

111
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,135
"what did you say?"

112
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:26,955
“Ah, excuse what did you say?

113
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:29,585
You have to throw them in quickly.

114
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,155
so that the call continues

115
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:35,165
If you have to think or pronounce them slowly

116
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:38,655
or pronounces them so it is difficult to understand them

117
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:42,175
so the conversation will stop

118
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,715
and it will not be as good a call

119
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:48,155
So just simple stuff like "What did you say?"

120
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:49,685
what do you mean?

121
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:53,025
Can you say it again?

122
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:56,035
Such issues are great to work out

123
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:59,005
so that you say them quickly and easily

124
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:02,015
and good without having to think

125
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,015
It will help you very much

126
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:07,325
right

127
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:10,935
and then we had more

128
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,445
Solid questions then

129
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:16,145
And there are a thousand follow -up questions

130
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:20,065
The first step is that you understand approximately

131
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,065
what the person is talking about

132
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,435
And then you can ask for more information

133
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:28,445
or help the other person to

134
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:29,445
develop

135
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,635
what he or she is talking about

136
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,255
so

137
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,715
a way to make this a little easier for oneself

138
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:41,705
that might be to think about

139
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:42,705
person

140
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:45,145
and place and time

141
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:46,745
can we start with

142
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:50,175
so if someone tells you about

143
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:53,645
A person so you can ask for example

144
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:57,245
okay what is working

145
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:59,045
he or she with

146
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:00,395
What does he work with?

147
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,105
Or maybe "what is he doing now?"

148
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,255
To get some more information

149
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:11,475
Sometimes it might be relevant to ask

150
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:12,905
How old is he?

151
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:16,335
or "How old is she?"
 For example, if you

152
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,245
talking about a grandfather or grandmother

153
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,245
Or something like that

154
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:23,505
or someone's parents, it can sometimes be interesting

155
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,655
To ask: How old is he or she?

156
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,045
You might ask: "Where does he live?"

157
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:30,045
Where does she live?

158
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:33,625
such simple stuff that still makes

159
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,385
the conversation continues, someone tells

160
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:40,015
About her mother, you ask, "Where does she live?"

161
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:42,975
it shows that

162
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:45,925
The mother lives in the United States, yeah then

163
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,325
Do you have more things to talk about

164
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:53,605
And there we were in place also a little neighbor but

165
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:56,615
If we think a little more in place then it might be that someone

166
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:59,975
tells: “I was on vacation

167
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:01,295
in Stockholm"

168
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:05,075
Okay, where in Stockholm did you live?

169
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:07,835
So what area

170
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:09,285
so the person can tell you a little more

171
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,635
or you can ask

172
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:15,285
- Was it nice there?
 - Yeah, yes,

173
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:18,165
We walked in the Old Town, it was great

174
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,255
Many old houses.
 So was it nice there?

175
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:24,555
You can also just ask

176
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,585
What did you do there?
 What did you do in Stockholm?

177
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,695
so

178
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:33,015
collect on some simple phrases

179
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:35,965
and questions about location that you can use

180
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:39,065
When someone tells you about a place they have visited

181
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,035
or been on

182
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:44,235
and then the same with time then

183
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,555
If someone tells about their life then you can

184
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,120
ask about

185
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,960
Was this when you lived in Italy

186
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,480
Did this happen in your home country?

187
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:01,785
Was this when you were young?

188
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:05,605
I don't know, maybe it's a little harder but

189
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:08,595
It is possible to find questions that fit in a situation

190
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:12,415
Yes, maybe someone tells them they like

191
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:15,295
to play guitar, then you can ask

192
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:17,145
How long have you been playing guitar?

193
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:20,895
Then maybe the person tells me that "I started when I was a kid"

194
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,785
or my dad taught me playing guitar

195
00:09:23,785 --> 00:09:26,835
When I was seven years old, yes, then you have new

196
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:29,825
things to talk about, you can ask further

197
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,685
The person can tell you more

198
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:35,235
Or maybe more

199
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:37,155
such things as to

200
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:40,845
Well maybe a student to me tells me about

201
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:43,835
his childhood in Somalia and then I can ask

202
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:46,615
Was this when Said Barre

203
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:50,005
Was president?
 - Yeah, that's it ... blah blah blah ...

204
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:53,025
So then comes more story

205
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,605
the person may come to think of new

206
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:57,385
things, it won't be

207
00:09:57,725 --> 00:09:58,785
so

208
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:01,385
A lot of stop

209
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:04,725
one may use one's imagination

210
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:07,865
one may use the knowledge you already have

211
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:11,425
And then you want to get in touch with Swedes

212
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:14,415
So you have the greater chance of finding good questions

213
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:16,795
to spin on

214
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:20,405
If one knows more about the culture

215
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:23,015
know more about the story

216
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:25,815
know more about things that interest people

217
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:28,495
so you have to take it a little step by step

218
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:32,315
But if you talk, for example, with a person like me

219
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,740
that is 40 years (haha 42 years really)

220
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,520
Yes then there are different historical events, both in terms of politics

221
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,365
and society and culture

222
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:42,365
which can

223
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:45,675
be important to me and do you know

224
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:49,055
some such things, so you can ask about them

225
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,960
and it can come in on time then then

226
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:59,215
when something happened in mine or

227
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:00,315
another person's life

228
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:04,635
good to be able to do things like “childhood”

229
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:06,875
youth

230
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,185
When you moved away from home

231
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:12,665
When you started working

232
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:16,155
in thinking about this so there is

233
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:19,495
both a lot of words and phrases

234
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:22,845
and important grammar as yes/no questions

235
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:25,925
and questionnaire issues

236
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,825
so this might be another way to

237
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:33,235
study and

238
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,175
approach grammar

239
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:39,815
by more thinking: “I want to

240
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:42,585
able to talk better,

241
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:45,765
Then I need to be able to ask control questions

242
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:48,715
Then I need this one

243
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:51,045
the grammar “for example

244
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:54,795
able to say "what did you say?"
 and

245
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:57,335
What was the other one now, yes/no questions

246
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:00,175
Is that your man, for example

247
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:05,825
And then we had ... Want to be able to ask about time

248
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,245
Do I need words like childhood, youth,

249
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,135
when you were little

250
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:14,055
When you boo in ....

251
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:16,415
so

252
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:20,815
This could be a study tip

253
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:21,815
Take 30 minutes

254
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,315
and so think in place

255
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:28,415
What questions do I need to be able to ask

256
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,045
about place when I talk to another person

257
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,155
Oh really

258
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:36,565
simply, to get a good call

259
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:39,735
so do you need to be able to control

260
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:40,815
that you have understood

261
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:44,205
and what the other said for something

262
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:45,585
what the other means

263
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:50,215
and you need to be able to ask questions

264
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:52,485
so that the other tells more

265
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:58,245
It can also be good to compare with their own language

266
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,295
What questions, which phrases do you use

267
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:04,245
When you talk to someone in your language

268
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,285
and then try to find similar

269
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,825
or equivalent

270
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:12,365
questions and phrases and small words

271
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:13,675
in Swedish

272
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,075
yeah this is nothing you do in a day

273
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:21,685
It's something you think about and exercise

274
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:24,015
gradually

275
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:26,855
man questions and listens and record a little

276
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,305
When you hear something you can use

277
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,865
And then you test and train

278
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:34,005
and uses many times and

279
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:36,975
So you learn, more and more

280
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,775
And of course we can discuss here

281
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:43,215
you can ask, you can comment

282
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:46,475
you can rewrite

283
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,415
words or phrases you've heard or as you use

284
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:52,825
you can tip each other in the comments

285
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:56,105
So please leave a comment, please ask

286
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:59,525
So I answer

287
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:00,925
When I have time and have time

288
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:04,655
so you may have it so good

289
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:05,655
and we'll see you again soon

290
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:07,515
bye
