00:00:00,725 --> 00:00:01,725
Hello

2
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:05,155
and welcome to Swedish with Kalle

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:10,335
Today you will get a little task from me

4
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:11,905
For this week

5
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:14,325
If you want to understand

6
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:17,405
and I think like this

7
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:19,995
To our brain

8
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:22,635
enjoy having fun

9
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:24,265
And the brain

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,375
So the brain in here I mean

11
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:31,135
enjoy variety and

12
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:32,135
null

13
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:34,425
that you do things in new ways

14
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:37,605
And it's very easy when we ...

15
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,545
... when we study something, to example

16
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:41,545
Swedish

17
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:45,285
that we end up in

18
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:48,485
the same routine all the time

19
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:49,765
that we do the same way

20
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,135
And this is of course very good

21
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,405
also because it means that we

22
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:58,825
not have to think so much without

23
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:02,385
We have our routine we work

24
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:05,315
with our dictionaries with our

25
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,805
Text books with ours

26
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:11,535
apps, websites, whatever it may be

27
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:13,895
and

28
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:17,275
to do the same thing and have a routine

29
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,745
is of course in many ways good

30
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:22,795
But sometimes it can get a bit boring

31
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:25,805
and it could be like we fall asleep a little

32
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:27,985
We make it too much on routine

33
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,345
So my suggestion is that ...

34
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,785
You plan to ...

35
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:36,855
Exercise in a new way this week

36
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:40,385
Think a little about how you usually study ,,,

37
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:42,265
And then so ....

38
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:45,845
Plan in a time to make

39
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,180
in a way you don't usually

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,260
So for example if you read

41
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:53,500
Very many books

42
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:57,605
Try watching a movie on Youtube instead

43
00:01:57,605 --> 00:02:00,225
Or test that

44
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:03,795
Test a new app on a mobile

45
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:06,825
If you work very much digitally test instead to

46
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:10,005
read books or

47
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,795
Try to write by hand

48
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:16,525
If you mostly read

49
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:19,595
And writes

50
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:22,525
so try to listen a lot someday

51
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:25,355
during the week or find an opportunity to

52
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,355
talk

53
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,475
It might be that you go to language cafÃ© or

54
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:33,485
go talk to yourself at home or

55
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:36,525
Record a video just ...

56
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:37,525
just because

57
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:39,595
Feel that you have someone to talk to.

58
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:43,195
But of course it's just the imagination

59
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:46,605
that sets the limit on how you can exercise.

60
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,895
null

61
00:02:50,895 --> 00:02:53,915
Read a magazine

62
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:54,795
magazine about something that interests you

63
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:57,125
borrow a newspaper about fashion or politics

64
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,315
or cars or football

65
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:03,665
Walk around town and ask people about

66
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:05,995
the way to any place

67
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:07,385
buy

68
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,265
nice post-it notes in new colors

69
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,265
and put up at home

70
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,215
in new words

71
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:20,565
You can come up with just about anything

72
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:25,765
Call a friend, decide,

73
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:29,095
Call a friend and decide that you should speak Swedish

74
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:32,095
for five or ten minutes even if

75
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:35,515
The friend does not have Swedish as their mother tongue

76
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,605
It really doesn't matter.

77
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,885
Go into a deal that you don't usually go into

78
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:45,415
and read on the signs and price tags

79
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,215
And everything that is in the store.

80
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,755
maybe ask someone who works there

81
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,565
and bring with you five new words

82
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:57,675
You may only be able to learn

83
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:59,515
some words that really

84
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:02,145
are completely meaningless and as

85
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:05,205
you don't think you have any use of

86
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:06,765
But that are fun to know

87
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:10,365
So simply, schedule some time

88
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:13,555
do something you don't usually do

89
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:16,255
When studying Swedish

90
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,585
Just to give your brain some entertainment

91
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:23,085
and variety and hopefully

92
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:25,205
also something fun to do

93
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:28,075
for it can give you new energy

94
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:30,475
When you study and

95
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:34,065
simply even your routine

96
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,065
becomes more fun when you mix it up

97
00:04:37,065 --> 00:04:39,865
with things you don't

98
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:40,995
usually do

99
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:44,605
This was my tip for today

100
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:48,105
You can always ask about

101
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:51,195
You don't understand anything I say or comment.

102
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:54,695
And please write a comment and tell

103
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,275
What you tested to do this week

104
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:59,235
that you don't usually do.

105
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,865
Thanks so much.
 Have a good one.
 See you again soon.

106
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:03,965
Bye.
