1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You, I say like this: Cheers the brother!
 -

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,192
Cheers, brother!

3
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:05,451
Bowl!
 - Good morning!

4
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:07,773
Good morning!

5
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:10,826
Here's how: Liseberg turns 100 ...

6
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:14,136
... and they celebrate it by running a club carousel.

7
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:15,350
We are here at the premiere.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,873
Today plays Nause, some attractions are open-

9
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:20,447
-It's bars, it's music, it's age limit.

10
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:22,301
We must say this, it's big!

11
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:27,200
For the first time ever, Liseberg opens a nightclub in the area.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,846
You did it powerfully there.

13
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:29,951
We are first in place!

14
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:31,606
Yes!
 - You can fuck that.

15
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:33,390
I have my reporter on site!

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,514
Dududududu!
 - I'm a bit drunk...

17
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:42,957
We should not stick under the chair with taking any unit before or so ...

18
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:44,024
Well but we did.

19
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,912
We have our two friends with us too, the corne and Bissen.

20
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:50,975
They are here as a backup, bodyguard and backpack carrier for Niklas.

21
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,955
We will test Liseberg by nighttime.
 - Yes!

22
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:56,297
What happens at Liseberg at night?
 - What happens?

23
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:57,981
It's DJ's.
 - Is it DJ's?

24
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,374
It's bars.
 - Is it bars?

25
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:01,002
These are attractions.
 - Are these attractions?

26
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:02,987
It's oily lighting.
 - Is it good lighting?

27
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:06,377
These are good dancers.
 - Is it good looking ... dancers?

28
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:08,314
And we're here.
 - We are here!

29
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,617
We'll test everything.
 Liseberg by night!

30
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:13,428
Bowl.
 Here we go!

31
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:22,502
We went in there.

32
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:28,220
And getting in here at night is almost a bit like Halloween at Liseberg though more alcohol.

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,650
And do you know what the fun is?
 Basketball and stuff is open!

34
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,331
Please, can't we drive one before?
 I promise I put it!

35
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:39,322
I promise.
 One just.
 - We run a match then.

36
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:43,136
We are going to go Valkyria now we thought but, damn.
 I got so hungry.

37
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:47,625
I don't have my glasses.
 - Neither do I, so we have the same handicap.

38
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,067
Disability?

39
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,628
So you mean that those who have poor vision have a handicap?
 - Yes, of course they have.

40
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,140
I almost put it in the other!

41
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,806
Damn!

42
00:02:03,806 --> 00:02:06,799
You start Lucas, you start!
 - No you start now.

43
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,591
Okay, are you with?
 - Ahh.

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,984
OOOH!

45
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,606
Woaaah!
 - So yeah!

46
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,560
King!

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,553
I put it!
 - King!

48
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:22,888
Damn!

49
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:25,167
I get to test again then.
 - May I take a picture with you?

50
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,737
Sorry, we are filming now so I promise we will do it afterwards!

51
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:31,354
In a little while, I promise.

52
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,398
Woooah!

53
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:39,307
Eyyy!

54
00:02:39,307 --> 00:02:42,595
Damn what king!
 Though I was first.

55
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,537
She asked: I'm from Borås!
 And I asked: Borås is najs, check now!

56
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:48,050
Hahaha!

57
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,860
Damn!
 - Ah we're pulling now!

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,488
Oh Lord fucking!

59
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:53,388
We have gone Valkyria before, but ...

60
00:02:53,388 --> 00:02:56,310
It's kind of three years ago.
 - Oh my God!

61
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,851
This will be fun!

62
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:00,499
Niklas, you don't understand what you have done.

63
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:02,162
Are you kidding?!

64
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:03,779
Aah!

65
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,469
Are you kidding me?!
 - Niklas!

66
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:11,763
I can not see anything!

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,741
It's so damn najs!

68
00:03:22,741 --> 00:03:24,816
Damn what it is!

69
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,560
It's so good huh?

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,922
Damn what wet and moisture and ...

71
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:32,348
It was Valkyria, now we are going to Loke.
 I never went it.

72
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:35,715
Of all the attractions at Liseberg, Loke is my favorite.

73
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,013
Spin back and forth, wonderful.

74
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:41,403
"Put your hands up in the air, put your hands up!"
 - Why am I so dad?

75
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:43,843
Up with your hand!

76
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:46,377
Oh damn!

77
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:01,992
My God what fun!

78
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,052
This is a big favorite.

79
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:09,008
My God what good it is.

80
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:11,389
You should not drink lots of beer and go this one.

81
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:14,173
Or that's what you should ...

82
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,715
So that's what it looks like!

83
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:21,655
In the middle of Liseberg at half past twelve one Friday night.

84
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:23,827
When they open club carousel.

85
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:26,566
You can do whatever you want!
 You can ride a carousel!

86
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,562
You can beat with a club!

87
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:32,010
Right on such a stick.

88
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,391
Yes ... you can do anything!

89
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:38,031
Now that we are still on the move, we thought we had to go Colorado.

90
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:40,778
Because it is open too and it is also a personal favorite.

91
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:43,893
You know what?
 How spinning I got off this floor.

92
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:45,285
Well, don't look at it!

93
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,930
It spins ... Don't you get spicy?

94
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,007
Now he pulls with our equipment.

95
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,637
May I take a selfie with you?
 - Yes turned ... we'll go on now.

96
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:54,673
But my God, damn what it spins.

97
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:57,971
This will be fun!
 There will be such a ray like that.

98
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,221
In the ear.

99
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:01,113
Oh!

100
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:03,382
!

101
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:06,273
Niklas!
 Oh!

102
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,137
Man Down for Fun!

103
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:14,451
Oh, in the ear too!
 - Right in the ear ...

104
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:16,880
No!
 AAAAAH!

105
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,128
Got a ray right in the head,

106
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,541
I got flashback to when I slept over with Grandpa for the first time.

107
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,786
Hahaha!

108
00:05:24,786 --> 00:05:27,322
Other side are you ready?!

109
00:05:27,322 --> 00:05:30,083
Jajaman is only taken!

110
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,601
Eeeeeeey!

111
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:35,339
On the other hand, do you have stake?!

112
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,065
Niklas!
 !

113
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:40,281
No no no!

114
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:46,853
Okay, oh-ah-marmalade, have you heard it?

115
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:50,410
I'm saying oh!
 Ah!
 Marmalade!

116
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,026
Oh ah marmalade!

117
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:55,419
What the hell, no one could ...

118
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,392
Haven't you heard it?

119
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:03,778
Oh ah marmalade?

120
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:09,334
Oh!
 Ah!
 Cheese with jam I said oh ah cheese with jam!

121
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,770
Yeah!

122
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,497
Now we have gone Colorado, now it is time for the guest.

123
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:17,647
It is starting to flow people now, there is full chaos in the park.

124
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:19,154
But it is organized chaos.

125
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:21,462
Now we're going to go the guest, then it's time for some bars ...

126
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,429
It's Nause on Main Stage ...

127
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:25,518
This is going to be as fat.

128
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,275
Welcome to Hotel Gasten ...

129
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:29,817
AAAAAH!

130
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,789
After all, they have a double end!

131
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:38,056
Hellskotta!
 Prosit!

132
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:41,503
Aaaah!
 Stop!

133
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:43,364
Niklas ....

134
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:46,077
Here!
 Did you see?!

135
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:47,913
Stop ... Damn ...

136
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:50,747
This was fun!
 Oh my God.

137
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:52,541
Now it's right out in the nightclub.

138
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:11,477
Okay Niklas, now we are backstage in the louge.

139
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:14,719
Tonight Nause will play so we knock here now.

140
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:17,955
Are we here now, at Nause's home?

141
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:21,048
Tjena Boys!
 - Hey!

142
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:22,487
Is it good?
 - Yes, come in!

143
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,546
Gött, thank you.
 When are you going on?

144
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:26,777
I'll be picked up a quarter.

145
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:29,548
So maybe half, ish.

146
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:35,124
Here is the dance floor, the whole of Liseberg.
 Then there is a balcony here.
 It's not that big balcony?

147
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:39,627
No he should not stand and play there, the sick is that they grill out there.

148
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:42,368
People stand and grill there and pray: Woooh!

149
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:44,563
Then he turns on the pork fillet.

150
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,101
Damn remix of it yes.

151
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,032
Niklas, now it's time.
 He is going on now.

152
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:15,000
There are so many people in here now.
 There are 3 thousand people, there are queues everywhere.

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,589
It's complete chaos.

154
00:08:16,589 --> 00:08:20,841
Wonderfully!
 - I'm getting curious.
 Pucko has a bar over there, should we go away and check?

155
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,980
Ah.
 -Ah.

156
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,994
We go and drink puck.

157
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:29,677
Now we go through all the people.
 Right through the dance floor.

158
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,310
You hear the music, there are octopus everywhere.

159
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,715
Lucas is starting to become impatient.
 He needs a beer, I look at him.

160
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:41,608
May I ask, where do you come from?
 - Gothenburg!
 Gothenburg!
 Torslanda!

161
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,627
Yes, Torslanda.
 You-

162
00:08:43,627 --> 00:08:46,029
How did you end up here?
 - Bus!

163
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,252
What do you say?
 - Bus!
 Bus!

164
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:49,834
Kiss?
 - Yes!

165
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,800
What are they saying?
 - What do you mean "end up here"?

166
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:58,074
Yes Yes!
 Bus!
 Yes Yes!

167
00:08:58,074 --> 00:09:00,859
What good, it is smooth with bus!

168
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:04,237
Fun to see you!
 - Yes the same!

169
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,583
Hello!
 AAAAAAH!

170
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:15,902
I like Latin girls and this is my boyfriend Omar.

171
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,557
Woooo!

172
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,268
EY EY EY!

173
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:28,265
My friend here wants Niklas!

174
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,685
She wants you Niklas!

175
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:33,177

196
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:31,947
Loke was nice, I went with it.

197
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:34,466

Unsaminated?
 Yes but that's good.

204
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:57,319
If you get Rate-A 1 to 10, vase do you like the visitors?

00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,712

215
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,737
This is new Balder Vettu.

216
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:32,121
I have an important issue.

217
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:34,451
Are you having fun?
 - Great fun!

218
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:38,277
It is asnajs, I have traveled everything you can go besides Balder.

219
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:43,822

 So something that is sickly important is that Carl has fun tonight.

220
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:51,746
So, play on puck, run ping pong, the sister fight ... I fucking won!

221
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:55,421
Can I ask a question?
 What happened to your shoes?

222
00:11:55,421 --> 00:12:00,037
They hang out here!
 - You check out, they hang out here!

225
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:18,771
Wonderful Niklas, everyone is married.
 Everyone is married at Liseberg!

226
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,754
Here comes Lucas, he is a live reporter in place.

227
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:28,067
Have you tested Pucko split?

228
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,241
!
 - Have you tested the Pucko split?

229
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:34,422
It's a drink, pucko split ...

230
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:38,037
Okay, I'll take one!
 - Yes you should taste ...

231
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,831
What did you think?
 - It's so damn good!

232
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,090
Was it good?
 Ah, we test.

233
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,015
This is good!
 - That's good.

234
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,776
Really good, really good.

235
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:52,597
Bowl!
 - Banana Split.

236
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:55,507
It was ash.
 - Banana Split.

237
00:12:55,507 --> 00:13:00,472
Now people are starting to get really full actually.
 Including ourselves.

238
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:03,634
It's just to ride here, I think.

239
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:07,259
Damn what a dad I am.

240
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:10,295
"It's just to rip with" - ah but what the hell should I say?

241
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,612
Ah but that's the case.
 - Yes, bowl.

242
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:18,532
Damn what good!
 - Yes it was damn good!

243
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:24,588
Yes Calle, how should we summarize so far all evening?

244
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:25,944
So I would say like this:

245
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:31,720
There is no more fun way to spend an evening at Liseberg, everyone likes.

246
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,459
Ride lots of fun attractions, drink adult drink,

247
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,668
Spending time with friends, listening to good music, it's a bit like ... You feel mischievous.

248
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:42,156
Yes ... bus seeds.

249
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,984
Bus-Pelle.
 - You know what?

250
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:47,732
They have churros here, should we test it or?
 - I want a burger or sausage.

251
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:50,983
They have sausages in bread here.
 - Oh what good!

252
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:53,391
Do you want sausage in bread?
 - Hotdog.

253
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,222
Sausage in bread.
 - Sausage with bread, yes.

254
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:58,525
This is not a collaboration.
 Liseberg has just helped us so we can control a good video.

255
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:02,608
Had we not filmed now and I had been with friends I would have had life's evening!

256
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,971
So it feels like a fairy tale!

257
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:06,163
I still have fun, I don't mean that way, but ...

258
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:09,309
Niklas and I said it off cam, this is so damn najs!

259
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,336
Our polishes who are with, Bissen and corne and Tobbe Volstedt, Shoutout to him.

260
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,159
Everyone says this is magical!

261
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,036
It's dream weather, it's late summer, it's September but it's kind of 20 degrees.

262
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:22,117
The clock is kind of one soon.
 So it is asnajs!

263
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:24,973
Now we have tested everything that club carousel has to offer.

264
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:28,855
We have been attractions, we have been drinking grogg and carried.
 - Yes Yes.

265
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:31,268
We have danced, we have talked to people.
 - Yes!

266
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:35,667
We have cooked churros, we have cooked sausages.
 - We have cooked churros, we have chewed sausages.

267
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,933
We have been shredded ...

269
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:44,772
Now we have done it.

270
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:46,618
Liseberg, this was magical.

271
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,885
We give it 10 out of 10 churros.
