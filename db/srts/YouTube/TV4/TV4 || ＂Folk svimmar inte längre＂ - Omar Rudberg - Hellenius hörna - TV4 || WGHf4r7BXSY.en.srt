00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:21,577
Welcome to the corner.
 What a good song.

2
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:23,312
Thanks so much.
 -

3
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:25,814
And you have written it with JubÃ«l.

4
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:28,951
Yes they started writing it, then they called me-

5
00:16:29,084 --> 00:16:31,753
-and said I would try to write a verse-

6
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:33,922
-For they thought I would fit in it.

7
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,425
The guys look happy.

8
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:40,362
I've listened to it a few times.
 It is about any person-

9
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:43,165
-When you can't let go, right?

10
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:48,537
"I can't get you off my mind", we say basic:

11
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:54,376
"I can't get you out of my head."

12
00:16:54,543 --> 00:16:57,245
Is it that you have a lock on a person you want to release?

13
00:16:57,412 --> 00:16:59,414
Or as it is cozy to have left?

14
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:05,153
It is cozy to have left.
 I think.

15
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,893
Before we can move on, I just want to double check.

16
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,329
-Did you get a taxi here?
 -Yes.

17
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:16,665
Did you get food?
 Were you well cared for?

18
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:21,737
-I got very good chocolate.
 -Yes, here we offer.

19
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:26,108
You may know why I want to check out a little neighbor?

20
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:30,145
You are used to being involved in fairly large talk shows.

21
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:34,049
You have been with Jimmy Fallon.

22
00:17:36,652 --> 00:17:40,689
In New York.
 A little more viewers than the corner maybe.

23
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:47,562
What was it like to sit there in such an incredibly large entertainment program?

24
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:50,832
It was among the widest I have done.

25
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:55,003
I lost my vocabulary in English.

26
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:59,941
I barely dared to talk because I thought I would be really Swedish-

27
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:04,513
-and just get stuck.
 So I just: "Edvin, what is it?"

28
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:09,651
-I didn't think was noticed.
 -No, I kept talking.

29
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:16,224
It went okay anyway.
 I had Edvin to lean on.

30
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:21,096
It was fun, because he asked me, "How did your band start?"

31
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:24,132
"Did you start singing in schools?"
 I just yes.

32
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,301
Although it is completely wrong.

33
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:31,206
We did not start in schools at all, but in the Globe with Justin Bieber.

34
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:38,346
-Unbelievable.
 -But I kept quiet ...

35
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:41,483
... because I couldn't explain because I didn't want to get stuck.

36
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:47,689
And then Edvin comes in and just: "No, you started so ..."

37
00:18:47,856 --> 00:18:51,393
What a friend!
 He threw you under the bus.

38
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:55,731
But does that mean you feel safer with me?

39
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:59,134
-Absolutely, you should have that.
 -It is important to build trust.

40
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:05,941
It became some kind of hysteria, not just in the studio-

41
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:12,748
-Or above all backstage.
 We have a clip from this.

42
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:40,208
It may be difficult to explain-

43
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,812
-But what was it like to experience that hysteria?

44
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:50,552
Sick.
 It was like living in some strange Hollywood dream.

45
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:55,724
When you broke through as an artist you have an incredible fanbase.

46
00:19:55,891 --> 00:20:01,496
So they get like crazy.
 Do you ever get used to that?

47
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,102
I think that during the band time, when I was 14-16-

48
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:11,406
-So we had very loud fans.

49
00:20:11,573 --> 00:20:14,109
And at that time you were a little more used to it-

50
00:20:14,242 --> 00:20:16,711
-For you lived in every day.

51
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:21,416
While now, ten years later, things have changed.

52
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,554
Our fans have grown up and we have grown up-

53
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:28,390
-And new fans have come.
 It does not happen as often-

54
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:31,193
-That people faint when they see me at ICA.

55
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:31,226
-That people faint when they see me at ICA.
