1
00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:04,027
It is January 22 and I am in central Stockholm.

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:12,767
In a little while, the biggest demonstration will be organized against vaccines in Sweden's history.

3
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:18,000
The police have urged vaccination clinics to close in the immediate area.

4
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:22,688
We simply see what will happen and how many will show up.

5
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:29,899
Right now an hour before, almost no one demonstrates against the vaccine.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,591
Instead, it is people who demonstrate for something else.

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,874
The idea of the video is to hear people's perspectives and thoughts.

8
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:40,688
I don't believe in a world where we divide ourselves into us and them.

9
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:46,978
I don't think there is any harm to hear people's different perspectives on this and other issues.

10
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:50,298
This is how we, I think, build a democratic society.

11
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:56,040
But there are some others who demonstrate here now and I was going to see what they have to say.

12
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,624
-Why are you here and demonstrate today?

13
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:04,808
-I demonstrate to stop the genocide in the northern part of Ethiopia, Tigray.

14
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:13,307
Tigray is surrounded by Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers.

15
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:21,073
Right now in Tigray there is no electricity, no banking services, no medicine and no water.

16
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:25,135
People die from hunger, especially children.

17
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:29,442
We are here to give voice to the people in Tigray.

18
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:31,319
We want to stop the genocide.

19
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:42,739
-How do you think about the fact that vaccine opponents equate the vaccine with genocide like the Tigray genocide?

20
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:49,192
-Personally, I think it is not possible to compare genocide and vaccine passes.

21
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,627
There are two completely different things.

22
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,844
It is not possible to compare it to genocide as well.

23
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,280
It's not possible.

24
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:00,347
-Now those who demonstrate for Tigray have gone away.

25
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,683
Now people have begun to gather against the vaccine or restrictions we have had.

26
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:11,080
I was going to talk to them because I'm genuinely interested what they have to say.

27
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,634
"We are not slaves" it says, tell you what do you think?

28
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:25,597
-Yes, I think I'm a free living person and I don't want anyone forcing me or my children to vaccinate us.

29
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:31,455
I take vitamin D, vitamin C, selenium and zinc.

30
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:38,549
-Do you think it helps against Covid?
 -Yes, I think it helps against Covid and I exercise a lot.

31
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:40,129
-Okay, thank you very much.

32
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:43,154
-All may weigh the risk of and against.

33
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:47,229
Do I think it helps and what is the risk of taking the vaccine anyway?

34
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:51,918
Is the risk to me greater than getting the disease?
 Yes or no.

35
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:59,241
-As society at large, shouldn't people take the vaccine in solidarity?
 -No I do not think so.
 No.

36
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:08,378
-It is not far from the fact that you start comparing how, for example, you treat people in China where you start building up some type of scoring system.

37
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,620
-Social credits are called it.

38
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,626
-How did it happen that you got involved in this question?

39
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:18,198
-Yes, you can't really avoid it.

40
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,823
It's everywhere as well.

41
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:23,737
-But you are from Norrköping or anything?
 -I am from Linköping.

42
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:30,159
-So you went here today from Linköping then?
 -Yeah, that's right.
 We went bus here the whole gang.

43
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:35,020
-Is it like a small popular movement that you also get to know each other?

44
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,680
-Yes, you have done this on the bus when you talk to others as well as when we feel the same way.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,133
-Do you for the vaccine or?

46
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:54,453
-I am so damn the opposite so there is not.

47
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,305
-But you still have mouth protection?

48
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:02,373
-We are here to demonstrate against their fucking forced vaccination

49
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:05,118
We are against this thing, we are on the same page.

50
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:09,941
We should not start any fucking unrest.
 We're just like you!

51
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:17,008
-What do you think?
 -I think it is obvious that we are starting to get rid of our rights.

52
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:20,818
It will happen soon if we do nothing.

53
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:26,585
Everyone here, shit in where we come from for different political opinions or what we think.

54
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,680
We agree with this issue and it is extremely important.

55
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:35,509
If we do not do anything now, we will just see how we are becoming more and more off with our freedom.

56
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,815
-You mean that the vaccine pass will increase and that vaccine passes will be required to go to the gym.
 What are you thinking?

57
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:44,780
-Yes, they have already talked about introducing it.
 It will be.

58
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,376
-You have the Swedish flag here on you?
 -Yes.

59
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:54,000
-How is it that?
 -No, but it's probably part of Sweden to have freedom to choose.

60
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:56,830
You old you free.

61
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:59,213
-Why are you here today and demonstrate?

62
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:04,760
-No, but it's to stand up for our freedoms and no to the idiotic vaccine pass.

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,103
-So you're not vaccinated yet?
 -No no no.
 It never comes to the question.

64
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:10,587
-Why not?

65
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:15,637
-No, I can't receive anything I don't believe in?

66
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:18,600
Then I should explain myself.

67
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,919
-But how come you don't believe it when billions of people have already taken it?

68
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,317
-Yes, billions!
 Why do I have to be one of them then?

69
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:30,720
-No, you don't have to.
 -No!

70
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:34,331
-How did it happen that you started to get involved in this question?

71
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:39,440
-No, but I started to question very early.

72
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,311
I am always one here.

73
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:50,462
New things come, maybe there are back sides?
 There may be good things about it, but there are also back sides.

74
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:59,167
The information is free to retrieve online and there are many good Youtube channels and other things, but I don't buy everything they say either.

75
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:07,158
I like my own way, but this?
 No, this is another agenda behind.

76
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:11,208
-What do you think about demonstrating and that there are so many people here?
 -Yes, but it's pretty.

77
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:16,980
-But I mean now when it is so high spread?
 -No, it's no spread of infection.

78
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,790
-We get to see how many people get infected today then?
 Maybe you or me!

79
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:24,376
-Yes, I've already had covid.
 -Yes, but you see that is also a thing.

80
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:28,967
If you have already had it, most experts say that then you are protected.

81
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,816
Still, they want to vaccinate!

82
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:40,451
-But how do you think when you say that you vaccinate for society's best to protect the weakest in society?

83
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:46,975
-In risking one's own life as an effort and getting vaccine injury?
 I would not set up and do it to protect someone else.

84
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:53,213
Who would stand up for me?
 I mean my body has many years left to live, I intend to live.

85
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:58,226
I was going to do that and I mean no one would take the vaccine to protect me.

86
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:04,204
So stop, that's just a damn awkward argument simply.

87
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:09,421
No one does anything for anyone else, so it is in society today.

88
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:17,010
-I think this is a little exaggerated, but I still appreciate that people say what they believe in.

89
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,924
-Tjena, Hello!
 -Hey man!

90
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:43,842
-It's on your sign to "the state is the virus", tell me!

91
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,055
-If we are going to live in fear, the state will live by us.

92
00:07:51,552 --> 00:07:55,919
They will suck out our freedom and I'm pretty tired of it!

93
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,595
-The part syringes are graphen oxide in and it is a poison.

94
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,978
It has a connection here so that is why I go with it.

95
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,278
I got it from one so I haven't done it myself.

96
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:12,042
But I got it and now I had to explain how I look at it because it was a little matched what my truth is.

97
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,462
-Why we demonstrate today?
 -Yes, why are you demonstrating?

98
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:19,891
-For human rights and because we do not want the vaccine pass in society.

99
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:27,476
I think it is for a totalitarian society to live in and there is nothing I put up with.

100
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:29,643
There is nothing I want in my society as well.

101
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:33,881
Then I think the story is repeated as it used to be.

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,017
-What do you mean by the story being repeated?

103
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:46,966
-Yes, but I think above all back to Hitler's time on the Juda pass.
 If you look a little at how they are designed, they are quite as designed as the vaccine pass.

104
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:54,562
Then they removed rights for Jews as well as and I do not think we need to repeat and participate in it again.

105
00:08:54,721 --> 00:09:02,734
-If you see it as taking the vaccine is voluntary.
 -Yes, but it's every person's choice.

106
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:12,133
It is a free choice.
 I can't influence you and you can't influence me, but this is just this with the vaccine pass it destroys so much more than the benefit.

107
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,638
Then every human being can do as they please.

108
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:22,572
-But when you draw parallels to the Second World War and the Jews, then the Jews had no choice at all?
 How do you think about it?

109
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:27,390
-No, they had no choice.
 Yes, how to say?

110
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:34,999
No, strike that question.
 I have to think about it, it was a little quickly put there.

111
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:38,704
-I mean you still draw parallels to the Jews?

112
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:43,878
-Yes, but then you do that because what I pull the parallel to is the more what they were not allowed to do.

113
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:49,719
They were not allowed to go to the cinema, theater and meet loved ones if you say so.

114
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:52,955
It's a bit the same with the vaccine pass.

115
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:58,602
That is why I pulled that parallel as well as back to the Jews.

116
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,622
-What do you think is the reason for a vaccine pass?

117
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:13,811
-That is a good question.
 It's control.
 Checking people it feels like and it feels like it's a little too overcrowded.

118
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:16,460
They want a little more control over us.

119
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:23,784
There is no real evidence and evidence, after all, no one emerges and demonstrates real facts as well.

120
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:29,139
If I seek proof then what evidence is that right?

121
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:39,294
There are so many numbers that are manipulated and censored, so it is not possible to find real facts no matter how much I try to search.

122
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,362
Yes, it's hard.
 Very difficult.

123
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,623
-I am not here to demonstrate, but I am here to support the whole movement.

124
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:54,721
We don't want vaccine passes.
 We do not want any coercion and get junk into our arms.

125
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,427
Control, they want full control over the people, I think.

126
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:06,492
-How do you mean that the vaccine controls people or that it is easier to control people who are vaccinated?

127
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:13,335
-Yes, so they can only zip and read, they see who has.

128
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:18,965
It is registered on you, so they have control I think.
 Electronic check.

129
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,568
-Yes, it's Bill Gates.
 -Tell?

130
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:39,796
-Yes, but it's a person who obviously makes huge money in the vaccine industry and propagates for the entire population of the earth to vaccinate.

131
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:43,738
So have you taken it yet?
 Have you received it yet?

132
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:47,740
Have you realized what it is about?

133
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,072
-So you mean that Bill Gates is behind this?

134
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:56,426
-Yes, but he is probably one of those who have earned this.

135
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:57,201
Okay.

136
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:01,912
-"Wake up! The only thing mutating are the lies"?
 -Yes!

137
00:12:01,912 --> 00:12:06,181
-So you don't believe in the Covid-19-Pandemic at all, right?
 -No.
 No.

138
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:11,208
-What is it on your sign?
 -Yes, it says that Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.

139
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:13,879
There should not be a vaccine pass.

140
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:20,465
-So you mean Jesus is against Covid-19 or?
 -Yes, he's against all that.
 It does not come from God.

141
00:12:20,564 --> 00:12:27,004
-Where of it will you think?
 -Covid?
 Yes, from Antichrist.
 The New World Order.

142
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:34,371
-It's about it in the Bible.
 If Corona they have calculated that it is 666.

143
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:42,800
So the covid pass is part of this that they should register and have control.
 You cannot buy or sell if you do not have covid passes.

144
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:48,683
The same is in the Bible, although it says as in other words, but that is the same foundation.

145
00:12:48,862 --> 00:12:53,937
After all, it is about to become this brand that is in the Book of Revelation 13:14.

146
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:59,922
-So you mean that or what do you think about the disease, isn't the disease covid-19 at all?

147
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:08,734
-Yes, Covid-19 there are, after all, they have made up in some way to be able to shoot in people lots of syringes, so-called vaccine.

148
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:16,289
-But what do you think is the reason, why do you think you have vaccinated so many people and urge people to vaccinate?

149
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,382
-For they want to reduce the population.

150
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,078
The world order wants control and reduce the population.

151
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:29,139
-So you mean it's a poison?
 -Yes, after all, it is made of graph oxide according to doctors and researchers that I have looked at.

152
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:32,340
-What doctors are it?
 -Yes, now I can't the names of them.

153
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:37,908
-I just thought of other Christians might claim to take the vaccine in solidarity with those who are weak in society?

154
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:41,703
-Yes, there are some Christians and I don't buy that.

155
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:45,302
No, so we Christians between us there are slightly different sentences there.

156
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,499
-Why are you here and demonstrate today?
 -To that the whole fucking world is corrupt.
 It's much more than just vaccine passes.

157
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:57,110
-Do you on the Covid-19-Pandemic?
 -It's scam!

158
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:00,277
-How?
 -How?
 Money!

159
00:14:00,436 --> 00:14:04,260
-The medicine companies or?
 -Yes, Big Pharma.

160
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:08,373
-Big Pharma, Big Tech, Big Corporations.
 Everything!

161
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,765
-But the vaccine you don't think work at all, right?
 -No, that's a damn shit.

162
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:19,537
It's money behind everything.
 Control and money.

163
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:27,350
-Is something more you want to develop?
 -No, it will probably take a year to develop it as much as I have researched and know.

164
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:33,976
I know who those people are.
 Bill Gates and Horungarna who are on and fucking us straight up and down.

165
00:14:34,075 --> 00:14:42,617
-Where have you done that research on Bill Gates and so?
 -Telegram.
 A damn good app.

166
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:51,114
There it is not censored as it is done on Twitter, Facebook and other places like Youtube.

167
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:56,394
I'm pissed!

168
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,794
I'm not so damned at them anymore.

169
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:03,880
I am more pissed off at the sleeping bastards.

170
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:14,671
On the idiots who do not understand what was sealed.
 I am angry with them!

171
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:17,307
It's stupid fucking sheep!

172
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:19,291
-Which follows the current as well, right?
 -Yes.

173
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:26,956
-The they call me a conspiracy theory, right -wing extremist and Nazi and everything even though they are the Nazis!

174
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:31,659
-What I've read and heard, I don't trust the vaccines at all.

175
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:38,141
I also have some underlying diseases that I am more afraid of the vaccine than I am too covid.

176
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,467
-You haven't had covid or?
 -No, not what I know.

177
00:15:41,586 --> 00:15:44,434
-But you are not afraid to get covid here today considering that it is so high spread?

178
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,588
-No, I'm not actually.

179
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:52,956
I feel pretty confident in what is anyway.
 I think it's a lot of scare.

180
00:15:53,016 --> 00:16:01,763
Okay, it's a very serious illness anyway for those affected.
 Many people have also died with underlying diseases and that is what I have.

181
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,783
-We have no pandemic, it is only statistics that they themselves have created.

182
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,753
-You mean the virus doesn't exist at all?

183
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:18,989
-There is not Covid-19 in that way.
 It is a common flu or cold which has nothing to do with any virus.

184
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:29,545
It has to do with the body's slag products wanting out of the body on what you have eaten and taken in through water and air throughout the year.

185
00:16:29,545 --> 00:16:40,610
Then when autumn comes and you do not have sun to get vitamin D and vitamin D so the immune system goes down, then all the sick who have a weak immune system will be.

186
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:41,740
Forget viruses!

187
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,634
-Are you here and demonstrate?
 -Yes!
 100%, of course!

188
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:47,808
-I have taken lots and took an extra to give out to someone.

189
00:16:47,947 --> 00:16:50,713
-Do you want one?
 -No, that's good thanks.

190
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:54,532
-What is it on that one then?
 -Here it says "no to vaccine passes".

191
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,101
-Th there is plenty of other text.

192
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:58,967
-It's the Nordic resistance movement too?
 -Yeah!

193
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:06,197
-I took it to release one to any random stranger for vaccine not being compulsory.

194
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:11,042
It should be voluntary and we should not be forced to take the vaccine to go to some places.

195
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:18,556
If we want to go to the cinema, we must vaccinate, but even if we are not vaccinated and want to go to the cinema, we will not.

196
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:28,066
It is to force us to vaccinate ourselves because we feel we want to go to the cinema, but if we want to go to the cinema we have to vaccinate and it will be a requirement then.

197
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:32,317
Because then you have to vaccinate and then go to the cinema.

198
00:17:32,476 --> 00:17:38,609
I want to be able to go to the cinema without vaccinating myself, without feeling that I need to vaccinate in order to go on such stuff.

199
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:41,821
This is not okay how they are doing.
 It is not OK!

200
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,089
We the people have had enough.
 This is definitely not okay anywhere!

201
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,083
I have decided not to vaccinate.

202
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:53,559
If you disagree with it, that's your opinion.
 I don't have the right to listen to your opinion.

203
00:17:53,658 --> 00:18:01,652
I have my own opinion and you can't force me to believe in your opinion because I have decided that I will not vaccinate.

204
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:07,544
You can't push me to vaccinate me because you think I'm a danger.

205
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:11,282
Okay, I'm a danger but we're all in a danger.

206
00:18:11,739 --> 00:18:17,993
What I believe in is that we humans are getting more and more, but we only have one earth.

207
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:27,521
I believe that this New World order like Illuminati that controls most of it wants to get down on humanity.

208
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:36,376
But they can't sit and say "unfortunately, but now so many have to die. You have to voluntarily die as well and kind of kill you".
 No, that does not work.

209
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:45,073
Then they are smart to do so in such a way to reduce humanity's population that it does not increase.

210
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:53,964
The thing is what I think is that people want to put in voluntarily or involuntarily their views in others.

211
00:18:54,699 --> 00:19:09,090
There are some who do not want to obey these opinions and those who want to put in these opinions have more power, but we the free peoples have our own choice and our own will.

212
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,005
They want to get rid of us.

213
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:18,819
We are born free!
 We should always be free!
 No one should force us to take anything to limit our freedom.
 No!

214
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:19,401
No!

215
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:28,800
-You have seen these NMRs that have run around a bit and it feels like some are mostly here because it is a large crowd that wants to be incite.

216
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,177
When they arrived here you saw a little.

217
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:35,465
-There are very masked people also with Bengals and stuff.

218
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:43,596
I don't know, it doesn't feel like everyone here to demonstrate against the vaccine pass either.

219
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:49,593
-It feels like everyone is not here on the same agenda, but it feels like some have a different view of this.
 Giants!

220
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:11,057
-Yes to freedom, yes to freedom!

221
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:22,646
-You are one of the last left here now that the demonstration is running out and you stand here with your poster that says "Warning for vaccination pass".

222
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:24,812
Tell me more, what do you think?

223
00:20:24,921 --> 00:20:29,475
I think our freedoms are taken away from us, especially our children.

224
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:37,527
This is probably not just about health, but it is about it being like China dictatorship this feels like.

225
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:42,697
We must stand up now when we can, before it becomes completely dictatorship.

226
00:20:43,054 --> 00:20:47,157
-What do you think about the vaccine, is it toxic or?

227
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:55,384
-This I have heard, that's what it doesn't contain good stuff in it, so it should be voluntary if you want to take it.

228
00:20:55,623 --> 00:21:01,156
They should also say what it is in the vaccine, you have not been told yet.

229
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:11,002
For example, with Pfizer, we may know about 75 years or something that the studies then come about how healthy it is and not.

230
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:12,577
No, I don't believe this.

231
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:15,464
-You haven't vaccinated you either?
 -No.

232
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:22,214
-Why do you think that you vaccinate such a large part of the population if it is now a harmful vaccine?

233
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:31,413
-It may have to do with transhumanism.
 New technology emerges, so there is a lot with vaccine.

234
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:36,991
It is not just that they should make money, but it can be very serious stuff behind, so you have to check it out.

235
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:39,501
-For example, what do you think?

236
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:49,948
-Yes, this with chip and stuff that we should be some kind of download and that you should have the internet in yourself, that you become one with the internet maybe.

237
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,124
I don't know, it sounds really strange but it's ..

238
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:54,733
-That the vaccine contains some kind of chip then you think?

239
00:21:54,872 --> 00:22:02,119
-Yes, but it may be something that makes you hook up and become one in the network since the future.

240
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:11,681
I don't know, but I just feel that I am very skeptical until someone can say what it is in these so I think you should wait.

241
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,894
-I understand.
 Okay, thank you very much!

242
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:15,762
-Yes thank you.
 Hello!
 -Thank you thank you.
 Hello!

243
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:24,155
Now the demonstration is largely over, there are some behind it.
 It is just after five o'clock and it has been on since two o'clock.

244
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:28,514
There were a lot of people.
 There were thousands of people, maybe about 2000-3000 people.

245
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:33,705
Not 20,000 or 18,000 that the organizers might have talked about, but there were still a lot of people.

246
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:38,595
It was difficult to move here at Sergel's square for a while because there were so many people.

247
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,039
I met people who all had in common that they did not like the vaccine.

248
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:53,090
Some were just critical of the vaccine and side effects that you can be or vaccine passes that you do not think it should be an indirect compulsory

249
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,484
-Mean's second hovered more and talked about the New World Order.

250
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:04,455
I also met the Nordic Resistance Movement here that did not want to put up an interview, but there were very different types of people who were here.

251
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:15,386
Others talked about Antichrist who had created the vaccine, so there are a lot of differences in this group of protesters but one thing that unites them.

252
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:23,398
Thank you for watching this video, comment if you have thoughts about this or if you think I should do another video about something.
