00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,462
Are we recording now?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,352
I am looking?

00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:10,386

 Today we are going to run such a Q&A video and now it is so that this intro-

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:14,823
-or last intro sucked, so now I record this on the other camera because I have a little lack of time.

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,720
So now we jump to the other camera and then I run some videos.

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,992
Hello or!

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,000
Today we will run a Q&A, a question video.

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,160
I think we jump right away.

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,080
It's fun.

10
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:36,791
Tjena Marcus.
 I wonder what distinguishes between the A, B and C shares for the same company?

11
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:41,250
Emil.
 Well, the difference between A and B shares is so here-

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,915
-This is the case that when you own an A-share, you have a right to vote.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,128
You have the right to influence the company.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,089
At a general meeting, for example, you get to vote for what you think and think.

15
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:56,449
If you think a company should do si or so.

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
If you have a B share instead, you do not have as strong voting rights.

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
An A-share is usually worth 10 times more than a B share in the form of voting rights.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
Otherwise, the shares are just the same.

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,288
The more shares you have, the greater the impact you can do at the company.

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,945
If you are the main owner you usually have A shares, but if you are a small saver like you and I-

21
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,225
-Then it is usually the case that you drive on the B shares instead.

22
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:32,243
These shares with less voting rights usually have greater turnover on the stock exchange.

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,232
So it is easier to be able to buy and be able to sell them.

24
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,649
Brief answer to your question is that an A-share is worth more than a B share in the form of voting rights.

25
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:45,896
If you are not the main owner of the share, it is unnecessary to even think about it-

26
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:50,382
-And just buy the share that is the cheapest and which has the highest turnover.

27
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:56,703
Should it be a high or low p/e figure?

28
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,640
Earn Elin!
 The P/E figure is an abbreviation of Price shared with Earnings.

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,737
Thus, the share price shared with the profit per share.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,770
These two key figures.
 How much does the share cost and how much does the company earn in profit per share?

31
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:15,820
Then you get the p/e figure.

32
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,828
If a share costs SEK 5 and the profit per share is 1 kr-

33
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:27,325
-Then it takes 5 years for the company to earn the profit to which the company or share is valued.

34
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Some believe that a low p/e ratio is better than a high, but purely scratch you can say that a low p/e

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,741
-SD decided that the company is low valued compared to a high p/e figure.

36
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,805
You could say that the higher p/e number a company has, the higher expectations they have.

37
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:50,241
For example, we have Amazon that has had a P/E ratio of 70 up to 130

38
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
-If you look back since 2011.

39
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:58,377
But Amazon has also gone very well, increased sales quite properly.

40
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,599
And the share has actually more than ten times in value since 2011.

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,397
So in that is the case, a high p/e number has not been so bad.

42
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,840
Personally, I don't care much about p/e ratios when I choose shares.

43
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Tjena Marcus.

44
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:18,656
I was just going to raise a quick question how you think about your own investment?

45
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
What is the goal of your savings?

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,568
How did you post it in the form of monthly savings?

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,408
And you can also add how you started.

48
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:37,113
Did you have any start -up capital or monthly saved with a lower sum and then increase?

49
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:39,520
Yes, your strategy simply.

50
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Tjena Daniel!

51
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
I always save at least SEK 1,000 per month and today I do so in 7 different equity funds.

52
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,866
Gradually, I sometimes sell off some funds if I am dissatisfied with the return.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,312
And so I buy more of my shares instead.

54
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,443
Often I want an 80/20 distribution between my shares and funds.

55
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
I remember when I was little and then we had cash-

56
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,818
-And I saved them in my piggy bank and sometimes I took out my money and put them on the floor.

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,400
Then I wrote on a paper how much I had saved.

58
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,582
My first goal was to save for a Sony Ericsson mobile phone.

59
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,152
I very much wanted to have it, so I saved as much as I could-

60
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
-To be able to afford to buy this mobile.

61
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,902
And it's always followed with me.
 This to save for something-

62
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:37,196
-or just that it's fun to feel that you have money.

63
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,135
I started investing by reading a lot, I googled a lot and then I opened an account at Avanza.

64
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
Then I was 19 years old, so it's just over 7 years ago.

65
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:54,046
So 7 years ago, in 2013 I think, then I bought Avanza Zero for SEK 2,500.

66
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,034
It was savings that I didn't know what would do with.

67
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,055
And I've always wanted to learn how shares and funds work.

68
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,037
So I put this money on Avanza and started buying Avanza Zero.

69
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,946
I bought Avanza Zero afterwards, a little like that.

70
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,397
And then I bought my first shares after that too.

71
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:15,000
Then I went some courses and have learned over time.

72
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,393
You never become fully trained, even that I have been doing here for 7 years-

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,536
-To you never become fully trained, but you learn all the time and that is what is fun.

74
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Erik Martinger.

75
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,027
Many monthly savings in funds, but how do shares really?

76
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
How do you do?

77
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,377
As I mentioned in the matter before, I buy funds every month.

78
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,223
Sometimes more often than that, if it swings a lot, kind of now in coronatids, I bought a little more.

79
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,542
Just as I said, my funds weigh more than 20 % out of my total portfolio-

80
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,719
-Then I usually allocate a little or thus sell some of my funds.

81
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
And buy more shares instead.

82
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
Because I think it is more fun to keep up with shares.

83
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Mattias Sandelius.

84
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
What does your portfolio look like?

85
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Earn Mattias!

86
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,270
Well, I have 4 companies in my equity portfolio today.

87
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:11,090
Some may think that is a little higher risk, but I like it to be high risk.

88
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:13,834
And I like when it swings a lot.
 I think it's fun.

89
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,692
Today it is Castellum, Mycronic, Sinch and Plejd.

90
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,800
Then I also have 7 funds and you can see them here.

91
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Gabbe LÃ¶nn Erlandsson.

92
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:32,191
Do you have any example of places you can invest in the interest-on-interest effect to secure their future savings?

93
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Earn Gabbe

94
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,614
I don't really know what you mean, but interest on the interest effect you achieve if it is that you invest in anything-

95
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,384
-And then you get a return or interest rate and then reinvest it.

96
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:50,145
So that the following year or a while thereafter, you get a greater return or a greater interest rate.

97
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:58,188
I advise you to see my interest rate on interest video where I explain more about interest on the interest effect.

98
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,560
Dividend shares are a perfect example of how to apply interest to the interest rate.

99
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,656
How do you go about finding out why a share is going high or low?

100
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,336
Most often, check news about the company, reports and other things.

101
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
Through rumors, I search for news on Google.

102
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,591
If you search for the company, you usually find it on Google on news or on Twitter.

103
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,391
Rafi Newton Andreasyan.

104
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,225
I don't know if I said that name right, but ... sorry.

105
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,760
What strategy do you use to determine if you want to buy a certain share or not buy it right now?

106
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,263
I actually have no direct strategy, but I feel about buying a share so I buy the share.

107
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
I have a little gut feeling you could say.

108
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,817
If I think the company has potential and I want to buy shares, then I usually buy a small guarding post-

109
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,991
-When I hold and then I read about the company.

110
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,143
And if I get a greater belief in the company, then I buy more.

111
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,633
What did your portfolio look like when you started with shares and funds?
 And what does it look like today?

112
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,000
So I am interested in how the development has gone.

113
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,986
The development has probably not gone so great.
 I did quite a lot of beginner misses that all do the first 2, 3, 4, 5 years.

114
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,367
I'm still a beginner in my eyes.

115
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:19,497
I bought a lot of Avanza Zero in the beginning and a little trampled ... Yes, cancer companies and stuff.

116
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,600
I don't think it went really well, but I can throw up a print screen here so you can see.

117
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Wilmer Lehtonen.

118
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
Hi, here comes a question from a real beginner.

119
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,748
I am trying to build a portfolio and study some different funds, but also stock-

120
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:39,116
-It feels like the stock market has been going very well lately and many funds and shares are at the top.

121
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:43,063
How to think then?
 Should you wait or look for others who have not gone as well?

122
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:47,903
Or buy in at those who are high and wait for Q3 in the hope that they will go up further?

123
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:48,437
Thanks.

124
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:50,687
Yes, you Wilmer.

125
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:54,705
I think you should not contradict so much.

126
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:57,558
But should think about how long do I invest?

127
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,750
Is it that I invest in one or two years' time?

128
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:04,193
Is it that you invest quarterly or why are you worried?

129
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,596
Sure, in the short span of time it is hard if it turns much-

130
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,906
-As an example with Corona when the stock exchange lost 10 % in one day.

131
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:21,197
It was very busy for a lot and many sold themselves away and you lost some money on it.

132
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,717
The absolute best tip I can give and that I usually give, it is to be long -term.

133
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,167
Thinking that this is money that I invest in maybe 10 years term.

134
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:38,247
Then when investing, you know that I should not be affected by such short -term events.

135
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,529
So should you wait?

136
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:46,715
Yes, if you find it difficult because there is a risk that it may go down a lot, then maybe you should wait.

137
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
Instead, I usually think like this that I might invest a little less amount, if I am worried that it is a pretty high top.

138
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,555
And continue to invest over time just all the time.

139
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,868
You don't have to go all in at once, because that's what a lot of beginners do in the beginning.

140
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:08,496
That you buy on tok for large sums, so if you earn 20,000 a month-

141
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:16,047
-Do not go in with 20,000, but go in with maybe 10 % of what you earn.

142
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,900
If you may deposit SEK 5,000 into savings, then you do not have to go in with 5,000 at once.

143
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,843
It is enough for SEK 500, so if it is so that it goes down you can buy for SEK 500 more.

144
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,716
Then you have come in both when it is high and when it is low.

145
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
Filip Thunstedt aka boss and legend.

146
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,245
Do you run loan?

147
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:45,026
Yes I do.
 I drive with securities loan.
 The super loan at Avanza.
 I run a maximum of 5 % loan.

148
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,026
That's my personal rule.

149
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,015
Magnus Sturedahl.

150
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:53,477
How to lie down long or short?
 And how do you calculate a possible loss?

151
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:00,146
Lieving long means that you believe in your investment in ...

152
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
It is believed that it should simply go up.

153
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,855
Locating briefly means that you believe in down.

154
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
It is therefore believed that the investment will go down.

155
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:17,002
This can be done with leverage products such as Bull, Bear, Turbovarians, CFDS.

156
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
There are a variety of such products.

157
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:30,000
In fact, I do not know all these products in my head, but leverage products are not recommended for beginners.

158
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,870
It's pretty easy to burn there.

159
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,760
If you want to count on the risks with a leverage, then you will have to look at how much leverage it is in the product that you buy.

160
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,255
Then you get to look at the potential tender side, if it is so that it would go down 5 %-

161
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,263
-Multiply it with the leverage, type.
 There you have your risk.

162
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,679
Plus any fees and interest rates for that product.

163
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,949
It is a very complicated question that is very difficult to go into right now.

164
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,663
The risk is great when you shop with leverage, so read on properly and make sure you learn first.

Tore Landin Larsson.
 My real brother, the star.

166
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,462
Strategies for purchases, sales, reallocation.
 It would be interesting how you reason about it.

167
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:18,818
So, when you take home profits, selling poor holdings, if you are long on minus placements or if you sell them with the highest development?

168
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,599
Well, it's a little hard to say something that is red.

169
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
If it is so that I see that a company does not develop as well as I hope-

170
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,845
-If it just continues downwards and down, then maybe I sell off.

171
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,522
For example, I invested in Catena Media a while ago and they did not go so well-

172
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:47,193
-then I sold with a loss, because it is better that you sell with a small loss-

173
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:51,602
-Ex that you sit for as long as possible and hope for a turn.

174
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,328
Many people say: "Yes, be long -term."
 Which I also say that you should be for 5, 10 years and blah, blah blah.

175
00:12:56,328 --> 00:13:00,971
But if it is so that news comes up while you invested in a stock-

176
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:08,080
-As you show that this company does not perform well and their profits are dropping, they lose money.

177
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,272
Why should you join a sinking ship for?

178
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,272
Then it is better that you get rid of that leaven.

179
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,135
That's usually how I think.

180
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:22,346
Then I would rather jump on a boat or train that goes and where the chance to make money is greater.

181
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:29,111
I also invest my money in something that I feel can give me more value for my investment.

182
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:34,555
Than I should have them in any sourdough that does not give me a return simply.

183
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
Tony Godlike Lindh.

184
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,071
Is it better to distribute the same amount to funds or a large amount on a single fund?

185
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:50,413
Yes, you Tony.
 It is a good question I would rather make myself so that I spread the amount among different funds.

186
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,431
Some funds that I think will go better I have slightly larger amounts in.

187
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:02,195
And some others have a little less amount in which I may think is high risk and other things.

188
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
So it is different and it is from person to person.

189
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
You get to feel yourself, simply.

Erik Martinger.

191
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,042
When will the video come up?

192
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Now.

193
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:19,127
Ida Runn.
 I subscribe to Youtube, but still haven't received a vacuum cleaner that you promised.

194
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,375
I wonder where it is?

195
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,411
Vacuum cleaner?

196
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,936
So now I have answered most of the questions and forgive me if I have not answered your particular question.

197
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,475
I have received a lot of questions now and recently and I try to answer as much as possible.

198
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:45,640
I have an idea that we should run maybe this week's question or that I bring some of your viewers' questions-

199
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,831
-And with them at the end of each video maybe.

200
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
I think it can be a good idea.

201
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,901
Feel free to thumb if you like the idea or leave a comment down here.

202
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,583
Dares to introduce yourself in the comments field here on youtube-

203
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,628
-or in our Facebook group.

204
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:06,495
It is incredibly fun when we build here a little community, so we can learn from each other.

205
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,925
It's sick fun.

206
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:15,181
I get an enormous number of questions every day and it only grows every day and I get more and more messages-

207
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,879
-and I don't actually have time to answer everything.

208
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:26,518
Sometimes it may be that I answer and that's because I'm kind, but preferably I wish that if you have private questions-

209
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:35,478
-The sinking you can book a meeting with me for payment for my time costs.

210
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:36,737
I have to pay my bills.

211
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,647
But otherwise it is so that I recommend asking the question completely free in our Facebook group-

212
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,749
-So that others can take part in the knowledge.

213
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,135
But it may also be that others in the group can help you with exactly answers to your question.

214
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,017
And I really appreciate when you others answer questions in our Facebook group.

215
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,553
So I don't have to go in and answer everyone myself, because it takes an incredible amount of time away from me.

216
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,270
We have more many good videos that will come and if you have tips on good videos so comment as well.

217
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
I hope you also liked this video.

218
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
So we'll see you in the next.
 Have a nice day!
 Thanks.

219
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Ciao.
