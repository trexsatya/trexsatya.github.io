And how should you think when choosing between shares and funds

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,664
Is it that before you watch this video it can go well to

Congratulations You have won each share book You can contact me on Instagram or Facebook

12
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,600
With your address so I send out the books to you

13
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
In today's video so we'll talk about

14
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
Shares or funds, ie

15
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
What should you choose

16
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
When you save

17
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
Should you buy

18
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
Shares or should you save in a fund?

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,400
And yes the biggest difference between stocks and funds

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496
When you buy shares you own indirectly

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
Part of a business

22
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
And if you buy a fund instead

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
Yes but it is so that you get some of

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
A bunch of different shares

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,016
Up to 20-50 different companies you might get if you invest in a fund

26
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,136
But if you buy a share then it's just the company you invest in

27
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
If we think about that particular claim

28
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
So maybe you understand that

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
There is a little higher risk that

30
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
Invest in shares

31
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
than it is to invest in funds

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,424
When you invest and save your money

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
so do you have to think about how much risk you are willing to take

34
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
By investing in shares so take very high risk

35
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,712
And when you invest in equity funds, there is also a high risk but not as high as if you had only bought 1 share

36
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
So if that company goes bad (in which you bought shares)

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
so does your entire investment go to the beep turn

38
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
But if you buy a fund instead

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
Then you spread out the risk

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Among different companies

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
At least 16 shares you get if you buy a fund

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
I usually say that

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,472
Stock suits you who are looking to take some more risk that may want to

44
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
it should go up and down a little faster

45
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,408
Also you want to spend some time analyzing different companies and seeing who goes well and

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,680
You may be thinking that "this company will go well"

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,760
You like to speculate and you want to spend some extra time on your investments

48
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
You may find it fun to invest in stocks

49
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,232
You may find it fun to follow different companies

50
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,816
And like the economy and everything in general

51
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Yes but then maybe shares are something for you!

52
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
The hook of buying a fund instead of shares

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,264
You don't have as much chance to make as much money

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
If you then buy a fund instead of shares

55
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:59,294
But a fund is perfect for those who can't think of spreading the risk without

56
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Want someone else to take care of it for you instead

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
If you want to invest shares

58
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,386
Yes but then maybe it is because you wanted a little higher return

59
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,160
For example, I buy shares because I think it is fun.

60
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,816
Not because I think I am a professional or that I am good at analyzing different companies but it is a bit like a hobby for me

61
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,400
I think it's pretty fun to follow different companies, how it goes for them

62
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
And yes, then my grows

63
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,032
Bargains also over time if it is so that the company is going well

64
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:28,339
If I find something that I think will go well.
 It's all about speculation simply!

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
Instead when you buy a fund

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
How do you leave that responsibility

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,000
To the managers who manage the fund

68
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,822
Because you think they are better at finding good shares than you are.

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,166
If you choose shares - then you will receive the following benefits

70
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:45,024
You have the chance to make more money than funds

71
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:49,835
It does not cost any annual fees or current fees when owning shares

72
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,267
3. You decide entirely which shares you want to invest in

73
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,637
When you buy funds so maybe it's a bit difficult to think about

74
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
What shares are what actually exist in this fund?

75
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,240
Because it's not something you can control

76
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,784
So if you wish to invest morally or ethically or environmentally friendly or other

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,459
Then you can't choose it in a fund

78
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,263
There are various funds that have such classifications

79
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
But

80
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,794
It is actually the fund manager who chooses what should be in the fund and not you

81
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,716
But when you buy shares then you can control this yourself!

82
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
Disadvantages of shares

83
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,329
Yes but that is that you have a higher risk than funds

84
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
Also swinging pretty much upside down

85
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,287
So it is that you are not.
 comfortable with

86
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,359
It might go down 10 % in a day

87
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,805
Yes but then maybe you should have a fund instead.

88
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,104
When you buy a fund then it is so that you hand over the responsibility to the fund manager.

89
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,691
To control and set and decide which shares should be in this fund.

90
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,232
Funds may be for those who want to spend a little less time on your savings

91
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,559
And just have an automatic savings where someone else takes care of you

92
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
You may not have the desire to sit and pick out different shares

93
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,557
And then maybe funds fit better just for you

94
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
A typical stock investor

95
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,225
Yes it sits on needles most often and often check how the savings go every day

96
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Myself, I am one that invests in shares

97
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,551
But I think it's fun!
 I enjoy following the stock exchange and keeping track of how the investments go up and down

98
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:15,777
I have no problem if it goes down pretty much in one day.

99
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:20,480
I think it's pretty fun to follow how my shares go

100
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,327
But one absolutely does not have to choose either or

101
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,239
Without you can have both shares and funds in your savings.

102
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
I myself have both

103
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,067
I have about 80 % shares and I have 20 % equity funds

104
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,322
It is no fixed rule with 80/20 principle

105
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:44,436
I just think it's nice to keep it in about

106
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,599
If it is so that my shares go bad, hopefully my funds will be better.

107
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
The vast majority they probably make more money

108
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
on investing only in funds than shares

109
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,583
It is very rare as one sees that

110
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Persons hit index (stock exchange)

111
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
You have to be good at selecting good shares

112
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
If you want to be able to beat index

113
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
It is required quite a lot at least over the long term

114
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
In the short term on some year

115
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
So yes but then maybe it is so that you beat index, but in the long term it is very rare you do

116
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,015
The vast majority actually earn best at choosing a free fund

117
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
Thus an index fund with very low fee

118
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
They show over the term that they give quite well

119
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
But if you are such as

120
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,815
Do you like to keep on and pill and invest yourself and find different shares and companies

121
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Yes but then maybe it is so

122
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
You should invest in shares with

123
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,006
One absolutely does not have to choose

124
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,601
Without it, it is good to actually invest in both shares and funds.

125
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,551
Whether you are new to investing and you have neither or invested in shares nor funds.

126
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,479
Yes but then I think you should start with a fund anyway

127
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,610
Funds don't turn as much as stocks do

128
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
And it's pretty easy to get started and

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,634
Just put a hundred dollars into a fund without costing any fee.

130
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,320
Thus, there is no purchase fee and no sales fee on funds.

131
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,936
On shares, however, you have to pay a fixed fee a purchase fee and a sales fee

132
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,342
called brokerage while on funds so it is a running fee

133
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,246
an annual management fee deducted on your investments

134
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:16,479
But there are free funds out there that you can use from that you can start with if you are a beginner and want to start saving

135
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:19,539
But then maybe it fits well with a free fund

136
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
To sum it all up

137
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,183
Choose what you think is most comfortable to invest in

138
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:29,023
If you like slightly higher risks but then maybe you should invest in shares

139
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,344
But if it is so that you want to spend as little time as possible

140
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,748
Then maybe it fits better with investing in funds.

141
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
If you want to have as low fees as

142
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,644
Choose some free index funds

143
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,615
If you want a little better control and

144
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
Want to invest in funds such as

145
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,247
swinging a lot and has a higher risk and higher chance of making money

146
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,832
Check out active equity funds then instead

147
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
It might be a better suits you

148
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
And then when you have learned

149
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,511
Yes but then maybe you can go in and test and buy some shares

150
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
It's all up to you - feel for yourself

151
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
But dare to invest - that's the main factor!

152
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,447
Dare to open a savings and just start investing for

153
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
With time you learn more.

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,335
I hope you have got some more meat on your legs and regarding the issue of shares or funds.

155
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,223
Thank you so much for looking, you give me a thumbs up and I understand that you like this video and then I hope to see you in the next video!

156
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Ciao!
