1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:07,360
In this video I will show you my biggest holding of my shares.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,360
SNCH.

3
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,749
The value of sinch shares is now up to more than SEK 200,000.

4
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:45,924
If I were to sell my shares right now, I would have made a profit of just over 150,000 or 216 %.

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,179
Will I sell my Sinch shares?

6
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
No.

7
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,992
In this video I want to tell you why I do not intend to sell my shares in Sinch.

8
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:57,600
And how to think if you have a share that has gone pretty well.

9
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,648
And if you are considering selling.

10
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,232
It is very common to sell your shares prematurely-

11
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,945
-When you are buying and selling with shares.

12
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,739
It is true that the vast majority of beginners, they sell their shares prematurely-

13
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:14,240
-And you look back after a year or something like that and so think man-

14
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,936
"Oh, I have been missing out on a lot of money."

15
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,272
My name is Marcus Lindblad-

16
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
-And it's me who runs Sparecash.

17
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,241
I want to teach you to save in shares, funds and much more.

18
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:37,126
But enough about me, because now we're going to jump into why you shouldn't sell your stocks-

19
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:42,665
-Ber how to think if you think and you may want to sell your shares.

20
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:50,880
So here it is that most beginners, they make the mistake that they sell too soon.

21
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:57,760
I have done exactly the same thing, I looked back at my stock history and then I found Fortnox.

22
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,486
I sold my Fortnox shares in December 2019 for SEK 26,000.

23
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,743
Had I not sold them, they would have been worth SEK 87,000 today.

24
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,164
So, I sold them for SEK 26,000, today they had been worth SEK 87,000.

25
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,336
And this is an incredibly common mistake that not only beginners do-

26
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,432
-What also professionals, people who have been sitting and acting on the stock exchange for 20 years-

27
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,196
They do the same things.

28
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,055
Have you done the same thing?
 Have you sold anything too early?

29
00:02:32,178 --> 00:02:35,912
One stock?
 A car?
 A painting?
 PokÃ©mon cards?

30
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:37,440
Write a comment below.

31
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:45,281
I think the most common problem is that you think the share has gone up so much that it will end up.

32
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,472
But it is so common that they just continue up, up, up.

33
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,342
And you think you have dotted the top, though you don't have it.

34
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:58,197
We'll go through some tactical stuff that you can use you-

35
00:02:58,197 --> 00:03:01,892
-If you are actually considering selling.

36
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Tip number one.

37
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,488
You sell the return, ie what you have gone plus.

38
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,402
So, your winnings.
 Just sell it and keep the basic investment.

39
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:24,032
Then you have secured the profit, so what you can lose at most is the basic investment that you first went in.

40
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,278
Tip number 2, it is that you sell your basic investment and then you leave the profits in the shares.

41
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,704
Then you secure what you have actually invested from the beginning.

42
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:42,208
If they place the money elsewhere, but leave the profit.
 So if the stock continues up-

43
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,512
-Then it's just "free money" if you say so.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,115
Thus, it is your profit that will continue to ride if it continues up.

45
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
Tip # 3

46
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,472
That you can sell half of your investment-

47
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,151
-If you've gone with SEK 10,000, yes, sell half.

48
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,408
Then you don't sell everything, so if it continues up-

49
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:06,107
-So you are still on the train, but you reduce your possible profit.

50
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,668
Then you have secured some money.

51
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
Tip number 4, it's not to sell everything at once.

52
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:20,493
If you have a share that has gone pretty well, as in my case where Sinch is worth SEK 200,000.

53
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:26,309
It's not that smart if I sell everything at once, but I can go out with a little at a time.

54
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:33,067
Kind of like I said in the previous tip, maybe sell half or distribute it into maybe four sales.

55
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
So you don't do everything at once.

56
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
It will cost a little more in brokerage-

57
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,774
-But if it is so that it continues up, you have sold a little more expensive and get more profit.

58
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,909
Tip number 5, do not sell the shares.

59
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
You may be convinced that the company will go well or you may be wrong.

60
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Why should you sell?

61
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,415
Really wondering if it's right to sell, because in most cases-

62
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,764
-So it is just short -term noise, that something is happening like viruses in society or whatever.

63
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,479
Which makes you doubt on your investment.

64
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,825
But it is true that quite often you are actually wrong and maybe should remain.

65
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,501
Alright, I'll tell you why I'm not going to sell my shares in Sinch.

66
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:31,004
From the beginning, it was so that I heard about the company Sinch first in the pod Market Makers.

67
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,775
Then I started doing some research, I started to look at this presentations from Sinch's CEO.

68
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,991
I got a really good feeling.

69
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,992
"That Means that we on average touch every single mobile phone on the planet on average 14 times per year."

70
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,691
And I thought the stock was traded very strongly.

71
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
And from the beginning I went in pretty heavy.

72
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,879
And that is why I sold a little shortly thereafter.

73
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,775
I thought I was a little too heavy in this stock, in case it went down suddenly.

74
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,173
Then start reading on a little more and got a better and better feeling for the company.

75
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:14,556
What I like about Sinch is that they have been profitable since day 1.

76
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,616
They have always made a profit.

77
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,183
The three main reasons why I don't sell my shares in Sinch right now-

78
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:31,621
-Sum number 1, I know that Softbank, a large Japanese investment fund, has invested a lot of money in Sinch.

79
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,495
They will use this money for acquisitions and the like.

80
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,567
I believe in them as owners of this company.

81
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,943
Number 2, it is that they will make a stock split soon.

82
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:50,868
The price of the sin chart is quite expensive.
 This has nothing to do with valuation, but it is just that it costs quite a lot to buy a share in Sinch.

83
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,360
They will solve it through a share split, which means that you get more shares.

84
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:03,065
This really has no impact on the company, but psychologically, it is so that-

85
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:06,239
-You and I like to buy shares that don't cost that much.

86
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,055
Because it will be easier for us to buy the shares.

87
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:14,687
And I think they can have a technical impact on the stock, which can make that-

88
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,328
-Exmer small savers like you and me, will want to buy shares in Sinch when it is easier-

89
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
-be able to buy them.

90
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,719
Then it goes from about SEK 1,700 now to SEK 170.

91
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,081
Which will make it much easier to buy more shares in Sinch.

92
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:34,245
I think that can lead to the price continuing on Sinch.

93
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,239
The third reason, that's the competitor Twilio.

94
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:47,723
Twilio is an American company that is currently worth just over 6 times more than Sinch.

95
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:56,657
I think there is a gap here that Sinch can fill as a good competitor to Twilio.

96
00:07:56,657 --> 00:08:00,255
Or maybe someone wants to buy Sinch or vice versa.

97
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,537
I think Sinch has a lot to catch up with at Twilio.

98
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:11,734
But I simply like to own companies that grow fairly fast, which Sinch does.

99
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:16,577
They increase growth and buy new companies and manage their business gallantly.

100
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:21,686
I like companies and shares that have a good momentum.

101
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:27,717
The course continues to be printed and more trade and investors come in.

102
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,975
It feels positive in my ears anyway.

103
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,327
I trust my gut feeling simply and it feels good, but this is-

104
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,887
-No buying advice, without this is my views.

105
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,727
Keep in mind if this is how you are considering buying the share.

106
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,823
It has gone up an incredible amount and it might as well go down 20 % in a week.

107
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,601
So take it carefully, don't take what I say as any advice.

108
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,271
The most important thing I want you to take with you from this video-

109
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,000
-It's to try to keep you away from the sales button when you are in stock.

110
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,767
Hold it away, so that you are long -term.
 That's when you make money.

111
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,375
I haven't sold anything in shares now in just over a year and a half, I think.

112
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:18,013
Yes, it has been so much better when I just buy instead of sitting and changing shares back and forth.

113
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,383
On the one hand, you burn quite a lot of commission.

114
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,759
It costs more in fees and then you may stay outside the market and lose out that other companies go up.

115
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,679
It is better that you invest in trying to make more money, save more money and invest more money.

116
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,679
Instead of switching from one to the spirit of the share.

117
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,535
It costs a lot of fees and you lose returns.

118
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,827
And probably you are just wrong.
 It is better invest, let them lie-

119
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:44,459
-Let the winners go up and take it easy.

120
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,507
Don't be so hot.
 Take it easy.

121
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
Hope you got some good tips this video.

122
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871

Have a nice day.

126

Take care

127
