1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,024
You looked right!

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:09,091
I have already earned over SEK 40,000 on shares this year.

3
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:13,296
It is not that difficult to make money on shares.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,314
I tried to tell you this in my previous videos-

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,000
-But I think that in this video, I'll simplify this.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
The only two ways you can make money on shares through.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,671
I will also show you my stock transactions that I have made money from.

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,587
So you can see exactly how things are going when you make money on shares.

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,193
In the end I give you a little bonus with my best tips for when buying stocks-

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
-So that you can make as much money as possible.

00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:01,077
I want to make it so simple and easy to understand for you who are new to this.

15
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,584
Take out a cup of coffee, because now we run the video!

16
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:08,531
Thank you so much to you who have invited me for a cup of coffee.

17
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,702
Briefly explained, there are two ways to make money on shares.

18
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,353
The first way is when you buy shares, so you buy them for a particular price-

19
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27,869
-To time, the price of your shares can go up and then you sell them at a more expensive price.

20
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,285
This way you have made money on your shares.

21
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,106
The second way you can make money on stock-

22
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,155
-This is that you buy that gives a dividend.

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
This means that the companies share their profits as they make.

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,735
Thus, you make money through their profit.

25
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,122
Then you get this money directly into your account that you own the shares on-

26
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:49,726
-In this way you have made some more money.

27
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:52,798
Coffee break!

28
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,641
[Marcus SÃ¶rplar coffee]

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,483
Yes, it's najs.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,132
If we start with way number one.
 It is that you make money when the price of shares goes up.

31
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,892
In my first video that I did about shares for beginner-

32
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:12,118
-So I show how to buy shares and I bought some shares in Plejd.

33
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:19,385
And there they went through and I have now bought a share in Plejd.

34
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:27,648
Then it was so ... that on June 8, 2020 I bought shares for just over SEK 5,000 in Plejd.

35
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:32,576
What I did then was that I bought myself in Plejd with a small guard post that I call it.

36
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:39,570
For me it means I force myself to read more about the company-

37
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,970
-During the time I have the little investment.

38
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,452
Then I also do not miss whether the share goes up very much.

39
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,288
I also do not go in too heavy if it is so that I have missed any detail on the road-

40
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,791
-Which, the share may go down a lot.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,997
It may not hurt as much when I go in with a small post.

42
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:03,189
If we flush the band a little, I bought some more shares.

43
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:07,221
Then I bought more shares for almost SEK 15,000.

44
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,384
So in total I have invested SEK 20,000 in Plejd.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,398
As time went on, it went better for the company Plejd

46
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:20,800
And so I decided to buy some more shares in Plejd quite recently.

47
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:25,988
Then I bought for 10,000 SEK, so I have invested SEK 30,000 in a total of a total.

48
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,880
If you look at the value today on my shares that I have invested in Plejd

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
-The today they are worth SEK 95,000.

50
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,776
Meaning an increase of just over SEK 65,000-

51
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
-To my SEK 30,000 that I have invested in Plejd.

52
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,574
Percentage, so means an increase of 216% right now.

53
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
So if I were to sell my shares in Plejd

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,000
-Then I had made a profit of SEK 65,000 today.

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,616
This is nothing that is normal for a share to increase so much on a year-

56
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,267
-Why I was simply lucky and I should thank myself for that.

57
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,839
You need to know however, it is that Plejd's shares ...

58
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,789
If the company is going badly in the future or they may be going bankrupt

59
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,047
Then my shares may theoretically be worth zero.

60
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,659
Then I have not made any money.

61
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:22,602
You have not made money until you have sold or taken home your profit.

62
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,365
For those of you who are beginners who may not really understand why the price of these stocks-

63
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:31,840
-In Plejd has gone up so much, then I'll try to explain it now.

64
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:37,016
The simple explanation as to why the price of the shares in Plejd has gone up so much-

65
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:44,222
-It is simply that the company has shown that they can make more money than they have done before.

66
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:51,112
What happens is that other private individuals, like you and I, or banks and other business-

67
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,873
-They believe that Plejd's shares are attractive and they also want to invest in this company.

68
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,799
If they continue to go just as well in the future.

69
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,540
What you do then is that you raise the price that you are willing to pay for Plejd's shares.

70
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,920
What happens is that the price of the shares goes up, which makes my investment more worthwhile than it used to be.

71
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,747
Insert number two that you can make money on shares.

72
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:22,448
It is through dividends.

73
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:26,878
I have made a video about dividend shares that you can check out here.

74
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:31,542
In that video I go through a little basic about why a company does dividend-

75
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
-and how to make money on it

76
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:41,572
But simply explained, it is usually a little larger company sharing their profits as they make.

77
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:46,193
They thank us shareholders for wanting to be part of the company.

78
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,768
But also then because those who own a bit of the company, as you and I-

79
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:56,375
-Or those who have founded the company should get a little bit of the profit.

80
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,454
To eat a small piece of the cake, simply.

81
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:03,560
Not all companies share the profits that the company actually makes.

82
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:09,077
For example, Plejd that I talked about earlier, they do not share with them out of their profit-

83
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,252
-whow they believe that the money they earn should remain in the company-

84
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,980
-And should not be distributed to us shareholders.

85
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,256
Because they believe that the company will use this money better.

86
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,047
Larger companies such as banks and real estate companies-

87
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,000
-which receives a stable cash flow as one calls it-

88
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:33,215
-They make a lot of money every month or every year and so there.

89
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:39,244
They are generous and want to share with us shareholders as a thank you for investing in their companies.

90
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:45,842
What I like about dividend shares is that you get some money, ie pure cash into the account.

91
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,676
That money rolls into the same account on which you own your shares.

92
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,999
Thus, you have some shares in a dividend share at, for example, an investment savings account

93
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,000
-The money will roll into the same account on which you own the shares.

94
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,349
Then it is free for you to withdraw this money and do what you want with them.

95
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,172
Or buy more shares, so you get a higher dividend next time.

96
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,933
Or whatever you want, buy a Snickers or whatever.

97
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:18,174
For example, I got SEK 3,600 from Castellum last year because I own Castellum shares.

98
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,210
Now I have bought some more shares in Castellum.

99
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:28,433
Partly for these dividend money that has rolled in, but Castellum has also raised the dividend this year-

100
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:36,762
-What means that I get a higher dividend, so this year I will receive just over SEK 4,000 in share dividends from Castellum.

101
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:40,639
But do you have to choose either?

102
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,529
No you do not have to.
 It is just as good to have both a dividend share and a growth share.

103
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:49,418
Or those who you think the price will go up on the shares instead.

104
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,215
I have both and, and it goes well for you.

105
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,743
Now I will give you my best tips for making money on stock-

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,920
-When you should consider before buying shares, so you make the right choice.

107
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,857
Tip number one is for you who are a beginner who may not have bought shares yet.

108
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,407
It is to invest only money that you can afford to be without.

109
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,251
The stock market swings a lot, it goes up a lot and it goes down a lot.

110
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,840
Money that you invest you should be able to afford to be but for at least 3-5 years, I think.

111
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:29,776
We say that you have just started working and then you have put away some money from your pay-

112
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,346
-Own about SEK 1,000.
 Do not invest all that money.

113
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,143
Maybe start with SEK 100 or SEK 200 that you might be able to afford to be outside

114
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,776
-And a little test with them, just to feel and learn how it works.

115
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,076
This way you avoid going in too heavy and burning yourself.

116
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,687
Then maybe you lose a lot of money and you think it's hard

117
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,904
-And then you simply will not continue to invest.

118
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,994
Start with a small amount and do not sell, but let it lie there-

119
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
-So you learn how it swings up and down.

120
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,617
Tip number two is to buy only shares in companies that you understand.

121
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,287
Think a bit like when you lend money.
 If you had lent money to a buddy-

122
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:17,856
-When you trust.
 Yes, but then you can trust that your friend will pay the money back to you.

123
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,670
If you were to lend money to a stranger on the street that you have never met before

124
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,438
-How sure are you then that you will get the money back?

125
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,716
Little is it about investing in shares.

126
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:39,181
Invest in companies that you know how they make money so you can understand a little better-

127
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,921
-If this company will use your money properly.

128
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:50,205
Very many beginners buy shares in companies that they have no idea what they actually do-

129
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:53,003
-or how they make money, if they even make any money.

130
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:58,835
Some companies are at loss and people just speculate on whether the share should go up or down.

131
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,623
But do you know what the company is doing and how they make money-

132
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,279
-The you will make much better investment.

133
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
Number three, be patient.

134
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,890
-Do that patience, you will make terribly much more money on the stock exchange.

135
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:18,386
When I was a beginner, I was buying and selling and holding on and back-

136
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:23,314
-I followed the stock exchange every minute from 9-17: 30 when the stock exchange closed.

137
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Do not do it.

138
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:29,546
Invest, log out and do something else that is fun-

139
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,881
-What you would rather do the days

140
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:37,486
Do not sit and check every day all the time for so much you will not learn from a stock exchange day.

141
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,169
Have patience.
 The less you are doing and shopping and buying and selling and here and there-

142
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,150
-So you will make much more money.

143
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:50,816
It is usually when you go in and try to make quick money in the short term that you usually lose money.

144
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,408
Be patient, log out a bit, and you will make much more money.

145
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,187
Tip number four, buy shares in an ISK account, an investment savings account.

146
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:08,159
From the beginning when you start investing, you get to choose which account you want to invest in.

147
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,366
Then there is investment savings account, capital insurance and equity fund account.

148
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:21,602
By having your shares and funds in an ISK account, you get a low tax and you do not have to declare your business.

149
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:28,549
You get tax -free dividends and you can only enjoy life and chill and have a good time.

150
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,968
The last tip, buy companies that make a profit.

151
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:38,727
If you are a beginner, do not buy companies that you have no idea what they do with-

152
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,767
-And then they go with a loss.

153
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
For what do companies that go with a loss?

154
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,084
Yes, they do something wrong.

155
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:53,049
Because it is not sustainable to run a business that does not make money or that does not make a profit anyway.

156
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,033
Then you have to be very sure of your investment.

157
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,896
Start by buying companies that make a profit.

158
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:02,222
It is easy.
 You can only check out the P/E figure.

159
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,980
Is the p/e figure above zero, so it is positive.
 Then the company goes with a profit.

160
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
If they have a negative p/e figure, they are at a loss.

161
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,463
Avoid them until a start, until you have learned a little more.

162
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,845
Then you can consider buying other companies.

163
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,499
The most important lesson when you want to start investing in stock-

164
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,000
-It is simply just starting.

165
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,084
Dare to invest, do not be afraid to invest.

166
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:33,921
Start with as little as only SEK 100, buy a Swedish company as you have control at-

167
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,711
-O which is listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

168
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,063

169
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,415

170
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,630
I am incredibly happy that I have done it.

171
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,641
I started over 6 years ago and I would never think I can live on this right now-

172
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,305
