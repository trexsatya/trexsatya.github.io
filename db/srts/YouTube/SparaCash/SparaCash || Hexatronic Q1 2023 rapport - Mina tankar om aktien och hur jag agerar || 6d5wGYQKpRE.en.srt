00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Hexatronic has a report today and I was going to draw a small quick report comment after a lot of requests.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,660
So we look and then we see here that the share is currently traded down to minus 10 percent.

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,660
Completely crazy and it was one of my biggest holdings, or has been anyway.

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,660
Now, it is no longer after this year's decline of 40 percent just over.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,660
And we actually had a pang report.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,010
For we look here we see that yes but it is a record quarter.

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,010
The first quarter became a record quarter of both sales and profitability.

8
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:51,170
Especially North America then, the US and Europe very strongly except Sweden then who have taken a little stop if you say so.

9
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,330
But despite this, the share is down a lot.

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:03,150
For we take a look at this graph that we see here, we see that the turnover is crazy.

11
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:11,150
They grow on nicely and the margin also up so that you increase both profit and sales.

12
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:21,150
But there were some words that were reviewed in the report where some may have interpreted this organic growth that has come down a lot.

13
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:28,150
For example, DI who shared this graph then over organic growth that has fallen down a great deal.

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,150
Which may be a reason why the share is traded down so much.

15
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,150
Since the order book also we see that it has come down a lot.

16
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,150
But CEO Henrik Larsson-Lyon himself says they are not worried.

17
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,150
It has been before, for example, Covid, for example, that there have been very long delivery times.

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:55,150
That is, you may have ordered or placed an order 4-5 months ahead.

19
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,150
Because it takes so long then to get material in order to implement the words.

20
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:05,150
While it will then go back a little more normal 2-3 months maybe so.

21
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,380
And this can be a reason why the market is shopping for the share so much.

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,380
After all, it has been very high.

23
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:24,240
And I scratched some numbers together on sales that have been historically that you can see above me.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,240
And then we look at the turnover as the biggest legs where we see most likely growth in the future.

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
It is probably North America and the rest of Europe.

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,240
For this we have then the United States, we have Germany and we have the UK.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,240
These are the three largest parts if you say.

28
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,240
And we look at historical growth.

29
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Here I have not included Sweden then because you can see here so Sweden is a bit struck and not so extremely high growth potential.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,240
But if you look at these legs, it looks very nice in the long run.

31
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,240
If you think the United States will continue to grow at the same speed as they have done before.

32
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:16,270
You had a proper growth if you look from the first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023.

33
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,270
And then we put together the quarters so we see that it looks pretty nice geographically.

34
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,270
Both in Europe and in North America then.

35
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:36,800
And if you look at the estimates that I have entered here where you assume then you follow these financial goals.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,800
If you reach 20% growth 2023 2024 2025.

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Yes but then we get a p/e 17 on 2024.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,800
And falls down to p/e 14 2025 if they then succeed.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,800
One thing that I think is interesting is the itself the package.

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
As has been presented in the United States.

41
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,200
Which Henrik has actually talked about himself.

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,200
And here next door I wrote a little about this bid package briefly

43
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,200
From what Henrik said during previous interview in DI in March this year.

44
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:24,200
And this broadband if you are going to say bid's contribution then to the United States.

45
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
It is, after all, to develop the infrastructure.

46
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
It is then called Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act.

47
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,200
And for broadband, $ 65 billion is budgeted.

48
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,200
And Henrik and Hexatronic estimate that this money will flow out

49
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Or begins to be rolled out in 2023 or the end of 2023.

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,200
And there Henrik himself has said that they have a market share of 5-6%.

51
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,200
And there is a major player in the United States who has 70-75%.

52
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,200
And this growth has not been shown in the figures yet.

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:09,380
And since we see such explosive growth in the United States, it is like The Good Times is Ahead of Us.

54
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,380
So it will be better in the United States.

55
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,380
So here I don't think you should worry about it will stop in the US directly.

56
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,380
But here you still gas.

57
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,380
So I actually don't understand why the market is shopping for the share by 10% on a record report.

58
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,380
I think the market is a little too worried actually.

59
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,380
For interest and inflation here for Hexatronic.

60
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,480
So I will stay with my shares.

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,480
It is not often that I usually make such comments.

62
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,480
But I will stay there.
 I will not buy more because the holding is a little too heavy in my portfolio right now.

63
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
So we'll see how it goes.

64
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,480
We keep our thumbs because it may be that the market re -evaluates its views on the share a little further ahead.

65
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,640
But it was a small short report comment at Hexatronic.

66
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Hope you appreciated it.
 In such cases, please put a thumbs up and so on.
