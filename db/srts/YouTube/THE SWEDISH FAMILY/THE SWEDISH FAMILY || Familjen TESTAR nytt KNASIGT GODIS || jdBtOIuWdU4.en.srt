1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,760
It smells really good!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,040
"Psych!"
 (jokes)

3
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:04,360
It was angry.

4
00:00:04,632 --> 00:00:06,040
5 points.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,481
I'm a little pluttis.

6
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,313
Yaaaaaaay!

7
00:00:18,247 --> 00:00:20,933
Hello Hello!

8
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:23,095
Today we will test ...

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,049
Cranky candy!

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,944
Yay!
 "OUII!"
 (candy)

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,273
- Laura has already started.
 - She cheats.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,760
Fuskis.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,518
- But it doesn't matter, because she's only 2 years old.
 - Yes, she is apologized.

14
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:44,240
But this is how it is ...

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,600
We often go to the store and look sweets that look a little cranky and fun.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,249
Yaaaaay, Yaaay!

17
00:00:54,156 --> 00:01:00,022
And then Alma and Harry have asked if we cannot test cranky candy, ie not from any country.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,680
No, exactly, but just cranky candy.

19
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:07,680
- So now we have accumulated ... - A lot of cranky candy.

20
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,040
Yes, yes, yes!

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,231
- We are running right away.
 - Yay!

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,680
“Lamp spray”

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:22,612
It's a candy spray ... with a lamp in the package.

24
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,440
Uääh!

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,795
Sour!

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
More.

27
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:36,892
- Very angry.
 Do you want to taste, Laura?
 - No.

28
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,040
Don't want to taste?

29
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:45,040
- But it was good.
 - I don't know, I've never understood liquid candy.

30
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:50,100
It's like juice that has not been properly diluted.

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,240
There is something about being a spray too.
 It feels like you are spraying hair spray in your mouth.

32
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:56,840
Do you think?

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,503
- Do you want to test mine?
 - Yes.

34
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:06,520
- My spray tastes raspberries.
 - It's blue?

35
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,640
Yes, I know, but it's a raspberry here on the package, so ... Yes, it's raspberries.

36
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:15,874
This one should be strawberry.
 It does not taste strawberry.
 It tastes sour.

37
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:22,640
This one should be green apple.
 You might imagine that it tastes a little green apple.

38
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,040
Do you also want to test now, Laura?

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,288
What grades do you give from 1 to 5?

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
null

41
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,240
- Or wait, 0 to 5. - Yes.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,600
- 5. - 5?!

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,218
Me too.
 5. I could buy this and have it as a Friday night.

44
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:51,760
- huh?
 Friday night?
 - Yes.

45
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:57,640
- Zero cozy factor with a ... - No, I totally agree.
 Very uncommon.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,640
- Is this lamp for the cozy, then?
 - No, but ... yes, a little.

47
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:11,600
I give this 0, but it was a lamp and I like cool stuff, so it gets 1 point for the lamp.

48
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:17,240
Yes, you changed your mind.
 You rounded up.
 I give 1 point.

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,101
Laura, how many points do you give?

50
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,760
"Um."
 One.

51
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,384
One, one, one, one, one.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,973
“Cotton Candy Buttered Popcorn Flaves”

53
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,742
So it is sugar candy with a taste of buttery popcorn.

54
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:45,920
- So nasty texture.
 - Uh!
 Is it common to be able to buy sugar candy in a chip bag?

55
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:51,360
- I do not know.
 "Made in the USA," this says.
 - Exciting.
 Okay.

56
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,520
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.
 1, 2, 3.

57
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:58,440
Oh!

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,200
It really tastes popcorn with butter flavor.

59
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:03,520
No.

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,440
What sick!

61
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,200
- Laura does not seem to like.
 - No.

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,440
She takes back her candy deodorant.

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,040
- I think this was good.
 - You like this?

64
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:19,825
It was something completely new to me.

65
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:23,640
Not my thing.
 Not my thing.

66
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,440
So ... I'm shocked.
 I don't know what I was thinking, but not this.

67
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,609
I would probably have bought this candy if there was no other candy left in the store.

68
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:42,001
Not so good store, in other words.

69
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:45,083
I probably give it 4.5.

70
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
(Axel + Alma + Joanna) 4.5?!

71
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,212
Oh.

72
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,159
I give 1 point.
 Too messy.

73
00:04:52,308 --> 00:05:01,294
I give 1 point.
 I thought it was really good, but ... it tasted a little popcorn.

74
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,640
- Mm, that's where the score came in.
 - Yes.

75
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,640
I completely agree.
 I give it 3 points.

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:15,040
Far too messy for me.
 Absolutely impossible to have in the home with a lot of children.

77
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,240
But, yes, it tastes as it says it should taste.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,160
- What do you give, Laura?
 - Do you eat on a wet napkin?

79
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,640
Blä!
 Yuk.

80
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:28,600
- Laura, how many points do you give it?
 - It was pretty much the same.

81
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,320
OM-NOM-NOM!
 Yaaaay!

82
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,370
Okay.
 It sounds like type a 3rd or a 4th maybe.

83
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:38,000
- "gango"?
 - "Gingo!"

84
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,320
- "Gingo."
 - Huh!

85
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:43,954
"Gingo" is "Cinco", that's 5 points.

86
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:47,015
"Milka Mmmax Choco Jelly"

87
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,920
It is thus a chocolate cake filled with jelly pieces.

88
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:02,600
- Oh, this gel was very rubbery.
 - mm.

89
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,523
- I haven't got any jelly yet.
 - No, I've just been cracking.

90
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:11,640
- cracking?
 - Me too.
 It bursts into the mouth, like "Popping Candy."

91
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,120
- Yes!
 - Yes, it is filled with different stuff!
 MHM!

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Yes, it snaps and crackles in the mouth.
 This was a bit festive.

93
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,441
Do you think this is in Sweden?

94
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,760
- No.
 - Maybe on normal.

95
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:30,640
- Do you think?
 Do they usually have Milka?
 - Yes.
 But maybe not this kind.

96
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,520
But this is a little fun.
 You at home ...

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,660
We do not know which of these can be found in Sweden, so you can comment on it below.

98
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,462
Good idea.
 Do it.

99
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,131
Do you hear how it snaps and crackles?

100
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,440
- messy.
 - messy?
 Yes, you get messy with chocolate.

101
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,536
- "uaua" messy.
 - Yes.
 Laura is messy, yes.

102
00:06:57,046 --> 00:07:02,240
I like this candy.
 I thought it was festive and maybe a little fun to offer.

103
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:11,186
So I give it 3 points because I didn't really like the Jellybeans.
 They were a little hard.

104
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:17,562
I also give 3 points.
 Fun with the spray.
 Unexpectedly.

105
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:24,044
- I give 0 points.
 - Oh!
 0 points, then?

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,580
- Why?
 - That's why it.
 It was disgusting with Jello.

107
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:35,553
Well.
 I thought it was delicious.
 It reminds me when I was little and made sweets in the freezer.

108
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,440
I melted chocolate and mixed up with a lot of candy.

109
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,828
I give this 4 points.
 It was fun and festive.

110
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,760
"Baby Unicorn Dipper"

111
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:56,700
It is a diphic club that you can open ... and then you should dip it in powder that is here in.

112
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:03,360
- It smells a bit "suspicious."
 (suspicious) - it smells very vast.

113
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,283
Uh!

114
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:08,760
Oh, Laura, you turned blue around your nose.

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,720
- Yes, it's the unicorn's hair.
 - Oh, it only tastes sugar, this one.

116
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:18,304
- But I can't even get it down.
 - Can't it get down?
 No!

117
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:21,842
- How to dip it in "powder"?
 - You have to do this, check out.

118
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
- Yes exactly.
 - Oh!

119
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,760
No, what a horrible sweets.

120
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,000
Wait!
 I found out that you can do this ... put some "powder" in it ...

121
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,588
- Oh, smart.
 That's how you do.
 - The lid.

122
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,432
Äää ...

123
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,200
- This is so disgusting.
 - Laura, your unicorn has such big eyes.
 It is very cute.

124
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Uää.

125
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,059
It tastes like ...

126
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,640
It tastes like dextrosol.

127
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,280
- Although it's more acidic.
 It's sour.
 - This is exactly DEXTROSOL, I think.

128
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,917
This is not sour.

129
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:04,040
Look, mom!

130
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,520
Yes you are right!
 Now I recognize it.

131
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,840
It's dextrosol.
 It's not like hockey powder, but this is dextrosol.

132
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:17,559
These are as much quick sugar as it can only be.

133
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:20,192
Uööö!

134
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,235
!
 !

135
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,640
- I give Feeem, Feeem!
 - huh?

136
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,157
- Do you give 5?
 - huh?
 5 points.

137
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,087
- "Psych!"
 (joke) - meh ...

138
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,360
- What do you really give?
 - "Psych" means the opposite.
 Zero!

139
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,271
- You don't like it either.
 - Noool ...

140
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,339
- Noool ... - Laura too, just ...

141
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,000
"Trolli jelly eyes"

142
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,620
They are packed in a plastic package and look like eyes.

143
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,840
- OH!
 There is something sour and runny inside!
 - No, then.

144
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
Stop it.

145
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,763
Hello, you haven't even eaten by yours!

146
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:14,132
- This is the worst Halloween candy.
 - Yes!

147
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:18,109
You mean, "Worst disgusting Halloween candy"?

148
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,080
Yes, it was a bit disgusting to eat.

149
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:23,884
- So, why is it red?
 - It's the blood.

150
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,588
"Creepy."
 (scary)

151
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,240
I give this 2 points because I love Halloween.

152
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,122
I give the same, 2 points, because it is a good Halloween candy to give to children who want to run bus or sweets.

153
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:43,440
- eww.
 0 points.
 - "eww."
 He throws eyes here.

154
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:52,040
I give this 2 points too.
 Top pack.
 Funny and perfect for Halloween.

155
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,160
- Crazy.
 - mm.

156
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:58,520
- So, how can you like this?
 - Concink.

157
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:05,040
Concink, says Laura.
 She wants to open one more.
 I think that means she agrees with us.

158
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,629
"Mentos Fanta"

159
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:13,120
It is quite common mento -caramel that are orange.

160
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,631
- Wow!
 - Wow!

161
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,520
- It really tastes Fanta.
 - Yes, it really does.

162
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:24,160
But now you have to put away your eyes.
 What does what you have taste like in your mouth?

163
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,916
Fanta without carbonic acid.

164
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,597
Was it good?

165
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:30,640
Waaah ...

166
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:34,780
I think this tastes just like regular orange mentosis.

167
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,440
No, it doesn't.

168
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,520
That's why I give this 0 points.
 It was just a "rebranding" of an old product.

169
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,040
No, now you're negative.
 This tastes Fanta.
 It gets 3 points from me.

170
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,239
From me it gets 3 points, the same as mom.

171
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:54,840
Of me it gets ...

172
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:56,840
0 points.

173
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,640
- huh?
 - Zero!

174
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,789
You don't like it.

175
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,415
“Crazy Roll-On”

176
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:10,840
It is such a small deodorant that Laura has sat with.

177
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,040
I have "Blue Raspberry" flavor.

178
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,640
- Strawberry.
 - Green apple.

179
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,840
Laura has green apple, and this is "Blue Raspberry."

180
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,840
- "Let's go!"
 (Now we drive!) - "Yes!"
 (Yes!)

181
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,240
- So snapped way to eat sweets.
 - Do you think?

182
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,040
Oh well!
 The one with green apple was so good.

183
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,240
- Oh!
 - Love this one.

184
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,760
Can I taste it?

185
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:41,160
- You like these, then?
 - Yes, I love them.

186
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,703
But it is a useless way to eat.

187
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,640
I also do not take the roll-on thing itself.
 It was like there were some deoflases over in the factory.

188
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,882
- And it sounds so unpleasant.
 - Yes.

189
00:12:55,667 --> 00:13:03,454
- Laura has a good technique.
 - mm.
 Although it runs around the bottle if you turn it up and down on it.

190
00:13:05,404 --> 00:13:11,440
- This I think is one that children like and adults just don't take.
 - No, exactly.

191
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:14,440
- Don't you want it?
 - No, please.

192
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:18,078
I give ... noool!

193
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,699
- Me too.
 0 points.
 - "How could you?"
 (How can you?)

194
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
- huh?
 - Yes.

195
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:26,440
I give 5 points.
 5, 5, 5.

196
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:30,063
- 5, 5, 5!
 - 0, 0, 0!

197
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,200
- 5, 5, 5 ... - 0, 0, 0 ...

198
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,040
- And what should you give, then?
 - 0, 0!

199
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,336
- No, Laura!
 - Three against two.
 It will be 0.

200
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,840
“Milka Oreo”

201
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,040
It is Milka chocolate with small oreo cookies in.

202
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:53,240
♪ (Laura hums) ♪ na-na-na-na-na-na ... na!

203
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,380
Laura is still keeping his eyes on.

204
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,360
But this one was delicious.
 Everyone loves Oreo?

205
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,000
- No.
 - huh?!

206
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,920
I don't like Oreo.

207
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,040
I love Oreo, I love Milka.
 Perfect mixed.
 So, I've eaten this before.
 I love it.

208
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,689
-(Joanna) mm-mm-mm.
 - I think it tastes dust.

209
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,903
- Dust?!
 - You're not like us others.

210
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:26,600
- You're a little pruttis.
 - I'm a little pruttis.
 I am a little pruttis.

211
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:31,040
- I give 4 points.
 - I give 4 points.

212
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,640
I give...

213
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,960
(scary voice) ... 5 points.

214
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:37,440
Five?

215
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,729
Oh, my God.

216
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,685
I give this 1 point.

217
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,960
- Just?
 - Yeah!

218
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:49,876
"XXL Acido Gumetro"

219
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,640
There is some long sausage with ... chewing gum!

220
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,040
- It was angry.
 - Great.

221
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,440
Oh, oh, hey, hey, hey!

222
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,920
- Sour?
 - Oh!

223
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:12,120
- Don't you know?
 - No.
 Yes, now.
 It came late.

224
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,640
- Harry!
 - Nämen, Nähä, you.

225
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,840
Oh God, what a sour.

226
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,840
Here, you can get mine.

227
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,040
Oh!

228
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,960
No.

229
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,600
- Horrible!
 - Ah, I'm crying.

230
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,460
Horrible!

231
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,800
- Eww!
 - Oh, my eye.

232
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:38,520
Eww!

233
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:42,000
- You get sweaty on the eyelids of this candy.
 - You get sweaty everywhere.

234
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,520
I give this chewing gum 3.5 point in terms of taste.

235
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,040
And I actually think this candy deserves "Crazy points."
 I give it 4 "Crazy points."

236
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,068
Yes, it was very "crazy."
 It only gets "crazy points" from me, 2 pieces.
 But 0 for taste.

237
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:06,760
I give the type 4 "Crazy points," For it was pretty "Crazy."
 It looked like shrek-bay.

238
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,119
And then it was like ... The taste of it was not so good, so I give it a third.

239
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:21,895
- mm.
 And Laura, what do you give?
 Is it good to clear your toes with?
 - Why does she have it around her toes, ewww.

240
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:26,440
She sits and cleans between her toes with Alma's chewing gum here.

241
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,640
What do you give, Axel?

242
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:36,240
I give this 0 points.
 But I give it 2 points for the package, so it will be 1 point.

243
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:42,762
"Boom Vampire Extra Sour"

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,464
There are small hard blue candies.

245
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,440
So hard.

246
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,360
Woho!

247
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,840
Oh, how angry it was.

248
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,164
- Woho!
 - Wohoho!

249
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,436

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,040
Oh, you get ...

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,600
- It says "Mouth Painter."
 - You turn completely blue.

252

253
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,600
- (Alma) Ääää.

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,040
- I give this 0 points.
 - huh?!

258
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,680
- Yes, I didn't think it was fun.
 - But it's cranky.

259
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,120
Yes, it was blue and it was very angry.

260
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,221
- Harry, what do you give?
 - I give it 500. I thought it was great to get a blue tongue.

261
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:45,360
Yes.
 I give it 5 points.
 I thought it was good, I thought it was angry, and I thought it was fun that the colored mouth.

262
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
I give it 3 points.

263
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,760
And do you know what?
 This was our last candy and the sun is going down outside.

264
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,120
Yes, so we have to finish and say ...
