1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,920
Now it's like this ...

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,584
Here are our house parts.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,280
- Bibbi!
 - Yes.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,284
Bibbi!

5
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:08,120
No but...

6
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:11,120
What the phase!

7
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:12,800
Don't bump into!

8
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:14,458
No!

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,240
Laura, you have to jump down.

10
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:21,360
- Release Laura.
 - I can not.
 I have to hold the pieces.

11
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:22,657
(Laura + Axel) Aaaah!

12
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,274
Hello Hello!

13
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:35,880
Today we will do ...

14
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:39,985
Gingerbread House CHALLENGE!

15
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:42,200
The world's longest words.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,859
- It is a competition where you have to make a gingerbread house.
 - Yes!

17
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,859
- A nice, fun, lovely, inspiring house.
 - Yes.

18
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,459
- And the one who makes the nicest wins.
 - Exactly like that.

19
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:57,081
- And is the best.
 - Exactly like that.

20
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:59,640
We have divided into two teams.

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,583
I'm a little worried about today's competition, because ...

22
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:11,299
Here in Portugal there are not these finished, type, "Mother Anna's" house that you just put together.

23
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:14,980
- No, exactly.
 - Is it so?

24
00:01:15,096 --> 00:01:18,619
- I think it's called "Grandma Anna".
 - Isn't it just "Anna's gingerbread"?

25
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:19,419
Yes.

26
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:25,869
Nice the same, there is not here.
 Portuguese does not eat and do not build gingerbread houses.

27
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,929
They don't even eat gingerbread at all.

28
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:31,059
- That's how it is.
 - Yes.

29
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:37,539
So we have to start by drawing up what our houses should look like.
 You have prepared a dough.

30
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:46,619
- Yes.
 I made a huge dough kit yesterday, so it's ready.
 - mm.
 And who is the law, then?

31
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,659
- Me and Alma.
 The best team.
 - And me and my mom and Lauris.

32
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:59,480
- huh?
 Do you get help from her?
 - Yes, she is the world's best mascot!
 Wihiii!

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,120
The winning mascot.

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,299
Okay, we split up and start working a bit on the house dreams, then.
 That is why there is so much paper here.

35
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,880
- I think we should go to the kitchen.
 - We go to the kitchen and you stay here.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,823
Schas, schasome!
 Fort, fast!
 Go, go!
 Away!
 Schas, schasome, schasome!

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,676
- Bye!
 - Laura takes nothing.

38
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:26,539
We have had some different ideas.
 At first, Harry thought we would make a horror house.

39
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:28,699
“Poppy Pli Time”

40
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:33,631
- And then you were at a sushi restaurant.
 - mm.

41
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:37,160
Since then we have been thinking a lot about which form-

42
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:43,240
-And concluded that the simplest thing is to just print finished shapes from the net.

43
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,600
So we have done that, and then we will invest more in the decoration itself.

44
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:52,840
And what kind of house will it be?
 Do we know that?

45
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,619
Harry's Toys store!

46
00:02:57,276 --> 00:03:01,200
We'll see.
 We may change again, I think.

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,898
But here we have little Harry anyway, right?
 Do you see that in the light?

48
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:16,939
- Are you filming?
 - (shoulder) mm.

49
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,659
- I didn't even notice.
 - Should you tell me what you are doing?

50
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:26,307
I make a hat for my and dad's mum house.

51
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:28,017
TA-DA!

52
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,120
(Laura screams) "Hugy."

53
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:37,065
Yes, it is scary with the scissors.
 It is very sharp.

54
00:03:38,856 --> 00:03:42,584
No, Harry.
 Bus kid.

55
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:50,219
And you eat sweets even though it's not Saturday.

56
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:55,850
Can you do it?

57
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:05,139
Now it is like this.
 Mom and Harry think we will make a similar gingerbread house as they do ...

58
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,800
Let's see.

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:15,200
... because we have taken these papers.
 But we really have done this for us to put the dough.

60
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:20,800
Here is for the roof.
 Like this.
 Just.

61
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:26,233
And now we will do for the walls themselves.

62
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,059
I just draw here.

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,213
- (Harry) Alma?
 - Mm?

64
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:41,599
- Which bit should we get?
 - This one, I think.

65
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:47,000
- Ah, the big one.
 - huh?
 I thought they were the same size.

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,219
(Joanna) get to see.

67
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:54,553
- (Alma) Yes, these are just as big.
 - (Harry) type.

68
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
(Alma) So there!

69
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,944
(Joanna) Time to roll.

70
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,081
♪ (music) ♪

71
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,353
Here are our house parts.

72
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,557
- (Joanna) Are you satisfied?
 - Yes.

73
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:21,763
- We only miss the chimney.
 It is in the oven.
 - Yes.

74
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,936
Yeah, what's that?

75
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,613
- Mom.
 - Yes, but you have to take out the pacifier if we should hear what you say.

76
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:32,219
No?
 You don't want to show it.

77
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:38,160
Stop, stop, stop!
 Harry, you should probably save it from Laura.

78
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:41,840
So!
 Away!

79
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:46,820
(Axel) None!

80
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:50,349
What is going on?

81
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:55,779
Our house parts crack and break ... and roll off.

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,253
- You make so advanced!
 - This will never go.

83
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:04,607
Never say never.

84
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:06,400
Don't bump into!

85
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:08,168
No!

86
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:16,543
Alma, what should we do?
 Oh no!

87
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,779
You may do a new part.

88
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:24,000
No!
 This must be possible to cook.
 Everything can be cooked, especially in Portugal.
 We have seen that.

89
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,520
Everything can be cooked with glaze.

90
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,692
The houses are oblique and wind, and they can still cook.

91
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:38,000
- Laura broke our freshly baked chimney.
 - Laura, your little bus!

92
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:43,880
It can probably get together anyway, I think.
 I hope.
 Now we have all our pieces.

93
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,059
God, what I look like in my hair.
 It's so hot when standing by the oven, or what do you say?

94
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:54,000
- Yes.
 - You also look a little ... weather bite.

95
00:07:54,378 --> 00:08:04,400
We started to try to put together our pieces with cold stuff like this "baking glue".
 Was it a good idea?

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,080
- No.
 - No, a very poor idea.
 So now we have had it in a water bath.

97
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:15,800
God, how I sit ... This with having Laura in your team, I think you should get a little handicap for.

98
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,338
Should we put it together now, with warm things like that "baking glue"?

99
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
Mm.

100
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:23,102
Drive a little there.

101
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:27,400
Now it's easier, huh?

102
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:33,498
- Is it still a little hard?
 - Yes, wait ... so, now.

103
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,917
Okay.
 Before it had been in a water bath it was stiff.

104
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,459
Oh, wait.

105
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,800
So, then we have some glue.
 And so we put there.

106
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,014
Oooh, two walls.

107
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,761
So we can put one like that too.

108
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:56,139
- No no no!
 - Don't take it.

109
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:58,619
- Do you want it?
 - mm.

110
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,190
- Oh!
 - Of course she wants to.

111
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:12,175
- We can take it there.
 - Yes.
 I wonder how long it will take for it to dry.
 It does not stand.

112
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:19,019
Oooh ... This is our site, with a door.
 It should be there.
 Should we glue on it?

113
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,424
Yes.

114
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:24,659
- I think this one went pretty smoothly now.
 - Yes.

115
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,173
That's how it looks.

116
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:35,506
Yes, you want it.
 But we need it as a small weight there.

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,853
Aaah!

118
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:44,748
Okay, take it.
 Should you jump down and go to Dad and Alma maybe?

119
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,779
I just, "Hello then."
 So now.
 Now, Harry.

120
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:55,619
- (Axel) This is going to be our roof.
 - Without the aluminum foil, then.

121
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:58,683
Yes, the goal is for us to be able to lift it.

122
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:03,059
But then, this will not be able to dry today, I do not know how ...

123
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,720
(Joanna) This is the world's best day for Laura.

124
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,516
She just walks and poles and fixes, and she loved to hold on and roll.

125
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:19,368
(Shoulder) Gullungen.
 Oh, are you going to bake muffins now?

126
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,480
This is going to be interesting.

127
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:31,800
- Yes, now you should also start putting together.
 - Yes.
 But then ...

128
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:34,160
- (Laura) Mom!
 - Mom is here.

129
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,690
I have never made such an advanced ...

130
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,988
Oh, now I see that we get chopped heads.
 Maybe we should raise the camera.

131
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:47,720
We have to sit down.
 I'll pick up more parts, Alma.

132
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,099
- There is an incredibly high level of ambition on your part.
 - Yes Yes.

133
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:57,548
We lowered the requirements instead.
 We only took the drawing from the net.

134
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:02,189
Oh, they are different high.

135
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:07,370
Huh?
 How could they be?
 They are cut out of the same piece.

136
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:11,000
No, but this ... This is going to be so good.

137
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:12,651
Mm.

138
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:16,000
Harry, I need your help.
 The roof.

139
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,371
I take the most durable bit.

140
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,835
Wait, wait, wait!

141
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:24,219
Do not touch.

142
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:28,594
- Harry, I need your help.
 - This will never go.

143
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:32,400
Stop laughing at that ghosts!

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,760
You hear the panic.
 It is clean and cut.

145
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:44,139
- No no no!
 - Oh my God!
 Laura ... Laura, you have to jump down.

146
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:47,480
- Release Laura.
 - I can not.
 I have to hold the pieces.

147
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:49,391
(Laura + Axel) Aaaah!

148
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:52,622
(Harry hum loudly)

149
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:53,885
Silent!

150
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:57,960
Our gingerbread house is starting to feel more and more like dough.

151
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:01,264
Yes, the pieces feel a little wet.

152
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,418
No!

153
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,499
- Oh.
 You have to wait with your old man, Harry.
 - My old man broke my leg.

154
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:10,040
Harry focuses only on his old man while I fight with the house.

155
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,560
- He amputated his own leg, with diligence.
 - Yes.

156
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:19,310
I talked to a parent we know at the Swedish school here in Portugal-

157
00:12:19,524 --> 00:12:21,760
-And told us we should make gingerbread houses.

158
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:31,855
He said, "Then you have to hurry on because they don't last that long. They like collapse because of the humidity."

159
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:37,379
And it seems to be true.
 It is much more humid here, indoors as well.

160
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:42,899
In Sweden, a gingerbread house can keep all winter.
 But here, forget it.

161
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:44,903
Here it lasts barely a week.

162
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:47,139
No...

163
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,254
What the phase!

164
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,560
No!

165
00:12:52,795 --> 00:12:55,440
No!
 Gosh...

166
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:59,842
The name, what messy.
 Should I help you?

167
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:03,584
- No.
 - It is too late.

168
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:08,400
(Joanna sighs)

169
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:12,748
We have no entrance to the house, Alma.

170
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:15,561
♪ (music) ♪

171
00:13:49,606 --> 00:13:52,023
We are done!

172
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,000
- Woho!
 - Or, almost clear.

173
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,704
The sun goes down 17:20 in Portugal.

174
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,195
Beah!
 Beah!
 Beah!

175
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:05,079
- (shoulder) more?
 More gingerbread houses?
 - (Laura) mm.

176
00:14:05,202 --> 00:14:08,400
- No thanks.
 We are done.
 - Yes.

177
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,520
We have stood in the brightest house ...

178
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,160
No.

179
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,441
... the brightest room in the whole house to show ...

180
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,720
- Our creations.
 - Yes.

181
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,640
- Why did you do that?
 - Nothing.
 It's just so hot.

182
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:30,440
Yes, from the oven earlier.
 This has been one of our hottest, sweatiest and stressful ...

183
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:31,640
And the scariest.

184
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,800
- ... recordings.
 - Yes.

185
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,600
- But when we cut, it probably doesn't look so awful.
 - No.

186
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,462
- Okay.
 Who is starting to present their house?
 - Me and mom.

187
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,744
- Okay.
 - And Lauris.

188
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,480
- (Laura) mm.
 - (Joanna) etc.

189
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,766
- You remember the story?
 - I remember the story.
 I will move forward the house and you should tell.

190
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,691
There was once a toy store called "Harry's Toys".

191
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,646
And it was created by Harry itself.

192
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Although one beautiful day the roof collapsed, and then it was run.

193
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:20,641
So he drove to give all the presents to the children who lived in the city.

194
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:27,200
Ever since then it is called Harrys ...

195
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,976
- (Alma) ruin.
 - ... ruin.

196
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,400
- Good!
 - This is how it looks.

197
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,560
- Right.
 The roof was difficult to get on.
 - Unbelievable.

198
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:42,001
It just slid off.

199
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,400
It was once a happy Moomin family that lived in a large Moomin house.

200
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:53,000
They loved Christmas, and just this Christmas they had bought really many gifts.

201
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,436
But some burglars entered and took all the presents.

202
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,800
After all, the Moomin Family was very passed, so they left.

203
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,716
Then the roof collapsed, and pretty much the whole house type broke.

204
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:16,600
Yes, and now we don't know who lives here.
 There is some Christmas tree lighting and other things here.

205
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,080
- Exactly.
 Every winter they light up.
 - Yes.

206
00:16:21,224 --> 00:16:26,782
- Here you can see tracks from the burglary.
 - Yes, there is a ladder here.

207
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,645
Now it is you at home who decide who has won today's "Challenge"!

208
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,440
Yes.

209
00:16:33,544 --> 00:16:36,971
- Team Harry, or ... - Team Alma.

210
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,374

211

212
