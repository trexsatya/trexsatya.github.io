1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,660
- Good morning.
 - Good morning.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,940
How are you?

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,900
- Good.
 - Good.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,640
What is happening today?

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,680
- We will go to swimming school.
 - Yes.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,920
I go on the brand stakeholders and he walks on the bats.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,120
- What are the brand stakeholders?
 - You swim and take marks.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,620
- Is it hard?
 - Yes.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:38,740
I will swim 8 meters underwater, so I will dive 8 meters, and it is very difficult.

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,200
- Do you do it, then?
 - No, but I'll do it today.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,020
I have promised myself.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:54,540
- Alma, did you say exactly 800 meters?
 - No!
 8 meters.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,440
I thought you said 800 meters!

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,800
Swim 800 meters underwater, then you die.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,880
- How is Dad, then?
 - Not good.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,900
- He is a little pain, he has stabbed his neck.
 - Yes.

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,320
Dad, are you doing well?

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,940
Yes I am fine.
 I have a little pain in my neck only.
 I lie here and rest.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,840
If you follow our Instagram then you know that Dad Axel injured his neck when we were at a trampoline park.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,640
Yes.

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,060
We didn't film a vlog then, we were just there to jump and bounce.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,700
Mm.

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,200
- And then Axel would make a backwards down into a foam pit.
 - mm.

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,860
And I stood and filmed with the cellphone.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,140
Yes.

27
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,660
It hurt my neck so I really thought that something had broken, so I didn't dare move.

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,760
The staff believed that too called 112, and then came an ambulance.

29
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,480
Ambulance could not get yourself up, then the fire brigade came.
 It was totally crazy!

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:20,800
Four firefighters and two ambulance personnel lifted me up on a stretcher with a lot of Velcro, type.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,960
We have got a lot of time on the day's question on Instagram about how you feel.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,400
I went to the hospital and was x -rayed.
 They saw that nothing was wrong, so I had to go home.

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,260
- So now we have a little ... what do you say?
 Stucking dad.
 - Yes.

34
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,720
- But you shouldn't be all day?
 - No no.

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,900
- You have to move a little.
 - Yes some.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,680
We will fix a picnic and go to the lake.

37
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,800
First it is Harry's swimming school, and then Alma's brand recipient.

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,260
- mm.
 - mm.

39
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,760
What a sunny day.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,600
- Nice, huh?
 - Yes.

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,660
- We are not spoiled with the sun.
 - No.

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,340
- It's been pretty bad weather in July.
 - Yes.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,260
- We're a little late.
 You may run into your group, Harry.
 - Yes.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:26,680
- I can't jump the bomb so well.
 - No, it can ... it ... it ... I know that.

45
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,880
- Although I can float.
 - Yes you can.
 You are good at that.
 You are great on that.

46
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,360
Hello Hello!

47
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,020
Now the swimming school children heat up.

48
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,800
Other directions, the other way!

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,080
- Come all my little kids!
 - How?

50
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,360
Like little old man, gallop!

51
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,260
Good!

52
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,540
Good, Harry!

53
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,820
It's not very hot.

54
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,060
Harry, you have to eat properly after swimming school.
 You were very capable after all.

55
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,780
- I'm freezing.
 - I understand that you are freezing.
 It's not a huge gun.

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,200
No.
 Only the sun is warming.

57
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,240
- Alma, soon it's your turn to jump in. - No!

58
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,400
- Yes!
 - No!

59
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,240
- Yes!
 - No!

60
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,940
- Nice, Alma!
 You are very close.
 Here I am.
 - Oh!

61
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,800
- You've been there.
 - It's too far away!
 And it's harder than I thought.

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,780
You can do it!
 Just push away properly from the bridge.
 Press away properly from the dock.

63
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,360
- Oh, check out how far you came!
 Now you got even further.
 - You're so close!

64
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,920
It is very giant.

65
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,500
Come on, Alma!

66
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,820
Swim, Alma.
 Swim.
 Continue.

67
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,480
Oh, check out!
 Do you see?
 Where are you?

68
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,460
No!

69
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,900
It was great!

70
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,260
I give up.

71
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,160
It was a little cold in the water but I still dived.

72
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,240
- Give a towel here!
 - Oh oh oh!
 Here you go.

73
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,020
She couldn't do it, she was really aware!

74
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,200
Yes, but then, that you dive from the edge and that you do not hold for your nose, Alma.
 It is absolutely incredible!

75
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm really impressed.

76
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,960
Oh!
 Harry massages my neck ... which I have so much pain.

77
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:30,360
He is actually very good at massaging.
 He takes in his whole body as well.

78
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,080
It is very nice, Harry.

79
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,640
You can make money like this, by massaging me.
 Did you know that?

80
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,220
I don't want to make money, it's just that I want to watch.

81
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,700
Well.
 But then you can serve a look minute.

82
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,900
I want to watch Youtube and play.

83
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,300
Obviously he wants it.
 Well, all children want it.

84
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,300
We have gone to Gustavsberg to wash our car.

85
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,060
Or, it's not really our car.

86
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,220
We have a collaboration with Mitsubishi who lends this pearl to us over the summer.

87
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,960
And I never want to return it.

88
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,300
We go on a road trip with this.

89
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,620
So it is a plug-in hybrid which means we can only take a cord ... into our electrical outlet.

90
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:56,080
Then we can drive for 4 miles and when the electricity runs out we drive on gasoline.
 It's absolutely amazing, I'm in love with it.

91
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,700
Now that we live in the countryside we almost only drive on electricity.

92
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,860
It's absolutely fantastic!
 It is great for nature.

93
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,740
- You should suck in here.
 - Yes!

94
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,440
- It's really great.
 - Can I suck?

95
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,080
Yes.

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,800
This is how we will do more with the children.
 They will be able to work more this summer.

97
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,100
So.
 Thanks and ticks.

98
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:30,160
Since Dad Axel is injured and behind the camera he is our supervisor now, children.
 Listen to him.

99
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,520
- Okay.
 Then you help mom remove everything from the car.
 - Okay!

100
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,800
You can put this on.

101
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,580
- Should this be thrown away?
 - Just put that.

102
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,400
Look what I succeeded in!
 I picked it up all by myself.
 I pressed the button up there.

103
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,280
Good!

104
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,940
- Oh, Dad has packed down car cleaning stuff.
 - Yes.

105
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,760
How good cargo space?

106
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,420
- Look!
 My phone.
 - It's not yours, it's Dad's.

107
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,680
- But that's my shell.
 - Alma has not received her first phone yet.

108
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,420
- Harry, are you prepared?
 - Yes.

109
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,340
- That one will start to suck.
 - Yes.

110
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,440
- Okay, hold it.
 Look at it.
 - Yes.

111
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,940
Now I stop!

112
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,900
- Now the inside of the car is clean.
 - Yay!

113
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,140
Good job, everyone.

114
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,220
- And I found money on the ground!
 SEK 5.
 - How nice.

115
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,900
- You're rich.
 - Yes, worst Lyllo.

116
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,240
Now we will drive a giant card and then we will wash the outside of the car.

117
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,140
If you wash the car then I can build a hut with you a little later.

118
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,380
- Yes!
 - Kurrisin ...

119
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,820
- "Kurrisin" ... Kurrisin Frances comes over.
 - Yes.

120
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,580
Cousin.

121
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes, I know - cousin.
 I have a little trouble talking, you know how I am.

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,460
- Sometimes you stumble on the words.
 - Do you really manage to build with your neck?

123
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:34,040
Eeh ... Yes, it feels pretty good.
 I'm a little stiff, but I think I can be a supervisor there too.

124
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,980
Here I have found.

125
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,900
Top, Harry!
 This will be great.

126
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,820
- Here I have found!
 - Oh, what good.

127
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:34,060
- Mine wasn't that big.
 - No, though mine was very big.

128
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,340
You can use all planks when building a hut.

129
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,000
You do not have to follow any rules.
 You can build with any planks.

130
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,740
- Dad, take this.
 - Yes, we will probably use it for something well soon.

131
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,840
- And then we'll find a door.
 - Just that, the door.

132
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,000
- The blue door.
 - mm, the blue door.

133
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,980
- It's behind Brännhögen.
 - Yes, you can try to see if you can lift it.

134
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,940
Here I have found a plank!

135
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:09,800
The blue door that Harry talks about is the door to our old playhouse that I have been torn recently.

136
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,300
I actually made a time Lapse on it so we might be able to put this in.

137
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,560
That one, yes!

138
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,440
Now I found something that should be on the floor.
 This should be on the floor.

139
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,080
- Harry found something on the floor.
 - How nice.

140
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,120
- Although there were two nails.
 - Well, oh.

141
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,640
Yes, it happens to be.
 It was just that.

142
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,020
Ah!
 Oh...

143
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,240
God, how heavy.
 I have to release it and then I have to wear it.

144
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,200
Lol!

145
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,140
It went well.
 Dad!
 Dad!

146
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,960
NEM GOD, HARRY!
 Beware so you don't hurt yourself.

147
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,160
- Strong, huh?
 - Very strong!

148
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,680
- Much stronger than you.
 - Yes, a lot.

149
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,440
Oh, don't crush your feet.
 Ah!
 Oh oh oh.

150
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,800
- There.
 - We can build it.

151
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,340
Now I can't bear to carry anymore.
 That one can be on the floor.

152
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,440
- Should it also be on the floor?
 - Yes, for it ...

153
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,100
- Now we have planks to the floor, I think.
 - Yes.

154
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,780
We will continue with this tomorrow.

155
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,780
- Do you think so?
 - Yes.

156
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,220
Okay, then we're laying down now.

157
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,820
Now it's time to sleep.

158
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,840
How does it feel in the neck, Dad?

159
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,600
It feels very stiff.
 But it gets better and better.

160
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:48,120
I have no problems with it, that it hurts so, because I am so grateful that it went well.

161
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,100
So am I.

162
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,640
Thanks for watching this video!
