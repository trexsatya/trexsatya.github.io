1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:02,792
What much warmer it was here.

2
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:09,421
Now I'm going to mount a water filter for this family.

3
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:12,010
This can save many lives.

4
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:16,347
Yes, you have to go in.
 They say you have to go in.

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:20,305
(English) Here, you can take one.

6
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:24,353
I get tears in my eyes from this.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,368
- Why?
 - There will be so much emotion.

8
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:48,839
It is early morning, it is seven o'clock.
 We are at Wilson Airport and we are outside the MAF hangar.

9
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,941
We shall go...

10
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:54,344
Do you know where to go somewhere?

11
00:00:54,677 --> 00:01:01,516
We will go to a place called Log Logo, and it is located in northern Kenya.

12
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:07,521
We will go there with water filters and see how they live and have it.

13
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:10,135
Listen, Pruttis.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,030
These are the buckets that will be included.
 And here are the lids of them.

15
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:27,670
You fill the bucket with dirty water and then you put in ... water purifier.

16
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:29,271
- Is it so?
 - Yes.

17
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:34,208
Water purifier.
 And then it comes out clean water.
 It as well as filters the water.

18
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:37,144
- Great!
 - Yes, it's superb, really.

19
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:44,350
- Pure water is a matter of course for most Swedes.
 - Yes, but here it really is not.

20
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:50,021
- No.
 And it spreads a lot of diseases.
 Unclean water.
 - So this can save many lives.

21
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,888
Yes.

22
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:57,293
And now you are in "check-in area."
 Harry, it's a little different from a big airport, huh?

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,161
Yes.

24
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:02,698
- What have you done here, exactly?
 - We have weighed.

25
00:02:02,865 --> 00:02:06,367
But Harry did something strange about the wave so it's weird now.

26
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,937
Oh, it stands at minus.
 Then maybe you have to do so there.

27
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,473
So there, now you can stand, Harry.
 Weigh you in.

28
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,076
No, you don't have to do it again.
 You have already done it.
 But it is very important when you go ...

29
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,811
I weigh 33.80.

30
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:22,680
Yes.
 It is great that they are in control of-

31
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:27,084
Or, it is important that they are in control of your weight when you go with a small propeller plane.

32
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:30,420
Yes, so it doesn't get really strange ...

33
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:33,355
- Uneven weight.
 - Yes.

34
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,364
Paula and Flora are with us today, but the rest of the family is in school and jobs.

35
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:48,501
- Yes.
 Ulrik is not in school.
 - No, he's at work.

36
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:52,003
Yes, he works from home today.

37
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:48,332
- What much warmer it was here.
 - Yes indeed.

38
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:53,285
A newly awake Laura.

39
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:58,890
The trip here took almost 2 hours.
 We are far up, in northern Kenya, now.

40
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,094
Jump off, Laura.
 You can only be one at a time here.

41
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,200
So!

42
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,032
Finally on the ground, Laura.

43
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:12,434
There is a bunch of children on the other side.

44
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,803
(English) - Hello!
 I'm fine how are you?
 - Good.
 Hi, my name is meshack.

45
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,539
(English) - Nice to meet!
 My name is Joanna.
 - Welcome.

46
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,807
(English) - Nice to meet.
 My name is Axel.
 - Meshack.

47
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:24,343
(English) - Hello.
 - Hello.

48
00:04:25,488 --> 00:04:29,014
Oh, Laura!
 Do you dare to take in hand?

49
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:31,682
(English) Hello!

50
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:42,292
- They think you are very nice.
 - Yes.
 Laura is most exotic of all of us.

51
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:46,361
- Yes, she really is.
 - She is the most fun for all the kids.

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,765
Then I think this is that she wants a pacifier, I don't think they know what it is right.

53
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:57,670
Or, they may know what it is, but there is nothing anyone here has.

54
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:07,945
(English) - How is it?
 - Well thanks.
 Self?

55
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:09,759
(English) Good.

56
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:15,617
(English) - Oh, strong.
 - Strong man.

57
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:28,761
Now the tassels are very uneven, but you get two tassels anyway.

58
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,696
So.

59
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,668
So.

60
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,342
- So!
 - See, Laura.

61
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,815
- Lots of children.
 - Yes, there are lots of children here now.

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,353
- Where should we put it?
 - Here's back.

63
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,040
- Here's the back?
 - I think so.

64
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:14,431
Oh, Laura!
 Have you found a new friend?

65
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,832
(English) Thank you very much.

66
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:21,736
How lovely!
 Someone else who could carry on you.

67
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:29,609
Now we are on our way home to a family that will get a water filter.

68
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:36,148
- Are you going to install that, maybe?
 - Yes, I think I should demonstrate how it works.

69
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:38,483
I've read a little neighbor.

70
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,751
I'm sitting with a ...

71
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:42,381
Well, now we're there.

72
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:46,089
It is a box here and it is very hot, but it was no long journey.

73
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,025
(English) - Shall we jump out?
 - Yes.

74
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,539
Very special house.

75
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:11,876
The people who live in this region are called Rendille.

76
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:15,479
Last trip we met the massage.

77
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:21,817
This is another people who live here in northern Kenya, and this is their traditional house.

78
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:26,354
There are just a lot of sticks like walls and then they have the plastic skins of different strokes-

79
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:29,890
-To protect yourself from rain and sun.

80
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,362
- "uaua" go there.
 (Laura) - Yes, you go there.
 It's so cranky.

81
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:42,700
What a rocky ground!
 It must be so difficult to grow here.

82
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:47,004
- Impossible.
 - Yes.

83
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,808
So this are the ones who live here?

84
00:07:52,875 --> 00:08:00,016
- Oh what a nice photo, Paula.
 - What colors, huh?
 It's just difficult because it's such shadows.

85
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:04,263
(Joanna) Yes, you have to go in.
 They say you have to go in.

86
00:08:09,276 --> 00:08:13,692
There is very low ceilings.
 It almost feels like a dollhouse.

87
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,627
(Harry) Laura, put it back.

88
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:19,496
- tea?
 - Yes, they probably drink tea there.
 But you should not drink tea here.

89
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,164
(Harry) right?

90
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:26,940
You get to see the most how they feel.
 Do you see?
 The fabric on the walls, Laura.
 Do you see that?

91
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:32,874
Here is a bedroom.
 With real beds.

92
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,878
Yes, a little different than at the massages where they slept on cowhide.

93
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,963
This was fine.
 What a nice roof!

94
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:47,852
(English) Thank you very much for showing us your home.

95
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:53,790
- Laura wants to go back in.
 - Yes.
 She thinks it's more fun in there.

96
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:05,366
Now I'm going to mount a water filter for this family.

97
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:16,275
And it includes a bucket and this plastic bag from Water Matters that MAF collaborates with.

98
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:21,512
In this water bag there is everything you need to install this water filter.

99
00:09:21,704 --> 00:09:24,681
You start with a small drill.

100
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:31,620
It is a very ordinary drill that you put in a drill.
 But now we do not have it, and it is very rare you have it.

101
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,356
Then you should drill a hole in this bucket.

102
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:49,680
And then you have to scrape away some plastic ...

103
00:09:51,869 --> 00:10:01,010
And then you make ... the nozzle and a pack.

104
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:07,282
And then you screw the screw on the inside.

105
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:11,685
Everything can be done with hand power, as I said.

106
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:16,823
- Smart invention, huh?
 - Yes, very.
 And simple too.

107
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:22,228
And then you take your hose and attach, so.

108
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:26,723
At the other end of the hose we put it here.

109
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,618
So.
 And then comes the water filter itself, and this water filter ...

110
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:39,140
You do not consume it but you reflect it with clean water, it is very important.

111
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:44,211
Then you fill this bucket with dirty water.

112
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,147
It is important to put the filter in the right direction.

113
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,749
And then at the other end, it slowly runs out completely clean water.

114
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:57,355
When there is a stop reversing the filter, and then you can start using it again.

115
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,387
(English) - Where does this water come from?
 - From a water reservoir south.

116
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:12,500
- And that's not clean.
 - No.
 It contains hair and algae.

117
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,711
Okay.

118
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:38,020
- You are a little curious about what they say.
 - Yes, the giant sneaky.
 They talk about the technology.

119
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:41,623
- (Laura) Bath there.
 - No, not swim there, Laura.

120
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:47,228
That water is dirty and it should be purified now, so people can drink it without getting sick.

121
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:50,097
Do we have any cup, then?
 Or a glass?

122
00:11:53,032 --> 00:12:00,805
- Okay water?
 - Yes, now the water is clean, Laura.
 When it comes out of the filter.

123
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:11,525
(English) Is it okay?
 Great.

124
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,849
(English) Top.

125
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,927
- What a thing!
 - Yes, what a thing.

126
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:20,354
(The camels are grunt)

127
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:26,692
They look so happy.
 They have as well as upstairs.

128
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:30,896
- But then, isn't it an exciting pasture they have built?
 - Yes.

129
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:33,564
With bare branches.

130
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:36,033
- Figured branches.
 - Figured branches.

131
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,868
- But very small, maybe.
 - Yes.

132
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:44,940
- They seem a little nervous.
 - Yes.
 They may not like to be in front of the camera.

133
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:47,580
(The camels are grunt)

134
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:52,280
- Probably not.
 - Or they have a stomach ache.

135
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,550
- Do you think they are fine, Laura?
 - Yes.

136
00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:01,620
So, I am getting crazy about Laura having a pacifier in her mouth all the time.

137
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,755
But then just recently she picked up a stone.

138
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,891
Then she removed the pacifier and was about to put the stone in her mouth.

139
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:09,893
I just, "No, no, no. Back with pacifier, back with pacifier."

140
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,974
I never thought I would say, Laura.
 But now ... pacifier feels totally okay.

141
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:25,005
Now they will milk the camel.

142
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,160
Don't want to try, Harry?

143
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,416
Did not work, eww.

144
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:41,810
- Axel, should you test, then?
 - Yes, I can test.

145
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,356
- Now the kid wants instead.
 - Check out, now it's competition.

146
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:52,600
(English) - No, no, no.
 - (shoulder) not?

147
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:00,900
(English) It's good.
 It is good.

148
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,668
It is sweet.

149
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:11,809
They give the camel milk to younger children here.
 He just said, "It's Full of Nutrition."
 Thus, nutrients.

150
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:12,409
Yes.

151
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,478
And it is really no stranger than drinking cow's milk.

152
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:17,947
- (Get Break) - Oh!

153
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:22,284
Have you seen?
 Do you want to pat it?

154
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:27,288
- It's really cute!
 - Check out, you can peel ear.

155
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:56,184
What a welcome!
 Incredible!

156
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:00,347
How cool.

157
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,556
- Wow!
 - Great welcoming.

158
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:16,427
Yes.
 We have come to a place where we will have lunch.

159
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:17,761
(English) Hello!

160
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:21,698
We had no idea that this was waiting for us.

161
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,300
Oh, what a nice thing.

162
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:28,003
I will go with you.
 I'm here.

163
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:39,736
Should we sing along, Alma?

164
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:43,815
Stop it.

165
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:48,886
I know, I'm embarrassing.
 And very sweaty.
 But I'm happy.
 This was fantastic!

166
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:51,354
Yes indeed.

167
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,093
- I get tears in my eyes from this.
 - Why?

168
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:03,607
There will be so much emotion!
 There will be so much emotion.

169
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,320
(English) - Wow, thank you very much!
 - Thanks!
 Wow!

170
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:28,685
(Alma) Oh, wow!

171
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:46,365
Should the women get water filters?

172
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:53,003
Yes.
 All the women come from different villages around here, so they will get water filters.

173
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:58,074
And then there are some of their children here that we should take the opportunity to give some of the stuff to.

174
00:16:58,141 --> 00:17:02,944
And then they have to think about what they think they will need.

175
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:05,079
"Part of the stuff."
 What kind of stuff, Alma?

176
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:10,884
After all, we have cleaned out lots of toys and toys and stuff, so we will give to the kids here.

177
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:12,685
- And some clothes.
 - Yes, and some clothes.

178
00:17:12,753 --> 00:17:17,222
- and shoes.
 - and shoes.
 But a lot of toys, at least.

179
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:21,492
Laura probably comes "freaka" out of a little, but it's stuff she doesn't even play with anymore-

180
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,843
-So she will kind of forget about it.
 And these need it more.

181
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,469
- These water filters make a huge difference ... - Yes.

182
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:37,338
... in this area where they have such bad water.

183
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:41,408
We were just told that the little place we visited ...

184
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,146
... there are eight households, and they are around 30 people living there, children and adults.

185
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:52,284
And with such a filter, they can get clean drinking water all.

186
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,422
It is so common with diseases, and in the worst case they die from dirty water.

187
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:02,492
Yes.
 Throughout this region with six large villages ...

188
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,093
She awards.

189
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,897
... a total of 6,000 people who are affected and who use the same water sources.

190
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,898
They have two boreholes with clean water.

191
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:16,669
But when it is drought people go to places where animals drink and then you get a lot of illnesses.

192
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:19,272
It is not uncommon for people to die.

193
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:24,609
MAF flies out these water filters.

194
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:32,415
MAF collaborates with many aid organizations, but is the enabler for help to arrive.

195
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:33,816
Yes exactly.

196
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:44,358
So now it's a QR code on the screen here.
 If you open Swish you can donate a little gift.

197
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:49,496
Yes.
 Such a filter costs about SEK 400 \ HKR.

198
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:55,834
But then the transport itself is out to these incredibly distant places ...

199
00:18:55,967 --> 00:19:01,704
But I think as always: many streams small.
 What if everyone watching this video gives 1 \ Hkrona?

200
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:02,272
Yes.

201
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:07,677
- There will be many water filters and transport, I promise you.
 - Yes.

202
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:11,613
- Why did I hold here?
 - I do not know.
 You paw a little at me.

203
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,417
- I felt your heart.
 - Oh, I'm kissing your glasses.

204
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:17,618
God...

205
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:21,821
- We have never done anything like this before.
 It feels a bit ... - It's a lot of emotions.

206
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:26,892
Yes.
 You feel so insecure when you are in such a place.
 You don't know ...

207
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:32,630
On the one hand, we do not know how it will land with you.
 But at the same time it feels just right.

208
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:38,470
We feel very privileged because we have been given the chance to follow this trip.

209
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:44,673
- Really.
 - To see how it is actually too much people on earth.

210
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:51,011
(English) - here!
 You can take one!
 - Yes!

211
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:06,156
(English please!
 - Thanks!

212
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:09,559
(English please.

213
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,028
Shall we go in?

214
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:43,553
We're back in ...

215
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:44,687
Oh!

216
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:46,688
... Nairobi.

217
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:48,757
It was very ...

218
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:54,130
- I'm hurt there.
 - Are you in pain there?
 Why?
 Have you bitten?

219
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:55,896
- Yes.
 - Oops.

220
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:59,899
After all, it was a very quick finish in Log Logo.

221
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,468
- Yes indeed.
 - Why was it so, then?

222
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:09,940
So ... the pilot suddenly said that we have to go now, otherwise we will be stuck here another night.

223
00:21:10,074 --> 00:21:12,342
It started raining.

224
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:18,881
It started out as a bit of a neighbor and then it was really in a hurry before it started to rain.

225
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:21,016
Yes.

226
00:21:21,635 --> 00:21:26,420
But in conclusion, we got really nice stuff from them.

227
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:29,155
- Yes indeed.
 - Are you going to try this one?

228
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:36,294
We would have checked before if it was quiet that we brought the children's outdated shoes and toys they did not play with and so.

229
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:40,600
And they thought so.
 But then it became like a barter.

230
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,803
I mean, what is obvious to us, to go to a shoe store or a toy store, there is not there.

231
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,873
Which of course you understand.
 You've seen the video.

232
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:54,409
But this, we can't get hold of it.

233
00:21:54,475 --> 00:21:56,944
- You get it.
 - And we got that.

234
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,480
- You on it.
 - Yes, this one was actually for you, Laura.
 Should I have it?

235
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,682
TA-DA!

236
00:22:02,841 --> 00:22:06,285
Oh wow!
 The family's own massage.

237
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,888
- Not massage - they are rendille.
 - Yes exactly!

238
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,224
- The massages had the same blankets.
 - I know.

239
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,561
We have learned so much on this trip.
 I had no idea.
 I had no idea before we got here.

240
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,897
Really.
 Don't ruin it!
 Don't ruin it!

241
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:26,167
- But I think this is a foot link.
 - Yes, but she has to address this first.

242
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:29,870
- Well.
 - We put it on your foot.

243
00:22:30,004 --> 00:22:37,343
But Alma, this is our last vlog from Africa.
 How would you summarize Kenya and what we have been through?

244
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:41,212
So, so educational!
 We really have, like ...

245
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:43,281
We have met so many, as well as ...

246
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:53,622
We have met so many people that we have never met, who are so different, but still similar.

247
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:58,226
I also think that the meetings are what will remain in one.

248
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,027
Really.

249
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:06,166
With people and animals and everything that is new to us and cool.

250
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:09,268
This is not the last time we are in Africa.

251
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:11,603
- No.
 - No, really not.

252
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:19,676
Thanks for watching this video!

253
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:24,747
