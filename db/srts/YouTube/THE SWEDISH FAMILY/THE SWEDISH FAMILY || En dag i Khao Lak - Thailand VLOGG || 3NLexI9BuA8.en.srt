1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning.
 We are in Thailand.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,860
- Should we go and have breakfast?
 - Yes!

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,260
- Shall we go?
 - Nah.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,380
Don't want to go and have breakfast?
 I want to go and have breakfast.

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,980
It was boring.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,980
- I think you need something in your stomach.
 - No, it's just boring.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,980
- But do you know what we can do on the road?
 - No.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,800
Feed the fish!

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,940
Come on!
 They are hungry anyway, even if you are not.

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,620
Okay then.

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,120
You should not throw too little, and you should not throw too much.

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,680
Because then it will ... end quickly.

13
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,180
- Should I refill yours?
 - Yes.

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,280
Oh god, they are completely crazy.

15
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,520
So you can do this every morning and afternoon.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,320
Harry does not have the best morning mood, but I think this helps a little.

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,600
- Yes indeed!
 - A little more fun morning.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,700
He became ... he like ...

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,440
Yes, but ... he had to think of something else.

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
- Now we have breakfast!
 - Yes.

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,680
Fruit and muesli for breakfast.
 Super good!

22
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,880
Harry eats strawberry yogurt with chocolate flakes.

23
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,640
Is it good?

24
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh.

25
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,540
- He needs help drying his mouth.
 - Remove it, remove it!

26
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,680
Yes, take it easy.
 I come with a napkin.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,960
The napkin ambulance.

28
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Okay?

29
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,720
Harry gets a little stressed sometimes ...

30
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,680
... when it gets a little messy.

31
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,080
The children have already jumped in.

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,580
There are several pools at this hotel, but this children's area is Alma and Harry's favorite.

33
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,600
Listen, now I come!
 What happened to the crocodile?

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,800
Should I put you out?

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,780
Should I put you out?

36
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,940
Stay!

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,260
- Okay, do you manage?
 Should I put you out?
 - Yes we do.

38
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Oh!

39
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,200
- It didn't come on my face.
 - No, well saved!

40
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,640
It is really difficult!

41
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,600
I just float up like a sausage ...

42
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,240
But corner, now the water slides have opened!
 Shouldn't we go there the whole family?

43
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,160
- Yes!
 - Come on, Axel!

44
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,340
Check.
 Here comes your pizza, Harry.

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,220
Oh!

46
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,580
- It's very hot.
 - Okay, I understand.
 Thanks so much!

47
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,120
- Huh!
 Is this mine?
 -Yes, we'll remove this.

48
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,460
It went wrong.

49
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,440
Sometimes it gets a little wrong.

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,480
After such a morning, everything tastes good, Harry.

51
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,760
You have jumped and shot a lot!

52
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,180
You have only taken a couple of salad mounds, it is really strange.

53
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,500
There will be more food for me and dad.

54
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,860
Nasty.

55
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,000
- Yes.
 One here and one there, please.
 - Yes.

56
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,840
Fanta!

57
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,780
What should Fanta eat, then?

58
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,540
- Who is Fanta?
 - Him.

59
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
This is Fanta.

60
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,180
Alma and Harry fell asleep for a while after lunch.

61
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
- Nice, huh?
 - Yes!

62
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
- Now let's go up to the main street here and ... - Come, Harry!

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,820
... Get our laundry that we handed in a couple of days ago.

64
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,840
Come!

65
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,900
Alma and Axel were up and found a laundry where you could wash ...

66
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,160
... a kilo for 50 bath, was it?

67
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,060
I think so, I don't know.
 I do not remember.

68
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,320
- And how much is 50 bath?
 Type 10 SEK?
 - mm, type.

69
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
- Should I put you?
 - Yes.

70
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,700
Now there is actually rain.
 We have to fold these up.

71
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,100
- I'll take this.
 - The camera!

72
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
Yes exactly.
 We must have one over the camera.

73
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
- Which of them are I taking?
 - You can take this one.

74
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,300
- Do you want to share?
 - Yes.

75
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,440
- Or, it can probably get Alma.
 - Yes.

76
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,900
It's a bit nice!
 It's great ... what do you say?
 Humid in the air.

77
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,720
And I who have so much sunscreen, I feel that whole.. whole I am just messy and moist.

78
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,780
So it's almost nice with rain.

79
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,380
These were packed when we handed them in, and now they are half full when the laundry is weight.

80
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,640
It feels like it was a good investment.

81
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,480
Axel went to leave the laundry in our hotel room, and we are on our way down to the beach.

82
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
So - our hotel beach.

83
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,080
- Hello ... - Hello, Hello!

84
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,340
Hello.

85
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,300
How is it with English, Alma?

86
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Okay.

87
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,540
This hotel is booked via TUI.

88
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,600
We have a collaboration with TUI, who sponsored our trip to Thailand.

89
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,860
And of course we are super happy for that!

90
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,160
But we will not just stay at this hotel, but we will change after a week.

91
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,260
Right.

92
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,020
When we met other travelers ... Swedes, we have noticed that it is quite common.

93
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,900
So this with a combination trip - that you are in one place for a week, and then another place.

94
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,780
Mm.

95
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,800
Alma was actually a little sad this morning, because a friend she met moved to another hotel today.

96
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,780
Yes.

97
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,520
Now Harry is shouting.

98
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,460
Come down on the beach ...

99
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,900
... then we go to the love tree.

100
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,740
But it is getting dark now, Harry.
 We will go back and change, and then go and have dinner.

101
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,060
Yummy, yummy!

102
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,140
- Is it good?
 - mm.

103
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,700
- Is your good?
 - mm.

104
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,240
Dad says I just have to take useful, not such nuggets and french fries and stuff ...

105
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,640
... so I've just taken useful here.

106
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,180
- What good that useful can be good too!
 - mm.

107
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,480
NOW

108
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,360
WILL

109
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
WE

110
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,160
TAKE

111
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,940
ONE

112
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,860
Evening

113
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,700
DO...

114
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,580
... pp!

115
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,540
PP ... What does "PP" mean?

116
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
Evening dip.

117
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,920
Woho!

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,300
- Best balcony!
 - Aha, aha ...

119
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,300
Here comes a diver!

120
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,740
Sleep so well now.

121
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,340
- Slept so well, Dad.
 I love you.
 - I love you.

122
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,640
It's carbon black.

123
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,060
Not carbon black, but a little darker.

124
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,640
Good night.

125
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,240
Good night.

126
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:44,020
We have a question that works pretty well, because this day has been quite hotel focused.

127
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,220
Jocke BrÃ¶ms wonders: "What is the best thing about your hotel?".

128
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,040
Bathe!

129
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,600
You should sleep!

130
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,980
"Bathe".

131
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,700
Yes, I actually agree.
 Harry is right.

132
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,480
I want to bathe now.

133
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,340
In water slides ...

134
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,340
- Yes.
 All pools, proximity to water.
 - Yes.

135
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,880
I can also reveal that the worst, these are the walls that are just glass.

136
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,560
Yes, it's the worst slim glass wall ...

137
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,340
Sorry, I just knocked on this one.
 It's like a paper wall.

138
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,040
We have a very hard time being able to do something in the evening, after we have put the children.

139
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,760
Mm.

140
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,760
Thank you for watching this video.

141
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,520
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

142
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,500
Comment, ask questions, and have a great time until we see you next time!

143
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,340
Yes.

144
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,020
- Bye!
 - See you.
 Have a good one!
