1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,520
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,340
We are in...

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,100
New Zealand!

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,120
YES!

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,360
If you follow our Instagram, you already know about this, because you have seen pictures.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,720
If you look at the channel a lot, you probably know that we have been to Thailand with TUI.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,060
There are several vlogs from there.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,900
But now you will be able to follow our journey from Thailand to New Zealand!

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,580
We are at Phuket Airport!

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,340
It is fortunate that the children feel embarrassed, because we have a long journey ahead of us.

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,760
Very long!

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,240
- Yes!
 - Rama x ...

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,380
Mom, check out.
 Rama X.

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,440
- Who is Rama X?
 - Thailand's king.

15
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,380
As usual, we have a lot of bags with us.

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,360
Yes, I don't know what happened here, but ... it's change clothes.

17
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,340
- Passport and boarding cards, please.
 - Yes.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,400
Hello.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,380
Harry, they said "Hello" to you.
 What do you say then?

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,640
- What should I say?
 - You can say "Hello".

21
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,480
Hello.

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,460
- Thanks!
 - Thanks so much.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,520
- Bye!
 - Bye!

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,560
So there, now we have gone through Security.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
Yes.

26
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,580
In an hour, at 14:30, our plane goes from Phuket to Singapore.

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,100
And then we will go to ...

28
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,060
New Zealand!

29
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,920
Yes it is true!

30
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,800
Do you know which city, then?

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,860
Ehm ...

32
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,640
- Auckland.
 - Correct.

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,040
Oh!

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,920
Auckie-Landie, Auckie-Landie ...

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,980
Auckie ... Auckland.

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,320
How's it going?

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,160
It is good!
 I am tagged to experience something new.

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,720
Thailand has been a great start to this long trip.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,800
Yes indeed!

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,380
- So ... - s ...

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,560
We talk in the mouth of each other.

42
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,600
- Hello!
 - Hello!

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,560
How satisfied are you with Thailand?

44
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,680
Br ... br ... br ...

45
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,180
Good!

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,500
It sounds like a good rating.

47
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,560
- Great to stay at a resort.
 - mm.

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,160
Leopard...

49
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,580
But...

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,940
Alma, go and play.
 Bye.

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't know what it is with them today!

52
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,300
I think there are some butterflies in the stomach for us to travel.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,680
Yes, I believe that.
 But...

54
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,000
Hello!

55
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,060
Pussy away.

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,260
- No, but go away now, please.
 - Go and play there!

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,340
Quite Spartan Kid Zone when compared to the hotel we have just lived on.

58
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,400
Yes indeed.

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,800
- It's been like a kid zone, the whole resort!
 - Yes.

60
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,460
It was only a bunch of children who have pulled around and had as much fun!

61
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,480
Yes!

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,200
I want to take the opportunity to strike a blow to travel in the off -season.

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,560
- Yes.
 - How nice isn't that?

64
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,660
There is no congestion, neither in restaurants nor on sun loungers or anything like that.

65
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,940
Everything goes very smoothly.

66
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,020
But there are still lots of children for the kids to play with, and good things to do.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
Yes.

68
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,520
And the beach was ...

69
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,100
- Some days it was almost empty!
 - Yes.

70
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,360
- If you can, travel in low season.
 - Yes.

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,220
- A tip from us.
 - Good tips.

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,980
This flight is only two hours.
 Me, Alma and Harry are at the back ...

73
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,380
... and foam!

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,100
Dad Axel sits two rows.

75
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,920
That's right.
 There we have him ...

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480
- Hello!
 - Hello Hello!

77
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,740
What is it, the old man?

78
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,720
I get scared.

79
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,060
Come, take my hand.
 Tell me, why are you scared?

80
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,020
The aircraft will probably crash.

81
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,000
No, no, no ... it's just raining outside, it's nothing dangerous.
 They can land anyway.

82
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,500
- They will land on the sea now.
 - No, we will land at the airport.

83
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,560
Yes...

84
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,960
- If we don't land on sea ... - no ...

85
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,060
- If we land on the sea we will go on a boat instead ... - No, Harry ...

86
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,160
... and take those disgusting masks on us.

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,260
We will land at the airport, I promise.
 It just rains and is a little gray.
 No problem.

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,260
- We will be at the other island soon!
 - Yes!

89
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,160
We will soon be there where we would travel.

90
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,900
You were right, we will land on land!

91
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,280
- It didn't take that long to go here.
 - No.

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,480
It was super close!
 Alma, now we're coming soon!

93
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,180
Singapore!

94
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,740
- It felt like that flight went fast.
 - Very quickly.

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
But now we have ...

96
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,060
... 3.5 hours here, I look at the clock that we will go by.

97
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,980
Oh, now comes someone who is in a hurry.

98
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,080
Sorry!

99
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,460
There is the time, do you see?

100
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,200
18:05, local time, and we fly on to Auckland ...

101
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,920
I have a hard time talking, as usual.

102
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
- 21:30.
 - Yes!

103
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,700
Now we have a few hours to ...

104
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,300
- Hello!
 Have a safe trip.
 - Thanks!

105
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,480
- Thanks, have so nice!
 - Thanks.

106
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,760
Yes ... eat, hang.

107
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,780
So there ...

108
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,760
...little food.

109
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,300
A lot of exciting food!

110
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,640
- You might think we're in a playground.
 - Yes.

111
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,140
But we are still in Singapore, at the airport.
 At Changi Airport.

112
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,180
Is it good, Alma?

113
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,180
Giant.

114
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,140
Ouch.

115
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,300
It's time to change to long legs.

116
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,440
Nice, because it felt like I kind of twisted my foot when I went in this one.

117
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,360
Now we have just changed and we were going to check out a bit in the stores here at the airport.

118
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,220
- It's a huge airport ... - Yes, it's huge!

119
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,360
... with a lot of shops.

120
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,540
Yes.

121
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,420
We actually go over to another terminal and then you have to take trains in between.

122
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,040
- How are you?
 - Good.

123
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,780
- What are you sitting in?
 - Wheelchair.

124
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,320
Now Dad has purchased something very good for the trip!

125
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,620
It may not look so fun, but it's a little headphone jack ...

126
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,560
... which you can plug in two pairs of headphones.

127
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,040
So you can sit and listen with your headphones ...

128
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,500
... and you can listen with your headphones!

129
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,000
- Good, is not it?
 - This wasn't fun.

130
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,980
- Isn't that fun?
 - It's really fun!

131
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,040
It will be great fun!
 Doing, doing!

132
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,940
Now we have a nine -hour flight.

133
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,140
Axel and the children here, three.
 And I ... there.

134
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,720
- At least in the beginning, we must see later.
 - Yes, we are testing a new variant.

135
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,820
Yes.

136
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,480
- They are pretty well tired now.
 - Yes, and they are in the hood on each other all the time.

137
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,980
I don't think we will be able to sit like this.
 I probably have to sit in between.

138
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,340
- Listen?
 - Yes?

139
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,920
- Can you open this?
 - Yes ...

140
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,260
- You hardly see you, Harry.
 - No, that hair ...

141
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,780
Mother?
 Can you put this on for me?

142
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,840
- The braids were so nice when they were newly made.
 - And now they have like ...

143
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,260
- It's a bit depressed.
 - They have rolled out a bit.

144
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,940
We can make new ones later.

145
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,060
When we get to New Zealand we can find a cool hairdresser that can do something cool with your hair, Harry.

146
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,760
Harry, I can't help you put on now, I can help you later.

147
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,380
The TV doesn't work now.

148
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,080
You have to eat a little.

149
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,560
Hello Hello.

150
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,100
- You talk so much with your headphones on.
 - Yes, but they hear nothing.

151
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,900
... Must scream.

152
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,980
- At
 Is 23:30, I don't think they will get that much.
 - (Alma) What is that?

153
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,260
But it's worth a try.

154
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,540
It is difficult to find a good position to sleep in in these chairs.

155
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,960
It is two and a half hours left on the flight.

156
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,920
The children have slept for 4 hours.

157
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,260
It is half past five in the morning, and then we lay down in the middle of the night.

158
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,280
Or, "Leak us" ...

159
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,260
Type covered for a little while.

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,140
- It bumps a lot.
 - Yes.

161
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,120
- It has made it all the flight.
 - Yes, it has.

162
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,080
Woho!

163
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,060
- We are in New Zealand!
 - Yes!

164
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,480
Here is half past two in the day.
 We are 12 hours from Sweden now!

165
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,420
Yes.

166
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,780
- As far away as you can get on the globe.
 - Yes.

167
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,160
At home is half past two at night.

168
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,220
For us, who are in Thailand time, it is very early morning.

169
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,580
- Yes, and we have slept very little.
 - Yes.

170
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,000
The last bag, everything is included.
 Great!

171
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,500
Yes, you found it.
 How fun!

172
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,860
Yes but it is quite hot, at least.

173
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,840
- Yes!
 It is hot.
 - Yes, it was actually warm and nice, after all.

174
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,560
We were a little prepared to freeze now.

175
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,740
- Taxi.
 - Shall we take a taxi?

176
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,620
Now we are on our way to a house that we have rented in central Auckland.

177
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,180
- Yes!
 - But God, what scary!

178
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,580
- Very exciting ... - I didn't see you!
 He made an "Alma".

179
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,180
Oh, God ...

180
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,660
- To make an "Alma", it is to just show up behind.
 - Yes.

181
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,140
Oh, God.

182
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,240
We have arrived!

183
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
Yey!

184
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,500
- Should we go in and check out the townhouse?
 - Yes!

185
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,080
We rent this from a family living abroad.

186
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Wow!

187
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,740
Oh!
 Great!

188
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,380
You can put on Netflix, in addition!

189
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,160
There is an upstairs!

190
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,220
Yes, but we have to check the kitchen and the patio first, then we go up and then check.

191
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,520
I stay here.

192
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,980
Here we can sit and eat.

193
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,220
Here we can cook our food.

194
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,080
Here is our upstairs!

195
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
Here's my room!

196
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,860
- Do you take this?
 - Yes, I'll take this.
 I pax it.

197
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,900
Here Harry can sleep.

198
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,580
- Should Harry have such a big bed?
 - Yep!

199
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
The toilet.

200
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,080
Oh, nice!

201
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,240
Oh, it looks good!

202
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,800
- Oh, how yellow it got in the camera.
 - Well!

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,820
That's how it is.

204
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,140
Mom and Dad's bed!

205
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,880
- Here is a small balcony.
 - and a mirror.

206
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Wow ...

207
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,700
Super nice, after all!
 And very hot!

208
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,640
Oh, it smells like food!
 I get so hungry.

209
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,080
Yes ... I understand that you are hungry, you did not eat so well on the flight.

210
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,600
Hi, Harry!

211
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,180
- Do you want to build with me?
 - Yes, we come down and build with you.

212
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,400
Alma and Harry ...

213
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,540
We should take out your braids.

214
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,220
No...

215
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,940
They are not so nice anymore.

216
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,940
Now we have been here for a few days.

217
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,900
YES!

218
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,480
And the children's braids have left.

219
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,900
Harry, your smile, so ...

220
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,840
We have a question of today's question that very many have asked.

221
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,280
And it is: "What should you do in New Zealand?".

222
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,720
I know!

223
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,100
Going motorhome for a month!

224
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,900
- Yes!
 - Just right!

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,440
We will stay in Auckland for a few days, then we have rented a camper that we will go around with.

226
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,900
And of course we will vlog throughout the trip!

227
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:29,980
Thank you for watching this video!

228
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,860
Feel free to leave a thumbs up ...

229
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,700
... or down.

230
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,540
Comment, ask questions, and have a great time until we see you next time!

231
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,540
- See you!
 - Bye!
