00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,580
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,000
We are in...

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,060
Thailand!

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,060
YES!

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,220
If you follow our Instagram then you already know it,

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
Because we update with pictures and stories every day!

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,940
Yes.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,480
But ... here comes a Youtube vlog of the trip from Sweden here to ...

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,340
- To ... - to Khao Lak.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,940
Oh, I would say "Thailand".

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But, Khao Lak is in ...

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,820
- Thailand!
 - Exactly.

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,700
Here it comes!

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,740
Ugh, how cold it is!

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,300
How are you?

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,860
Good.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
- Are you peppered?
 - Yeah!

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,140
God, what you chew.

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,360
Rocket...

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,180
How many bags do we have?

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,960
We have three checked in, then we have the children's ...

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,000
- It wasn't Alma and Harry.
 I thought so!
 - Just ...

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,460
We have three bags that we checked in, and then we all have each ...

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,580
... cabin bag.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,260
I have a backpack, Joanna has a backpack, and the kids ...

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,160
We each have a backpack, simply.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,600
Then we have this little thing, with our passports.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,720
Then we have these, and we do not know how to check in.
 They may be special luggage.

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,040
We'll see when we arrive at the check -in counter.

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,760
Come on, friends!

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,240
Yes!
 We swish away!

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,560
Let's go!

33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,760
- How do we do with these?
 Is it...?
 Should we take that?
 - Yes do it.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,940
- The scooters are special luggage.
 - Yes.

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,920
- So that ... Axel got a bag.
 - mm.

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,720
- Now we are on our way to check them in another place.
 - Yes!

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,140
Dad, check out what I can do.

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Oh, what good!

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,160
So.
 And then Alma, yours.

40
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,660
Aah!

41
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,520
What is it?

42
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,500
I turned on like legs ... The leg lump in my knee.

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh no.

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,180
Silent!
 Silent!

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,160
They will talk like that all the time we are at the airport, you understand.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,360
Now we have submitted the children's scooters, and should go through the security check, and there you must not film.

47
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,340
So see you on the other side!

48
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Oh, wow!

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,740
- Here you have a lot to choose from!
 - Really.

50
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,240
What is this?

51
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,500
- Scooby-doo.
 - That's Scooby-Doo.

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,400
Scooby-Doo we checked at Tanja at home.

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,900
I think ... that.

54
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,860
But that is not a newspaper?

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,940
- Do you want it instead of newspaper?
 - Yes.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,140
I have decided on this one.

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,340
Good!

58
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,060
- We are actually in a hurry, so now we go to the cash register.
 - Yes, now we are in a hurry.

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,660
- Are we in a hurry?
 - We are in a hurry.

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,040
It is ten past four and our plane goes twenty in five.

61
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,220
So we have half an hour on us.

62
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,120
- I want to open ... - I want my scooter!

63
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,400
- Mom, can I open the gift I got on the plane?
 - Yes.

64
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,040
- We can.
 - We can.

65
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,500
Great!

66
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,120
It's been so stressful in recent days ... hard to even explain.

67
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,120
I will end up in a coma on the flight, I feel.

68
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,260
Yes.
 Don't wake up, just ...

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,160
- Do you know what's behind us now?
 - No?

70
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,740
- Our gate, and it's boarding!
 - Yes!

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,760
Yay!

72
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,960
- Now we leave!
 Goodbye Sweden.
 - Yes, we are so ready!

73
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,840
Goodbye Sweden.
 I will miss you!

74
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,040
Should I say one thing I won't miss?

75
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,620
What?

76
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
The darkness.

77
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
You don't like darkness because it gets dark in the camera, and just ...

78
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,540
Yes!

79
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,160
Then we can't use what we film, and then just ... we have to put down the whole vlog.

80
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,860
For that reason, and several other reasons, I do not like darkness.

81
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,600
So, it is not even five, and it is black as the night out.

82
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,440
Yes.

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,200
It's unpleasant!
 That is out ...

84
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,600
- Joanna has a fixation at the dark.
 - Yes I know.

85
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,440
- Hello Hello!
 - Where are you sitting somewhere?

86
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,100
- 6 C to F. - Yes.
 Then you can go ...

87
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,260
- It's forward?
 - Yes!

88
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,020
- Should we stay here?
 - Yes, there we are going in.

89
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,940
What is this?
 It's a blanket!

90
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,300
So Harry chose ...

91
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
... instead of a newspaper ...

92
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,220
- ... a turtles ... - a turtles guy.

93
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,440
Check!

94
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Gosh!
 Show.

95
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,320
NÃ¤men, which ... what a tongue!

96
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,640
I know.
 You do this ...

97
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,160
- Check out what I got in the newspaper, Dad.
 - What a fun.

98
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,540
I got this one in the newspaper.

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,140
Oh, wow.
 What is that?
 Keep it up.

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,460
It is a small one where you hang.
 I can hang it on my backpack or anywhere else.

101
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,320
The plane lifted a little late.
 We got away just after five.

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,500
It was completely extinguished, as it needs to be when you fly away in the dark.

103
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,300
Then they lit, and this fun gang sat with each screen.

104
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,440
Now it is half past seven.

105
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,940
I hope the food is coming soon.
 We are all hungry.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
- Yes, this is here.
 - It's here.

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,020
Alma ...

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,640
Harry, now comes the food!

109
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,860
- What's that?
 - It's a dessert.
 It looks like a lemon cake.

110
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,660
- Looks good.
 - But first you should eat that.

111
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,300
Meatballs and mashed potatoes.
 Good, of course!

112
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,180
Where is the dessert?

113
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,920
What is happening over there?

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,840
He is angry and unpleasant.

115
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,820
- Tired.
 - Yes.

116
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,540
This is how it is with children, when they are tired and you should fly with them, and it is uncomfortable, and so there.

117
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,600
Sometimes it is, at least, not always.
 Sometimes.

118
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,180
The water cannot be drinked.

119
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,320
- Is it in English?
 - Yes.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,220
Vat ...

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,720
... er ... Vater.

122
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
- "Water".
 - Good!

123
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,320
Water ...

124
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,060
Note...

125
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
For ...

126
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,440
Drink...

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,320
... ing.

128
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,380
It is a quarter to nine, and we are getting ready to sleep.

129
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,980
We hope we will be able to sleep, anyway.

130
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,960
Good morning.
 We just woken up.

131
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,780
Alma sits watching the baby boss.
 Harry is still sleeping on the floor.

132
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
What time is it?

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:15,000
It is 8 Thai time - I've switched to it.
 But in Sweden it is two at night ...

134
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,400
I feel it in my body and soul.
 I am very tired.

135
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,360
Yes.

136
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,880
The positive is that we have 2 hours left of an 11 hour flight.

137
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,020
Soon it's over ... It's nice!

138
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,800
- It's really warm here, mom!
 - Yes!

139
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,020
- Is it nice?
 - Yes.

140
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,600
Do you know what we are waiting for now?

141
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,740
No.

142
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
Not really.

143
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,680
- Pass stamp!
 - Yes!

144
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,660
- Stamp in ... - Passport control, it's called.

145
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,780
Yes!

146
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,180
- They have a little trouble letting each other be.
 - Yes.

147
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,260
There is a bit of a retry and thief type all the time.

148
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:46,260
But it will be good when we arrive, because then there are a lot of other children, and a lot of baths and play.

149
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,320
It's so hot!

150
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,800
- Hello!
 - Hello Hello!

151
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
- Warm welcome!
 - Thanks!

152
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,080
- Where are you going anywhere and swimming?
 Which hotel?
 - The Sands.

153
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,360
The Sands ...

154
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,440
I must say;
 I actually know who you are!
 I looked at you the other day.

155
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,800
Oh what fun!

156
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,160
After all, we haven't told us that this trip is a collaboration with TUI.

157
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,560
- They sponsor us these two weeks in Thailand.
 - Yes.

158
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,140
Which is the beginning of our long journey, so we will continue on another.

159
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,920
But it is a very wonderful start that we are very happy for!

160
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
- Oh!
 - Oh.

161
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,740
Yes, I stepped on something.

162
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,880
- Now we are going to take a bus to Khao Lak.
 - Yes!

163
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,960
- And it takes two hours.
 - Two and a half hours, I think he said.

164
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,940
- So we are landed at Krabi Airport.
 - Yes.

165
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,960
There our bus goes.

166
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,180
Here is our hotel.

167
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,740
That trip took type three hours.

168
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,280
Harry fell asleep a bit at the end.

169
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,940
- Which is a hotel?
 - This is our hotel.

170
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,580
- Here is our hotel.
 - Here we will live.
 Finally, Harry!

171
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,020
(in English) Welcome to The Sands!
 These are your bags, huh?

172
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,240
(in English) Hello!
 Yes please.

173
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,440
It looks like a small safari car.

174
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Large hotel area.

175
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,780
It looks huge.

176
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,760
(in English) There is the Kids Club pool.
 And behind the Kids Club ...

177
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,960
Check out, Alma and Harry!

178
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,780
Wow!

179
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,500
What did you think of that?

180
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,600
Very cool!

181
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,220
The cat the sausage almost rubbed ...

182
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,440
(in English) Okay, now we're there!

183
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,420
(in English) Welcome to your room!

184
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,480
(in English please!

185
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,980
Oh!

186
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,840
- Straight out to the pool!
 - Oh, what a nice!

187
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,540
- Here you can just plum in!
 - Yes!

188
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,020
This is an interesting solution ...

189
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,000
... to the toilet.

190
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,660
Here Alma and Harry will sleep.

191
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,040
So you can close ... with this.

192
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,660
- And that's those stars!
 - Cute, huh!

193
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,880
And here is mom and dad's!

194
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,580
Now we have been here for a couple of days, and of course there will be several vlogs from here.

195
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,800
Yes!

196
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,080
We have a question of the day.

197
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,000
Football girl07 wonders:

198
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,640
"What do Alma and Harry think about going away for so long?"

199
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,320
Super long!

200
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,680
What do you think about it, then?

201
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Good!

202
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,260
I think it's totally okay, actually.

203
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,980
I don't think Alma and Harry understand how long we should be gone, in total.

204
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,580
We talk about four months.
 I have a hard time understanding it, myself.

205
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,460
Yes me too.
 It feels really strange.

206
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:05,660
But at the same time Supernice to start with a more holiday - ie holiday - for two weeks.

207
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,740
Yes indeed!

208
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,240
Thanks for watching this video!

209
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,880
Feel free to leave a thumbs up ...

210
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,920
... or down!

211
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,100
Preferably up!

212
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,600
Comment, ask questions, and have a great time until we see you next time!

213
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,980
Bye!
