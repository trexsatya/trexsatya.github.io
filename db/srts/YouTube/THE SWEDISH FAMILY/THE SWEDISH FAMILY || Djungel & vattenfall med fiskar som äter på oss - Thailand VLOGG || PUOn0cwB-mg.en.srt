00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,600
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,060
We are in Khao Lak, Thailand!

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:21,160
Today we are going on an excursion to a waterfall!

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,800
- It will be really cool!
 - Yes, and of course you should come along.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,860
But first we should go and braid Harry's hair.

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,300
Yes, to check out Alma!

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,720
- Nice, huh?
 - There are even pearls in the hair.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,580
When Harry saw how nice it was, he said he wanted the same.

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,240
We will fix that first and then it will be an excursion!

10
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,720
Mom is a little busy working so she stays at the hotel.

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,340
Is everything good with the beads?

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Only one.
 I'll fix it for you.

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,960
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six ...

14
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,860
- Does it hurt?
 - mm.

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,300
When I got braids it became so awkward everywhere so I just scratched here and here.

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,880
Then it was a bit jerky to itch, I didn't know ... I didn't know if I would do it or not.

17
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,280
So it was pretty hard.

18
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,500
Now it is soon ready, Harry.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,660
Am I done now?

20
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,400
The last beads only.

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,680
Wow!

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,040
- Are you happy?
 - mm.

23
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,900
Get to see, then?

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
Bye!

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,400
- Hello then, thank you!
 - Bye!

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,820
Bye!

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,020
Well, what cool!

28
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,860
He's super nice after all!

29
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,780
Harry, how nice to be rid of that hanging and slingy hair on the face!

30
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,120
This was the coolest I've seen!

31
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,500
- Hörrni, now our taxi is here so now we will go!
 - Okidoki!

32
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,860
Nice car!
 Blue...

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
It's very hot today!
 It was 34 degrees yesterday.

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,980
- I tip that it's around the same today.
 - mm.

35
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,860
It is warm no matter where you are.
 Indoors, outdoors, it's just ...

36
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,860
- I actually hope for some branches and shade now.
 - Yes.

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,160
What are you babbling about?

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,360
- He talks about marshmallows being bitten very hard.
 - huh?
 What kind of marshmallows?

39
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,160
- In a movie.
 - Well ...

40
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,260
This heat has knocked our children.

41
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,740
... get life in them ...

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,320
Oh, sleeping?

43
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,040
- Baby sleeps?
 - Yes, baby sleeps.

44
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
... to you.

45
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,860
  Happy Birthday, Dear Alma

46
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,380
  Happy Birthday to you!

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,160
So ... it's so cute that everyone calls Harry a baby.

48
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
"Baby Sleep?"

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,340
A little dried fruit is very good to bring with you when you have tired children.

50
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,320
- May I eat it?
 - Yes you can eat it.

51
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,400
- How is the situation, Almis?
 - Good.

52
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,920
- Are you ready for 1.5 km walk?
 - Yes!

53
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,380
It's a pretty cool road.
 You hear the water on that side ...

54
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,860
Maybe you even see it?

55
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,900
- Oh, God!
 There you do not want to fall down!
 - Oh oh oh!
 Whoa, take it easy!
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

56
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,640
Okay, there was a proper drop.

57
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,080
On this page we have incredibly dense vegetation.

58
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,360
- Do you know what that means, Alma?
 - Jungle!

59
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,400
Yes, but ... "vegetation";
 So it is very dense vegetation.

60
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,380
- Jungle!
 - Yes, it's a jungle.

61
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,700
Check out how beautiful it is!

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,820
Is it okay to go in sandals, Alma?

63
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,640
Yes...

64
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,540
As well as...

65
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,940
The...

66
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
... is not completely ...

67
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,420
... good, but ...

68
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,300
- Frankly, I have no one else.
 - Why not?

69
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,920
I've grown out of them!

70
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,060
- Every shoe?
 - Yeah!

71
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,780
- Is there anyone who thinks it is warm, raise a hand!
 - Yes!

72
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,420
- Yes Yes...

73
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,180
So, even though it is branches and leaves and so on, it is pressing heat.

74
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,400
It will be great with a bath!

75
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,640
We arrive at "Level 1".

76
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,860
Or, 100 meters it is for "Level 1".

77
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,020
- Oh.
 My.
 Good!
 - Oh, check out the bridge!

78
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,380
Good!

79
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,980
Tone chong Fa waterfall

80
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:37,320
When you go back, then we will go in the waterfall at the bottom!

81
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,740
- Check out which big ones!
 - Yes, I see.
 Can you get rid of them?

82
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,260
They eat on me!
 I think it's scary.

83
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,680
- Eat on you?
 Big fish eating on you?
 - Yes!
 Yes!

84
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,280
- No, but God!
 - I don't think it was nice!

85
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,580
- Are you filming?
 - Yes.

86
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,420
No but five!
 Worst big fish that nibbled!

87
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,340
- "Fish spa" ... natural.
 - Although it was kind of this big ...

88
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,080
- This pool was not as nice as I thought.
 - Nah.

89
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,140
This "pool" was not so nice ...

90
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,000
Alma is allowed to go first so she has something to fall on.

91
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,100
- Should we go up here?
 - Yes, to the next level.

92
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,440
No, now we will never find home ...

93
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,480
Oh my God.

94
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,420
In this pool there are some ... so we go.

95
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,300
Yes, we check level three.

96
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,340
I'm not so worried about going up.
 I'm more worried about coming down again.

97
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,460
But it is nice if we can get our own little "pool".

98
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,340
- I'm worried I should fall.
 - Yes, worried about falling can also be.

99
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
80 meters to level three ...

100
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,780
... of four levels.
 I think we only drive three levels.

101
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,620
The terrain gets worse and worse.

102
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,000
Wow!

103
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,880
So, it's so beautiful!
 I hope the camera shows how cool it is!

104
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,600
Shall we swim?

105
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,700
- Yes!
 And here you can go water slide!
 - No...

106
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,520
Not a single company.

107
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,500
Good!

108
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,760
- Do you want a sandwich?
 - Gladly.

109
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,080
It pushes everywhere around us!

110
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,580
- It is unclear if we are heard in this.
 - Yes, but I think so.

111
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,960
We have some lunch bag with us.

112
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,880
Yummy!

113
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,040
The time is...

114
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,020
You have no watch, I have a watch ... it is five in five.

115
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,120
The sun goes down at a quarter past six.
 Now we have to focus on getting down, so we pack the camera in the bag.

116
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,620
- Yes, we can't have it when we go down.
 - No, but then, some parties were like this ...

117
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,280
- ... and I want to come down with living children.
 - Yes, so we'll see you down there!

118
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,500
We managed.
 See what we found ...

119
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,460
It's spa fish!
 Down here...

120
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,820
Check out, they come right away!

121
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,240
Ouch!

122
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,940
- How does it feel?
 - They ...

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,380
So they take chews!

124
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,060
They take chews of my heels!

125
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,200
After all, I have those parmesan heels.

126
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,720
- May I look at the heels?
 - They just "Oh, Parmesan!".

127
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,920
Here are my heels.

128
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,260
Uäää ...

129
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,980
"Uääää"!

130
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
Check now.
 They come right away!

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,320
Fish-shovel was very interesting!
 It didn't hurt, but it felt a bit strange.

132
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,820
I thought it was very uncomfortable!
 I can't understand that people pay for that.

133
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,900
Harry, you dared to stop your feet.

134
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,440
I stopped them super many times!
 I stopped them three times type.

135
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,140
Yes, Harry is always brave.

136
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,880
We have a question of the day.
 Moa's world wonders, "What is the best thing about being gone?".

137
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,680
To experience all experiences.

138
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,560
- Very "up" ... - Yes.

139
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,500
- But I really agree!
 - Me too!
 Do you agree, mom?

140
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,380
I agree with.
 And to hang out with you crunch balls!

141
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,540
- Me too.
 I agree with!
 - Yes.
 It's funny!

142
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,040
I like to play with you!

143
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,440
- Kiss!
 - What about me?!

144
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:26,500
Thanks for watching this video!

145
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,180
Feel free to leave a thumbs up ...

146
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,360
... or down!

148
