00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,746
Hello all legends!

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:04,665
Early serve!
 Today there will be a new reaction video

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,944
Where we react to what you said last time: Near death experiences.

4
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,696
Shall we do this honey?

5
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:11,958
-Jump?
 -Parachute.

6
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:14,434
Yes or...

7
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,387
What happened right?
 Lord...

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,839
Oh, shit.
 I thought they would do a trick.

9
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:25,316
They fly into a plane.

10
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:28,089
Oh, what?
 He is on the second plane.

11
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:31,482
Oh, shit.
 I didn't realize it was so serious with the balloon.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,061
It just crashes.
 Then you wonder what is happening to the pilot right now.

13
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:39,364
Yes.
 Look, there you got to see from a different angle.

14
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:42,097
Oh, wow.
 It just burns and stuff.

15
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:47,076
-It's type seven people in the air.
 -It was the plane they sat in that broke.

16
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,226
I think what they crash with are breaking.

17
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,951
Okay, is this any car, right?

18
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:55,085
It's an airplane, I think.
 So, how can you be so stupid?!

19
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,180
-Otherwise, I'm getting angry.
 -Oh my God!

20
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:02,276
Make if he is hit in the head by that.

21
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:05,847
-Shey, how can't the other see it?
 -What jerk cork, that is.

22
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:10,914
-But what luck he is.
 -Yes, what a luck, angel guard.

23
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,231
This is completely crazy.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But okay.

25
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:18,338
No sharks anyway.
 I think it's so scary.

26
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:21,284
Oh, it's a shark.
 I had been so scared!

27
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:26,759
How heavy he is.
 He just lowers the shark.
 He struck it.

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,386
Yes, but who hadn't done it?

29
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,807
So, what a legend!

30
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,021
So, he just "bam"!

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:40,013
I have read somewhere that you should hit for it to feel that it is not ...

32
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:43,815
-It's hammer shark, huh?
 -Yes it is.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,593
I have heard that they are quite aggressive.

34
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:47,609
It can't want to eat him, right?

35
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,148
But he may have caught his kid in the thread.

36
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:55,157
No!
 He must think it was a turtle.
 Often they believe it.

37
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:59,533
-But if he hit it hard ... -A big yellow banana boat is a tortoise?

38
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,592
He fights for a long time against this thing.

39
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:04,449
Yes, it does not give up.

40
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:07,657
It could overturn his boat so easily.

41
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:08,807
-Do you think so?
 -Yes.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,061
Imagine being the one sitting alone on the sea.

43
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,624
I had been so scared.

44
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:17,403
This I think is cool but so scary.
 Shit.

45
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:21,184
-What is he doing?
 Throws out of a mountain?
 -Yes probably.

46
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:25,173
-Go go, dude.
 -Okay.
 Can you just, then ...

47
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:26,910
Oh, no, the man!

48
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:34,358
Oh my God!
 WORM.
 Oh my God.

49
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:37,192
Huh?
 How could he manage?
 I do not get it.

50
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:40,839
But that is probably the case that is muted.

51
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,776
But still.
 That must have done so much hurt.

52
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,847
Why is the guy just filming?

53
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,696
Oh!
 What is happening there?
 Or what?!

54
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:53,339
I didn't even see.
 Did anyone flew into a sign?

55
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:55,585
We will try to understand what is happening.

56
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:59,704
-Nowing comes flying.
 -Oh, wow!

57
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,324
It is such a squirrel costume, I think.

58
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:05,958
Well, one with fluxy?
 I have never understood it.

59
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:07,427
How can you fly one?

60
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:17,184
Shit, then.
 What a fucking ...

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,974
Oh, Lord damn!

62
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:25,752
-Otherwise, that guy!
 -Did you see that tour?!

63
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:27,560
No, ush, what scary.

64
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:30,585
Can we rewind and check again?
 That was totally sick.

65
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:36,053
-Oh my God.
 -This are centimeters, that is.
 Wow.

66
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:39,636
Centimeter?
 He certainly hit the car, but he managed very well.

67
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,093
Ouch.
 Huh?
 What is going on?!

68
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,244
He is passionate about it!

69
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,855
No, but extinguish the fire!
 I just want to extinguish the fire on him.

70
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:54,458
I love that he just "shit, I'm outa here!"

71
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:57,514
First he went out and then he just tagged.

72
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,664
He may have seen that the others came to him.

73
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,252
-No, what a cowardly of him.
 -Yes, I think it was cowardly.

74
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,524
Thus, understand the tour you have to have for such a thing.

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,196
What now?
 After all, this wall will not come ...

76
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:19,673
Oh no.

77
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:23,279
No, no, it will collapse!
 This feels like a game of blocks.

78
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:27,090
-Oh, no, no, no.
 Please.
 -So dumb.

79
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,934
Don't do this, please.
 Check all the stuff above him now.

80
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,204
Why?
 Oh.

81
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:36,958
So, I'm kind of angry.
 You are so stupid!

82
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:38,641
Stop!

83
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:45,363
No?!
 What did he think would happen?

84
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:47,228
Oh my God.
 Did he die or?
 No, okay.

85
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:50,156
Oh, should he be robbed?

86
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:54,021
-No, what a nice!
 -What is he doing?

87
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,683
-He have this ... -... hair spray and lighter or something.

88
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,133
So, what a heavy!

89
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:04,355
-But what smart that he just ... -This was a legend.

90
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:08,530
They didn't even get in before he did that.
 Shit.

91
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:09,705
Pure legendary, that is.

92
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:14,125
-Gta.
 -No!
 Oh...

93
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:19,323
No, but animals must not be damaged.
 It's just so.
 It's something special.

94
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,685
-He just goes late.
 -Ouch ouch ouch...

95
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:31,201
Yes, he is completely shocked.
 Shit, then.

96
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:33,995
Oh.
 No!

97
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,598
So, that is completely sick.

98
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,950
Oh no!

99
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,387
In other words...

100
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,974
Oh, my God how close it was.
 Did you see it, right?

101
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:54,061
No no no.
 Oh.

102
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:56,915
Bye.

103
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,344
No, but God what a fucking cliff it was there.

104
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,427
-Hey hey, skye?!
 -I'm good!

105
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:08,433
Okay, sorry I said hello then maybe.
 But wow.

106
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:12,646
Oh my God.
 Running!

107
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,223
You flew!

108
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:20,635
I flew?
 I felt sorry for those standing there.
 He flew.

109
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:24,585
Aj, aj, aj, aj, aj, oh!

110
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:26,688
He made it.

111
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,782
All guys breathe out.

112
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,357
So, I thought it was Nut Shot on that.
 Wow.

113
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,434
God.

114
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:37,895
What is going on?
 Oh!

115
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:43,236
... it deserves it but then ... yes, you should not pass by ...

116
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:44,261
Ah men, wow.

117
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:49,604
It looks like Sweden.
 It could be Sweden.

118
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:52,429
-This is you, honey.
 -Yes, it could be.

119
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:56,906
Wow, what a fucking luck in ...

120
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:01,537
-It kind of could have been me.
 -No, she doesn't take this, right?

121
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:02,657
Oh!

122
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:07,085
Talking on the phone and walking across the road at the same time.

123
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:09,998
-Did she go into the bus?
 -Yes, yes, yes.
 She was so close.

124
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:13,640
That is why you should not talk on the phone unless you are focused.

125
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:14,776
It is fatal.

126
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,601
But you have to check the left.

127
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:21,372
And so she doesn't even go to the pedestrian crossing either, so she just goes in the middle of ...

128
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,641
Damn what scary, then.
 I had just died.

129
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:30,728
But I felt sorry for the snake first.
 But then so ... can't just leave the snake.

130
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,749
Oh, no, no, no.
 Beware, beware!
 You stand in the way.
 Hello!

131
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:41,887
Oh, did you see how he just threw that kid away?

132
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:45,244
-This was also Legend Move.
 -Yes, what a hero.

133
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:49,927
Do you see, he hung in the hood as well.

134
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:54,903
This is just bautafail, that is.

135
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:57,482
-What do they do?
 -No no no!
 Oh.

136
00:07:57,507 --> 00:08:02,577
Oh, Lord ... wonder how much it weighs.
 It may not be so heavy.

137
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,559
I would guess 100 kilos, but I just guess.

138
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:08,752
-It's totally ... -Now it's bombs.

139
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,019
-Ouch!
 Ouch.
 Was he really shot?
 -But then, huh?

140
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,680
No, he was probably not shot because then he had screamed a lot, but shit.

141
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:24,736
Take the weapon from man!

142
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:28,657
-Such people should not have weapons.
 -But why do you turn around?

143
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:30,593
And then just "Ah, but well! Bam!"

144
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:33,585
Okay, a little higher, please.

145
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:38,863
It was all the videos we had for today.
 My God, my heart just thumps.

146
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:42,355
And it doesn't end.
 You just "uh, uh, uh!"
 continuously.

147
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,230
After all, you are up here.
 You get such an adrenaline rush.

148
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:46,783
You don't get a quiet moment.

149
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:53,561
But hopefully no one died or was exaggerated injured, I hope.

150
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,280
I thought it was most sorry for that snake.

151
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:59,236
And those little sheep.
 No, my God.

152
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:02,985
It was great fun to make this video.

153
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:07,529
Thank you so much you who suggested to react to close death experiences.

154
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:09,030
A really good suggestion.

155
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:11,681
So more comments, spam with suggestions.

156
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:16,070
Don't forget, if you like these videos, give a thumbs up because then we will be happy.

157
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:19,192
-Write a comment and ... -... subscribe.

158
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:24,485
-So I hope you have a great day.
 -So we'll see you again soon.
 Bye.
