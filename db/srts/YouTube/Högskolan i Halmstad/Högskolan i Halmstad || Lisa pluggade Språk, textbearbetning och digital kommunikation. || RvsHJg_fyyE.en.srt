00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:04,500
- Hi, my name is Lisa NÃ¤renborn and I sit here at the Halmstad University

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,067
-In DLC, which stands for digital laboratory center.

3
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:11,633
I plugged language, text processing and digital communication.

4
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,567
Now I work as Business Development representative-

5
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:17,833
that is a nice word for selling at an IT security company-

6
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,133
-while is called Proofpoint.

7
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:23,000
It is an American company with offices all over the world-

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,667
Including Stockholm, but also in the UK-

9
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,800
-When I will belong to.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,533
My job is very fun-

11
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:33,567
-Very much relate to digital communication.

12
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:38,100
I write a lot of e -mails and I am in the sales process in the beginning.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,700
Much of my job is to communicate with potential customers-

14
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,767
-To, and this is very often digital.

15
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:49,200
Before I worked with marketing and there is a lot of text and communications-

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,000
-But in another way.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,267
A girl who plugged in the program works more with-

18
00:00:55,267 --> 00:01:00,567
-The shop communication and also it is text processing and how to get in ...

19
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:05,800
... the message in a good and clear manner.
 Once you have read this-

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,600
-The program so you have it, that's what you have to learn.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,667
Something I thought a lot about when I read the program was that I compared me-

22
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:15,700
-Very with my classmates.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,900
Everyone we had chosen the program because we like text and digital communication.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,367
And then it is clear that everyone is good at it.

25
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:26,200
Only after I had taken my exam-

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,600
-in I saw that "no but god I'm really good at this too".

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,400
I have a special competence that not other have-

28
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:37,100
-But compared to those who are also good at it.

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,700
When you come out into the world where others have read something else-

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,700
-To you notice what advantage this program has-

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,967
-And how much you use it.

32
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,400
I also think it's good that you can choose either-

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,367
-Swedish or English.

34
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:51,367
I chose English because I knew that I-

35
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,067
-Ville work and live abroad.

36
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:55,900
I didn't know exactly what I wanted to work like or with.

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,667
But at least I had it clear to me and-

38
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:02,633
-Then I thought that English will always be a competence that is in demand.

39
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:03,900
Whatever I work with.

40
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,700
One of the reasons I chose the program where-

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,933
-That it had an exchange term.

42
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:15,500
You could choose to study abroad.
 I studied a semester in Missouri in the United States.

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,400
It's really so fun, because you meet so many people.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,033
There was another girl from Halmstad University who went with me-

45
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:28,967
-And we became great friends.
 You get so much experience.

46
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:34,067
Studying at a college is not just about studies.

47
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,967
Sure, largely, but it's also about experiences, get friends

48
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,200
-and all the extra around.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,067
If I am going to give a tip to someone who is thinking about searching, I would say-

50
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:48,500
-If you have an interest in writing, for communication and text-

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,333
-But do not know exactly how to apply it to a professional role.

52
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,733
So I recommend this program.

53
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:59,867
I didn't know what I wanted to work with either.

54
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:04,000
But this program provides a broad competence, so that it goes-

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,867
-To apply on so much.
 You don't need to know what you want to become.

56
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:10,967
If you know the area: "Text and communication".

57
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:14,400
Then I really recommend this program.
