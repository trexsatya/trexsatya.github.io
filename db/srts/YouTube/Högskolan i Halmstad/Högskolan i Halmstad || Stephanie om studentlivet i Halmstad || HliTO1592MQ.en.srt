Student life in Halmstad.
 Student Stephanie tells.

2
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:07,500
Hi my name is Stephanie and I read-

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,567
-IT-Forensics and information security at Halmstad University.

4
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:14,167
Right now I am on the western beach.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,900
The best thing about plugging in Halmstad, I think is Halmstad.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,200
It is a fairly large and very cozy city.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,333
It is close to everything and I think the university is great.

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:31,800
The people are very wonderful and it is a fairly large school.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,167
It is easy to get in touch with the teachers to get the help you need.

10
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:40,700
My favorite place at the college must probably be up at D5.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,400
D5 is the floor is where we, IT forensic, for the most part.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,567
There are our lab rooms.

13
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:49,467
There is also the opportunity to sit and study with their friends.

14
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:54,900
You can bring your lunch and sit there and eat, there is micro and everything.

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,333
So there I usually hang.

16
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,333
I thought the zeroing was great fun.

17
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:04,533
It was really noticed that those who planned were involved.

18
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:09,133
They had spent a lot of time and energy to make sure we zero-

19
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,433
-would get as fun as possible.

20
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,267
One got to see a lot of halmstad-

21
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:17,033
-What I thought was good because I am from Gothenburg.

22
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:21,833
You got to know a lot of new ones so when you started school-

23
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:26,500
-So you were not alone, but you had already come to know some.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,700
Which I thought was wonderful.
