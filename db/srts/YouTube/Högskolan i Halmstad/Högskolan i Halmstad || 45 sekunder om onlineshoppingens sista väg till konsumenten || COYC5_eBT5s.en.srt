Hi, my name is Vaike Fors-

2
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,565
-I am professor of design nnography here at Halmstad University.

3
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,956
I'll tell you a little more about the Green-Log project.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,829
Join us in the elevator and I will tell you more.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,489
Have you ever bought something online?

6
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:34,916
Imagine all the logistics to get that product-

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
-From the producer to your kitchen table.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,000
In the Green-Log project, we are 29 partners in ten different countries-

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,200
-and with 6.3 million in EU contributions we will implement-

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,267
-timely innovative “Last Mile” delivery solution-

11
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,600
-Which is completely sustainable.

12
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:56,906
Researchers from Halmstad University participate in this project-

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,326
-To help five cities establish so -called Urban Living Labs.

14
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:05,036
These Living Labs will also do co-creation activities together-

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,975
-With the interested parties and citizens in these areas.

16
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:11,905
And we will also facilitate trade zones between them.

17
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,110
We design with people, not just for them.
