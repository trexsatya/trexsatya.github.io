00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,933
My name is \ halaa elshebeny-

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:10,867
-And I read the preschool teacher education \ H \ HERE at Halmstad University.

3
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:16,067
Right now I am in the Q-house, where we spend most of the time.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,400
I chose this program because I enjoy working with younger children.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,800
I worked before as a system tester.
 But felt that I will-

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,440
-Bab with people and especially with children of preschool age.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,080
The best thing about the program is that it is very broad and interesting-

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
-and that we have very experienced and dedicated teachers-

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,640
-As is happy to share their experiences.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,080
We read, among other things, about children's care, learning-

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,840
-And development that together form a whole.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,640
We get several occasions to be out on internship-

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,040
-And practice at preschools.
 And it's called VFU.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,400
This is a great way to anchor the theory in practice-

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,080
-Then we get to plan and implement several teaching opportunities with the children.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,200
In the future so-

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,160
-I want to work at a preschool where I together with my future colleagues-

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,080
-To the basis for children's lifelong learning.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,840
I also want to invest in creating a good environment-

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,080
-And meet the needs of the children.
