1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Do you know what I have done?
 I bought some Axfood shares.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,080
-Axfood?
 What can you do about Axfood?
 -I got tips from a share expert.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,680
Wait.
 Before you invested did you read well?

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,880
No, I didn't read on myself.
 I got tips from a stock expert as well.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,360
Do you understand what you have done?!
 You have to keep track of P/E ratios, valuation, dividend!

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,320
-You need to know what does before you invest.
 -Sid, sorry, sorry.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,360
What then sorry?
 Now you come along!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
-What is going on?
 -Okay.
 You bought the Axfood share.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,000
Now gasoline prices have risen.
 Then there will be worse margins.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,640
It costs more to deliver to and from the stores.
 The share falls 10 %.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:54,200
What are you doing?
 A. buys more.
 B. sells everything.
 C. retains.

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,160
-I do not know.
 -How you can't know?!

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,320
You have to count on it!
 You need to know what you do before you buy shares.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,480
Sorry.
 I would only buy one share.
 It would go up and I sell with a profit.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,160
Okay.
 We turn it on.
 Axfood beats expectations.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,960
Profit and growth will be 7 and 5 % better than expected.

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,120
The share rises 3 %.
 What are you doing now?

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,960
A. buys more.
 B. sells everything.
 C. retains.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,200
3 % up?
 I keep.
 I do not know.

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
-C.
 I keep.
 -Why do you do it?

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,320
Please, I don't know.
 Sorry.
 I have no idea.
