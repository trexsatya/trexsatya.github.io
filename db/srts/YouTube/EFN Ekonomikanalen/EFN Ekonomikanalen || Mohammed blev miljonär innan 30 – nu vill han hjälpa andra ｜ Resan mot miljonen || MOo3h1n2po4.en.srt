1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,560
He came as a refugee from Iraq to Sweden as a 13-year-old.
 Today he is 30 years old and a millionaire.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,960
Mohammed Salih is a savings economist, stock market inspector and Instagram profile.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,240
He is a podder, writer and dad-

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,840
-And today he is here to talk about his journey towards the million.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,000
-Welcome here, Mohammed.
 -Thanks.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,760
So fun to have you here.
 We will hear about your trip to the million today.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,200
-Do you have always been interested in savings?
 -Yes, I've been.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,680
I can remember back to when I came to Sweden.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,280
Already then I started to take an interest in savings and the entrepreneurial.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,680
Now it is prescribed, but before New Year-

11
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,840
—I used to ask my dad to buy out a bunch of big rocket-

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,600
-And then I sold them pieces.

13
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,240
In this way I made money and I know my family always needed more money-

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,200
-So I tried to contribute as much as possible.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,280
You and your family fled from Iraq to Sweden.
 Can you tell us a little about it?

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,600
Yes, and it wasn't that we took the flight from Iraq and landed in Sweden.

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,720
Without it was a long escape route, we were on the run for several years-

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,680
-And did a lot of middle stops before we landed in Sweden.

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,400
We are incredibly grateful for that.

20
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,200
So a long escape route that resulted in the new home Sweden.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,080
-You grew up in Ronneby.
 -Yes, first Rosengård and then Ronneby.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,680
Or Kallinge that is the metropolis for me.
 It's just there that I feel at home.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,920
That you have this escape in the luggage, how has it affected your view of money and finances?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,920
This is probably what has made me so interested and constantly want money.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,880
It creates such security.

26
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,720
During the escape trip we did not even have money for food and clothes.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,760
Then Mom got to beg clothes and food.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,160
Although I will never end up in that situation in Sweden-

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:32,160
-So money is a damn security for me and the dependence on money comes from it.

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,720
What does it mean for you to be in Sweden?

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,520
It is difficult to explain with words.
 My love for Sweden is really boundless.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
There is nothing that I am so grateful for-

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,640
-As Sweden opened its arms to our family.

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,960
For after 13 years on escape-

35
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,320
-or 13 years of uncertainty before getting this residence permit-

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,320
-It can't describe how nice it felt.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,720
-When did you discover the stock exchange?
 -When I was around 22-23, quite a few years ago.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,280
It was through a friend actually.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,000
We were going to MMA training.
 I drove a car, he sat next to it.

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm pretty social so I like to talk.

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,680
He was not as social at all so I asked what he was doing.

42
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,200
Then he bought and sold shares on his mobile and earned a lot of money-

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,280
-On this short part we drove.

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,000
Then I felt that I had to learn about shares if it is possible to make money via mobile.

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,760
Before you put your savings goal to become a millionaire, what did your life look like then?

46
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,640
Can you get a snapshot from Mohammed Back in the Day?

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,160
Then I had bought my first apartment.

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:03,080
I had no savings goals, and without savings goals it is quite difficult to save money.

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,920
Because then you feel that you have nothing to save for.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,200
An economic yet spent Mohammed who did not care very much about economics.

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,040
I had no budget at that time, but I took life as it came.

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,960
It was probably more before.

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,560
How did it go when you decided on the million?

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,120
Money is very taboo in Sweden.

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,600
No one talks about it, you must never ask what anyone earns, hardly what anyone has in interest.

56
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,040
I wanted to try to change that, document everything I do-

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,760
-and become a millionaire before I'm thirty.

58
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,760
How did it go at the beginning of your investment trip?

59
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
It went okay, actually.

60
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,680
I went on the big raffle before I started Mohammed's path to the million.

61
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:02,160
I knew I would buy a lot of investment companies and buy very wide.

62
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,240
I had 150,000 that I did not invest right away, because I had already burned myself once.

63
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,320
So I started by buying very broadly, as if I managed an index portfolio.

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,320
Slowly but surely I built it up and the money rolled in, the monthly salary came in.

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,560
It felt good.

66
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,560
How did it feel when you really got to see this interest rate on the interest effect come?

67
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,960
It took off after a while.
 The money only grew-

68
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,520
-And sometimes they made balance updates two, three days in succession.

69
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,800
I had SEK 10,000-balance updates, but they came more often and more often-

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,000
-In and with the stock market just going up and interest on interest was becoming more and more powerful.

71
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,680
It was a great feeling.

72
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,880
You hear about it very often, but it is even more powerful when you get to experience it.

73
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,880
Did you make any changes to your everyday life to increase savings?

74
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,680
Yes I did.
 I knew this will not last for any length of time.

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Hopefully I would become a millionaire before thirty.
 Then I was 26 or something.

76
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,160
So four years left.
 Then I felt I had to make some changes.

77
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,000
I earned about 28,000 gross.
 Not very high salary, but not very low either.

78
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,640
But I knew I had to start working a little extra.

79
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,440
I waived SL cards and went back and forth to work-

80
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,960
-From Sundbyberg, it takes an hour and a half to go easy.

81
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,320
No outdoor lunches or outdoor dinners, I didn't go out at all.

82
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,360
For any length of time you can't live that way, but it was a short period of time-

83
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,280
-And I felt it was worth it.
 Pretty big changes in my consumption ...

84
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,080
You tried to obtain revenue in other ways, you started a "flipping account".

85
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
What does "flipping" mean?

86
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,920
Someone sells an ore agency from Ikea.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,440
It is in very fine condition, maybe it is before a move.

88
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,000
The price is a hundred bucks and I know that a new one costs 1,200.

89
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,280
I pick it up, polish it a little with a wet napkin

90
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,800
-To it out and flips ... I put it out for 500 bucks.

91
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,800
Then I flipped this item and made a lot of money.

92
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,760
I did it often and received around SEK 50,000 in 25 months.

93
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,400
-Wow.
 And that money you invested.
 -Yes.
 Above all students ...

94
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,040
... usually ask how to fix extra money.
 "Forex trading?"

95
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,880
No, "flipping," I answer.
 So good, and you can make a lot of money.

96
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,840
Then you can think that all those agencies and armchairs are part of your million today.

97
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,520
Really, and in addition to the money, you do something very good for the environment.

98
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,200
So it's win-win for everyone, for the buyer, for the environment, and for your own wallet.

99
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Now we will have an overview of Mohammed's savings.

100
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,080
Mohammed, a person who has inspired you is this one.
 Who is it?

101
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,200
It is the "stock test", a great role model both for me-

102
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,720
-and all ordinary people who only have a few hundred dollars to start saving with.

103
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,320
He started at SJ with a couple of hundred dollars and finally had SEK 140 million.

104
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,520
-What is so exciting about him?
 -He shows that everyone can invest.

105
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,680
Everyone can create a great fortune through the stock exchange.

106
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,960
You did, but it has also looked like this.
 A hardship you have had.

107
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,920
Yes, when I bought my very first stock.
 The Marketing Group was delivered from the stock exchange-

108
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,520
-So it was a huge hardship.

109
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,320
But some patches on the tracks may come here.
 A lesson: "Everyone makes mistakes."

110
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Yes, that's it.
 No matter how knowledgeable man is-

111
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,920
-How much you have plugged in, how well inserted you are in the industry-

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,280
-I is actually that everyone makes mistakes.
 It is important not to make the same mistake.

113
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,440
An opportunity that meant a lot to you was this.
 What do we see?

114
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,640
Yes, here you see me lecture, and now I have become quite large on social media-

115
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,280
-But this is my first major lecture, and it is at the Börshajen event in Malmö.

116
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,720
That was where I came when I came to Sweden.
 It felt very, very big.

117
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,600
Did it also open a desire to be seen and heard more?

118
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,960
Yes, and above all to meet people and lecture.

119
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,200
It will be a completely different thing than just sitting digitally.
 It was a big milestone.

120
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,200
What was your biggest motivation?

121
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,560
A huge driving force behind running the account and continuing with it-

122
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,880
-Ist know that people look up to me, do as I do, take hold of their financial

123
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,960
-Fears their parents to invest ...

124
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,560
It has been the biggest motivation and inspiration for me.

125
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,280
-Getting others to grab their finances.
 -Can it not make you a little scared too?

126
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,480
-You get a great responsibility?
 -Yes.

127
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,040
Therefore, you have to be careful what you do and communicate.

128
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:55,520
I am 99.9 % transparent with everything I do, but I buy an ill-white small company-

129
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,480
-I may not own it to my 80,000 followers because the course is affected.

130
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,520
So I have to choose mine ... that 0.1 percent I can choose not to go out with.

131
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,320
-It can be a Mohammed effect there?
 -Yes, there may be a small effect.

132
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:22,040
You started when you were 26. What was most difficult during this savings trip?

133
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,160
To stay motivated, actually.
 Sometimes one goes out in snowstorm-

134
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,280
-And know that "today I will go to work because I will not buy an SL card".

135
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,160
To motivate yourself to everything all the time, choose things ...

136
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,120
... don't go for expensive dinners with the poles, or go to concerts with good artists ...

137
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,640
You had to do ... you had to prioritize, so prioritization was probably the most difficult.

138
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,720
What did you see for a dream picture that made you say no to everything that was pushing?

139
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,520
It was that I had so many followers.
 I didn't want to disappoint them.

140
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,840
"I'll really go to the finish with this."

141
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,280
The nice was that I know many made the same trip while I did it-

142
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,160
-And when I reached the million it has been transparent with everything.

143
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,880
Then you got in their DM ... "I also reached the million!"

144
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Or "I've reached this milestone".
 It was very nice.

145
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:45,520
The followers have been my biggest motivation, of course.
 More than this million.

146
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,240
-Do you what the day you became a millionaire?
 -Yes.

147
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,760
-What happened then?
 -I bought champagne and celebrated.

148
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,400
A little celebration with me and my partner.
 "Shit, what a trip."

149
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,160
She has also helped me, had an understanding of four ore agencies in the hall ...

150
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,320
I felt I had to share the joy.

151
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,520
-We celebrated with champagne and food.
 -Gud, what a wonderful.

152
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,680
Now we will have a look at which holdings have led Mohammed up to the million.

153
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,200
Voilà!
 What we see here is a selection of the portfolio that you had-

154
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,480
-During the journey towards the million.
 We have selected some of your biggest holdings.

155
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,400
You had a very large portfolio.

156
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,120
But here we have then picked out the investment company Kinnevik, SBB-

157
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:55,000
-Evolution and a fund - MS Asia Opportunity.
 What was your investment strategy?

158
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,520
"Buy very much and very wide."
 That was my strategy.

159
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Should one of the companies go over, I have 20 others who can back up.

160
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,960
So my philosophy was not that I just have growth or just value-

161
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,920
-Or to buy broadly, and buy in several different sectors.
 And I succeeded.

162
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Here we see an investment company, but in your portfolio there were some more.

163
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,160
-Why do you like investment companies?
 -They are self -sufficient.

164
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,120
They are amazingly good historically, heavy families behind that have been for a long time-

165
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,240
-Gedigen return historically, good balance sheets-

166
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,880
-Get or approved dividend, so ...

167
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:52,480
At least the majority of them bends off all my criteria.

168
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,920
Sbb, then?

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,920
Yes ... the second most owned stock in all of Sweden, which is totally sick.

170
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,120
And at this time, when the portfolio formed-

171
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,720
-The sbb don't at all be the favorite it has become now.

172
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,640
It was really a start -up.

173
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:22,200
It sounds very safe: long contracts, community properties, stable cash flows-

174
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:29,720
-and then quite low mortgaged because they had not started with the acquisition shoulderlomerate ...

175
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,560
Then it was a very nice company that I thought in my portfolio.

176
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,880
How did you reason about funds, then?
 There was a greater focus on shares.

177
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,600
Yes, of course.
 I think I had two funds if I don't remember.

178
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,840
Asia was one of them I didn't have ...

179
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,240
That sector, or the country, or the continent I did not have much exposure to.

180
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,520
All these are very European and American-

181
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,600
-And I wanted to be exposed to Asia as well.

182
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,320
Then it became Morgan Stanley's very expensive Asia Fund, but it returned very good-

183
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,600
-And has delivered fantastic returns.

184
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,000
-So your portfolio out like this today?
 -Two of these four are left.

185
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Evolution is still the greatest possession-

186
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,280
-Kinnevik ends well in sixth or seventh place, or perhaps even further down-

187
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,000
-But Evolution and Kinnevik remain.

188
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,600
There are certainly many who want to make a similar savings trip.

189
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,480
What are your two, three best tips to succeed?

190
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,840
You have to set concrete goals.

191
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,920
If you have no concrete goal, saving will be quite diffuse.

192
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,360
"I'll reach here before I'm ..." both a goal and a schedule.

193
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,760
I think.
 Then you become very motivated to follow your goals and can prioritize correctly.

194
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:10,720
One more tip is to celebrate the sub -goals as well.
 At every 100,000 we went out and had dinner.

195
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,880
We did a lot for the trip in general.

196
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,960
And then, remember that it is not the goal but the trip that is important.

197
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,720
Thank you very much, Mohammed, for being here.
