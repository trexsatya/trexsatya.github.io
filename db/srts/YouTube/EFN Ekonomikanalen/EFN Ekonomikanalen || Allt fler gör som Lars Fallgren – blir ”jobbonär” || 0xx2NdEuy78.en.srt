1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
The day I go and buy the magazine it is over in my life.
 I have more to give.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,560
Sweden is getting more and more "job sonaries", people over 65 who combine jobs and pensions.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,560
Why?
 And what should a pensioner who works think about?

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,720
We try to find out in this feature.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,600
A joy in life.
 Not only to say thank you and goodbye, but continue some more.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,840
It is above all fun.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,840
Lars Fallgren had a full working life in the advertising industry behind Sig-

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,400
-When it was time to retire.
 But the sofa cover did not attract-

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,200
-Instället was involved in starting the thunderstorm "rents a pensioner" in Stockholm.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,200
In recent years he has written children's books.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,280
I'm probably an uncle who thinks something should happen in life.
 Are the children's chefs happy-

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,880
-Above my figures, it pleases me.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,880
My ambition is that it will be a theater in the first step.
 I hope so.

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,920
It would be great fun to be involved and do it.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Figures from the Pension Authority show that the number of "job sonaries" increased constant-

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
-In the 2010s.
 According to a survey from Jönköping University-

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,120
-As every third person over 60 jobonar or plan to be.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,920
When you have done something that you may be quite good at, you get huge feedback.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,280
And maybe you can get some crown.
 I am absolutely convinced.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,560
For those who want to combine jobs and pensions, there are some things to keep track of.

21
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,440
Of your general pension you can withdraw 25, 50, 75 or 100 % per month-

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,800
-Over how much you work.
 And from 2023, according to the Employment Protection Act

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,760
-do you right to work up to the age of 69 without getting rid of your employment-

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,840
-On the basis of age.
 Also keep an eye on the income of pension and job-

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,400
-Compassed and the limit for state tax is around SEK 52,000 per month.

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,200
Working longer is always profitable.

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,280
In addition to receiving pay, your future pension is also increasing.

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,040
For example, one can sit on boards of the company-

29
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,200
-Lite depending on the skills they need.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,560
Are there any risks to continue working as a pensioner?

31
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,040
Yes, there is, of course.
 Especially if you work too much.

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,200
How are you treated as a working elderly by individuals and society?

33
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,120
Very positive.
 We asked the question to several people:

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,800
Why do you use us 60-plus?

35
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,680
"It's so safe. You may be a little long, but it's positive and safe."
