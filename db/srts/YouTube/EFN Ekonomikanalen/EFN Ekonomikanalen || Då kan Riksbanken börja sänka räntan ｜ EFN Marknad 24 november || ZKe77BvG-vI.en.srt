00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,200
On Thursday morning, the Riksbank came with the last interest rate message of the year

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,520
-And there it was clear that the interest rate was left unchanged.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,000
Is it ready now, or is it just a break?

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,360
This will be about in today's EFN market.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,520
We also say welcome to today's guest.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,720
It is Claes Måhlén, chief strategist at Handelsbanken.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,520
-Welcome.
 -Thanks thanks.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,080
The main track was for a long time that the Riksbank would implement a last interest rate hike-

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,520
-But the closer the message we got, the more the scales moved-

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,600
-In the direction of unchanged.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,040
Before the interest rate announcement this morning, it was basically completely open.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
An unusually fragmented analyst corps.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
How would you like to describe the advance talk?

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,480
The picture has changed a little bit, not least after the last inflation figure-

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,600
-This was a little lower than we expected, but still higher than the Riksbank thought.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,040
At the same time, the krona has been strengthened quite significantly since the Riksbank's latest message in September.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,280
So there were definitely things in both scales.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,960
We counted on raising.
 Now it remained unchanged.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,720
We go directly to the message itself.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,480
The Riksbank chooses to pause after eight straight interest rate hikes since the spring of 2022-

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,000
-Retro zero to four percent.
 What was your initial reaction?

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,720
We counted on a raise, but it was not an equally obvious message-

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,920
-When it has been lately.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,120
It is continued to point out a certain probability of interest rate hike in the future.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,960
In fact, you have the same peak in the forecast of 4.10 %-

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,000
-As you had in September.
 So you want to keep the door open for raising.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,600
But it is clear that one ignores a little from the fact that inflation has continued-

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,840
-To developing weaker than expected and chooses to wait.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,800
How do you think the Riksbank is reasoning here?

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,880
You do not want to do unnecessarily much damage to the economy.

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
It is clearly a factor.

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,400
Then you are comfortable that inflation is still heading in the right direction.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,240
We must remember that Swedish inflation, just like Norwegian-

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,240
-As clearly higher than in Europe, the euro average.

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,720
But you seem to be able to handle the uncertainty that exists and choose to wait.

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,560
One also lets the interest rate hikes that have already implemented

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,480
-Surge work into the economy.

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,840
Weakened labor market, increased unemployment and that the crown has been strengthened slightly in the near-time

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
-Is it also causes behind?

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
You do not mention the crown explicitly, but it has certainly affected.

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,800
If it had been a weaker penny, it could have been another decision.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,440
The labor market has weakened, on the other hand fairly expected-

43
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,560
-For it has been a puzzle piece that has rather been missing before.

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,680
The economy has slowed down, but the labor market has remained strong.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,520
Now we see that even the labor market reacts a bit to a weaker economy.

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,840
It is expected, but still something that ends up in the scales for unchanged interest rates.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,640
Given that the analyst corps was so divided before this decision-

48
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,920
-So it would be almost surprising if the Executive Board was also a bit divided on the issue.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,600
Did the Executive Board agree in this decision?

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
It agreed, in fact.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
It does not mean that you did not do a little different considerations-

52
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,920
-But you finally chose to vote in the same way all five.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,160
Is there any risk that the Riksbank's measures against inflation are not sufficient

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,840
-And inflation thus bites stuck?

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,200
It is absolutely the risk.

56
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,080
Both on the basis that inflation is still clearly higher than the Riksbank's target-

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,720
-But also that you are now at the same level as the ECB in policy rate, 4 %.

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
You may think that it is reasonable that the Riksbank is a little higher.

59
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,040
This has been done on average historically and the crown is still weak.

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,560
It is possible to not just raise the interest rate again makes it harder-

61
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,960
-For the crown to continue to recover.

62
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,640
The level of the crown, although it has been strengthened, is still weak.

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,440
There are risks here that may mean that it takes longer for inflation to come down.

64
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,760
If we look forward, the Riksbank counts in its forecasts with-

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,360
-That the policy rate may be raised at the beginning of next year already.

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,880
Is it a likely scenario?

67
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,640
Nothing can be excluded.

68
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,760
But when we go into next year, then you have come even further into this bike-

69
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,960
-svagare economy, higher unemployment and lower inflation-

70
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,160
-So that it is natural that it was almost now or never at this meeting.

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,480
Because one chose not to raise now, it is not so likely-

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,040
-That you raise at the next meeting which is at the end of January-

73
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,880
-or for that part during the next meetings.

74
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,280
It will probably require something a little extra-

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,000
-To you choose to raise so late in this bike.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,080
If we look at the Riksbank's forecast, they have lowered it marginally for the policy rate in the future.

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,520
What does such a change in the so -called interest rate track mean?

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,880
The entire track is displaced by a quarter.
 One has the same peak, 4.1 %-

79
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,280
-But then, reductions from that top in the Riksbank's forecast start a quarter earlier.

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,600
So it already begins Q2 2025, instead of Q3 2025.

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,720
So it's a shift with a quarter.

82
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,240
"The krona remains unjustified," the Riksbank writes in the decision.

83
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,920
Today's message actually caused the crown to sink further.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,400
How will this affect the Riksbank's actions in the future?

85
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,040
You flag for another action in connection with the January meeting.

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,080
It is to increase the pace of sales of government bonds.

87
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,080
It is possible that it can provide some support to the crown.

88
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,440
If the crown were to begin to weaken again-

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,040
-Then it may clearly be a question that you also need to raise interest rates.

90
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,600
But it is hoped that the crown will be normalized by itself partly when we move forward.

91
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,960
Then maybe some concern for the Swedish economy and the Swedish real estate sector also drops away.

92
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Finally, the question that I think many want to know so clearly-

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,560
-When the interest rate can start to be lowered again?

94
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,320
The Riksbank flags for it to take a long time, only in 2025.

95
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,280
We think it will come earlier than that.

96
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,960
But it can probably take until the end of next year rather than it will be earlier.

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,600
Yes, fourth quarter 2024. There somewhere.

98
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,520
