1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,960
An early Christmas present.
 So you can look at inflation data for October.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,680
Larger cases in inflation than expected in Sweden.
 The same thing in the United States, and markets-

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,520
-Tat a joy.
 Lower interest rates and higher stock exchanges.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,600
What does this mean for the Riksbank?
 Although inflation came out lower-

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,200
-Ent we expected is still higher than the Riksbank's forecast-

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,400
-In connection with the September meeting.

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,880
We therefore believe that they continue to raise.
 Raises the interest rate to 4, 25 % one last time-

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,800
-But it's not obvious.
 The crown is still weak-

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,280
-But stronger than the Riksbank counted in September.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,400
So the meeting next week will be a bit of a thriller.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,360
Another thriller is whether the US state apparatus must be shut down in part-

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
-or if it receives funding.

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,200
As the US Congress has approved financing to at least year-end-

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,400
-they it is not needed this time-

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,640
-Anable biden writes on Last Friday and he does.
