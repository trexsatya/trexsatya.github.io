1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Björn, how has the weather been in Vattholma?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,280
It has been an exciting year of huge variations.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,240
Rising fuel prices, sinking grain prices-

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,200
-And a challenging weather this summer has set it up for Sweden's farmers.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,120
We are back at Hånsta Gård in Vattholma outside Uppsala-

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,760
-To check the situation with EFN farmer Björn Wallin.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,920
Around Uppsala we have probably had a great luck.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,840
If we look only three miles west in Harbo-

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
-Where crops are under water-

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,480
-So it's nothing.
 It has arrived 160 millimeters in August.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,880
We can handle that.
 The soil swallows it when it has been dry from the beginning.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,800
But summarized: first it was drought, then it came very rain-

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,080
-And then came the storm.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,360
If you put the weather season into a historical perspective, where do you land?

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:12,240
In a fairly common weather type.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,880
Here it is early -dry.
 July and August are the rainiest months.

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
Then it may have been a little drier and a little rainier.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,280
LRF has talked about 20 % worse grain harvest than a normal year.

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,960
How has it been for you?

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,000
That figure is probably at the bottom.

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,920
The harvest will be worse than 20 percent loss.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,560
You could say that 6.5 tonnes of autumn wheat is quite normal.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,560
Spring seed ...

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,720
Yes, stiff half harvest.
 Not much more.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,680
It is the spring seed that loses.

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,160
It knows we threshing in July, an early sort-

27
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,640
-Ad the fall figures, bread quality.
 The rest is feed wheat.

28
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
As if it wasn't enough to dry and rain-

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
-To the farmers have been able to handle greatly varying prices-

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,120
-On cereals, fuel and fertilizer.

31
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,560
It's almost a new position.
 It's always on the way up or down.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,640
It's the new normal, so it's ...

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,600
-That it fluctuates ...?
 -Yes.
 It flutters very much.

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,760
What you have to do is make sure ...

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
If the fertilizer is expensive and one decides to buy-

36
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,360
-So you have to sell the grain expensive as well.

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Try to time the two, so there is ...

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,480
It is no problem to conduct agricultural-

39
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,160
-If the fertilizer costs ... 11 bucks for Kalkamsalpeter-

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,520
-And you can sell the wheat for 3.50.

41
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,200
But if you get 2 bucks for the wheat, it starts to be tight.

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,640
Then it starts to get bad.
 More "back to back" shops.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,440
Despite the uncertain circumstances, no complaint is heard from Vattholma.

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,360
It's not a shame about me or us here around Uppsala.

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:36,120
It is a pity for those who have flooding and cannot threy everything.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,960
So it is.
