1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
I do

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,072
I thought now

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,680
Make a

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:13,824
Quick overview of what happened the bitch is and where they come from

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,384
And what there are for different variants of hermeneutics

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
And

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,504
How to be able to sleep three people with music in several ways

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,808
And how this can enrich

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,112
The qualitative analyzes

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,160
I will make a card

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Translate

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
Of

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Various

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,536
Central figure within hermeneutics

15
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,632
Will all German partner agreements 90s but

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
But

17
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
So

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:46,336
I will go through these quickly it will be a pretty sloppy your historical overview but on the other side so we're not here for

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,152
Idehistoria outside to be better at qualitative method

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
And that's why I will raise this in a way that makes us

21
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:01,184
So that I can go ahead and use her shop in being research methods

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
And

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
Then

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
So will i go into

25
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,400
The concepts of suspicion's hermeneutics and reconciliation and hermeneutics

26
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,472
And the concept of rationality or for something

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
As

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,080
A central component of hermeneutics to understand

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
In which way someone resonates

30
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,224
And that can be understood in different ways in the same way

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
As I had an accident

32
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
Explanation models

33
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
Within the social science social sciences I had caused or the chaos

34
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
Speak the explanation model

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
Caffeine in coffee Thursdays me

36
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,144
To become nicer and more concentrated

37
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
We had a functional explanation

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
The coffee break fulfills an important function

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
For students

40
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
Days

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,944
Geostorm space to talk small to know each other

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
And slowly with surely establish trust

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
And a friendly attitude to each other where one shares knowledge and cooperate or

44
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,744
What does the coffee have for function in the social system

45
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Or

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
One

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
So to speak

48
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
Purpose statement

49
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Christoffer

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Drinking coffee

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
In order to

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,616
Show their affiliation to this to wash

53
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Culture

54
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
Within the academy too common to stand and lecture with a cup of coffee in hand it is something that makes

55
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
One expresses

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,648
A way of being scientific academy, etc.

57
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
Okay three examples

58
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
The third of which in any sense and

59
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,816
Pelvis the functional explanations

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Requires interpretation

61
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
While

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Cause the explanations and causal relationships

63
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
The

64
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
So to speak

65
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,664
Is about measuring weighing and describing the forces

66
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
Which creates a tennis court

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Important function

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
So

69
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
Hammarviken This music is interpretation theory interpretation theory means that we should understand

70
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Something

71
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
And

72
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,400
We must also understand something about ourselves in order to understand the one where we are to describe

73
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,496
The background to this

74
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
Vitaby

75
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
In the 70s

76
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
So in some sense the modern home store is a

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,920
Modern

78
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Invention

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
The modern her nail

80
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
Also have over the centuries

81
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
Been in a kind of low -intensity warfare or in what we then call for critical debate

82
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
With

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Positivism

84
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
And on several occasions pointed out that things especially when it comes to it

85
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:57,056
Social or mental life and expressed soulful journey 70's words for

86
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Social Darwinism

87
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Change a little

88
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
To understand people and what they think and think and what they write and what they talk about and so on

89
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,856
Unable to reduce simple facts such as positivism did

90
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Without

91
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Decree

92
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Something completely different

93
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
And here also this demonstration happens in has between qualitative and quantitative method is lost

94
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
Hard sciences it is someone who eats and roads and looks at simple facts and set them up in table

95
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,847
Or also further the causal relationship finds one

96
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
While

97
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,735
Hermeneutics yet will represent more soft science

98
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,063
We look at things that not necessarily

99
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,391
At the place where the mechanical scales such as

100
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,231
Humans humans conceptions of freedom

101
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,327
Man's conceptions of the social contexts she is part of

102
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Swedbank

103
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Is important point of view not because it is important that we have to put the name Schleiermacher on

104
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,919
The memory to probably so did not ask about it on the exam but

105
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Schleiermacher

106
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Designed

107
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
Lonely first personally about hermeneutics

108
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Where he then

109
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
First, thought that when interpretative errors the stomach we have when interpreting the material misinterprets

110
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
Not we interpret that text anything

111
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
It is

112
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:29,215
Basically a general ability that I said earlier so when we ride a tram so we know how to behave

113
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
That we know what is deviant behavior

114
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
We all know

115
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
How to ride a tram

116
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,967
It is something that rests and that has the ability to interpret and understand context than anything

117
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
As

118
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,343
Most of us at least have 99 % of all know I go tram and so on

119
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Adulthood

120
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
And so childish self to sit on

121
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,791
But already as a child like this this interpretation the ability to put things into context

122
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
Is universal

123
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,983
It is clear that we can encounter new situations go to new places on earth where one suddenly makes completely

124
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Other things are running so just yes

125
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
In Tokyo and so I would pay with my card and so handed over different like this

126
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
The card

127
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
And

128
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
Got back the card with a built in with both hands and then I realized

129
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,975
That I had taken with me completely wrong I had been very unusual as well as slender just raised my card and so on

130
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
And

131
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,399
Really, I would be polite and hand over one and both hands and not be as you are

132
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:37,055
When you walk on Seven Eleven on Vasagatan but actually consider that this situation may be different

133
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
When I buy one

134
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
Snickers basement coca-cola at a kiosk

135
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
If I do in Tokyo or with Gothenburg

136
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,087
As one can burst in the center high but we have anyway

137
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,415
The ability to learn to understand the situation all the time

138
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
What the girls thought I was interested in

139
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
It is only to analyze texts

140
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Above all

141
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
And

142
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
In order to understand a text

143
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,031
For example, a novel Roman Exercise Park in the 18th century

144
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
But above all what you have previously interpreted very much because you do not call it the hermeneutics modern sentence to be

145
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
Bible texts and religious texts

146
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,343
The Qur'an Torah and the Bible and so on

147
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,743
Have something that one constantly here interpreting to try to understand what how relate to baby

148
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Live our lives today so on

149
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
And

150
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
Then in relation to the text

151
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,007
So Schleiermacher thought that the goal of

152
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,127
The hermeneutics reconstruct the creation of it

153
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
That is

154
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
As far as possible

155
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
Repeat and repeat them

156
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
Thoughts that were behind

157
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
To

158
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,071
Wrote about the young burr or that I do not know

159
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
What are there more for novels are not good at reading books but

160
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
Type

161
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,983
Da vinci code

162
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,567
Was written what was the writer thought behind then Vinci Code

163
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
When he wrote this way what was it

164
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,943
So which tank operations figure in the head

165
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
I recognize partly from the scientific method is like this that we try to understand

166
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
Why do any coffee drink or why vote someone for an exit from the European Union

167
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,607
Etc that are going on in the heads of these people around Europe

168
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
That makes the Soviet

169
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
We try to reconstruct their

170
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
Thoughtful or how

171
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Partly in any case

172
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
This can do this with scientific methods

173
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
And

174
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
To do it

175
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
Those who say you can point it out

176
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Where

177
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,207
If we try to understand why the North English farmer wants to get out of the EU

178
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
Why

179
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
Swedish Democratic voters

180
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,679
Skeptical of the after all with his folk party voters are positively attuned to the

181
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,079
Then you can go from my prejudices about Sweden Democrats People's Parties Word English Farmers and

182
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
London -based is the financier or how

183
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
Not say that much money by myself

184
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
Amber says about their performance world

185
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
So

186
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Schleiermacher

187
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Busy with the problem

188
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
Black displays oneself

189
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
If I will understand

190
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Goethe

191
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
Navigate to writes their novels

192
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
You have to penetrate myself

193
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
And get good or maybe but at least to be part of it

194
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
The world of performance

195
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
I have to be part of the world of performance

196
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,807
That makes the north English farmer we go out after all

197
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
To understand

198
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
The social reality

199
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
From

200
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
The Conditions of the North English Farmer

201
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
How does a word in the English farmer look

202
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
On

203
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:22,335
At Brussels and politicians and how do they see the north English farmer at

204
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
Free market and so on can ask different questions and

205
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
Slowly with surely we know if we train ourselves

206
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Farmer's

207
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
By the way

208
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
And

209
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,439
Stamp back

210
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
Yr.no

211
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Part

212
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,351
Putting a whole it is only by understanding

213
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Pay

214
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
The context

215
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
By a Northern English farmer

216
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,543
As we can understand the individual phenomenon

217
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,223
Participate in Wilhelm Delta in was also finally after

218
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,599
And he builds on the idea you can say that

219
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Have some kind of empathy

220
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
As a method

221
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Solar

222
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
In the same way as that

223
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Schleiermacher

224
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
Chiquito Z Express itself

225
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
So

226
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,287
Workers Bill Time with the initial understanding

227
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,663
To get into someone else's situation Visättra We cannot become the individual

228
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
The farmer

229
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
John Smith

230
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
But on the other hand

231
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,135
So we can live in this person's situation context context

232
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,695
Or social reality

233
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
We can live in what I ask

234
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Yes it borders on empathy one could say

235
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58,847
Absolutely even though empathy also contains is a little more than just

236
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
Understanding or empathy

237
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Yes, just

238
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,599
Lot as well and so this machine components were

239
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
This person is suffering here

240
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
And then i suffer with that person almost

241
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
And also empathy often a prerequisite for doing something about it that a human being lies, etc.

242
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,983
Yes, of course it is quite close to a battery and

243
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
In order to be empathetic and one must be able to get into another person's situation

244
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Absolutely

245
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
Participants and bread for a quote I don't know on German original

246
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
But a discussion here between science and social sciences or natural sciences and those who lived in German

247
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
So Geist Wissenschaft

248
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Kjell's sciences

249
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
As

250
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:57,983
Decor sometimes translates to the humanities but also is

251
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Includes

252
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Parts of the social sciences

253
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,127
We explain nature

254
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
We remember

255
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Cause explanations

256
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,295
We remember the other plans the types but above all causal explanation gladly

257
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
The causal explanations

258
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,487
To explain why something happens why does the cup fall to the ground when letting it

259
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Yes

260
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
One

261
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,119
You can explain this with gravity Newton's laws

262
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Etc

263
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32,031
Soul life or those who want a little more modern you can call for the social life

264
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Is something that we are going to understand

265
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,223
Explain Understanding to explain science understanding how to science and social science

266
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
The survey

267
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Try again

268
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
One

269
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Distinction

270
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
As

271
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:51,487
Characterizes much of the philosophical debate of science during the 19th century

272
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
And to Thai

273
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
Is also

274
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,167
The person behind the mysterious circle

275
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
As

276
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,239
Wikipedia method literature

277
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
The hermeneutic circle

278
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
What is

279
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
The hermeneutic circle

280
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
Will drive to you when I say that the hermeneutic circle is basically the relationship between part and wholeness through unit is something

281
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
Now is starting to get tired of

282
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
But that's it

283
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
But

284
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
What is meant by this really there is a component in

285
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
The hermeneutic circle as absolutely central

286
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
The understanding

287
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Son

288
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
When I end up

289
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
An Easter bunny

290
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
So

291
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Occurs

292
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,711
Knowledge in a kind of gap between me and they examine

293
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
In the same way

294
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
As the North English Farmer's

295
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,463
Attitude toward the arises between the farmer and the farmer context

296
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
We have

297
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,815
Double part of the whole relationship here

298
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
And what to do

299
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
If we are to follow dill pie

300
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,079
Is to become part of the farmer's performance world I will live in it

301
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,711
And then I'll get back and have to account for it and then it becomes qualitative science

302
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Odeta

303
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Should I

304
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Idiot do

305
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
A type of

306
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Circular movement

307
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29,535
What do you do at home circle a circle a good concepts i would be spiral that i will soon be made

308
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
It might be one

309
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
Spiral changed a circle

310
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
So

311
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
Let's say I travel to England

312
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,567
Trips to northern England and start interviewing farmers and with u

313
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
I'll come then

314
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Understanding

315
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Or prejudice

316
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,503
I come and have my showing world

317
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
If

318
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
What means to be a farmer in northern England

319
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
I come forward

320
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,047
And is not starting to bid to talk and maybe even live with the farmers here I spend

321
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
Months

322
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
In theirs

323
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
What

324
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Where is working on

325
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,983
How to measure how to sleep how then

326
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,615
The weekends etc I try to gain a total understanding of their social reality

327
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,735
Then my past prejudices will come my understanding

328
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
To

329
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,159
Is characterized and slowly displaced by the fact that I take part in this second understanding

330
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
I get one step closer

331
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
Northern English farmer

332
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
And what happens to my prejudice when I meet

333
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
The light of something new

334
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,799
If you can come home with my prejudice new as well as teach me new things about what means to be an angel

335
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Peasant

336
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Interpreters

337
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
It changes it in hospital

338
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
It is found on menu knowledge

339
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,063
And some of my performances that I had

340
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,599
For example

341
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
All enough English farmers

342
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,743
Smelling strange because they are out and keep up with all day

343
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Maybe it

344
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
Falls in the light of new knowledge

345
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,679
I see that the peasants in northern England they do

346
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:17,055
Very much with paperwork finances to make their companies go around

347
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:23,455
Nordic farmers who are very active in local politics north English farmers perhaps also

348
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,855
Do completely different things that don't even involve animals they may not deal with it

349
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,207
Just up breeding sheep and such things one can do with tourism and such things

350
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,023
I learn lots of new things about Nordic farmers

351
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
And my parts

352
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
And my prejudice

353
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Can be crushed

354
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
Others can be strengthened

355
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
But no matter what so my understanding changes

356
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,591
And this is the exciting happy to snack

357
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
And circle movement anyway

358
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
Makes us imagine

359
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
That we start she is the starting point

360
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
Here I have only my

361
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
Performances

362
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
About Swedish peasants English farmers French farmers French Babblarna's notion that they are going and demonstrating in Paris Hill

363
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
A few days now, only two of the French farmers do this but it is the only thing shown on TV about Swedish farmers

364
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,495
That and romantically fine vineyards and such things

365
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,103
Way I have updated resource price mode so I have it the knowledge that

366
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Connects I have

367
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455
I go to England not we have the farmers

368
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
30 back again and

369
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
Clothes and not to the same place

370
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
By far a new flat

371
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:38,463
Turn off new knowledge New understanding maybe new prejudice new knowledge of something

372
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Since

373
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
Passed that they should return to the peasants

374
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Continue

375
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
Based on a new understanding horizon

376
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
Are you in

377
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
Commute back and forth and this I don't matter how to do interviews when interviews and in the past

378
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
On reads about that

379
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,735
Think more about what why answer

380
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,831
Or if i text analysis you return to a text man interpret

381
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,671
Because you read policy decision -making is and will interpret them

382
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
Or

383
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Legislative texts

384
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
Or you read different report

385
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
Etc

386
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:21,215
You analyze these with something special that we focus on something that is already issues

387
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,127
Then you can interpret the text and interpret the text to interpret the text you can keep on this

388
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
The monks of medieval Europe

389
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:35,551
Keeps up with their entire life interpreting the Bible etc. Returned Return Returned

390
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
All the time then

391
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
So change

392
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
The understanding because we fill up a new meeting with the text with man with interviews

393
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,095
With the culture that becomes studying them in anthropologists

394
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Or

395
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:55,775
I return return we return to be heard again and retrieve circular movement that may not be a circular movement

396
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:01,151
Ways we can never get back to the same point a circle walks around around or how

397
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
Rather be seen as a kind of spiral movement

398
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
Where we hopefully

399
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,391
Gain a better understanding of you north English farmer

400
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Or the one

401
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
19th century benefit or a no policy document or yet

402
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,727
Investigation that was made up of a department or whatever it is we write an essay or research on or how

403
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Spiral circle movement

404
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:35,199
Is that as before our knowledge and makes the more scientific literature Petter

405
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,111
We continue into the 20th century and he at home after interface curtains

406
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
His Georg Gadamer

407
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
I think

408
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
And

409
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Gadamer

410
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
Was very critical of methods where sounds a bit strange

411
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
But Gadamer

412
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
He took home the music

413
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
Further

414
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
To a level

415
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,015
To also include reflection on

416
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
How we as a researcher go about

417
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,111
In this

418
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,184
The hermeneutic circle or what we should now call that spiral

419
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
About mine

420
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,864
Research you are about Nordic farmers

421
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,264
So I have a number of method rules because I will do it may have set up interview questions I might have with

422
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,408
Tape recorder i may have different things i imagine this of this this i shall look at

423
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,504
Here my analysis schedule this is my method of accessing you

424
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,344
Is the attitude of the Nordic countries to the European cooperation

425
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
I have

426
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
This

427
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
With me when I sit on the airplane at Landvetter and go to Gatwick 11 Avenue ended up somewhere

428
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,120
And a few hundred

429
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,984
Kilos of carbon dioxide later find me England and I have so to speak too

430
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
Research methods

431
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,104
Are, after all, impregnated by an understanding

432
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Hello

433
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,992
We create our questions and issues based on something that we

434
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,528
Have read or

435
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,136
Taken to us at the education etc I learned some method and so yes but

436
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,304
Qualitative content analysis Jajamen Discourse Analysis This is how you do a qualitative interview so here that people Cup's interview

437
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
It says that you should do this and here and here

438
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
SMS: a

439
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
No

440
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:36,288
We must also rely on reflecting then her

441
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
To our methods

442
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Namely

443
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
When we

444
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
Meets what we study

445
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,784
If it is Nordängen's farmer or an investigation text or policy document

446
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Which

447
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
So we must be prepared to revise our methods as well

448
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
While we are researching

449
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,488
It might very well be like that

450
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
That I think I should

451
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,656
Ask five questions to the Nordic farmers that this will give me the answer to why they don't like

452
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,704
But once I get there

453
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,984
So i discover to

454
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
The question is misbehaved

455
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
Is not about

456
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,712
Complicated biographical papers from Brussels one had to fill in

457
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,296
It is not at all about what this is about instead

458
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,136
The nation's self -determination and the right to have a

459
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,488
Not to influence so that the decisions are made far away something there

460
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
The question of wrong

461
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
And the way I analyze it on

462
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,448
Nor was it very well in line with the reality I met when I went to northern England

463
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
Saga number said

464
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
We

465
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:44,640
Must also think about our own methods

466
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
And puts

467
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,712
As we, so to speak

468
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,552
Transforms a Nordängens peasant game study object

469
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
And

470
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,024
Because otherwise we do

471
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
Say the mistakes that

472
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,704
Hemnet Fristad had accused positivism of reducing to study objects

473
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
An English farmer

474
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
Setting to U.

475
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
The

476
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Have

477
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,432
Depends on these they find we

478
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,272
That set a consequence if we ask these five questions

479
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
What if there are six questions

480
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
Or what if it's just a completely different question

481
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
Which is actually closer to the truth

482
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
These

483
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,328
Särdal 5 things on the checklist that we thought we would

484
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Do that

485
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:43,008
We must, so to speak, as her think interpretative and within the qualitative method Anna was soft in

486
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
For the fact of being

487
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,408
Research instruments may have to change during the course of work

488
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:54,528
And when you conduct interviews, for example, I use qualitative interview

489
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,552
Then you will

490
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,600
Hopefully discover this

491
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:04,000
Bread before we write an essay that we know how to deal with this problem but you return and so

492
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,328
Press Play on the tape recorder and then you get on

493
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,448
Wait now I would I have asked a completely different thing here really it now realizes 41 degrees

494
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,800
We humans and we come on afterwards were mistakes

495
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,384
Idiot way so we are in a circle

496
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,968
Movement and can return and ask new questions, etc.

497
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:29,856
Practical reasons so you are kind so they have booked an interview that does not want to disturb people anymore and so you just say

498
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,952
35 weeks to write c-thesis etc so that

499
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,792
This is something that rather must speak reflective before

500
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
One that one can necessarily

501
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,888
Do if things say

502
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Pam

503
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Another concept as new

504
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
Perhaps encounter in the literature

505
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Whether they read

506
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,040
Method literature or you read as more overall texts

507
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,600
The concept of understanding

508
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Horizon or

509
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,160
Horizon

510
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
Fusion

511
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
And

512
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,912
Sometimes harvests a little fluffy concept that it is often used a bit sloppy but

513
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
The goal with

514
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,288
The hermeneutic survey

515
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
Is it completely different

516
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Schleiermacher

517
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
Displacement of oneself

518
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
Horizon melting

519
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,368
Does not necessarily mean that I like this

520
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,184
Will it be the English farmer.

521
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,744
What thinks just like him

522
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
As I like this

523
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
There are probably opportunities we can become other people and so on because in some sense there is

524
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,520
Individuality that changes this I can never become

525
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
Exactly

526
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
I study

527
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,408
Yet scientists are like

528
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
I do not know

529
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
Research about

530
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Something and

531
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,856
Like becoming very friendly and positively set and perhaps become

532
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
See the messages themselves culture

533
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,512
What is in anthropology is called go native when one becomes one of

534
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,840
One that culture that one is studying

535
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,448
Without horizon meltdown is rather about

536
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
Atman

537
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,288
So to speak

538
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,616
Can take to stand on that horizon

539
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
As

540
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
The north English farmer

541
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
Or

542
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,320
The London -based financier

543
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,392
Understand the world from the outside

544
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
And

545
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:43,488
Understand the world in that way but then

546
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Retire

547
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,048
Its

548
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,328
Its original mode

549
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
Say

550
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,168
That we can consider the world

551
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
From

552
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
What's study object

553
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Horizon

554
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,408
Looking out over the same horizon as was 21

555
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,040
But we are not where study objects or on this fine discussion that is between these two things

556
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
Not entirely clear

557
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
But

558
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,416
The goal of the research

559
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,208
Is to stand

560
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
On the same

561
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
Horizon to look out over type

562
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,912
English Channel based on Northern England

563
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,192
To understand

564
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
Power in Brussels

565
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
EU

566
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,592
Eevee practice based on this farmer's

567
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:31,872
Horizon

568
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
We look from the same position

569
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,224
In the minute Horizont

570
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Merged

571
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:39,296
From the same position

572
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
But not

573
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
To be the same person

574
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
This was for the Kalmar target

575
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,256
With

576
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Hermeneutics

577
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,328
And

578
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,680
Exactly then as tanning turns on prejudice

579
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,984
Or understanding as an obstacle

580
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,312
Is to see it rather as an asset

581
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
It was he says

582
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,920
I have a different understanding of the phenomenon is after all

583
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
A study of yarn

584
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,552
I have borrowed for understanding of other prejudices

585
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,880
I've been to Brussels

586
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,280
They have not been this picture and so on we understand Brussels in different ways and European Union

587
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Differently

588
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
And

589
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
To

590
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:31,520
I said to say can make myself aware that my understanding is different from you

591
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
Subject understanding

592
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
So i get a contrast

593
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,712
Or I get a kind of conflict

594
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
The doll

595
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,040
See different paradoxes

596
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:48,160
And by another understanding, I can ask questions that in turn

597
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,720
Can provoke out certain types of answers

598
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
So that

599
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,768
The wardermo gains that

600
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,120
Prejudice to understand something we can use

601
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
For

602
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
To illuminate

603
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
Well on Avtech

604
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
Send

605
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
That which we try

606
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Comprehend

607
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
Sounds super abstract or

608
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,296
Should I take it once again now another work

609
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
Or units

610
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
Why Dennis okay

611
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
Okay like that

612
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
I have a prejudice

613
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
If

614
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,760
I have prejudices about Sweden Democratic voters that they are low -educated

615
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,648
This prejudice I have and

616
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,184
I

617
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
Do you have the task to

618
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Research about

619
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,608
Swedish Democrats electoral behavior and political attitude

620
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:07,520
I go and I have accumulated about ten Swedish Democrats Minicars.se that this team

621
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
People

622
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,408
I ask different questions to them and get

623
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
To some extent

624
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
This

625
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Prejudice

626
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
Challenged by

627
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,064
Peter here

628
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,392
The Swedish Democrats are highly educated and come with

629
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,184
Very

630
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
Detailed arguments

631
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
As

632
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,840
Is related to a higher level of education

633
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Then

634
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
I think

635
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:41,824
All the time then I'm going to the crushed revised here are also highly educated Sweden Democratic voters

636
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
As

637
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,944
Working strong e-education

638
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
Aspect, etc.

639
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,088
And then I can say reflect on

640
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:59,744
But why did I have that prejudice about low -skilled Swedish Democratic voters what can they tell me

641
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,024
About this one

642
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,048
To

643
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,608
For example, there is then this one

644
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,680
Prejudice that I have received to me by the fact that

645
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
So to speak

646
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,544
Is in my bubble as

647
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:19,456
Academics or something like this by spending time with people who often say that the Swedish Democrats in Sweden

648
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,760
Team pictures hillbillies etc

649
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:28,672
So you prejudice has an origin in a kind of contrast that this prejudice might explain

650
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:34,560
Why these Swedish Democrats voters in some sense are so much against

651
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
This

652
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,632
The context that I come from

653
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Of course

654
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,568
People who have prejudice against each other are often in some sense in different worlds or in conflict with each other

655
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,104
Advanced all the time

656
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
So then I can say use reflections on why my prejudice so to say what it was before

657
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
Origin and how they can explain

658
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
Start it

659
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:01,440
The contrast that arises in against the Swedish Democratic voter

660
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:09,120
It is something that anthropologists 118 20th century colonial anthropologists constantly wrestled with

661
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:15,520
But they went out into the British Empire and the German Empire, etc. and would study what they call primitive

662
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Tours

663
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
They got there then of course I had prejudice

664
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,408
How many Therese anthropologists

665
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:26,016
Just went there and confirmed the prejudice and said that yes but compared to

666
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,880
The British formed man

667
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,440
So these people are just

668
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,512
Cdon button civilized

669
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,072
Others tried so to speak

670
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
Wait for their prejudice and understand thought system from within and understand how society

671
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Built

672
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
And then when they returned

673
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
So

674
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
Related to

675
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,664
Run prejudice and so will

676
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,064
But it is not so much civilized that he fulfills functions that we can also see in modern communities, etc.

677
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,184
We also behave we also rituals in our modern societies for example

678
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
It's not just them

679
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:13,120
So -called primitive cultures that have rituals straight and so I also we also dance around the midsummer bar and all

680
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,984
Strange pagan things that really look completely bizarre in

681
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:23,872
But we have a notion of what it means to be a modern man enlightened man, etc.

682
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,920
Contrast

683
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
What's better

684
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,064
Ideas on how to use this knowledge of one's own prejudice

685
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:38,720
As a kind of strength not only to tell about the other or the British sheep farmer

686
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
The Swedish Democratic voter

687
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,328
But also reflect on one's own knowledge

688
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,936
Situated in total where from where does my knowledge come

689
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,496
From which position

690
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,056
I stand and try to describe the world

691
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
What is it that affects this

692
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,968
This leads to the grand finale

693
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Butter

694
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
The

695
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,368
The concepts of the suspicion's hermeneutics

696
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,672
And parish hall music

697
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,464
And to some extent the concept

698
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,488
Relativism

699
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,424
Do you want six minutes on me to pull this which is just too short

700
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:24,800
But there are places that I talk fast that can be found to reverse the tape

701
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
The Hermeneutics of the suspicion

702
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,200
It has been terminated in the book here

703
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,224
Apelgatan 8

704
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
Build on

705
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:39,392
A thorough with simple ways to explain the suspicion of the suspicion of the suspicion

706
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Is

707
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
To think that

708
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Fool

709
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
A people party

710
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,280
Goes out and says

711
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,608
We will raise the gasoline tax because we think about the environment

712
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:49,888
Then

713
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,704
Is there anything else that lies behind that

714
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:58,336
Suspects that this is really about a settlement Environment Party

715
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Hello

716
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,176
It is so that I suspicion hermeneutics

717
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,712
First movement

718
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,528
That you don't believe it

719
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,320
That is on what one sometimes calls

720
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
For

721
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,136
Manifest level

722
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,672
I say

723
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
That this coffee is good

724
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,560
But really they say for a reason

725
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,096
That I want to give

726
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Praise to the one who has boiled

727
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:28,800
The cat something like this now I don't think so but I think something completely different but I say this about another reason or

728
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,432
Or in this policy report so it stands

729
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:40,576
If growth is a prerequisite for democracy in Europe and by we should

730
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:46,976
Develop Beethoven's ninth symphony as the national anthem of Europe so we will

731
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,304
What is the European Community within this VA

732
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,656
Actually this means something else that is something

733
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:59,520
That have a different meaning than those expressed on it manifestar yesterday

734
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
There is only another yesterday

735
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
Bred

736
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
Meaning

737
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,736
And explanations in Visby

738
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,880
A typical example of this psychoanalysis where one thinks that

739
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,696
I do one thing but really

740
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:24,096
So that doesn't depend on something but it really depends on a trauma from childhood

741
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,656
Burger King Opening hours the police

742
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
This person

743
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:35,360
Says she feels bad about the exam but really it is shopping

744
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Complete

745
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,688
Style pod in from childhood something like that

746
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
The Hermeneutics of the suspicion

747
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Or

748
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,344
Within a form of Marxist theory

749
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
When

750
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
The supervisor goes saying

751
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,536
That he has never been as happy as he bought a new Volvo

752
00:37:54,304 --> 00:38:00,448
So he does not mean that is an expression of all generation that this person has become part of

753
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
The consumer society

754
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
And

755
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,568
Actually, so is

756
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,920
When the proletarian is pleased with his new Volvo

757
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,736
So he is really exhausted and capital

758
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:18,112
I also suspect exaggerate and live a little here now but you understand the point like this

759
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,696
What is said is interesting truth lies on another level

760
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
Manifest level

761
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,256
Is

762
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,304
Only a shine

763
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,120
Because under this on it

764
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:29,888
Vegetarian

765
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:36,800
Tell a common perspective even though I survive little about in different discourse analytical perspectives text interpretation

766
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,616
Active looking for underlying meaning

767
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:46,016
We can look for underlying racism in texts we can look for underlying sexism performances

768
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
A little female and so on

769
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
In a text

770
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:54,720
We can look for different types without biology thus almost all ideology critical

771
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,744
Perspective

772
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Is

773
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Based on

774
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
Mistake

775
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,472
The opposite of MR not like this with coffee Personal Hemnet you parish home Rättvik

776
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,008
Is much more

777
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,824
19th century hermeneutics

778
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,152
One could say that Schleiermacher is one

779
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Personality her stings

780
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,248
All I want to do I understand

781
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:21,856
How Göte thought when he wrote about the suffering of young Werther

782
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,904
I want black people

783
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,184
Shop at the same

784
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
And

785
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
When

786
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,888
Volvo Proletarian says I'm so happy

787
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,960
Over new Volvo I'm so proud of my new Volvo

788
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Then

789
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
So shall we understand that joy

790
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,176
Parish hall Rättvik ie parish halls opening hours

791
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:50,016
Wrong what is happening and what is real

792
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
In any sense of

793
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,880
This worker I have saved together and bought a new Volvo

794
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,160
As

795
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,488
Those who are the true event

796
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
The mistake

797
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,376
Goes under something

798
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,960
Digs on depth and develop an underlying meaning

799
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
The reconciliation's hermeneutics

800
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:16,128
May not move on the surface because the person then the music to type in some way on the song

801
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,176
Hamlet wants to live in

802
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,832
The experience of having saved together and bought a new car the experience of being proud of their new car experiences of

803
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,136
Feel joy for his new car, etc.

804
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,672
Chinese

805
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,952
The Hermeneutics of the suspicion

806
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,072
Science philosophy

807
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
So

808
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,936
Will this come to a sort of

809
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
Burning question

810
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,080
Which city where two is true

811
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
Namely

812
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Is

813
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,272
The prominent

814
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Manifest

815
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Things

816
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Valid in itself

817
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Or

818
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
Does things really mean other things

819
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
And

820
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,072
This leads to

821
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,144
A discussion that I cannot

822
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,752
Summarize in a minute but as you can read more about in

823
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
I texts

824
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
If

825
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,824
Relativism

826
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
Namely

827
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
Is all the knowledge

828
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
Always dependent on

829
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
A position

830
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:29,088
Or a situation is all knowledge situated

831
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
And pull it

832
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,440
The idea to its forefront

833
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,096
So this one comes here but after over there and a half minutes over there saying different things

834
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,912
Both are equally right or equally wrong

835
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
Or

836
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,008
Is there a position

837
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
From

838
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,336
Which

839
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
An interpretation is

840
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,991
More Sun more right more valid than another day

841
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,807
That is the opposite of

842
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
Relativism

843
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
I have to stop here

844
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,183
And

845
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:10,047
I hope to wish you all the happiness and hope it is as I have said

846
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
In any sense

847
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:15,935
Can help you then work with more concrete methods for thanks

848
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,471
Thank you so much for me
