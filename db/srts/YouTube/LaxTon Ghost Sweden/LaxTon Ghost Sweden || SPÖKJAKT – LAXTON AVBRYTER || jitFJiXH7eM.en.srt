1
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,240
I do not know how many houses there are in Norrland, which many do not know that it haunts.

2
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:38,240
The house in Yrttivaara was definitely such a house we did not know, but which we soon became aware that paranormal things happen in.

3
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:46,640
The house was built during the Second World War and part of the house was then a store, where they sold nails.

4
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,718
At that time, you had to buy a whole railway carriage with nails, which you also did.

5
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,605
The deal was closed down and demolished, but remaining the old wooden stairs and the concrete slab, where the store once stood.

6
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:11,111
The house changed owners and renovations began.
 That's when everything started.

7
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,512
Inside one of the bedrooms you began to hear banks from the wall where the store once stood.

8
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:28,994
You also heard how someone goes with clogs up for the old wooden stairs.
 Although no one is there.

9
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:47,573
The basement door which is immediately when you come in to the left, opens and closes inexplicably.

10
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:54,580
And on the second floor, today's owners feel that a woman with curly hair stands and stare at them.

11
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:03,220
Who that woman is you do not know, but a huge discomfort radiates into the room when she is present.

12
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:19,835
We did not know what we were about to meet during this investigation.
 And maybe it was good, because the house in Yrttivaara will do something with us at LAXTON that we have never experienced before.

13
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:41,481
Then we will just go here in Yrttivaara, in an old business.
 But the deal is no longer left.
 We have been with the bags.

14
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,175
I was putting on the vest, yes we are a little taken here.

15
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:44,945
Yes.

16
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:48,619
I think we've caught it on surveillance.

17
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:49,778
There are two things.

18
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:58,393
I go to the toilet which is just inside the left.
 And you Niclas should go around and start the audio recording on all surveillance cameras.

19
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:01,469
Yes, so we get sound for surveillance.

20
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:08,817
And when I'm in there I hear how you go Niclas and I think it is he who hits the handle on the toilet door.

21
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:11,341
I just said "yes" or something like that.

22
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:16,788
And then I go out and asked if you turned on the handle.
 And you say "No, I haven't touched the handle"

23
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:22,119
So hopefully the monitoring has taken that angle.

24
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:10,785
And not only that, me and Johan go out here, we are right where we are right now.
 We go in and we go to the kitchen, then I hear how the basement door just "Bang!"

25
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,626
Damn!

26
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,296
The door closed!

27
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:24,458
Open that door completely.

28
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,071
Monitoring takes it.

29
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:38,819
What I think is interesting is what she tells.
 Just with this door, but I don't think she said anything about the toilet door.

30
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:47,274
We also have knocks in the wall, we also have things that are visible, ie shadow figures.
 A woman is visible in here, we have lots of things.

31
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:54,000
And we just have time to step in, we will prepare to start this investigation.
 And then it starts.

32
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,876
It is really cool, we will see where this is going.
 A nice house, but it may be slightly darker in here, I have no idea.

33
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:09,486
And they are renovating and this tends to tear up energies, I think it can be even stronger.

34
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:18,000
And the owner said earlier today that she feels this pier in the scalp and body and so it usually is when it happens amazing things.

35
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,221
Shall we go in?
 It's a little chilly out now.

36
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:27,995
Then we are inside the hall here.

37
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:37,423
There we are the door, it is completely still now.
 This one was closed and when you asked if it could open more it did.
 And it has happened to her.

38
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:42,000
This is how it sounded about if I should reconstruct what happened.

39
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,992
Like it went again.

40
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:46,104
And that it then ...

41
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:49,751
went up.
 Type like that.
 When we prayed it open.

42
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:55,618
Just.
 And what also happened, for her, because I have her as a reference, because this will be a hot spot.

43
00:07:55,618 --> 00:08:02,878
She is upstairs and she hears a bang from here.
 She said she always locks this door, we have chosen to have it open of course.

44
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:06,253
And behind here is the toilet.

45
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:10,111
Here I was, I close the door and then I hear this ..

46
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,927
Like someone turns pretty hard on the handle.

47
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:20,240
I also walk by here and I hear it, but I think Tony is watching so the door is locked.

48
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,774
But it's not me.

49
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:30,259
No, I thought 100% that it was you who wanted to say that now you have to come out.
 Very strange.

50
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,671
Hopefully we have a good angle on this since then.

51
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:37,902
In the kitchen we have all the technology.
 Should we go in and start walking around a little neighbor?
 Detect.

52
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:44,172
I think we should start there.
 I even shudder there, it's interesting.

53
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:51,345
I pull a PSR there directly, with static and strap.

54
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:56,798
I put it so it even touches the door.

55
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:01,035
Do you have Polterscript on you?

56
00:09:01,035 --> 00:09:01,834
Yes.

57
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:06,684
Should we have it running and see if we can get any direct communication?

58
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:13,614
We have Lennie sitting on the bus, he has the time codes, he has saved everything.
 So we'll go back and watch this later.

59
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,678
Then you will see it, if we got it.

60
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:27,600
We have now put a PRS down there.
 It is our paranormal rem static.
 We have the strap function, just like a remepod, even static.

61
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,034
I start Polterscript, see if we can get anything about what happened here exactly.

62
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:41,344
As if we have someone with us here who just did them things, jerked the handle or closed the door.

63
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,162
Can you do any of them things again?

64
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:50,224
Close this door or hit the toilet handle.

65
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:55,135
I shudder when I stand here.
 Strange.

66
00:09:55,135 --> 00:10:01,422
I think this is current to the machine.
 So there we have nothing.

67
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:06,000
I got the feeling when I came in here, that I was not welcome to be there.
 Like "out of here!"

68
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,339
Yes, it's a bit like that.

69
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:12,367
*Footsteps*

70
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:15,411
Was that a step up from?

71
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:25,619
You, I forgot to say one thing.
 When I was standing here before and just going out, I thought I heard like a growl.

72
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:37,357
It is also interesting, they have plans for this house.
 They are renovating and that is when it has started.

73
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:41,585
Do you know what they have for plan with this house?

74
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:49,707
I haven't been rugged here before.
 I have been in here and fixed stuff.

75
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,000
The forest.

76
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,332
I also asked if this ditch they have dug out.
 I wondered when they did that.

77
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:01,869
There is memory out there.

78
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:12,996
So what they have dug is next to a cat that they have buried.
 One of the people who have lived here said we have to move on the cat and someone said "No, we shit in the cat"

79
00:11:12,996 --> 00:11:21,488
And I also think, you pull a deep sheep out in the woods, when you have to dig down a cable.
 It is open now.

80
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:25,379
You think so.
 There was a lot that came here right away.

81
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,018
I'll check if you have electromagnetic fields at you.

82
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:38,448
As you can see, it's zero.
 At Tony here.

83
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,979
Try walking towards the doors.

84
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:52,996
Did you hear?
 Someone hit this one.
 Where did it come from?

85
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:59,647
When I got two on Polterscript, I saw two on it.

86
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:02,508
This is how it sounded.

87
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,353
We have 0.2.
 0.1.

88
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:12,883
That sound must have come along, it was like someone was snapping on the meter.

89
00:12:13,743 --> 00:12:18,196
If you have touched this door, do it again, you are kind.

90
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:30,759
Here is 01, 02. 03. This is the base we had throughout the day when we went here and looked.

91
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,222
I also thought when you said if it is electricity and you feel something ..

92
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:42,184
I shudder and it comes from something.

93
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:43,600
I've never been to that.

94
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,344
No, it was like something struck.

95
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:52,045
Can you try to go up?
 Do we have EMF further up?

96
00:12:52,045 --> 00:13:01,400
02. But it has not been during the day when I have been watching.
 They have electricity here that we can use, but there is nothing that is leaking, what I have found.

97
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,854
It may remain there.

98
00:13:02,854 --> 00:13:05,924
Should we take a lap and feel a little neighbor?

99
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:14,507
I have a new instrument here.
 A pyramid, you don't really have the name for it yet, it's a prototype still.

100
00:13:14,507 --> 00:13:21,564
I want to say it's paranormal pyramid of truth.
 It's like yes and no on it.

101
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:27,216
We put this one, something on one side so it shines green, something comes on the other so it shines red.

102
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:33,680
Then we can also ask questions and communicate.
 Should we put it on the table so do we stand a bit away?

103
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:38,760
Now it takes red for my hand.
 I put it a bit away from us.

104
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,580
Now it will start pulse with a blue light.

105
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:43,470
That's how.

106
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:48,406
Now the shivers comes in here.
 Good!

107
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:51,203
You who are here now ..

108
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,401
You who are here, Nancy came up.

109
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:01,432
Can you touch this pyramid?
 Make it shine green.

110
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:11,269
It is a damn discomfort to stand here against this.
 I almost look at the basement here.

111
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:18,549
Come to this now that blinks blue.

112
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:28,167
I think about this cat.

113
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:38,486
If there are several men here now ..

114
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,472
In this house ...

115
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:52,282
You who move here, is it the woman who has been seen here?

116
00:14:52,282 --> 00:15:01,304
After all, it is a woman on the above floor that the owners have seen.
 With a little shorter curly hair, she only stands at a doorway there.

117
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:03,747
We don't know the name of her.

118
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:13,534
And we will go through the entire building, but hot spots are the strongest places.

119
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:18,002
Should we bring it and go through the rooms down here?

120
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:38,279
This is a room that every bedroom before.
 The previous owners have told them that they have heard knocks.
 And the old deal, Everts old business as it is called

121
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:48,000
It is behind the wall here.
 Here they have heard knocks from the wall.
 It is also an old staircase that goes here, where they have heard someone walking up with clogs.

122
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,315
Exactly, it has been heard at night.

123
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:54,544
Can you knock back on this wall?

124
00:16:06,152 --> 00:16:10,776
Evert, are you left here?
 Tap here.

125
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:19,619
Or if someone else is left here so knock in the walls.

126
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:26,998
Can you make a loud sound so we know where to go?

127
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:39,082
Can you run upstairs if you are there?

128
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:50,424
I think it is interesting, because it is a fairly small house, but then the chances of something could happen.

129
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:57,290
We compress without quite well, it is not a castle.
 So is someone running here or knocks in the wall, we hear it immediately.

130
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,463
Yes definitely.

131
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:00,314
So that's good.

132
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:12,433
It would be damn interesting to get back the knocks.

133
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,213
But as I said...

134
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:23,436
There is no discomfort here but there is more discomfort in the hall.
 Do not you think so?

135
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:24,672
Yes, definitely.

136
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:32,978
I'm drawn up a bit, should we try to go there?

137
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:45,390
Should we try close the door?
 If I close the door completely we will see if we get a move here.

138
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:49,654
We put this against it.

139
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,497
Boys.

140
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,560
Yes?

141
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,000
Very strange white fog down in the basement by the stairs.

142
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,849
White fog in the basement?
 We go down there now, now there is a white fog in the basement.
 We were going to go up, but we go there instead.

143
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:34,667
Now we go into that surface, the deal is not left above, but the concrete foundation remains.
 And the old stairs are left.

144
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,864
Now the question is where the fog is.

145
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,370
The camera is further in.

146
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,858
Lennie does Lennie hear us now?

147
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:50,972
Yes.

148
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:52,158
Where is the fog?

149
00:18:52,158 --> 00:19:00,815
The fog came where you stand now, then it passed the stairs two, three steps down, thick.

150
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:03,956
Okay, I get 37 years here too.

151
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,520
Ugh what shivers it was here.

152
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:14,377
Are you down here all?

153
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:22,605
You see that it is moisture damage, it drops in.

154
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:29,198
But as I said, it is this staircase that belongs to the old store here.

155
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:35,528
And this is where they have heard someone run up in clogs.

156
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,432
*Bang in the room*

157
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,602
It was a bang in the corner here.

158
00:19:44,678 --> 00:19:47,152
Who do we have here?

159
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:57,457
I try the mood.

160
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,009
Okay, this fog that is here ...

161
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:27,216
Where!
 Exactly where Lennie said it was before.

162
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,326
Who are you?

163
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:34,534
Is it you Evert?

164
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:40,994
Where.
 Should I interpret it as a yes?

165
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:50,864
I look here in the corner.

166
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:54,464
*Bang in the room next to*

167
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:55,377
What was that?

168
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:57,093
Was this behind?

169
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,346
In here we have no surveillance camera.

170
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,742
No.

171
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,101
Is it on red?
 Or orange?

172
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:14,346
Orange.

173
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,106
Okay, can you back are you kind?

174
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,769
Who are you?
 Is it you Evert?

175
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,036
You talked about an army with people here.

176
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:31,618
Are you many who are here?

177
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:40,669
I'm starting ... I'll test a thing just ..

178
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:50,068
I turn off strap.
 Now we see MG, this plug cabinet does not work.

179
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:51,068
Nothing at all?

180
00:21:51,068 --> 00:21:54,809
Zero.
 03 here now.
 08.

181
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:57,717
1.1.
 There was nothing at all here.

182
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:58,511
Huh?

183
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:03,056
And now it comes.
 But it's pretty low.

184
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:05,786
Check this out.

185
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:12,739
1.1.

186
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:16,646
2.8.
 3.0.

187
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:28,743
Here it goes down.

188
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:37,709
So I need to be damn close.
 You see, now I'm 30 cm from the cabinet.

189
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,317
Then it's 0.

190
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:50,558
And here was what we got.
 I'll start it again.

191
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:56,151
Can you touch that antenna now?
 Right in front of Niclas.

192
00:22:56,151 --> 00:23:03,349
If we have with this army with men you describe who are here.

193
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:09,396
Wondering what it was?
 It was like something was pushed away.
 After all, we got a rash immediately when we came in here.

194
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:12,035
We go back here to the fog then.

195
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,422
3.9 degrees.
 And zero ...

196
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:25,870
Here is something ... zero in EMF ..

197
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:32,840
Away.

198
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,498
Come back to me here.
 And grab it properly in this iron stick.

199
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:42,694
Do you want us out of here?

200
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:47,196
Do you want us to stay here?

201
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,178
It's up here.
 But it is still zero in EMF.

202
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:08,196
It's pretty cool, it's in the doorway.
 And the degrees go up.
 To 7.2, we had 4 recently.

203
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,119
It gets warmer there.

204
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:14,701
Now I go out.

205
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,559
It's strong here.

206
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:22,258
Huh?

207
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:25,724
What was that?
 Was it you who did that?

208
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:26,719
What did you do?

209
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,464
I got a shock in my finger.

210
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:30,000
A shock?!

211
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,756
So disgusting.
 Like I took in ..

212
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:34,625
In metal type?

213
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,429
Cables that were loose.

214
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,035
*First words from Polterscript when we enter the basement*

215
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,231
How disgusting that was.
 At first I thought I was bitten by something, but there is nothing here.

216
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:57,306
That was like a shock in your finger.
 Like I take in two cables that have low power, I felt it was tingling.

217
00:24:57,306 --> 00:25:07,624
Irritated?
 You, the owner said it started to tingle in the body.
 It was interesting that you feel it.

218
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:09,476
And now 4 degrees again.

219
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,785
4.5.
 It went up to 7 degrees and this one went.

220
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,074
Warmer.

221
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,991
Nothing.

222
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:30,676
Lennie.
 do you hear us?

223
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:31,641
Yes.

224
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:35,163
Is the fog gone or is it left?

225
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:37,409
The fog is gone.

226
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:52,199
We do this, we document this Lennie, we continue to document it.
 If there is something else that is starting to manifest, then we go back here.
 If the fog all the time, we know if it is an army of energies moving here.

227
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,425
We drive on it.
 We go back to the house again.

228
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:56,303
*High bang in the room next to us*

229
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,690
What the hell was that?

230
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:02,359
It's like it slams in here.

231
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:06,000
That sounded like something was moved.

232
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,221
Is anyone down here and playing with us?

233
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:11,521
I'll start this again.

234
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:15,053
It was like you turned on something.

235
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:21,586
It seems you like to turn on things.
 You turn on the meters, you turn on handles.

236
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:25,768
If you want us to stay here with you, then touch this iron stick.

237
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:35,590
Yes, take in this black box I have here.

238
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:41,735
I'm starting to think about some other things now, it talked about forest before Niclas.
 Now a box, it may be something else it wants to convey.

239
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:47,118
Now it is snow outside so we can't go out and dig, but it's something they want to be able to convey.

240
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:59,143
I turned off this, that was what sounded.
 But I also think like this, if they have stirred up the ground, they have renovated here, they might pull in something else.

241
00:26:59,143 --> 00:27:07,820
I am starting to feel the outside.
 I will test stand here in the door where we had high value.

242
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,996
I have so we can measure even more.

243
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:19,688
When it said Orb it went up to 276!

244
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,249
MAN.

245
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,748
Was it this box they talked about maybe?

246
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,544
Shit what it started talking.

247
00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:40,250
Do you think it's fun with that one?

248
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:46,316
01, 02. It went up to 276 ... when the first word came.

249
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:48,170
Orb.

250
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:55,534
Throughout the house it has been 01, 02 all the time.
 05 as max.

251
00:27:55,534 --> 00:27:56,993
But this was .. What did you say?

252
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:59,036
null

253
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:05,821
And just with the word orb.
 We'll see if we catch something on the camera, or in the surveillance camera when we entered here.

254
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:07,555
Should we go back to the house?

255
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:12,809
We do it.
 So we let these shadows are manifested because we catch it on film.

256
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,218
This is also absolutely incredible, it is five inches of fresh snow suddenly from nowhere.
 We had sun and nice weather before.

257
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:31,888
I think we close the door, we put a PRS in front, so we see if we get a move on it, because this is said to be opened by itself.

258
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:35,424
And we got some of it on the surveillance earlier, you hope.

259
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:40,959
So put PRS in front.
 I pick up Ovilus and test it too.

260
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:49,332
I want to place some instruments.
 If there are any younger energies moving on this floor, for things that are not where they should be.

261
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:56,508
I put this on the table.
 And this is a Remdeddy.

262
00:28:56,508 --> 00:28:58,855
So if something comes close to it ...

263
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,712
So if you do not think it should sit there, then you may want to push it down.
 We saw you in the basement, or we saw you in the basement.

264
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:10,001
How many are you up here?

265
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:16,891
When the shivers comes, they disappear, then they come and disappear.

266
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:17,932
Do you know what I do with this one?

267
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:18,571
No?

268
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:23,343
This is our movement sensor that we have now, also a demo that we are testing.

269
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:27,056
I can set this alarm.
 Should I put it inside the office over there?

270
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,136
Where they have heard the knocks?

271
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:33,217
Just.
 If we come down and this one flashes then ...

272
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,414
I put it like this, so it's exactly against the wall.

273
00:29:41,605 --> 00:29:43,894
And then I start it.

274
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:54,682
So if we have someone behind the wall, who wants to knock or knock in the wall then do it now then we will see it then when we come down.

275
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:56,883
We leave it there.

276
00:30:01,347 --> 00:30:04,507
Or get up from the basement if you like.

277
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:09,000
Push that away.
 Open the toilet door too.

278
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:16,066
Touch the teddy bear unless it is there.

279
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:23,699
And everything we are putting out now is in front of surveillance cameras, so hopefully we catch it if something happens.

280
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:27,360
We go up to the second floor.
 This is where you have seen this woman stand.

281
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:34,002
*When we go upstairs this happens with the door to the basement downstairs*

282
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:45,174
We can also say that there is a room that they are carpentry in, here they have had no experiences.

283
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:47,157
*Bang in the room*

284
00:30:47,157 --> 00:30:47,893
What was that?

285
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:52,268
I heard it immediately when we came in here, like something was thrown.

286
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:56,371
Interesting, because here they said they had nothing.

287
00:30:56,735 --> 00:31:00,373
I don't know if it was thrown on the window or whatever it was.

288
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:03,639
Can you make that sound again?

289
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,644
*Bang in the room*

290
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:11,835
It's here.

291
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,908
We test like this ..

292
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:18,625
Is it wooden floors or plastic floors that we stand on here?

293
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:24,000
It slams at our feet, but it slams here.

294
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:30,155
I put one thing here on the floor to you.
 So it must be here.

295
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:42,719
Now stir at that iron stick.
 If you walk around here, can you kick it off?

296
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,635
We put it at the doorway, then we should get it on the camera if something comes there.

297
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:54,041
Now the camera is right here.

298
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:58,211
Put it at the entrance right where you get up.

299
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:07,725
This is the doorway at the kitchen, this is where you have seen this lady stand.

300
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,824
Right here.

301
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,998
Should we try a PMB?
 Align it straight up.

302
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:23,011
Lisa, I got a name here again.

303
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:28,259
The woman who has been seen here ...

304
00:32:28,557 --> 00:32:31,667
Can you come in to us here?

305
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:45,626
There are more people who have experienced phenomena here.
 That you hear knocks, you have seen you.

306
00:32:45,626 --> 00:32:52,536
There are things you could have pulled out or open here in the kitchen, these boxes.
 If you are up here with us.

307
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:55,283
Then can stand here and fix in the kitchen.

308
00:32:55,283 --> 00:33:02,564
They talk about men down in the basement here.
 Can any of you come up here?

309
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:08,348
We are testing a Ghost box and we will see, if it comes through something up here.

310
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,815
Do you hear this noise?
 Get near me here.

311
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:30,000
If that woman is in this room right now, can you come out to us?

312
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,085
Who gave me a shock in my finger?
 Down in the basement.

313
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:49,243
Who was the one who hit the handle down by the toilet?

314
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:55,500
Who opened the cellar door?

315
00:33:57,484 --> 00:34:00,833
I move a little here too.

316
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,106
*Tony hears steps behind him*

317
00:34:13,421 --> 00:34:16,204
It sounded like someone was going here, did you hear it?

318
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:22,047
I remove PMB here.

319
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:35,027
It was just like someone went here.
 I felt it in the floor, because I stood a little obliquely behind.
 It was like someone was walking, because it swayed in the floor behind here.

320
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:39,240
And it was like a bang, I have a hard time saying where it came from.

321
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:45,874
That woman, or whoever went here, can you come in and talk to us here?

322
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:58,053
Shit, it spun when I went in here.
 Like it's leaning.

323
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,519
The woman who has been seen here ..

324
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,992
Who are you?

325
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:09,710
I try the other corner too.

326
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,775
"You are disgusting"

327
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:16,103
Did it say what disgusting you are?

328
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:21,095
It sounded like it.
 It is the first thing I get through and it is a man who says it.

329
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:25,045
Who are you?

330
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:34,064
He didn't sound nice.
 The one who came through was really ... "How disgusting you are"

331
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:37,049
I shudder all over my body.

332
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:41,181
That's the only word we had.

333
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:45,907
It was a whole meaning and I think it was very clear.
 Right?

334
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:48,593
I'll check.

335
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:50,377
What did you say?

336
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:53,191
I'll check, it stings there.

337
00:35:54,183 --> 00:35:56,039
On hand.

338
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,750
I put in the Owlus and see if I get something more.

339
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,317
"Beware"

340
00:35:59,317 --> 00:36:00,646
Beware!

341
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:04,871
It was a woman, in Finnish, who said beware.

342
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:15,139
I shudder when I go into the corner here, what sick.

343
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:23,352
Can you tap or slap into the walls if you are Robert?

344
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:25,756
I'm standing here in the corner.

345
00:36:28,832 --> 00:36:31,478
If so, you may have to push me off.

346
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,793
*Something moved in the building*

347
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:40,177
It was something that fell or thrown out there.

348
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:54,493
I'm standing here.
 Can you push me away, or pass in front of me, like a shadow.

349
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:59,104
Can you do something that makes me want to go away from here?

350
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,319
*Steps heard in the building*

351
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,118
It's steps!

352
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:15,754
It was steps.
 But it came .. There is nothing up there.

353
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:17,400
I just shudder.

354
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,877
Tap the wall again if it was you.
 The knocks were great.
 Do it again.

355
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:35,534
If the lady is here, come in here to us.

356
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,885
What a stinging feeling in my head I got.

357
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:17,628
I can stand out there, I'm in front of a camera if I'm out there.
 Do you stand Johan?
 If you stand there.

358
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,515
Now we are divided, Niclas is behind here.

359
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:31,304
Make that sound again.

360
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:48,000
Join us on some tearmark now that Niclas.

361
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,847
Do something that makes sure we go out of here, that we think it is so uncomfortable.

362
00:38:56,376 --> 00:39:01,085
Bat in the walls here.

363
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:13,120
Not the lamp Johan, stay there.
 Tony, come.

364
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,696
We have a surveillance camera on this, come, come, come.

365
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:23,589
Check the floor.
 Isn't the black there something else?
 Does it look like something is on the floor?

366
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:24,599
At the stairs?

367
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,328
At the stairs, right in front.

368
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:28,255
Very black.

369
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:31,440
If we pull a lamp there, it will disappear.

370
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,579
Should we just go there?

371
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:38,265
It's like something is there.
 It is darker than the darkness.

372
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:42,279
It's so damn dark.
 Just like something that has come up.

373
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,752
Slowly came Johan.

374
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:46,829
Damn what dark it is.

375
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:53,398
Now it starts to disappear ...

376
00:39:58,755 --> 00:40:02,073
That was damn crazy.

377
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,108
The carpet is here, but what was located was here.

378
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:20,622
Imagine someone lying down on the floor.

379
00:40:20,622 --> 00:40:25,022
And I saw the contours .. I just shudder when I stand here.

380
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:29,094
Was it you we saw here?
 Has it happened to you something here?

381
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,620
It burns on my knees.
 It's really strange.

382
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:36,061
As tear marks or burns?

383
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:42,000
It burns, we must see if there are tear marks.
 It usually starts with it getting hot, but what was it I saw there?

384
00:40:42,827 --> 00:40:45,434
Imagine a man lying here.

385
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:55,533
It is just manifested from nowhere, suddenly it was just there.

386
00:40:57,385 --> 00:41:06,000
Like this, do you see this brand here?
 Imagine something like that though you see ... Yes, it was really strange ..

387
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,274
Something manifested that lay there.

388
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:20,001
Shall we go in there?
 Should I put a PMB targeted here?
 So we see.
 Johan if you go in there.

389
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:27,719
It calibrates.

390
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:40,012
Anyone who may be in the hall at the stairs, came in, pass the kitchen and came here to Niclas in the corner.

391
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:50,935
This one works like a spirit box.
 Although it is digital only.

392
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:55,341
And the sound is on this page, that's why I have it up and down.

393
00:41:58,615 --> 00:41:59,115
Did it say that?

394
00:41:59,115 --> 00:42:02,858
I thought it said Niclas.
 I thought it said your name.

395
00:42:02,858 --> 00:42:05,584
Did you say my name recently?

396
00:42:16,497 --> 00:42:19,663
Is the former owner here?

397
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:25,286
He who had the deal.
 Are you still in this building?

398
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:39,395
What do you think about these renovations that happen here?

399
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:44,230
Will it be your way, the way you want it?

400
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:45,662
It was me who put my hand ....

401
00:42:45,662 --> 00:42:46,829
"Worse"

402
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,854
I shudder in here.

403
00:42:56,748 --> 00:43:00,000
If you don't like it, can you make a loud bang here?

404
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,849
Try turning it off again.

405
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:10,335
Sick, I thought it said Niclas ...

406
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:15,646
I thought it flashed, but we'll see, the surveillance is there.

407
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:17,194
*Surveillance did not catch a blink in the room*

408
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:23,609
But as I said the one you got through did not feel very nice.
 He who said how disgusting you are.

409
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:25,597
But I think, did he talk to me?

410
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:26,339
I do not know.

411
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:33,720
Or did he talk to the woman?
 Was it that woman we saw?
 Has something happened to her?
 Was that where she collapsed?

412
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,674
But them the steps ...

413
00:43:35,674 --> 00:43:39,028
They were so clear, where they came from.

414
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:41,780
What the hell was that?

415
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:49,565
It was as if someone was looking .. on the floor, like something looked here.
 Here.

416
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:51,991
Or what was it I saw?

417
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:56,215
Type that something made me see something like ...

418
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:57,501
*Nothing was caught on the surveillance*

419
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,291
Or if there was any child or something that looked forward.

420
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:07,074
I go and sit down here.
 I bring Johan.
 And if you try to go down and sit down, you can choose.

421
00:44:07,074 --> 00:44:21,312
I sit down in the bedroom where they have heard these banks.
 So I listen and see if I hear the banks.
 Then you up here.
 So we see if we hear something between us.

422
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:23,719
I go down myself then.

423
00:44:26,828 --> 00:44:33,206
Now I sit here myself.
 It is me and Johan, but Tony is himself.

424
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:34,557
"We go"

425
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:36,326
We go.

426
00:44:38,156 --> 00:44:45,310
Now I'm down here, Niclas is just above.
 I sit in bed.

427
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,537
Go down to Tony.
 All.

428
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:54,289
Touch the wall, hit there.

429
00:44:57,233 --> 00:44:59,677
Sound from there.

430
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:09,181
Sound from here.

431
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:15,468
Don't you want me in this room?
 Is that why you go from here?

432
00:45:15,468 --> 00:45:16,069
"Beware"

433
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:17,570
Beware ..

434
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:27,502
It's like I see someone standing there, in the contours.

435
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:29,159
Go toward me ...

436
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,381
It looks like someone less, like a woman ..

437
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,966
Shorter.

438
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:48,000
It stands in the hall, but it is not visible in that camera, it is exactly at the door edge.

439
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:54,275
And tell me, who was it I saw as lying on the floor?

440
00:45:55,691 --> 00:45:57,107
"Me"

441
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,955
I see you there.

442
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:03,471
Come here.

443
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,031
It's cold around here.

444
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:11,210
Shit, around the face ...

445
00:46:12,797 --> 00:46:17,593
I sit down again then, so you have to make that sound.
 Come walking in the corridor here.

446
00:46:27,547 --> 00:46:30,881
Again.
 I hear someone walking here.

447
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:42,000
Has something happened up here?

448
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:44,778
That made a person die ...

449
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:53,239
"Woman"

450
00:46:57,505 --> 00:47:00,965
I ask the question again, that woman ...

451
00:47:00,965 --> 00:47:05,160
Who has been seen here, have you died in this building?

452
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,352
"Silent"

453
00:47:06,749 --> 00:47:08,322
Silent.

454
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:09,221
MAN.

455
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,660
Yes.

456
00:47:15,323 --> 00:47:17,727
We do this Johan, I shut it down.

457
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:22,706
We leave and go down to Tony.
 I put a motion detector right here.

458
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:28,793
You know how it sounds, it's a Hello Welcome.
 And we hear this downstairs ...

459
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:32,876
Then we know we had movement here.

460
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:43,208
I hear so much steps, it's like someone goes down here.

461
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:54,150
And here, exactly here, when I stand in the room at the bottom with them there the knocks, like there is a girl here, just standing there.

462
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:59,503
I see the silhouette of her, because I see the window behind.
 She just stands and looks.

463
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:04,002
And then I hear steps, like someone's going.

464
00:48:04,002 --> 00:48:05,355
At the ground floor.

465
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:15,983
We put a motion detector up there now, where she has been seen.
 So it sounds like it is in that passage.

466
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:20,668
I think we remove that, we put a PMB against this door.

467
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:27,955
So if you're there ...

468
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:29,714
in the basement....

469
00:48:32,194 --> 00:48:34,175
that army of ...

470
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:38,693
energies, so get up here.
 Now this one is calibrating.

471
00:48:40,677 --> 00:48:43,412
So if something then goes by here ...

472
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:46,240
So we will know it when it starts playing.

473
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,609
We make us go up there.
 And we bring a car that goes static.

474
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:57,311
We place it a bit away.
 After all, we had static up there that woman lay.
 I think we place it there.

475
00:48:57,311 --> 00:49:07,197
So we'll see if it starts to go.
 If it reacts to static.
 I leave that chair, stuck to it a bit, we still have PMB and the other instruments.

476
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:18,000
Plus I will take the pyramid and put it .. The Pyramid of Truth, that it will be green or red in bed as well.

477
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,286
Because it is completely different up there and we hear the steps too.

478
00:49:21,286 --> 00:49:22,587
We test.

479
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:31,231
So if a static field shows up, this car will go away.

480
00:49:33,248 --> 00:49:37,830
I put this fast here then we go out and see if the car comes.

481
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,442
We go out here again then.

482
00:49:42,988 --> 00:49:45,652
I put it farthest, at the far end here.

483
00:49:51,836 --> 00:49:56,582
The figure we saw low on the floor, can you walk near this car?

484
00:49:56,582 --> 00:50:00,224
Can you put your hand on it so maybe it goes here to us?

485
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:03,026
And you who have been seen ... directly!

486
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:12,487
It stuck right away.

487
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:15,457
Can you put your hand on it and then ... That was right!

488
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:21,994
Try again, this is absolutely incredible.
 And as I said this goes on static fields that have appeared earlier.

489
00:50:21,994 --> 00:50:30,000
And immediately when I say put your hand on this one.
 Because we saw something lying on the floor, it looked like a woman lying on the floor.

490
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,874
And it sounded like she said suicide.

491
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:37,618
Green!
 Suicide....

492
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:40,641
Thanks!

493
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:47,060
Was it you who put your hand on the car now?

494
00:50:50,995 --> 00:50:54,774
It was interesting that it answered right over there, .. green again!

495
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:56,229
Is it?

496
00:50:56,229 --> 00:50:59,763
That I find it interesting that it answers ...

497
00:50:59,763 --> 00:51:03,323
So now Tony has put back the static car.

498
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:05,588
Are you here?

499
00:51:05,588 --> 00:51:08,540
If you are still with us here ...

500
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,860
So put your hand on the car again.

501
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,871
So you can get it to go here.

502
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:22,532
Did you go out there in the hall?

503
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:25,159
Is it you we've seen?

504
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:27,642
So do the same thing again.

505
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:34,799
There, now!
 Now it's static here.

506
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:40,584
Good, go out to the car there.
 And do the same thing again, put your hand on it.

507
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:44,422
I pull up the volume.

508
00:51:50,044 --> 00:51:54,000
Good.
 Just come here.

509
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,147
"Yepp"

510
00:51:55,147 --> 00:51:56,190
A man.

511
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:01,394
The man who is here, do you see the car out in the hall?
 Can you go and kick it?

512
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:16,767
Do you see this pyramid in bed that lies there?
 Can you put your hand at it?

513
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:25,857
Run past us here and out to this black bus.

514
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:26,716
"Away"

515
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:30,691
Just when you talked, it was a man who said away.

516
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:34,860
The car!

517
00:52:42,665 --> 00:52:44,084
"Running"

518
00:52:46,928 --> 00:52:48,898
*Tony is starting to feel weird*

519
00:52:48,898 --> 00:52:51,397
I feel damn bad up here.

520
00:52:51,397 --> 00:52:52,907
Are you feeling bad?

521
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:57,366
I feel throughout my body.
 I almost feel spiteful.

522
00:52:59,185 --> 00:53:05,735
I don't know if I feel something here.
 It just came and I feel dizzy too.

523
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,755
Is it any of the energies in the house that affects Tony now?

524
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:16,024
Beat the wall in case it is.

525
00:53:16,024 --> 00:53:17,592
Green!

526
00:53:20,237 --> 00:53:23,319
I think I have to go out ... It feels like I'm about to vomit ..

527
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,415
Men's voice saying "hmm"

528
00:53:31,243 --> 00:53:35,126
It doesn't shine at all!
 Did them turn it off?

529
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:41,368
I'll probably go out a turn, damn what I'm feeling bad.

530
00:53:55,455 --> 00:54:02,682
Being so influenced by a house that you finally cannot be able to remain, has never happened to us before.

531
00:54:02,682 --> 00:54:10,070
This completely unknown house for us made us do something we have never done before on our investigations.

532
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:13,665
Namely to cancel.

533
00:54:15,192 --> 00:54:22,539
Tony was so strongly influenced by something inside the house that he goes out and sprouts immediately after the investigation.

534
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:28,022
Johan feels after Tony has left the house, that he too is starting to feel strange.

535
00:54:28,022 --> 00:54:31,640
Then the decision was made to cancel.

536
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:45,690
In retrospect, we have thought about what really happened.
 Why was Tony so strongly affected?
 Could it be because he asked the house to do something, on several occasions during the investigation.

537
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:59,041
When you look back at the investigation from Yrttivaara, we see that the further into the investigation we come, Tony gets worse and worse and must eventually hold on to the table in order to continue.

538
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:06,000
What stands out during this investigation is several things, except that Tony was affected.

539
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,560
The door to the basement opens.

540
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:17,078
The handle to the toilet is knocked down.

541
00:55:17,243 --> 00:55:19,677
Steps heard in the house.

542
00:55:21,215 --> 00:55:27,006
The fog in the basement that also affected the melmeter when we got there.

543
00:55:27,535 --> 00:55:37,796
What is also interesting is when we saw the dark shade lying on the floor.
 Which also affected the static bus, which leaves when Niclas asks it to put his hand on it.

544
00:55:38,623 --> 00:55:44,589
But the strongest memory will be that we had to leave the house.

545
00:55:46,824 --> 00:55:56,235
The house in Yrttivaara won over us this time, but it will be a next time, so we will make sure to be more prepared for the dark forces of the house.

546
00:55:56,235 --> 00:56:04,211
And at that time we will not cancel.
