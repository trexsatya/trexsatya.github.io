1
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:33,338
There is an old agricultural property outside Piteå, which is said to affect the family that lives there so much that they sometimes frustration screams straight out that it will end.

2
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:44,773
It is said that a man has hung himself in the barn, in one of the beams.
 Who this man is you try to find out.

3
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:50,604
Those who live here experience a huge discomfort when trying to stay in the barn.

4
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:56,203
And what is in there wants you to leave quickly.

5
00:02:56,203 --> 00:03:04,966
The family reports that you see figures inside and outside the houses, who look at them.
 And the feeling inside the dilapidated house is that it is a child.

6
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:08,992
A boy and a girl.

7
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,467
Outside the house, there is a man standing at the house knot and observes them.

8
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:33,196
The boy in the family who has his room on the ground floor closest to the kitchen talks to someone they can't see.

9
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:50,972
On this land previously stood an old Norrbotten farm, which unfortunately burned down.

10
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:11,498
And the flames brought a woman and her child who never got out.

11
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:22,112
Perhaps it is these unsavory spirits that still haunt the houses.

12
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:33,516
Then we have entered here in Piteå, to this agricultural property.
 Actually, there are three properties, it is this one since the a little more down and then we also have the barn.

13
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:36,508
So much to investigate.

14
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:44,189
It is specific stuff that happens, we should focus on them.
 We will look if we can make these phenomena happen, but we do not know that.

15
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:50,000
It can happen now, it can happen when.
 But we have had small things that have happened before we started here.

16
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,609
I think we have even captured a shadow, on surveillance.
 And it all made us jump to.

17
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,096
It was very interesting to see it.

18
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:01,347
In fact, we have not been documented before, not this way.

19
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:07,875
We have seen it before, at the safari investigation, but then it did not record it.
 But now we were on the recording that was lucky.

20
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:12,203
This sequence shows what it looks like when the camera goes to Nightvision as we usually see.

21
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,738
So it was very, very special.

22
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:39,816
Clearly.
 And I think like this, now it's pretty much to investigate, many rooms.
 Then there are specific phenomena they say hands here, so I think we should try to go on the hot spot we have.

23
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:41,395
Should we start in the kitchen?

24
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:53,784
I think we should start in the kitchen, but we should also focus on a special room.
 Where a little guy gets things to him, he talks to something before he goes to bed.

25
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:57,755
And he also gets information, which is not so positive.

26
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:58,335
No.

27
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:04,800
So we should go in and try to address this, but they also think there is a little girl who goes in, goes around ..

28
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:14,983
But we'll see.
 It may be something that tries to show up like a little girl.
 We check, I think we start with that room.

29
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:23,727
We bring some tools with us.
 I think if it is a younger energy, I think we put the remeddue there.
 See if it can push it down, you will run communication.

30
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:30,720
I think he gets a lot of messages that are not nice.
 If it wants to communicate with us, what is now here.

31
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,200
Exactly and it's just straight through this door.
 It must be awful as a parent to lie down and hear him talk about everything possible in there.

32
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:49,101
In the kitchen where we are now, we have a surveillance camera too, behind me.
 And here we have this box, above all, pulled out and these knives change position.

33
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:53,498
And ends up in another cabinet.
 It is absolutely incredible.

34
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:58,469
If we can catch it, it is absolutely wonderful.
 The Holy Graile of everything.

35
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,337
But as I said we have lots of instruments, all equipment is here so we can always go and get more.

36
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:13,538
It's not huge.
 We will pick up some instruments, we have to put on jackets, it is cold out there and cold put inside the other house.
 Plus in the barn.

37
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:21,885
But right now we are in the heat.
 We go in here, I wonder if we should have a tool going.
 If you start it there and immediately open the door, we will see what is said.

38
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:31,332
I also think the PDA, Paranormal Direct Answer.
 It works in case something comes to the right or to the left, so it glows red or green.

39
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:35,361
Just.
 We prepare the whole room and we will see what happens.

40
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,189
Shit what scared I was.

41
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,703
What then?

42
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:39,244
When I check straight to the right ...

43
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,314
Well, it looks like someone was standing there.

44
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:42,409
Yes, I thought someone was standing there.

45
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:45,527
As if you hung a shed over someone.

46
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:51,415
Like seeing one of the worst horror movies, you just see a blanket so it looks like a human being.

47
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:57,262
As I said here he lies and sleeps, he hears lots of stuff and he talks back to it.

48
00:07:57,262 --> 00:08:03,016
We start with PRS, both static and strap function.

49
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,203
I wouldn't have done that.

50
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,262
What does it say?

51
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,519
I wouldn't have stopped it there.

52
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,755
Okay.

53
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:19,816
I will put more things here that you can mess and push away.
 Do you recognize this teddy bear?

54
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:23,037
If you want to push it away, do it.

55
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,533
It's just patting it.

56
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,610
Include.

57
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:32,220
Are you included in this family?
 Is that what you know?

58
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:33,820
I have shivers behind ...

59
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,254
I was just going to say, I have shivers behind here ...

60
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:41,388
You are not included in this family.
 I do not know who you are..

61
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,673
You say no positive things.

62
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,735
I will stop another thing here as you can ..

63
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,561
put your hand against or go by.

64
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:55,191
So you will be able to answer with different colors to us.

65
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:57,375
Allows.

66
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,632
It's almost like it gives us ...

67
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:03,682
It is you who decides.

68
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:07,917
What shivers!
 It comes as in waves.

69
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,799
It comes from behind.

70
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:18,896
Do you usually talk to the boy who usually sleeps here?

71
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:24,807
If you do it, go to this blue vibrant light that is in front of us on the bed.

72
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:31,354
Is it the little girl who usually says things to him who is here?

73
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:37,231
I can say, we have surveillance now in most buildings, if something happens, Lennie will shout to us right away.

74
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:43,577
He sits on the bus watching the surveillance.
 If we get some name, he will look if he can relate the name to this farm.

75
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:48,213
So maybe we get a better understanding of what it is or who it is.

76
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:54,714
We must not forget, there was a Norrbotten farm that was about where the barn is and it burned down.

77
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:57,122
It is said that a woman and two children burned inside.

78
00:09:57,122 --> 00:10:03,328
Just.
 And that is what we are thinking about if this girl has entered this building, which is also affecting this boy.

79
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:08,980
We have to test everything here now.
 We don't have the faintest about what we are dealing with here.

80
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,743
It can also be something very negative that has come in here.
 These shivers that come, they are interesting.

81
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:17,040
It comes as in waves.

82
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,095
Love.

83
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:23,183
For now I do not feel it, it comes like shocking.

84
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,661
I'll try to go into the corner here I think.

85
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:29,080
It was I who affected it.

86
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,391
Now I would like you to come in here and show how strong you are.

87
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:35,773
Talk to us too.

88
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:40,523
Feel free to open a door in here or push something.

89
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:43,924
Can we get the name of the one here?

90
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,331
What are you?

91
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,429
Now a shudder came again.

92
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,573
Here is nothing now.

93
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:56,031
It felt here, right here.

94
00:10:58,227 --> 00:11:00,423
Can we have a name?

95
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:05,746
Are there initials?

96
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,520
It's hard to say in and of itself ...

97
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:18,242
We have other things happening here.
 We have a drapery down in the basement of the shower, where they hear this little girl laughing and turning on the drapery.

98
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:25,317
We will test that theory and be one on the inside of the drapery and so some are outside and then we will see if the little girl can come in there.

99
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:33,414
It will be a damn humming though down there, because it has a ... what is it called?
 Dehumidifier.

100
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:35,985
And we can't turn them off, they don't want it.

101
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,221
I'll try to get down on my knees here and see if we get something, if it is the little girl who is here.

102
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:45,414
My name is Tony, this is Niclas and Johan is the one who is filming here.

103
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:48,590
We just want to talk to you who are here.

104
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:55,199
We don't want anything bad, we want to know why you are left.
 If there is a girl who is here.

105
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:58,342
Have you died in this fire outside?

106
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:04,449
At the barn, this old farm.
 Together with your sibling and your mother.

107
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:07,660
I found a small teacup here.

108
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,261
I put this at the teddy bear and you can touch it if you want.

109
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:14,466
Are you under the bed?

110
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:24,165
What does it mean?

111
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:25,298
No clue.

112
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:27,548
Play first ...

113
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,843
Okay, do you want to play with us here?

114
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,476
If I put this down under, can you take me in my hand then?

115
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,672
You may touch me.

116
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:44,986
Wait, that was ....

117
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:45,715
Do you have any lamp here?

118
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:46,616
No I do not have it.

119
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,950
Either there is some hair or so ..

120
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,933
I got touch on my fingers.
 Shit ...

121
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:56,646
What is this?

122
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:59,416
Here I know something.

123
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,997
Wait I pick up an instrument.

124
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:13,934
I have a perfect instrument for that.
 Which can take static fields, if that's what Tony has received.
 We take the handheld paracope to it

125
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:18,952
Either it is a static field or it is some kind of cobwebs.

126
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,912
You may get around here Johan.

127
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:30,945
Are you below?
 Where!

128
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:34,181
Where!
 It is a static field.

129
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,840
Are you under the bed now?

130
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,996
I felt your hand or something.
 Damn!

131
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,325
I test a spirit box and see if we get through her voice.

132
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,893
It was as if something caressed my fingers here.

133
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:46,682
What did it say?

134
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:47,465
Time.

135
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,816
Did you hear this just?

136
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:50,867
Here.

137
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:53,544
It sounded like .. yes it may have it.

138
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,254
Hard.

139
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,174
“Works now”

140
00:13:58,174 --> 00:13:58,813
Works now.

141
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:02,256
Should we turn this off for so long?
 Or should we have both started?

142
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:04,025
Run both.

143
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:09,587
The girl who is here can you say your name?
 Thanks!
 You are here.

144
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:10,700
Where.

145
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,224
It is in both directions here, both red and green

146
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:30,799
It was such a light touch over the fingers several times like this, back and forth.
 Imagine a child's hand that with your fingertips pulls over your fingers like this.

147
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,603
Never felt like that.

148
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,757
Are you left there?

149
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,510
You can do it again if you want.

150
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,970
You don't have to be afraid of us.

151
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:52,957
But cool anyway that this one showed static, what I knew.

152
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,205
That was ...

153
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,578
Place it at the bed and we'll see.

154
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:56,480
Is it on?

155
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,648
No, I've turned it off.

156
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,207
I put this one.

157
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:02,837
Now we have lots of tools here that can take different fields.

158
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,412
So if you are in here now, can you come and sit here in bed are you kind?

159
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:12,953
Get up from below the bed.
 You don't have to be afraid.

160
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,157
I run spirit box again.

161
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:19,018
This was the sickest, it still feels like she is moving my hand.

162
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,347
Was it you who took in Tony's hand?

163
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:25,819
*Breath*

164
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,341
Someone who just breathes ..

165
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:32,723
"Beware"

166
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,966
Did it say beware or behind you?
 But now it is a man who is in here.

167
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,017
*Laugh*

168
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,702
Did you hear it?

169
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:43,507
"One"

170
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,405
"Girl"

171
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,307
A girl.

172
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:48,797
Now the shivers came again.

173
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:49,578
"Here now"

174
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:50,643
A woman.

175
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,377
It was like someone grabbed at my health type, when I stand with my foot on the bed here.

176
00:15:55,377 --> 00:15:57,078
Or get pain.

177
00:15:58,014 --> 00:16:00,000
Is it you who touches Tony now?

178
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,079
"We are waiting"

179
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,342
A woman, I don't know what she said.

180
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,077
"Go now"

181
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,817
It was dark, like it said.

182
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:15,123
Is it really a little girl here?
 Then I want the little girl to come in here now.

183
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,664
The man who took his life ..

184
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:21,530
Out in the barn ...

185
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,252
Are you left here?

186
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:27,118
"He says...."

187
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:28,602
"Go up"

188
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,449
It sounded like going up.
 Or up.

189
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,066
"Leave"

190
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:44,474
Turn it off.
 This man, he is seen inside the house, but he is also outside and just looks at them.
 He wears a swallow hat.

191
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:50,679
Just.
 And a rock.
 And boots.
 So he just stands still.

192
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:55,040
They even screamed at him, what do you want?!
 And then he just goes away.

193
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,780
That was sick, it was a great feeling that.

194
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,369
It is cool, while you get the touch, you get a static field that pops up there.

195
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:07,183
It was like I went into it, but it continued to wander along my fingers.

196
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:11,725
You get to play with this teddy bear or with that coffee pot there.

197
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:12,873
Throw them down if you want.

198
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:22,014
I think we also put our PMA there.
 Paranormal Motion Alert.
 I will start a switch here and it will then lie and activate

199
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:25,732
And it sounds.
 If I start this now, it will be like this.

200
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:26,824
And it continues.

201
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:30,542
Until we turn it off.
 We may also hear that.

202
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:35,594
You can also have it only on movement.

203
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:44,323
That it moves.
 So I put it on the bed in case something presses it or sits in bed.

204
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,672
So if you want, you can sit there in bed.
 Then we will hear that.

205
00:17:54,672 --> 00:18:01,138
Should we go down to the basement?
 Or should we go up to this room where the closet is said to open?

206
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:04,277
We go down to the basement first I think.

207
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:23,211
Here we have where the family usually shower and this is where they hear, I will show, you know when it gets hot and cold then drapes usually go in and out, but when they stand in there they get this.

208
00:18:23,211 --> 00:18:32,964
That someone beats.
 Really powerful.
 So there are no small movements and they think it is the girl who runs here, that she makes them the phenomenon.

209
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:36,983
Now we have the camera there so if something like that would happen then it is caught there.

210
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,702
I think if I put this inside?

211
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:59,589
Can you come in here?
 You who usually beat here.
 On this drapery, whether it is the little girl or whoever is now that is usually here and bust and turn on the drapery.

212
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:00,805
Find.

213
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:09,124
Are you behind the drapery or can you come in here and turn on the drapery?

214
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:17,459
Actually, maybe someone should stand inside, just for everyone illustrate that someone is behind.
 Should you try standing in there?

215
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:21,687
So it's like you are in the shower.

216
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:26,073
Play, I got now.
 Yes we play with you here.

217
00:19:34,088 --> 00:19:36,271
Coming, I got now.

218
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:40,522
Yes come.
 I'm standing here.
 But hit the drapery first.

219
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:45,800
Now I stand here and waste water, if it is the man who does not like to waste water.

220
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,631
Turn on that drapery, if you're in here.
 You have done it several times before to those who live here.

221
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,616
Good, turn on this now.

222
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,700
Niclas is in there, make sure he gets out of there.

223
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:08,583
We will check if we get any light phenomenon.

224
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,246
Time to pray, it says.

225
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:15,786
What do you want?
 Steam are you talking about now, will it be hot in there Niclas?

226
00:20:15,786 --> 00:20:17,268
Yes.

227
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:30,567
We will test one thing Nicke, me and Johan back out so you have to stand there for a little while.

228
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,727
We back out, so we have that camera running.

229
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:38,105
Can you come and turn on this drapery now when I stand here?

230
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:47,251
Take all the power you can.
 Get the water to turn off here, hit the drapery.

231
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:55,640
Take all the power you have and pull in the drapery now.

232
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,172
All power.
 In the drapery.
 Now.

233
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:12,703
Now we will see if it is right because he is in there now.
 If this girl or boy wants to turn on the drapery.

234
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:21,651
It may not want it when we were there.
 But we have a camera running, so it hit it so it has to hit the outside and towards Niclas.

235
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:25,017
All the power in the drapery, now.

236
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:46,470
The drapery is moving but Niclas does not notice, and that the surveillance camera is blinking.

237
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,072
Do you know anything there?

238
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:48,805
No.

239
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:50,000
Nothing?

240
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,627
Unfortunately, nothing came.

241
00:21:52,627 --> 00:22:02,398
Now you have still showered the same way as the family.
 But we put back the drapery as it is, it rolls here all the time, so it would happen something so we catch it with the camera.

242
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:09,760
Just.
 Now I have got the steam up so it got very hot in there.
 So we see if it is moving in any way.

243
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,650
We go up to the living room.

244
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,351
Boys?

245
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:12,429
Yes?

246
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:17,473
We lost the kitchen camera just recently.

247
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:19,075
Kitchen camera?

248
00:22:19,075 --> 00:22:22,147
We're just on our way up.

249
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,155
Tell me when it comes back.

250
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:29,546
It is already back, it was gone for about thirty seconds.

251
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:30,551
Okay.

252
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,931
Wonder if something happened.
 We have to check, we have stuff on the bed.

253
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:37,906
Yes exactly.

254
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,907
Now the shudder came again.

255
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:44,591
Should we check the bed only then?

256
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:49,152
Everything looks normal but it smells strange here.

257
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:50,440
There is some scent here ..

258
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,835
It smells freshly baked?

259
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:52,667
Right?

260
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:57,920
Newly baked it smells.

261
00:22:58,107 --> 00:23:02,467
We let this be, the alarm does not seem to have gone to bed either.

262
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:06,360
Should we go out to the living room?
 There is the rocking horse that is said to move.

263
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,448
I bring Spirit Vibes, I will put it at the rocking horse.
 And also our PDA, Paranormal Direct Answers.

264
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:16,132
Green or red, answers questions.

265
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:20,232
I replace Polterscript and I drive Ovilus in there.

266
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,729
Here to the right ...

267
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:27,463
Here it stands.

268
00:23:27,463 --> 00:23:30,000
The rocking horse.

269
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:37,577
I put it up here, in case it moves then this will take the movements.

270
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:45,474
You see, if I stomp.
 And if this starts to swing, it hopefully falls off.

271
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:57,984
So if we have the girl or boy here, who usually play with this rocking horse, who has made it swing before, could you do it now?

272
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,324
I put this down too.

273
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,305
I back a bit.

274
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,706
Do we have someone with us in this room?

275
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:24,160
I have the spirit box ready so I take a small session here only.

276
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,880
Can you go to this rocking horse?

277
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,656
"Oh no"

278
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:31,375
No, a man.

279
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:37,976
The man who is here is you who went out in the barn and took your life?

280
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,646
“Severely ill”

281
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,726
Difficult sick.

282
00:24:43,711 --> 00:24:47,857
Did you find out that you were seriously ill and then you went out in the barn ....

283
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:50,676
and took your life?

284
00:24:51,275 --> 00:24:58,163
Is it you people usually see who are out in the yard, in windows and a little everywhere?

285
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:07,992
Said that Eriksson or Fredriksson?

286
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,001
After all, we brought in an object from the other house, that lamp and placed it on the table.

287
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:16,909
That's when the family says that even more things are starting to happen.

288
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:19,189
Don't you like this lamp to be there?

289
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:20,268
"Go now"

290
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,583
Go now.

291
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:29,240
It smells freshly baked all the time now.

292
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,078
Who makes it smell so good in this building?

293
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:38,597
Say your name, you who make it smell so good.

294
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,524
"People live here"

295
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:55,374
This is also interesting, I mean we have these phenomena that happen and right now it feels like we are talking to quite a few around here.

296
00:25:55,374 --> 00:26:07,519
But I do not know, what we are trying to focus on when we are here is what he experiences.
 Is it really a little girl or is it something else that has been generated from something completely different?

297
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:20,216
And we focus a lot on these phenomena, because it's the ones that stand out.
 It is the rocking horse, the bedroom there, the shower down there and we have one to bedroom up there where a wardrobe door is usually opened.

298
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:24,541
And there are also moved there.
 It is caps that end up in completely different places.

299
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,298
I try Ovilus here and we'll see.

300
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:30,767
Someone here?
 Angry I just got up ..

301
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:37,042
Are you angry because we're here?
 Don't like us?

302
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:43,977
Can you get this rocking horse to swing once for us?

303
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:51,373
You've got it to swing several times before.
 When the family has been sitting here.

304
00:26:56,055 --> 00:27:02,843
What I know now with hot spots, it's just his room.
 There are shivers, everything is very focused on his room.

305
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:12,533
Shall we go up?
 We let the horse be, it is also in front of the camera.
 Shall we go up one floor?
 And feel how it is up there with this wardrobe door that opens.

306
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:13,290
Yes.

307
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:15,803
We try it.
 Should we leave Spirit Vibes?

308
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:17,502
It must remain.

309
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:22,560
Okay, I get interesting I got now.

310
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:34,349
It is this wardrobe, which is said to be opened and closed.

311
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:37,909
And these caps are usually moved and change position.

312
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:42,787
Anyone up here who can open this wardrobe?

313
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:44,493
After all, these mirrors have overturned.

314
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:46,263
Yes exactly.

315
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,552
I start this one too.

316
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:13,103
I don't know what it was, there was something black, little like .. I don't know if it was your shadow, can you make it once to Niclas?

317
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:14,263
Is that it?

318
00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:16,452
Yes, it may have where the one I saw.

319
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:17,623
It may have where I.

320
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:18,880
Yes, it could be.

321
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,080
What Tony sees is a light phenomenon that passes in front of him as the surveillance camera captures.

322
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:41,170
If you are in there, take all the power you can and just push up the door to us, you are kind.

323
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:52,639
Take all our energy, we who are in here.
 Drain the camera battery, take everything from all technology to open this door.

324
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:57,644
Would you be able to do it for us?

325
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:15,145
If it is the little girl who is here, who does them here, would you like to play with us and open the wardrobe then we will play hide and hide and hide, then you will look.

326
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:25,354
I try to listen while talking, on the whole house.
 We hear drops, something that beats out here, you hear a lot.

327
00:29:25,354 --> 00:29:29,173
But it is recurring, it is the same all the time.
 So it's nothing paranormal.

328
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:30,676
No.

329
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:34,206
Can you move on a cap hanging here on the wall?

330
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,493
EVP is recorded.

331
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:39,052
"Kannor"

332
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:52,084
It's not the same discomfort here either.
 It's his room down there, so far, right?

333
00:29:52,084 --> 00:30:01,581
If you want to go on the instruments and what we know, it is down there.
 But then if it moves throughout the house, the camera takes it, if these phenomena happens.

334
00:30:01,581 --> 00:30:11,071
But right in there it seems that it is centered.
 I have a theory of the little energy that is there, using him an incredible amount.

335
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:15,187
He probably has a lot of energy.
 So that's why it is in that room.

336
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:18,397
That he becomes like the battery to it.

337
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:24,470
I mean, if it doesn't calm down, you have to do something completely different.

338
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:30,537
I'll put a PMB against this door.

339
00:30:39,788 --> 00:30:45,823
So if you want, you can go by here, then it will play a melody for you.
 Or open the closet there.

340
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:50,000
So we let that camera work.
 Lennie also says so now.

341
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:59,070
That is what gets interesting, there is so much phenomenon in different places here now and I think they are so fascinating, you want to document them.

342
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:10,627
If we can find a logical explanation for them it is even better, we have tried everything here now during the day, but nothing.
 Nothing logical, that one has been closed since we closed it.

343
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,725
Okay, we're going down.

344
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,978
As I said earlier, in this staircase they hear running too.
 People running up and down at night.

345
00:31:23,978 --> 00:31:27,040
It is cracking a little when you go so you will not miss this.

346
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,443
No, exactly.

347
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:32,966
Here it is a completely different feeling when you come down.

348
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,147
I agree with.

349
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:36,677
You are drawn to that room.

350
00:31:39,673 --> 00:31:42,354
Should we go in again and test?

351
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:46,365
I test Ghostbox in there.

352
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:52,040
I have with me Ovilus, who works in parallel.
 So we'll see.

353
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,510
Now we are back here again.

354
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,012
It was under the bed before that we found it.

355
00:31:58,536 --> 00:32:01,699
Immediately!
 It was under the bed earlier.

356
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,709
Directly when you said it!

357
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,786
And shiver.
 Good.

358
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:11,097
Can you get up and sit on the bed?

359
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:23,645
If it's a little girl then you don't have to be afraid of us.
 We should not hurt you or anything.
 You can only get up, sit on the bed, and we can talk you and I.

360
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:26,327
I start Ghostbox here.

361
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:29,112
Ovilus is allowed to lie here.

362
00:32:31,996 --> 00:32:34,334
Who are you?

363
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:39,457
Ghostbox works as a spirit box, it is just digital.

364
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,141
The little girl who is under the bed, you can come up and put .....

365
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,363
"Angry"

366
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:45,517
Did it say?

367
00:32:45,517 --> 00:32:48,575
I don't know if it said it or what it said.

368
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:52,464
So the little girl who is under the bed came up to us here.

369
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:55,162
Do you see the teddy bear there?

370
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:03,449
Do you see the teapot I put to you?

371
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:06,792
That noise, I put this one.

372
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,708
Can you say what your name is for us?

373
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:09,753
Look look!

374
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:13,339
Good!
 Go near it.

375
00:33:15,848 --> 00:33:18,003
It glows on both.

376
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:32,171
Sit next to it and talk.
 So maybe we will hear your voice.

377
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:44,532
Like it went.

378
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:49,539
Yes, like it didn't really cope, did you see?
 It went away.

379
00:33:54,932 --> 00:34:00,000
Strange, I don't usually get anything, but in my head all the time, it's a maiden name.

380
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,453
Which has been holding on for probably ten minutes.
 Now I have to say, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa ...

381
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:09,496
That just walks around, around, around.
 We haven't got through Lisa huh?

382
00:34:09,496 --> 00:34:10,892
No.

383
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:17,639
Lisa, if that's what you're called ....

384
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,443
Can you touch something on the bed?

385
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:33,400
Should we leave this?

386
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,006
I'll bring it.

387
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:41,075
We leave the teddy bear and that to hopefully catch the camera it.
 And the alarm will go and it will hold on until we come back in that case

388
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:48,601
Should we go out to the building as well?
 See if we can see this man.
 And there are a lot of other things in the windows there.

389
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:54,369
Yes exactly.
 And Lennie has a look at if stuff happens, whether PMB starts playing or something else.

390
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:58,667
But it's cold outside, so we have to wear the jackets.

391
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:07,566
And so we go out.
 We go away, we have lots of stuff in the pockets.
 We also bring the SLS camera, the heat camera.
 We'll look at everything, the man who hung himself in the barn

392
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:13,379
But we will also look at where he has been seen.
 Around here, so we'll see if we can get any mapping.

393
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:21,109
The instruments are still underway here.
 Lennie has full control over it, so he shouts, Johan you have Walkie Talkie, so we will hear it.

394
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:36,089
We run both SLS camera and heat camera at the same time.

395
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,966
And it is in this house where they see people stand here.

396
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:51,433
Anyone here?

397
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:56,108
It is interesting, a candlestick is up and running.

398
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:57,877
Should I extinguish it?

399
00:35:57,877 --> 00:35:59,372
Do it.

400
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:09,096
Do we have someone in here?
 Which usually stands at these windows and look out.

401
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,602
He has been seen standing here.
 And look straight at the person when they come in.

402
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:24,788
If you stand there Niclas, I'll see if I get an upset.
 See if we can get him with you.

403
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:29,431
You who usually stand here, this man .....

404
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:33,058
Can you come in here?

405
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:36,848
Probably you who have built this house.

406
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:39,103
Stand along with Niclas there.

407
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:41,282
The voice that Johan heard was not caught by the camera.

408
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,058
How disgusting it was, a women's voice I heard.

409
00:36:44,058 --> 00:36:44,857
What did it say?

410
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:50,210
A women's voice, I didn't hear what it said.
 I heard a women's voice in the handsets.

411
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,312
Just as a women's voice I heard it was.

412
00:36:56,024 --> 00:36:59,629
Is it a woman who is here?

413
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,732
Which Johan just heard.

414
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:06,770
Can you stand along with Niclas in that case?

415
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,651
What degrees do you have?

416
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:13,774
I have zero degrees inside the building here.

417
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,921
The woman who was heard just ...

418
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:21,198
Can you make a loud sound in this building where you kind?

419
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:30,910
Where are you now?

420
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:41,811
I see no heat or cold, or anything.

421
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:45,742
Wait, there!
 Now something appeared.

422
00:37:45,742 --> 00:37:49,373
On that hand there, now it disappeared.

423
00:37:49,598 --> 00:37:52,554
You beat it, but it was a little lower, like a child Niclas.

424
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:54,476
Okay, but then I develop communication.

425
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:55,080
Did you get that?

426
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,885
Yeah.

427
00:37:55,885 --> 00:37:56,825
Good!

428
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,680
There was a shudder now while you say it, good.

429
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,103
Can you come back again?
 You don't have to be afraid of us.

430
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:12,852
What's your name?

431
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,615
Did you hear what it said?

432
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:27,926
Why do you want to hush us?

433
00:38:30,623 --> 00:38:33,132
Are we talking too high in here?

434
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,171
Then I raise this to the max.

435
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,233
If you hear this noise ...

436
00:38:41,233 --> 00:38:43,468
So come and hush us again then.

437
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:44,698
"Go!"

438
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:46,539
Go!!

439
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:50,424
Oh!
 Now it is, stand there!

440
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:55,103
A small child who is under your arm, touching your hand type.

441
00:38:55,103 --> 00:38:57,253
Good!
 Use this ..

442
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,205
It disappeared again.

443
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:05,003
"My Spot/My Place"

444
00:39:08,486 --> 00:39:10,421
We stand, or something ..

445
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,047
How angry he sounded.

446
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:17,310
I want these kids here ...

447
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,930
Now it's back!
 Stuck on the other side ...

448
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,976
Yes, there!
 Behind your back now.

449
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:29,482
But that doesn't look like a child, it looks like something is climbing on your back now.

450
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:36,039
Climb up!
 Take off my cap, turn off my cap, pull in my jacket.

451
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:36,983
"Naughty"

452
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,408
Naughty.

453
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:42,541
Cool, there will be a cold up after the back.

454
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:49,257
Yes, it wanders up longer and farther after down back.
 Hands touch your hand there.

455
00:39:49,257 --> 00:39:51,061
It moves your hand where Niclas.

456
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:52,258
It stood up, it squatted huh?

457
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:53,914
Yes, it squatted, now it stands up.

458
00:39:53,914 --> 00:39:54,794
*Duns in the building*

459
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:56,702
Oh, what a bang somewhere.

460
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:05,794
If it is you we see now ...

461
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:09,201
The little child who is in the second house .....

462
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:17,695
do something.
 Pull my jacket.

463
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:26,766
It just stands behind you, it does nothing.
 It hits a little against your leg or against your hand.

464
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:28,320
And your knee.

465
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:31,947
It was one more ..

466
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:33,660
I have to lift my hand ..

467
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,153
Now it settles, what does it do?
 Check...

468
00:40:36,153 --> 00:40:40,000
Nicke, it is on the floor type.

469
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:51,128
If you see, it lay down and crawls on the floor.
 But now it is another who stands ....

470
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:52,075
"Hello"

471
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,807
It was a child.

472
00:40:54,807 --> 00:40:56,844
Hi, we hear you.

473
00:40:58,492 --> 00:41:01,107
Are you called Lisa?

474
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:09,731
One more, though it is there now, on that side.
 It stands up on the bench.
 It also looks like a small child.

475
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:11,815
There are two kids here.

476
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:16,767
Are the kids here now, you who passed away here?

477
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,706
Do you see Johan?

478
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:19,206
Yes, I have full control.

479
00:41:19,206 --> 00:41:24,457
One sitting on the floor, one standing on the bench behind you Niclas.

480
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,235
"Mom comes"

481
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,929
Mom is coming.

482
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,219
"Yes!"

483
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:37,815
I thought it was a black shadow behind you Johan.

484
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:41,880
I have a light entry there, it was suddenly bent out and it's not you.

485
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,852
Mom comes, okay if mom is here came in here too and talk to us.

486
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:53,071
Sick.
 One who is still sitting and one who is there.
 And both are small.

487
00:41:53,071 --> 00:41:56,385
Can we have the name of you?
 What's your name?

488
00:41:56,385 --> 00:41:58,813
Can you stand up?

489
00:41:58,813 --> 00:42:02,094
What if I go out of picture?
 Will them be left?

490
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:02,761
Should I try?

491
00:42:02,761 --> 00:42:03,370
Yes.

492
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,968
Yes, try to go out.

493
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:13,430
Yes, it's left.
 It sits down there on the bench.
 Come and see for yourself.

494
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,534
Sitting leaning ...

495
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:17,344
Now I know what is happening ...

496
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:18,308
That is not ...

497
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:21,846
Now something happened.
 It crawls after ...

498
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:23,683
Away.

499
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,298
I'll go there again.

500
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:28,738
You who were here ..

501
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:33,086
Go down to the bench there.
 Where.

502
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:40,747
Now it's time for you to show you to us.

503
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:45,000
We would like to see you.
 If it is this man who is here now ...

504
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,816
"Yes!"

505
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:50,618
Although there were two pieces that said it at the same time.

506
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:53,400
I shudder like hell here.

507
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,473
Do you usually talk to a boy in the other house?

508
00:42:56,473 --> 00:43:00,768
Now!
 One more.
 On the other side.

509
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,365
"Is it wrong with us?"

510
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:06,674
The first sounded downwards.

511
00:43:06,674 --> 00:43:07,694
Disappeared.

512
00:43:07,694 --> 00:43:10,252
So, jump down.

513
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:15,053
Be sick.

514
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:19,083
Is the man here?
 That has been seen.

515
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:22,311
Go into that room too and we'll check.

516
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:24,869
Wait!

517
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,188
Bert.

518
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,125
A name.

519
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,208
"Stand there!"

520
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:30,688
Bert was someone who said.

521
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,721
Is it the man who took his life in the barn?

522
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:40,440
Is it you that people usually see outside?

523
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,952
I would like to test a thing Tony.
 I close this ..

524
00:43:43,952 --> 00:43:50,980
I would like to test stand where that barn burned down.
 On the ground out there.
 See if there is something that pops up next to me there.

525
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:56,675
Should we test it before we go into the barn?
 But it is interesting, we have two energies moving here.

526
00:43:56,675 --> 00:44:10,000
They come through pretty well.
 But there are still too many questions.
 But it's like, there are two children and the legends are there.
 It's not far, we can only go there before we go into the barn.

527
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,635
Lets go out.

528
00:44:11,635 --> 00:44:16,292
So if it is you, who passed away out there, follow us.

529
00:44:19,547 --> 00:44:27,420
As you can see, we are just off the bus, what you hear now is our heater to the bus.
 But we have a good bit more ...

530
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,513
Damn was anyone standing there?

531
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:31,794
Care for the Chinese.

532
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,129
Someone stood on the balcony there.

533
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:34,890
On the balcony?

534
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:42,218
Yes.
 It was a full shadow of a human being.
 Stand still there, check out here ...

535
00:44:42,218 --> 00:44:45,235
So that was sick!
 Now I understand what they mean.

536
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:46,452
Where did you see it?

537
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:48,442
Like this.

538
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,585
Who stood there?
 Where!
 Wait, damn I got it ...

539
00:44:57,585 --> 00:44:59,714
Here it was an old man looking at us.

540
00:44:59,714 --> 00:45:05,984
Right where you were, there was one who stood.
 It disappeared just as quickly.

541
00:45:05,984 --> 00:45:13,628
I understand now.
 What I saw was just black, this posture, you stand with your arms along the sides.

542
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:14,409
Stood and just watched?

543
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:20,000
Just stood so.
 I thought that now someone has come here.

544
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,657
Look there.

545
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:26,168
Can you come back, the man who usually stands here?

546
00:45:26,168 --> 00:45:31,468
I just saw you.
 Now I understand what they are talking about here.

547
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:48,852
We have been involved in many, many times when we do this.
 That you see it, you get it confirmed afterwards, but we never get it on film.

548
00:45:48,852 --> 00:45:59,575
But now I think we could actually get it.
 The sick thing is that you say we go here and you stand, then it takes two seconds then it just disappears.

549
00:45:59,575 --> 00:46:03,666
When I stand there, I get like this, the owners are back.

550
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:04,421
Well, was that how you thought?

551
00:46:04,421 --> 00:46:05,683
Yes, that's how I thought.

552
00:46:05,683 --> 00:46:06,346
It was so clear?

553
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:10,799
Yes, imagined a black shape that is just looking at us.

554
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:12,001
You didn't see if it was a man or woman?

555
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:20,594
No, black shape.
 But just the posture, with the arms after the sides.
 Just stands like this.

556
00:46:20,594 --> 00:46:29,080
But this is what they have talked about, they have said they see this man, he stands here in the yard.
 He looks around the corners, he is here in the house, he is in the window, he is everywhere here.

557
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,501
And now I understand what they are talking about.
 He was so clear and clear over there.

558
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:33,933
So sick.

559
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:36,814
But it's cool that SLS took it afterwards.

560
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:45,920
Show yourself out here!
 And it is said that this Norrbotten farm was here adjacent to the barn.

561
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:50,000
I start and scan.

562
00:46:52,622 --> 00:46:56,564
These kids, if you are with us now ...

563
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,717
Come here and talk to us.

564
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:11,157
I don't know what it said there.

565
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:20,461
If you hear me now ..

566
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:24,510
So come here and talk to me now.

567
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:34,149
"Comes"

568
00:47:34,524 --> 00:47:36,467
This was the man.

569
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:41,574
This man who is here, as we just saw, can you come here and stand next to me?

570
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:44,855
Stand next to me here now.

571
00:47:44,855 --> 00:47:49,848
If you stand there we will see you too.

572
00:48:09,248 --> 00:48:14,807
We stand out in the yard and try to get in touch with the Ghost box, at the same time this happens in the kitchen.

573
00:48:14,807 --> 00:48:29,207
What we can see is that one of the hooks is pressed down, and that cables move in the bags, we notice with arrows where to look.

574
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,742
Then the lid is pressed back.

575
00:49:22,408 --> 00:49:30,262
Okay, they won't come through here either.
 Should we go to the barn and test, see if we can get in touch with these man, maybe can see him too.

576
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:33,337
Energy memory of him if nothing else.

577
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:40,545
It is said that he has been hanging out here, from one of the beams.
 We direct the camera and see if we see anything.

578
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:47,976
The man who unfortunately chose to end his life here, are you left here?

579
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:50,996
Up there...

580
00:49:50,996 --> 00:49:52,550
It's up there, to the right.

581
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,698
Where?
 This is?

582
00:49:55,934 --> 00:49:58,265
On the contrary, it will be, exactly.

583
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:00,655
Can you come back again?

584
00:50:02,636 --> 00:50:06,265
Just for a short second I saw.

585
00:50:06,452 --> 00:50:12,028
If you took your life in here, can you show which place?

586
00:50:12,403 --> 00:50:14,625
Where was it?

587
00:50:17,696 --> 00:50:23,743
I just got one quick.
 I'll have a look between the caravans here.

588
00:50:23,968 --> 00:50:27,570
Anyone hiding down here?

589
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,912
Feel free to show yourself if you are here.

590
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:37,555
Throw something.

591
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:40,312
Did you see it?

592
00:50:40,836 --> 00:50:42,430
Where!
 No..

593
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:48,592
Do you hide here behind?

594
00:50:53,835 --> 00:51:02,552
What is here, it only turns out short.
 A second, then up on the wall, then gone.

595
00:51:02,552 --> 00:51:04,841
I'm going on this page too.
 Are you here?

596
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:08,459
I start communication here behind.

597
00:51:11,979 --> 00:51:13,902
Nothing.

598
00:51:21,842 --> 00:51:27,933
This man, can we get the name of you?
 Are your named Bert?

599
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:35,479
Hermansson in surname, is that correct?

600
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:38,680
"Not really"

601
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,573
Not really.
 I might be wrong then.

602
00:51:42,798 --> 00:51:48,554
We heard from previous owners that it could have been, or I have confused it.

603
00:51:48,554 --> 00:51:52,369
I don't get a walking here, just on you, no one else.

604
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:53,857
Okay.

605
00:51:54,713 --> 00:51:58,191
Can you slap somewhere so we know where you are.

606
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:07,198
Knock.

607
00:52:08,023 --> 00:52:09,372
There was something here ..

608
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:13,726
Was it at the caravan or?

609
00:52:14,213 --> 00:52:21,538
Niclas, should we test go into the main house again?
 And then we go to the room, with the Kinect.
 It's not so much battery left on it.

610
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,929
We see if we get any mapping on it.

611
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,827
Here everything shines.

612
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:44,613
No alarm has started.

613
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:50,179
We're back here again.

614
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:56,946
Are you under bed still?

615
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:00,411
There is Niclas.

616
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:14,844
You who usually talk to the boy who has his bedroom here ..

617
00:53:14,844 --> 00:53:18,762
Would you be able to show yourself to us once?

618
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:21,576
A little time.

619
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:29,145
No mapping on SLS camera here.

620
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,765
I'll try once under the bed here.

621
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:38,742
Nothing.

622
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:47,140
We wait for Johan while he takes off his jacket before we continue, then this happens.

623
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,615
Damn, now he was there I think.
 He was damn behind the car.

624
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:51,693
Huh?

625
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:52,954
Yes, hell!

626
00:53:52,954 --> 00:53:55,127
What you see a lot of Niclas.

627
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:57,685
Damn I also want to see this fucking old man.

628
00:53:57,685 --> 00:54:02,770
But that's because I look around, I look out all the time.
 Now there was a black shape behind the car.

629
00:54:03,556 --> 00:54:10,859
While we are fixing and taking off jackets, I look out at the same place, but now he stands behind the car.

630
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:19,200
Those who live here have two cars and they left one left.
 And now he was behind the car.
 Unfortunately, we have no surveillance out here, but I am who see it.

631
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,911
Now that Johan is taking off the jacket for us to be back.

632
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:27,479
It's pretty interesting, I don't know why he turns out to me.
 It's as you said, you want to see too and I understand that.

633
00:54:27,479 --> 00:54:35,989
But I am one as a person who looks all the time, I may seem nonchalant, but I work with everything.

634
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:40,988
I let the body feel, but here I just turn my head, I see him stand there ...

635
00:54:40,988 --> 00:54:44,053
Same dark figure, straight out here.

636
00:54:44,053 --> 00:54:53,718
So I think it's awesome, he goes around here, but he doesn't come in here it seems.
 But what we have focused on all evening is more this with the child

637
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:56,734
And it seems to be children here.

638
00:54:56,734 --> 00:55:04,582
Yes, everything that the owners tell us here.
 There are two children, we have got through a woman and you see this man out there in the yard walking around.

639
00:55:04,582 --> 00:55:08,805
If it is now the same man who has been hanged out, we do not know.
 Or if there are two different men.

640
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,658
Because it is one that has a slightly more aggressive tone as well.

641
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:20,496
You also have to think that it is their land and we try to get a little more right to those who live here.

642
00:55:20,496 --> 00:55:26,563
What it is that can affect him.
 Because they also give him pretty negative thoughts.

643
00:55:26,563 --> 00:55:32,544
So it is very difficult for us, I can't put my finger on why that energy does.

644
00:55:32,544 --> 00:55:46,323
But we will test a little more, I think, we will put out a pyramid that we have.
 The Pyramid of Truth.
 I will put it inside and we will not be in the room.

645
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:59,103
We will stand here somewhere.
 And this one will then push out rays on each side.
 Who senses if something breaks this, then it will indicate with green or red.

646
00:55:59,103 --> 00:56:03,281
And then it comes pipe and has its own life in there.

647
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:06,388
Then I wait out here.

648
00:56:06,388 --> 00:56:09,462
As you can see, it turns green and red.

649
00:56:09,462 --> 00:56:10,651
Two beeps.

650
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:18,512
So it will be on the bed here now, about this girl or whatever it is.
 So Johan will direct the camera between us here now.

651
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:23,666
Now we have placed this one and it detects if there is any movement next to it.

652
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:30,491
So if the little girl is in there by the bed.
 We're not in there with you now, so you can arrive.

653
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:34,788
You can touch what blinks there on the bed, nothing is dangerous.

654
00:56:34,788 --> 00:56:42,555
You can make it shine green if it is yes and if it is red, it can be no.

655
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:47,960
That said it is not dangerous, you can touch it as much as you want.

656
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,232
Do you know what we do?

657
00:56:49,232 --> 00:56:57,127
We have a car that goes static.
 If you take it and place it under the bed, see if it can roll out to us.

658
00:56:57,127 --> 00:56:58,661
If she can make it come out to us.

659
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:00,731
We test it.

660
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:04,300
We will add more toys to you there.

661
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:09,091
Then we should keep in mind that static fields are required for this car to start.

662
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:13,588
We will not be in the room ourselves.
 Tony will put it under the bed.

663
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:16,296
I put the one I had ...

664
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:19,595
Now Tony went by as you can see.

665
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:25,621
I put this one, where we had the static field.

666
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,084
Now it is under the bed.
 You can play with it if you want.

667
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:41,872
It was Tony again that passed, so you see how sensitive it is.
 It takes directly, so that's why we're not in the room.

668
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:47,386
So now we have posted a toy car for you too.
 You who are under the bed ...

669
00:57:47,386 --> 00:57:48,778
There were shivers when you came out.

670
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:49,492
Well?

671
00:57:49,492 --> 00:57:50,893
Good!

672
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:54,622
You don't have to be afraid of something I said.

673
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:07,981
Do you want to play with us?
 Play with this car that is under the bed and drives it out to us.

674
00:58:11,764 --> 00:58:13,085
Play with it!

675
00:58:13,085 --> 00:58:15,211
Play with that car.

676
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,055
Now we have addressed this with friendly voices, like it is a child.

677
00:58:25,055 --> 00:58:26,228
Should we test something else then?

678
00:58:26,228 --> 00:58:29,508
Try a little more like it is not a child.

679
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:36,563
You who are under the bed in this room, which affects the person lying in that bed ..

680
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:38,628
Can you make a sound in there from?

681
00:58:45,182 --> 00:58:48,640
The negative that is in that room ..

682
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,257
There it comes!

683
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,106
The negative ...

684
00:58:57,215 --> 00:59:00,000
It pulled over the threshold and everything.

685
00:59:01,198 --> 00:59:04,844
That was uncomfortable, the negative!

686
00:59:05,069 --> 00:59:12,306
You got the car to go out.
 The negative that is in there that affects this boy who sleeps there ...

687
00:59:12,456 --> 00:59:15,619
Now I'm talking to you.

688
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:18,690
There is no little girl who is in there.

689
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,441
It's something else.

690
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:25,317
Are you afraid of us?

691
00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:33,687
If you are afraid of us, I'll come in to you now.

692
00:59:40,503 --> 00:59:43,432
Can you throw something against us in here?

693
00:59:44,743 --> 00:59:47,598
You got the bus to leave.

694
00:59:47,935 --> 00:59:52,693
It was sick when you said the negative.
 When you talked about it being something else.

695
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:56,631
We tried to address it as being a child, but it wasn't listening.

696
00:59:56,631 --> 01:00:01,969
What is here with me now, that made this bus go out ..

697
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:06,665
Can you close this door?
 Close me here with you.

698
01:00:06,665 --> 01:00:10,844
Do you have such power to be able to slap this door again?

699
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,655
Niclas hears a voice.

700
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,391
It sounds like a woman saying "Niclas"

701
01:00:18,391 --> 01:00:21,039
There are shivers in here.

702
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,560
It sounded like someone said something ...

703
01:00:31,162 --> 01:00:34,664
Yes, push me or push someone in here.

704
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:37,821
Push the door again, push the bus.

705
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:41,594
The bus is trying to drive again.

706
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:44,407
What was that?

707
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:45,963
That's it!

708
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:48,026
It is it ..

709
01:00:49,138 --> 01:00:52,048
I said push the bus.

710
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,802
It tries to push the bus.

711
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,670
It was a voice before Tony, out here.

712
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,680
Well?

713
01:01:07,216 --> 01:01:08,791
I belonged to it.

714
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,798
It lies and beats there.

715
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,022
It wants to push it away.

716
01:01:17,243 --> 01:01:20,309
We won't go out of here ...

717
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:23,180
until you say your name.

718
01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:30,000
Who are you?

719
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,083
It begins to vibrate more Tony, the bus.

720
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:32,830
Does it?

721
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,735
I put a PRS down on the floor next to it.

722
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:51,910
It may be that PMB is running up there as well.

723
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:57,467
A bright light is captured by the surveillance in the room where the PMB stands.

724
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,485
Show yourself like a fog here.

725
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:16,868
Play the melody up in the other room.

726
01:02:16,868 --> 01:02:20,245
If you are there by the closet.

727
01:02:20,769 --> 01:02:26,505
I stand here thinking about a thing that feels pretty macabre ...

728
01:02:26,505 --> 01:02:28,273
When we came here earlier today ..

729
01:02:28,273 --> 01:02:31,444
So this door was closed.
 No one in there.

730
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:34,320
What is also on this door is a hasp.

731
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,166
Huh?

732
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,429
At the top left.

733
01:02:39,478 --> 01:02:44,136
Is it so negative in there that they even lock this door sometimes?

734
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,514
Shuts it in.

735
01:02:49,622 --> 01:02:51,211
Do you understand?

736
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:53,423
It's pretty sick.

737
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,263
It's the bus.

738
01:03:00,424 --> 01:03:03,320
It increased in speed when you talked about Haspen.

739
01:03:04,256 --> 01:03:11,898
So those in the family sometimes choose to close and havep.
 They may have forgotten to tell you that this door ....

740
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:14,673
What the hell was that?

741
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,230
It was the second lock on the bag that folds down during the evening.

742
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:29,824
Something was moved.

743
01:03:29,824 --> 01:03:32,916
Something was moved in the boxes here.

744
01:03:33,702 --> 01:03:36,122
Or if there was some lid.

745
01:03:36,122 --> 01:03:39,201
It was like someone was turning on something.

746
01:03:42,909 --> 01:03:45,842
Are you doing that?

747
01:03:45,842 --> 01:03:50,385
So close a lid here.
 Unless you like us to get closer to the truth here ...

748
01:03:50,385 --> 01:03:52,864
That the family even usually shuts you down.

749
01:03:56,572 --> 01:03:59,128
It sounds like the car is popping popcorn.

750
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:00,956
It answers when you talk.

751
01:04:00,956 --> 01:04:05,120
Yes, it only gets more and more every time we mention it.

752
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:10,340
What is in there that makes them have to have the door even?

753
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,684
I haven't even thought of it.

754
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:19,348
No, I saw it now when I stand here thinking about what they have in there.
 That it's so ...

755
01:04:21,384 --> 01:04:23,420
I'm the voice.

756
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:25,157
Who are you?

757
01:04:25,157 --> 01:04:29,214
That is the voice, he hears the voice.
 Who says things to him.

758
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:30,750
Yes, but who is it?

759
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,689
Who are you?

760
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:38,360
Check.
 It just took vibrates, the bus.

761
01:04:41,656 --> 01:04:43,863
Guess, a little nonchalant answer.

762
01:04:43,863 --> 01:04:49,880
I think you are a dark energy that has been generated in this place, of something very, very negative.

763
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:55,722
I even think you told this man, going out in the barn and hanging you.

764
01:04:55,722 --> 01:04:56,983
Am I right there?

765
01:04:58,893 --> 01:05:00,634
And so it increases.

766
01:05:02,656 --> 01:05:05,290
It vibrates even more.

767
01:05:08,473 --> 01:05:12,918
And you try to behave as if you are a small child.

768
01:05:13,105 --> 01:05:15,120
So when the boy is to be able to talk to you ..

769
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:30,651
But we will tell those who live here, that the boy is talking to is no little girl.
 So he'll stop talking to you.

770
01:05:31,437 --> 01:05:34,569
It just lay down, the bus too.

771
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:40,263
Okay.
 If you are going to do something big and strong, so do it now.

772
01:05:40,975 --> 01:05:44,495
Because you are not the voice in this house any more.

773
01:05:49,588 --> 01:05:52,367
If you have such strength ...

774
01:05:52,367 --> 01:06:00,338
Then I will direct one thing out here.
 If you can manifest yourself without being afraid of me, come in here.

775
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:05,320
Go past this and get it to blink, then I know you are out in the hall and listen to everything I say right now.

776
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:13,502
So if something goes past this pyramid, also a prototype that we are testing right now, if something breaks this beam then you see ...

777
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:17,270
How it starts to light up.
 That there is something about density moving.

778
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:19,968
What are you?

779
01:06:24,312 --> 01:06:27,790
You have to tear us up as much as you want.

780
01:06:28,165 --> 01:06:32,184
But it will not affect what I will say to those who live here.

781
01:06:32,184 --> 01:06:35,264
Then it is just as good that you leave this place.

782
01:06:35,264 --> 01:06:38,589
Creeps back where you came from.

783
01:06:46,379 --> 01:06:48,599
Sick, it feels like someone pulled a finger ...

784
01:06:50,846 --> 01:06:54,227
It feels like someone pulled a finger in my neck.

785
01:06:57,486 --> 01:07:01,195
I'll see if there are high emf in here.

786
01:07:01,794 --> 01:07:03,715
I stand a little behind you Niclas.

787
01:07:08,621 --> 01:07:12,140
Even if you say such words, you don't scare me.

788
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,907
It takes a lot, much more than that.
 Now this one will come to you then.

789
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:21,329
Because I think you are hiding here, you dare not go out of this room.

790
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,946
Throw down the teddy bear there then.

791
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,678
Now Niclas is there, close him.

792
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:40,497
Did you hear?

793
01:07:40,497 --> 01:07:41,584
It increases.

794
01:07:42,895 --> 01:07:45,528
I won't run ..

795
01:07:49,723 --> 01:07:52,589
It sounded like it made a sound.

796
01:07:55,136 --> 01:07:56,408
Below here.

797
01:07:59,816 --> 01:08:01,867
1.3 ..

798
01:08:02,129 --> 01:08:03,688
05 ..

799
01:08:04,474 --> 01:08:06,972
Even higher.

800
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:15,129
Here is higher, exactly where the sound came.

801
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:17,096
05 down here.

802
01:08:20,879 --> 01:08:26,096
And this is also a theory within the paranormal, that the electromagnetic field rises ...

803
01:08:26,096 --> 01:08:33,821
when the energies, or the entity, want to do something.
 Or want to be manifested.

804
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,678
Is there anything more you want to do before we leave?

805
01:08:44,978 --> 01:08:49,517
Run upstairs, they have heard steps up there.

806
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,579
Tap in the walls.

807
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:57,209
Can you knock like this?

808
01:09:00,168 --> 01:09:09,536
Think like this, of everything that happens here, we are giving up something very, very good.
 We will tell the family that it is not a little girl.
 We have come to this.

809
01:09:09,536 --> 01:09:13,460
And I think the man we see here, he walks around and protects them.

810
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:14,836
That he stays on the outside ..

811
01:09:14,836 --> 01:09:22,880
He does not go here because there is something negative here.
 But it is, as I said, a hasp on the door, you understand that it is something they do not want to release from there.

812
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,610
It may be that this door is beating because something wants out of here.

813
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:28,596
It is an interesting theory.

814
01:09:28,596 --> 01:09:32,747
But we tell them.
 So they find out what we have come up with.

815
01:09:32,747 --> 01:09:34,113
Clearly.

816
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:51,189
Some investigations nothing happens.
 And at some hands everything.

817
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:59,340
The investigation in the north perhaps surprising us even more when we start to analyze the material than when we were there.

818
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:11,043
The family in the house early tells about their experiences and we can now say in retrospect that we have managed to document a lot of what the family experiences.

01:10:11,305 --> 01:10:22,424
Early in the investigation, we manage to get the energy that the family senses down at the shower.
 Which creates a shadow in our surveillance camera.

820
01:10:22,611 --> 01:10:33,784
There was something special in one of the children's bedrooms down at the kitchen, where Tony senses a static field that also our equipment gave rash for under the bed.

821
01:10:33,784 --> 01:10:44,797
Is this the dark energy that the son knows in his bedroom?
 Which also allows a bus that detects static fields from the bed.

822
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:54,399
Is the man Niclas saw the man who hung himself in the barn?
 And is it he who talks to the child in the bedroom?

823
01:10:54,736 --> 01:11:06,797
Perhaps the most interesting phenomenon that happens, which we have never been able to document before, is a poltergeist phenomenon.

824
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:25,760
The energy has so much power to be able to push the locks down on our equipment bags.
 Not just one, but twice.
 As well as moving the wiring upwards in bags.

825
01:11:34,052 --> 01:11:41,898
This means that in retrospect we are completely taken by what we have actually managed to document that night.

826
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:47,852
Our theory may be that the man who has hung himself in the barn is still left in and around the house.

827
01:11:47,852 --> 01:12:04,006
Our recommendation is that the family contacts a medium that ensures that the children in the family get it easy and that the energy that is still left should come to the place it belongs.
