00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,280
<font color = "#ffffff"> very tired very fast and then it would just be nice </font>

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,960
<font color = "#ffffff"> to be able to go into a room and just be able to breathe and hear </font>

4
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,119
<font color = "#ffffff"> self and think. </font>

5
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,119
<font color = "#ffffff"> Everything affects one in school. </font>

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,520
<font color = "#ffffff"> I at least much more sensitive at school for </font>

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
<font color = "#ffffff"> scents, light. </font>

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,679
<font color = "#ffffff"> How big a room is. </font>

00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,320
<font color = "#ffffff"> I don't like rooms that have high ceilings. </font>

10
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,079
<font color = "#ffffff"> I don't like too bright lights. </font>

11
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,039
<font color = "#ffffff"> i don't like different types of light. </font>

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,159
<font color = "#ffffff"> i don't like different scents. </font>

13
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,480
<font color = "#ffffff"> I'd rather all rooms look similar. </font>

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
<font color = "#ffffff"> i don't like when the benches are different in every room i go </font>

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,040
<font color = "#ffffff"> into because then are unsure where to sit. </font>

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,120
<font color = "#ffffff"> I want to be able to sit at the back of the classroom but still be able to see </font>

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,040
<font color = "#ffffff"> and hear the teacher. </font>

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,719
<font color = "#ffffff"> loud sounds in the classroom I think is, it can be </font>

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,680
<font color = "#ffffff"> very disturbing because i already have as well, </font>

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
<font color = "#ffffff"> concentration difficulties and so. </font>

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,680
<font color = "#ffffff"> and then also that you have a place you feel </font>

22
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,239
<font color = "#ffffff"> safe with. </font>

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,040
<font color = "#ffffff"> If you want to sit yourself, it should be possible to solve. </font>

24
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,120
<font color = "#ffffff"> and that you should not have to sit with someone you do not know </font>

25
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:45,680
<Font Color = "#ffffff"> Sig Safe with. </font>

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,239
<font color = "#ffffff"> Because I vis visual problems late, </font>

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,959
<font color = "#ffffff"> So all of life really. </font>

28
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,239
<font color = "#ffffff"> so I had to sit at the front of the classroom for me to </font>

29
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,079
<font color = "#ffffff"> be able to see the board. </font>

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,879
<Font Color = "#ffffff"> But this resulted in my ADHD wanted to check around </font>

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,239
<font color = "#ffffff"> in the classroom, check the rear and so on. </font>

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,359
<font color = "#ffffff"> and that noticed the teachers immediately. </font>

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,879
<font color = "#ffffff"> It was very strange light input and it was </font>

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,120
<font color = "#ffffff"> really not sound -adapted so that all the sound from the outside came in </font>

35
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,080
<font color = "#ffffff"> and you simply could not focus at all. </font>

36
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,439
<font color = "#ffffff"> at the municipal school I thought the dining room was, </font>

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
<font color = "#ffffff"> very bad. </font>

38
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,240
<font color = "#ffffff"> There were a lot of people, there was little space. </font>

39
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,319
<font color = "#ffffff"> There were people who always came and went and had lessons and. </font>

40
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,759
<font color = "#ffffff"> I was unsure where I could sit and, -e i </font>

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,520
<font color = "#ffffff"> strange if I sit alone even if I want to sit alone. </font>

42
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,840
<font color = "#ffffff"> and if so -who can I sit with? </font>

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
<font color = "#ffffff">-Where can I sit? </font>

44
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,560
<font color = "#ffffff"> and there are no written rules. </font>

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,639
<font color = "#ffffff"> the best thing for me would be that everything is </font>

46
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,919
<font color = "#ffffff"> the same every day. </font>

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
<font color = "#ffffff"> you don't have to have lots of variety and change things </font>

48
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,159
<font color = "#ffffff"> all the time and stuff like that, but it should be the same place </font>

49
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,439
<font color = "#ffffff"> and the same routines every day. </font>

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,639
<font color = "#ffffff"> It worked very well for me. </font>

51
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,159
<font color = "#ffffff"> When I went back to school, to plug, </font>

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,120
<font color = "#ffffff"> full time. </font>

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,840
<font color = "#ffffff"> or go back as a normal person. </font>

54
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:11,080
<font color = "#ffffff"> Then it was important to me, especially in the beginning, to have an </font>

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,000
<font color = "#ffffff"> place where I could really pull back and sit </font>

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,879
<font color = "#ffffff"> self and reload for the next lesson. </font>

57
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,039
<font color = "#ffffff"> A good time I remember it was in grade one. </font>

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,680
<font color = "#ffffff"> Then it was a classroom that had been built out in the school yard, </font>

59
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,360
<font color = "#ffffff"> for our class and then we had out pedagogy. </font>

60
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,719
<font color = "#ffffff"> and this helped me incredibly much. </font>

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,360
<font color = "#ffffff"> The educators they told my mom and dad that they noticed </font>

62
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,560
<font color = "#ffffff"> such an incredible difference in how I concentrated in the classroom </font>

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
<font color = "#ffffff"> and I concentrated outdoors. </font>

64
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,080
<font color = "#ffffff"> so what I feel I would still need </font>

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,000
<font color = "#ffffff"> off is to be allowed to sit maybe in a group room. </font>

66
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,360
<font color = "#ffffff"> and get discuss with friends about it when we are going to </font>

67
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,240
<font color = "#ffffff"> a sample or if there are any questions to answer. </font>

68
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
<font color = "#ffffff"> that you can sit in smaller groups and discuss. </font>

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,879
<font color = "#ffffff"> Then get my new school so it was very much </font>

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,199
<font color = "#ffffff"> sound insulation and you could not hear from the door and </font>

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,039
<font color = "#ffffff"> It was very good so you can't lose </font>

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,199
<font color = "#ffffff"> focus at all type. </font>

73
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,159
<font color = "#ffffff"> and it wasn't much window at all, was just on </font>

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,479
<font color = "#ffffff"> side and it was easy to turn from. </font>

75
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,400
<font color = "#ffffff"> and yes, everything works simply just well there. </font>
