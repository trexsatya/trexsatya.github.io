1
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:10,176
Yes I have worked a few years now before and have been thinking

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:14,336
Been a little craving for a while now on starting to read at university

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,060
And there is nothing that I have regretted that I made this decision

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,736
It's a mix of people reading here

5
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:22,007
A little mixed ages

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,951
I am definitely not the youngest but not the oldest either

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,771
Are there very different activities to do after study time

8
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:36,226
But you choose for yourself what you want to be part of what activities

9
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:40,294
I have always felt welcome to hang on the a little younger but

10
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,751
Sometimes it becomes that you prioritize the family instead and go home after the end of school

11
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,437
It is probably a little depending on what kind of course you read

12
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:58,880
Or education how much you are out at university or how much you have distance studies from home

13
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:04,512
For me reading to teachers so I try to get up at 8 in the morning

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,304
Get my kids off to school

15
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,608
Then I'm ready to get started

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,496
Sometimes there are some studies from home but often you sit out at the university

17
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
You meet some plug friends you sit and plug and maybe take a coffee it is mixed with lectures and seminars

18
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,824
But I put my studies

19
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:28,576
Between 8 and 5 in order to be able to get evenings and weekends free to devote myself to something else then

20
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
Yes when you start plugging it makes little difference with the economy

21
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,608
It may not be as much luxury holiday and spontaneous shopping anymore

22
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,878
But I think this is for a limited time

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
A difference is now also that when you have children and plugs

24
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,872
Should they get sick or you want to take vacation like that

25
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
The job is in as well as still left

26
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
To do

27
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,159
But then it's up to me if I want to sit in the evenings and weekends and do it

28
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:05,669
There is still some flexibility when I do my studies that did not exist when I was working

29
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,048
Yes but I had probably been thinking about doing something else

30
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:14,885
I was craving something new

31
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,240
But once I took hold of it and started examining a bit like that

32
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,760
On the one hand, it turned out that one could be study service leave

33
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,312
And there was little to think about with the economy

34
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:27,968
But you can get some extra contributions if you have children from CSN

35
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,186
And no,

36
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:32,877
It's just grab it and search
