00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
My name is Yadgar.
 I am 23 years old

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,632
And goes on the third year of civil engineering in computer technology.

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,728
Should you make a computer game and want to simulate reality,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,360
Is it very important that you understand the physics behind reality, so you can reflect it in the computer.

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:21,760
When I started, I had not coded a single line of code.
 Never programmed in my entire life.

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:27,136
Without just after a year, I would say that most are as competent as those who coded before.

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,256
It was a course.
 We would make a sea rescue weavers.

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,096
The hovercraft could get out on water, to a point.

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,960
Save someone or something and then get back to land again.

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
And it would be managed autonomously.

11
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,080
We just tell it which punk it is going to, so the hovercraft solves the rest himself.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,992
It was incredibly rewarding.
 I learned a lot of new practical knowledge.

13
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:58,368
There are, after all, Liu alums in every corner of the world,

14
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,000
Who works for companies like SpaceX, Google, Tesla, Apple, Microsoft.

15
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:09,888
I think this shows the confidence the business community has on the engineers who are trained here.

16
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,000
14 different master orientations!

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,032
I simply went on feeling and took what I thought was most interesting.

18
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
IT security.
 It's like an opponent you have.
 You should protect a network or company.

19
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,784
I find a big drive in it.

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,064
Only you have the interest, the rest takes care of the education!
