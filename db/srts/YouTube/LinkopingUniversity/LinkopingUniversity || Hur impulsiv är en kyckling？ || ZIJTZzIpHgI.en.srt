1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,222
Is it allowed to be a flour mask?

2
00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:05,805
Chickens are quickly learning new things

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,655
When there is a flour mask to get.

4
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:12,000
Why are some individuals more impulsive than others?

5
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:15,720
In this test, we want to investigate how impulsive chickens are.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,740
First we teach the chickens the concept stir.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,724
We use a reward, which is a flour mask.

8
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:26,144
We put the flour mask in the middle of the tube.

9
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:28,144
Then the pipe is presented on this joint.

10
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:33,063
The chicken learns that it must retrieve the flour mask from the side of the pipe.

11
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,096
When they can, we do the test ourselves.

12
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:37,855
Then it is a transparent tube instead.

13
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:41,314
Again we put the flour mask in the middle

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,556
What happens then is that the chicken intuitively and spontaneously

15
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:48,484
will want to pick on the tube for it sees the flour mask

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,712
But it must stop its impulsivity

17
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,313
And remember that it should take the reward from the side.

18
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,388
