00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,519
Hello Welcome to Beauty's list of the most and least worthwhile Swedish Christmas films.

2
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,199
Yes, finally it's time to dive into the treasure that we

3
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,359
Nevertheless, over the years has been accumulated as a Christmas -like movie podders.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,719
This was easy huh?
 Or?

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,399
To begin with, there are not so many films with strong connection to

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,880
Christmas and even fewer who want to put people in the Christmas mood.

7
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:43,399
The Christmas meal in Swedish Christmas films is, so to speak, absent.

8
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,560
Ah, here I recognize myself.
 As in absent parents, do you mean huh?

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,600
It does not light up directly 10,000 Christmas lights within

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,960
Swedish Christmas movie when it comes to mood anyway.

11
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,560
....come down

12
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,200
Damn idiot came down now!

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,600
800!

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,840
NEEEEY!
 Jump down from there!

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,040
For example, we can look at the perhaps clearest Swedish Christmas films.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,680
That is, they have either Christmas or the plot in the title.

17
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:45,040
Just like our favorite poem.
 Let me resite the first 7-8 verses.

18
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,359
Midwinter's cold is hard.
 The stars, sparkle and glimpse.

19
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,799
Everyone sleeps in solitary yard, deep during midnight.

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,680
The moon wanders its silent track, the snow shines white on pine and spruce.

21
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,680
The snow shines white on the roofs.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,840
Only the plot is awake.

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,159
Have I really taken it is right?
 This woman

24
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,080
Sara, who we will celebrate Christmas with, has three children with three different men.

25
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,120
You sometimes.
 She lives along with one

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,439
Fourth, some Janne who has no children of their own.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,039
And everyone will be there.
 But new wives.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,639
The plot is the father of all the children is about

29
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,240
A couple where the man has sterilized himself sneakily.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,319
It's called sterilized.
 But it is

31
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,960
quietly go on with yours.
 I will not disturb.

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,400
She has fertilized herself sneakily and now this will get some resolution on Christmas Eve.

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,599
It is not directly cozy on the couch with the family.

34
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,120
I've been worse.

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,240
Plus, if you are in a couple relationship you might be able to talk to each other.

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,240
Instead of trying to solve everything on December 24 as two fucking ...

37
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,919
Yes, two fucking ...

38
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,479
Santaus on speed.

39
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,000
Merry Christmas!

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,520
A wonderful fucking Christmas is really exactly the same movie.

41
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,360
Although now the main characters are gay instead and have a surrogate mother.

42
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,639
Otherwise it's still about a family

43
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,000
where relatives and friends still can't handle

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,919
To tell people they love what they actually want to do with their lives.

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,960
You don't get super cozy.
 Not very.
 Most a little anxiety.

46
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,120
I look really nice that guys ... but mom I have to thank us now.

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,759
No but baby what is it?

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,159
I'm leaving here now.
 No, it might be best that I go instead.

49
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,240
But wait now.
 Why should everyone go all of a sudden?

50
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,280
No one should go because we have found out what it is that has happened.

51
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,960
Yep, two real bottom app.
 But it feels like this was the two like you ...

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,639
Although the worst is probably that I will come home again for Christmas.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,759
Which not only has the same title as the popular Christmas song.

54
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,120
Without Peter Jöback who sings the song also plays the lead role.

55
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,439
Here you think it will be a high level Christmas.

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,959
Peter Jöback finally returns home to Christmas as he sings.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,439
But no, instead it will be cancer and choir leader who exploit boys sexually.

58
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,560
Yes, Christmas.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,279
Traditions.

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,240
You are not filled directly by Christmas afterwards.

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,959
They do not want us to talk about things as hard.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,319
It's a bit of a Christmas tradition here.
 It might be time for someone to break it now.

63
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,680
But instead of being huge bummers like that

64
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Can we actually watch some movies like ...

65
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,959
When it is as dark actually spreads some kind of Christmas atmosphere.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,879
If it is only based on nostalgia or that the movie takes place during Christmas,

67
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,000
I leave that unsaid.

68
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,519
Yes, but that is still the thing about Christmas.

69
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,959
We jerk crack nostalgically.

70
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,519
We look at Kalle nostalgic.

71
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,240
And we hold up the hair on a far too refreshed grandmother

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,839
When she is screaming out of her homemade strong beer.

73
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,800
Nostalgic.

74
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,240
Rest in peace grandmother.

75
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,160
Anyway.

76
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,800
Here are the movies you should see instead.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
To begin with apparent.

78
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,879
Love apparently.

79
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:27,439
Or...

80
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,240
Damn, I don't remember what it is about even.

81
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,040
But it should be good huh?

82
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,240
Apparently takes place on a train to Berlin on December 23-24

83
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,399
Directly after the Second World War.

84
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,279
And it might not be that the Christmas mood is directly hanging in the air.

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,439
But apparently an unexpectedly high body count hears once the trip is over.

86
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,839
And it's not just a person who falls off the train before it arrives.

87
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,680
Peter Dalle has also unexpectedly given a lot of slapstick

88
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,439
And ram-on-end-time for Robert Gustafsson.

89
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,079
And almost nothing for Gösta Ekman.

90
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,399
But Gösta Ekman can at least jump on some seats in the coupe trolley.

91
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,399
And that's actually always something.

92
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,160
Yes, I remember once when I jumped

93
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,399
Break a bed that Pernilla Wiberg took in took gold.

94
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,600
So, yes, there is always something.

95
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,199
And last but not least has Peter Dalles

96
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,720
Train conductor surprisingly many one-liners.

97
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,519
Too bad you don't hear what he says.

98
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,120
Doesn't he see the text that is being prosecuted?

99
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,199
It must be how much fucking Christmas it wants.

100
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,079
But this will be the report on.

101
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,240
If you don't have much, very good explanation now.

102
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,839
I saw the plot.

103
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,040
Kiss, mom, me ...

104
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,240
Okay, but you, there is a movie series that has succeeded.

105
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,959
No matter how stolen Sigge Eklund claims it is.

106
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:52,879
Right?

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,120
Yes, unfortunately, a small problem has arisen due to overbooking.

108
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,959
I wonder about Olsson Stig-Helmer.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,079
It is you.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,920
And Dramsrud, Ole.

111
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,439
Yes.

112
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,319
Can you share rooms?

113
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,839
Yes.

114
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,319
Okay.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,439
Actually, I think the Sällskapsresan is

116
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,800
The only real Christmas movie on this list.

117
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,560
Christmas gift distribution.

118
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,279
And by that I mean that it actually to

119
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,560
Most of them take place during Christmas leave.

120
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,959
And those who are on the trip seem to care a little about it being Christmas.

121
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:44,879
Talk about unreal.

122
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,240
Although the pig party and Peppes Bodega are of course more important.

123
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,720
Sexier you get to look for.

124
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
Sure, it's a bit creepy that Stig-Helmer

125
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,079
Love interests are always as old throughout the film series.

126
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,839
Yes, just like my dad's.

127
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,000
iochmed that this is the first and second best

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,839
The movie in the series is easier to have indulgence with.

129
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,240
Overall just the top Christmas atmosphere.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,920
Hello.

131
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,240
I found Peppes Bodega.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
It was like hell.

133
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,319
Where is a thunderstorm?

134
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,519
We buy some shit for the Christmas party

135
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,879
Yes, but was somewhere?
 Here!

136
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:28,920
Here?

137
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,959
I am at the back of the hotels.

138
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,759
And we who have been looking through the whole damn Nueva Stockholmo

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,039
In zero tolerance, we see Johan Falck to take his first stacking steps as a superpolis.

140
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,399
And above all their first stacking.

141
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:50,919
Release the weapon!

142
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,799
Release the weapon!
 For the fuck!

143
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,840
It's probably quite easy to forget that this is a Christmas movie,

144
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,960
Iochmed that more part of the film takes place after Christmas and it is kind of thaw all the time.

145
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,440
Well, so as a divorce child is type

146
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,879
Christmas ongoing until mid -January.

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
So it feels reasonable.

148
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,159
But they are pushing help the plot in the introduction

149
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,080
And it must still be counted as something really Christmas.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,159
Dad!

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Dad!

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,440
Mio My Mio is probably not the Astrid Lindgren filmization

153
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,519
Which has the most Christmas and snow in itself.

154
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,200
Why do you and I never talk about Kajsa Kavat anymore Anders?

155
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,279
But that is the other side the strangest and with the worst dubbing.

156
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,759
And if you want to see both Christopher Lee and

157
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,600
Christian Bale in really bad dubbing.

158
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,279
There are few movies that deliver such a good result!

159
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,799
You have defeated me, Prince Mio.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,200
Strike.

161
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,720
End up on me with a chop.

162
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,879
I have known for a long time that this moment would come

163
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,960
But remember Prince Mio

164
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,080
Even if you kill me, evil cannot be destroyed.

165
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:05,440
Another Kato comes and one more and what can you do about it?

166
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,200
Nothing.

167
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,159
Let me live ...

168
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,159
Oh no!
 I came here to kill you and I will.

169
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,519
And even if you kill me, another prince comes.

170
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,080
And one more and one more.

171
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,440
Then you have to die.

172
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:28,279
It's not a movie you want to see for yourself, but after a good mulled wine and some gingerbread

173
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,080
is it hard to say no to a movie that is so

174
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,440
Strange that it's an adventure to just see it.

175
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,399
Plus, the title track will root out

176
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,279
Last Christmas from the brain in a really good way.

177
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:29,759
Okay, there we have it.
 All our snow -covered Christmas balls.
 Good work!

178
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,480
And that is actually the case that there is one

179
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,440
Doubtful episode about all the movies we have raised here.

180
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,559
Yes, except those we actually remember for the right reason.

181
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,159
But with that said, I think we take and

182
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,320
Ending this.
 Because we must be lucky with Christmas anyway?

183
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,679
Yes, it will be good.
 And to make it a little

184
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,799
Better for us so listen to the latest episode of doubtful!

185
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,879
There are on, where all pods are located, and Spotify.

186
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,000
And I just got everything I wanted with a Christmas present.

187
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,600
And I looked at the whole of Karl Bertil and no one bothered me.

188
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,519
And then I got a little too full and fell asleep at 11 o'clock.
