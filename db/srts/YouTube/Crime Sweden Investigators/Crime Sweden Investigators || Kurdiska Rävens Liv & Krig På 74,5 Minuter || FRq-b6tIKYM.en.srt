1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,970
Imagine that you are a very close business partner to someone.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,939
You make a lot of money together.

3
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:12,911
What would they have to do to you to make you so upset that you get rid of their mom?

4
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:16,080
Let's find out the answer now.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,620
How do the children of refugee parents go to eventually reside in a small dark, cold and Nordic country from being a boy,

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:41,133
to grow up over 30 years later, to a man who finds himself in the midst of cross -border politics and diplomacy, the most wanted and ruthless criminal and leader for a dreaded gang that causes devastation over several continents.

7
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:52,108
Bosnia, Tunisia, Turkey, Norway, Iraq, Sweden, Iran all over the world has been the game plan.

8
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:59,448
This is the story of the Kurdish fox and foxtrot.
 And where is he now?

9
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:28,904
When the Foxtrot network, once a united crime syndicate, was divided, one of the most violent periods in the history of organized crime was triggered.
 The now divided Foxtrot network has broken up in two hostile phalanges, with ten central targets that are of the highest priority for each gang.

10
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:40,880
In the heart of this bloody conflict stands two men: Rawa Majid the Kurdish fox and Ismail Abdo, the strawberry.

11
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,853
They, along with their followers, have transformed their previous ties of friendship into a battle on life and death.

12
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:53,824
Ask yourself, could you kill your mother to your worst enemy?

13
00:01:53,824 --> 00:02:05,967
Benzema has previously been painted to be the right hand of the Kurdish fox in the Foxtrot network, now it seems that the wind has turned anyway if you look at the surface.

14
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:10,523
Has Benzema distanced themselves from Kurdish fox and foxtrot and made peace with the strawberry?

15
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:14,007
All these questions you will get the answer to!

16
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:22,811
drug smuggling, kidnappings, murder, abuse, bombing, shootings and false deaths.

17
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:25,516
This tragic story has everything.

18
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:34,356
We know how the wave of violence started a conflict with the valley gang about, among other things, the city of Sundsvall and the region's drug market.

19
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:52,070
Especially a man has a strong hand in what is happening in Sweden in 2023, which makes him one of the most sought -after men in Sweden.

20
00:02:52,070 --> 00:03:05,181
This is the story of Rawa Majid, 37 years old, better known as the Kurdish fox, the leader of the Foxtrot network.

21
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:25,897
Rawa Majid is of Kurdish origin and was born on July 12, 1986 in Iran.
 His parents fled when Iran- and Iraq feud became instensive.
 Just a few months old, Rawa came with his family to Uppsala

22
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:41,376
Uppsala is a smaller city about 70 km from Stockholm, Sweden's capital.
 Rawa did well in school as a kid.
 After finishing school and turning 18, he opened his own small companies in Uppsala.

23
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:58,156
However, his career in crime did not start far behind.
 In 2010, he was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for several drug offenses.
 This included the management of cocaine which he imported from the Netherlands.

24
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:15,703
In February 2015, he received conditional release prematurely.
 He owned a glass kiosk in Uppsala which he later used for money laundering.
 However, the freedom of the Kurdish fox was short -lived.
 Just months after the release, he broke his guardianship and was once again imprisoned.

25
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:20,640
In 2018 he was released again and forbidden to leave Sweden.

26
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:35,118
One of the cousins of the Kurdish fox, shad, was the leader of the headshot league or HSL.
 Shad was shot dead in his car in Barkarby on June 5, 2018.

27
00:04:35,118 --> 00:04:52,466
A double murder occurred in Kista 2017 when the leader of the gang Lejonen was shot dead in his car with another young man on March 8.

28
00:04:52,466 --> 00:05:12,215
Shad's brother, Kurdish fox's cousin, Lanko was convicted of the double murder.
 After Shad's death, it was even speculated within the family that the Kurdish fox was somehow involved in the murder of his own cousin Shad.

29
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:20,154
For some reason, threats directed at him, the Kurdish fox was granted permission to leave Sweden.

30
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:30,129
He was allowed to travel to his parents' country of birth, Iraq, and eventually registered in his mother's birthplace, a city in the eastern part of Kurdistan in Iraq.

31
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,635
Kurdish fox continued where he quit and started smuggling and selling drugs again.

32
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:53,414
It was not until 2020 that he had appeared on the radar as a large drug smuggler in Sweden.
 After the police managed to hack into the encrypted chat the services he used, he became a wanted man.

33
00:05:53,414 --> 00:06:02,321
Sweden one of Europe's richest nations and was previously one of Europe's most peaceful nations.

34
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:15,164
More recently, Sweden has fallen into an unprecedented wave of violence.
 Throughout 2022, 391 shootings were registered and in 2023 no different.

35
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:29,576
Only during September 2023, eleven people became victims of death.
 These gangs recruit young boys in their teens, some as young as 13 years old to perform assignments.

36
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:35,280
Rawa Majid is better known as the Kurdish fox, leader of the Foxtrot network.

37
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:44,254
The central and important members could at least early be identified by their golden fox rings and chains they carry.

38
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:53,828
The Foxtrot gang focused mainly on taking in large broadcasts of different drugs to Sweden and then selling them on to other gangs.

39
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:59,533
They are now also notorious because they do not pull out to use brutal violence.

40
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:15,312
At least since 2020, Kurdish fox had total control over the Foxtrot gang and its operations.
 In November 2021, the Swedish police and Iraqi police started an operation and struck against the house in which the Kurdish fox was in.

41
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:21,417
Unfortunately for them he had been advised and the fox was gone.

42
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:40,932
The Kurdish fox seems to have political connections and contacts in this area of Iraq, they operate at this time in any case to change services to gene services.
 In March 2022 he is moved to Turkey under a false name and by buying expensive properties where he manages to become Turkish citizens.

43
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:48,705
His name then slowly but surely begins to emerge more and more in Swedish media.

44
00:07:48,705 --> 00:08:05,185
After two major transport drugs were seized by the Swedish police on February 11 and 14, a conflict started between Kurdish fox, his fox -trot network and Bandidos MC in Sweden about who would take the loss for these lost drug deliveries.

45
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:19,696
Within two weeks after the lost and seized transport of drugs, Bandido's MC clubhouse in Brandbergen south of Stockholm with an automatic weapon is shot.

46
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:33,941
On March 4, 2022, an innocent hairdresser was shot dead in his car outside the same clubhouse after the shooters had faulty identified him as a Bandido member.

47
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:38,244
Among other things, members of the Zero network were convicted of this murder.

48
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:46,551
Two weeks after this murder, the Kurdish fox ordered its subjects to get ready for new actions against Bandidos MC

49
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:56,659
March 28, 2022 you can see a young man go into a gym in the middle of Stockholm city and then run down the stairs to the gym's basement floor.

50
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:13,606
His mission is to shoot a certain Bandidos member who is training at this gym.
 On the way to doing so, another man tried inside the gym, Fredrik, a completely innocent man who was familiar with Bandido's member, step in and stop the young boy.

51
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:21,112
Several shots are then fired inside the gym.
 On surveillance images you can see visitors run up the stairs in total panic.

52
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:27,083
You can also see the intended target, Bandido's member, leased out of the gym.

53
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:35,056
The shooter also ran up the stairs again and even tried to escape through the wrong door before someone guided him in the right direction.

54
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:47,666
Fredrik who tried to help died from his injuries to the hospital a few days later.
 The hired killer turns out to be only 16 years old when he did.

55
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:59,609
Rapper 5iftyy, who belongs to the Bro network that is allied with Kurdish fox and Foxtrot is seen in a music video wearing a t-shirt where it says, among other things, "Free Frunze" which was the 16-year-old killer.

56
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:17,623
In April 2022, a gardener in a park in the Turkish city of Marmaris found a bag that someone left behind.
 The bag contained bundles of cash and was handed over to the police.

57
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:23,528
The police counted several currencies with over $ 12,000 in total value inside the bag.

58
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:37,239
After checking the security cameras near the park, the police managed to identify a man named Miran Otoman.
 They invited the miran to the police station to pick up the bag.

59
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:48,414
He introduced himself as a shipping magnate, but the police decided to drive his ID through all his databases and discovered that this was an internationally wanted man

60
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:58,389
Interpol had a red note for him.
 The man in front of them was the wanted Kurdish fox.

61
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:10,865
The Turkish police arrested him at the same time as they hit his villa where they found unlicensed weapons, large sums of cash and luxury articles such as designer clothes, watches, etc.

62
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:20,573
But this was not the end of the Kurdish fox.
 He had bought Turkish citizenship for about $ 400,000 in 2020.

63
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:35,018
Turkey has become a sanctuary for criminals because they can buy citizenship by investing in real estate in the country.
 Although Sweden, together with Interpol, has requested extradition from him, Turkish authorities have refused to do so.

64
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:47,461
After this, Swedish police shared a comprehensive police report on Kurdish Fox and his Foxtrot network in order to help Turkish intelligence service to prosecute him.

65
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:59,404
Information about where the suspects were, pictures of them and what they are accused of and more evidence.
 The report was very confidential and only had to be read by some police officials.

66
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:15,917
The document leaked, the Kurdish fox gained access to the report it turned out when later in 2022 a gang member was arrested in Sweden and on his iPhone the very confidential report they had made to help Turkey.

67
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:21,121
But the worst would still come.

68
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:27,092
Towards the end of 2022, a conflict began between Foxtrot and Dalen network.

69
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:39,702
Michael Alias Greek is a 25-year-old man who, despite his low age, is said to have managed to become a leading figure in the Dalen Network, he is said to live abroad for his own safety.

70
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:50,678
The police describe the valley as a criminal network that has its origins and operates in Enskededalen, but also in Skarpnäck and other areas in Stockholm.

71
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:56,649
They also have branches in other parts of the country, including Sundsvall and Gotland.

72
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:02,554
They engage in drug trafficking, violent crimes, weapons offenses, blackmail etc.

73
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:11,794
The fact that they are active actors in violent conflicts is also a well -known fact through, among other things, investigations and intelligence.

74
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:21,736
The fact that members often carry bulletproof vests, even with heavy plates to cope with strong ammunition, is also a clear indication that they are in violent conflict with other criminals.

75
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:30,709
The police's view was that Mario Golzar, aka Super Mario, until recently was the leader of the Dalen Network and their various areas.

76
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:41,685
He must have provided the areas and networks with large amounts of drugs.
 However, Michael, the alias Greek, has probably largely taken over his role as a leadership figure,

77
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:51,493
Among other things, for Super Mario being detained when he was convicted of drug smuggling and also for his involvement in the kidnapping and extortion of the famous rapper Einár before his death.

78
00:13:56,497 --> 00:14:05,737
Rapper Thrife is described as a senior member of the Dalen Network and he is considered to be just below the Greek in the hierarchy.

79
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:09,707
He is often seen with the rest of the older core members of the gang.

80
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:15,979
Another known Swedish rapper, Haval, is also considered by the police to be a high -ranking member of the Dalen Network.

81
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:26,420
Haval has already served several prison sentences, the last time for his involvement in the kidnapping of the now deceased rapper Einár.

82
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:34,393
We know how the wave of violence started, a conflict with the valley gang about, among other things, the city of Sundsvall and the region's drug market.

83
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:45,969
In the middle stands KP, a 21-year-old man who has been identified as the key person and the extended arm for Kurdish fox and foxtrot in the area regarding the conflict in Sundsvall with the Dalen Network.

84
00:14:48,971 --> 00:15:00,881
KP has initially been part of the local Dalen network grouping in Sundsvall.
 Then after a quarrel with his old friends and the valley, he changed teams and went over to the opponent side Kurdish fox and Foxtrot.

85
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:15,859
When KP, which became central to the great prosecution in 2023, felt badly treated by its buddies, the seed was sown to what is now being played out during one of the country's largest gang trials so far.

86
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:26,935
KP is suspected to have coordinated several murder attempts through shootings and blasts, all in order to extend Foxtrot's control over Northern Sweden's drug markets.

87
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:32,773
“He goes nowhere.
 Inshallah.
 Tomorrow he is already in the mouth of the crocodile. "
 A message sent by KP.

88
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:45,016
The recipient of this message was a person who was hired to spy on an intended murder victim and who mapped his habits and then reported this back to KP.

89
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:49,219
It starts with some chat messages in November 2022.

90
00:15:49,219 --> 00:16:04,031
The conversation starts with KP feeling badly treated by his old friends in the valley gang.
 This is KP's version of the events, and he also hints at accusations that his old friends were trying to "go" him, he deceives into a death trap.

91
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:12,337
He writes to a key person in the Dalen gang, you will get war now.
 I'll fuck you.
 And you will see.

92
00:16:12,337 --> 00:16:22,979
On December 2, 2022, there is a gunfire in Sundsvall.
 The recipient of the messages is shot together with two friends.
 He meets with several bullets, but survives.

93
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:30,952
KP is thus believed to have taken deadly measures against his old friends and now he belongs to Foxtrot's gang constellation.

94
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:43,929
This is confirmed by the fact that he himself tells about Foxtrot's goals on Snapchat to become the largest drug sounds and suppliers in northern Sweden and to wipe out competition.

95
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:53,870
But what both parties think they say to each other in secret, encrypted messages online is in reality under the supervision of the police, step by step.

96
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:13,853
When 19-year-old Yosef Key was a very close friend with the gangster rapper and superstar Einár at his death.
 Einár had only the month before turned 19 when he was betrayed, chased and shot out outside his apartment in Hammarbysjöstad in Stockholm.

97
00:17:16,855 --> 00:17:31,834
In addition to Yosef after the murder of Einár still seems to have a close relationship with Einár half brother, Einár's name or nickname Nisse is mentioned several times in the criminal investigation of Yosef or by others involved in the murder plans against rapper Thrife, a member of Dalen Network.

98
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:42,709
Has this murder assignment something to do with the murder of Einár.
 Is it revenge or is it linked to something completely different?
 Or both and?

99
00:17:46,712 --> 00:18:01,290
On December 13, 2022, after being guarded for several weeks, Yosef was observed under the supervision of the police.
 Yosef acted nervously, jogged a few stretches and looked around a lot.
 Yosef bent down and put something next to a pair of pots outside the gate.

100
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:16,236
Yosef was then stopped and checked on the same street.
 He was arrested when the police found out that he had hidden a weapon, a loaded glock outside the gate.
 Joseph's phone was confiscated and very interesting things were later found there.

101
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:24,809
Through external and internal scouting, Joseph can be linked to several addresses.

102
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:36,785
House searches are therefore done in several places.
 Police find ammunition and drugs in an apartment in the basement and storage room, the police find several kilos of amphetamine, hash, etc.

103
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:50,263
They were seized in connection with the completion of the house search.
 Gazmend and another man came walking towards the building.
 They were checked by police personnel and taken in for questioning.

104
00:18:50,263 --> 00:19:03,006
Gazmend is the same man has its name on a long enemy and death list created by the valley network.
 Seven months later, Gazmend was shot dead on a balcony in Ulvsunda on July 10, 2023.

105
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:14,548
Yosef Key is also included on this death list.
 It seems that Yosef Key had a close relationship with the now murdered Gazmend and Einar half brother.

106
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:33,030
After being arrested since mid -December 2022, there are several interesting chats that affect the then major gang conflict in Stockholm with users Ghost Worldwide, Animal Shopping and El Zorro, of which an alias belongs to the Kurdish fox.

107
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:50,010
According to the Investigation Protocol, Yosef is in a group chat called Team Nisse, aka Team Einár on the encrypted network Signal.
 The following content consists of, among other things, planning and preparation regarding a murder of rapper Thrife.

108
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:59,751
The chat material shows that several attempts are made to locate where Thrife lives or is located.
 They try to gather a murder command of at least three men to perform this murder.

109
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:18,733
The sender A person with the username Ghost Worldwide in the encrypted chat app Signal is then said to be a high-ranking man within the Foxtrot organization, is at the forefront to instruct Yosef how to plan the Thrife murder in the chat material.

110
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:34,145
It is also evident from Ghost Worldwide that a "Yappling" or murder must take place because an unknown rapper is said to have said it very disrespectful things about Einár in a Tiktok video, both Ghost Worldwide and Yosef Key wonder who this rapper is.

111
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:48,656
User Ghost Worldwide writes that the Kurdish fox is basically Upplands bridge or the bronze network, and that they were very close friends for now murdered Einár.

112
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:59,432
Yosef was convicted of the crimes and sentenced to seven years and ten months in prison for his involvement in the conspiracy to murder the gang rapper Thrife.

113
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:14,443
Now we go back to KP and Sundsvall, the origin of the extremely brutal conflict between the valley and the Foxtrot network.
 The feud comes from a battle for control of the drug market in certain cities and regions.

114
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:25,419
Sundsvall had long been supplied with the Dalen network.
 Then Foxtrot tried to enter the market, which led to this conflict began.

115
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:29,389
The Dalen Network was not going to reverse.

116
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:42,299
Police investigators have been able to follow what is happening in real time through data monitoring, while the different pages are starting to plan and map how to kill their enemies.
 A total of ten murders are believed to have been planned and to their aid, 21-year-old KP had their own death list.

117
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:55,443
According to information, he had not been at the address for a long time and was assumed to be abroad.
 He has several ongoing conflicts.
 One hypothesis was that he was involved in the murder of Einár.

118
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:59,412
"I stand with scar, brother it sounds *bang *"

119
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:17,994
They were childhood friends, but ended up on each side of a conflict.
 The gang member and rapper Dumlee was shot dead on December 25, 2022 in Rinkeby, Dumlee was with Einár when he was shot dead in October 2021 and was formally suspected of being involved in the murder.

120
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:27,868
So one theory was that now even Scar, 23 years old, is subjected to reprisals due to Einár.

121
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:34,340
Scar is described by the police as a person with great violence.

122
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:49,852
From the beginning he was considered to be a running boy for the valley network, but he was soon responsible for the security at major meetings and as the one who was armed at these, also that he worked as the Dalen network responsible for handling and moving the gang weapons.

123
00:22:49,852 --> 00:23:01,328
Soon it was clear that he began to act as a steper or perpetrator in violent crimes, which he seems to think is satisfactory.
 He sees himself as a "Sicario" assassin.

124
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:10,235
Scar has also acted as a bodyguard for the Greek, Michael, the leader of the Dalen Network, both in Sweden, but also when they went abroad.

125
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:24,747
Scar must have performed violence, shootings and murder on behalf of its Dalen Network, but also performed assignments for payment and gene services for other networks allies with the valley, for example 23st from Farsta.

126
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:33,320
The overall assessment of the police authority is that SCAR is part of a criminal network, the valley for organized crime.

127
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:39,825
Scar is suspected of being a target for attacks during the conflict with the Kurdish fox and fox trot.

128
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:51,835
A hand grenade is thrown into the doorway where Scar and his family are written.
 In addition, SCAR is also suspected of being an active actor in violence against Foxtrot and their allies.

129
00:23:51,835 --> 00:24:00,942
After the attack on Scar and others in the gang, the conflict between the valley and the Kurdish fox is a fact.
 Several shootings and blasts aimed at housing in Stockholm are taking place.

130
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:11,951
During the early morning hours New Year's Eve 2022, an apartment building address linked to rapper Haval, a member of the Dalen Network, gets his gate blasted by a bomb.

131
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:24,594
The Dalen Network then starts planning revenge actions against the opposite side.
 They recruit steps and torpedoes from all over Sweden who must carry out various revenge documents on behalf of their behalf.

132
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:32,903
Here are some of the events that the police believe that the Dalen network is behind.

133
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:50,915
The police have, among other things, compared names and addresses of those who have been exposed to violations of a so -called "death list" which they found on a arrested gang member's mobile phone.
 There are names and addresses of people that the Dalen Network at that time considered to be on the opposing side and are their enemies.

134
00:24:52,917 --> 00:25:01,423
January 2, 2023. Early in the morning, an explosion occurred in Bagarmossen in southern Stockholm.
 Someone threw a hand grenade into a stairwell to a multi -family house with split injuries as a result.

135
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:11,832
Previously mentioned Yosef Key linked to the Foxtrot network and his brothers are written at the address.

136
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:19,304
Yosef Key is on the Dalennäverket's list of enemies when he was convicted of murder plans on the Dalen Network's rapper Thrife.

137
00:25:19,304 --> 00:25:33,015
An 18-year-old rapper from the capital in northern Stockholm who was signed to a record label controlled by the Dalen Network is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison for throwing the hand grenade.

138
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:42,789
January 5, 2023. A hand grenade is thrown into the stairwell to the address of the apartment building in Farsta, south of Stockholm.
 There is a person on the death list.

139
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,759
The conflict between the valley and the Foxtrot escalates considerably.

140
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:59,202
On January 12, 2023, just after 04:00 in the morning, a door and the facade of a multi -family house in northern Stockholm will be sprayed with bullets.
 It is an attack on the Greek and address he is linked to.

141
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:10,178
January 14.
 On Saturday morning, bullet holes were discovered in an apartment door in Märsta.
 Another attack on the Greek.

142
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:20,586
January 16.
 At 19:38.
 A shooting takes place in northern Stockholm in Hagalund at the NBA gang's home ground.

143
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:32,562
A then 21-year-old rapper was found at the site lying with gunshot injuries, enlight information is shot the victim from behind.
 He was shot with several shots and taken to hospital with serious injuries.

144
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:47,007
Now 22-year-old rapper Lee Blockboy, who then belonged to the NBA gang from Hagalund, is shot with several shots and is seriously injured, but survives the attempted murder.
 The rapper's name was included on the death list.

145
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:58,249
According to information, this took place because of an internal division within the NBA gang where they took different pages in the Foxtrot and Dalen gang conflict.

146
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:09,058
January 17.
 On Tuesday morning, a restaurant at Södermalm in Stockholm was injured by a strong explosion from an explosive charge.
 The restaurant is linked to relatives of the Greek.

147
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:22,902
January 18.
 A new bomb is placed and an explosion occurs the day after, on Wednesday morning, this time at a company property in Kista in northwestern Stockholm.
 This attack is also aimed at the Greek.

148
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:35,812
Early in the morning of January 18, the Greek himself goes into a discussion with KP.
 First, he tries to persuade KP not to drive with the Kurdish fox.

149
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:43,418
"Do you think the fox cares about your family?"
 he asks in the chat conversation.
 "This is about going with the fox against me."

150
00:27:43,418 --> 00:27:46,338
"You get into something that won't end well."

151
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:57,329
KP answers this message by writing, “We will go to war with you on the street.
 But since we can't find you because you hide, we have to attract your horns. "

152
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:12,274
“This makes the Greek cursed.
 The Greek writes back that KP will soon cry blood and that even relatives and family are in danger due to KP's choice.
 "The fox has only 15 year olds."

153
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:19,113
"I have snipers, real killers."
 “You will be chased for the rest of your life.
 You are dead."

154
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:36,594
Shortly thereafter, the police may follow how KP is suspected to have planned a murder of a member of the valley.
 The 21-year-old and the Foxtrot gang rely on using and hiring freelancers, mainly very young men and teenagers from other parts of the country, to help them with violent attacks.

155
00:28:36,594 --> 00:28:44,233
Against payment, three so -called steps travel, people who perform the death, from different parts of Sweden up to Sundsvall

156
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:59,545
They are commissioned to detonate a bomb outside the home where the goal from the local Dalen network lives.
 Three other young men, "shooters" also travel from different cities up to Sundsvall

157
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:04,516
They have been commissioned to carry out a murder of another member of the Dalen gang and they have a glock with them.

158
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:19,428
Finally, two bomb experts from the Stockholm area travel up to Sundsvall who have previously helped them to provide the Foxtrot network with explosives.
 "Explod his entire whore balcony," writes the alias Hamado from the Foxtrot network.

159
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:32,305
During the planning, they will agree within Foxtrot that the kids will perform the act.
 It seems obvious in the investigation that it is a stated strategy to use minors as soldiers.

160
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:44,814
They are either attracted by money, status is deceived or threatened to take on these assignments, while some young people actively seek freelance assignments, they want to do this.

161
00:29:46,816 --> 00:29:59,826
KP is very clear that you cannot reverse once you have said yes to an assignment.
 When it appears that the girlfriend of one of the intended victims can be in the home to be attacked, the perpetrators receive the following order from KP.

162
00:29:59,826 --> 00:30:03,882
"Kill her too if you have to."

163
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:05,898
"It's not a problem."

164
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:13,771
21-year-old Wafi is a local rapper in Sundsvall and also a high-ranking member of the local dalen network Falangen in the city.

165
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:28,349
At one point, KP is trying to use an older woman to attract his former friend Wafi so that he can be shot to death.
 But KP will no longer than plan for January 26, everything changes.

166
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:38,857
Until then, the police have followed every step in the planning and hours before the attacks, the police strike a number of homes and properties in Sundsvall.

167
00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:47,831
The police find thermos bombs, automatic weapons and guns.
 Several of the now over 20 charged were arrested there.

168
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:59,040
KP himself denied all charges and claims that the cell phone and chats linked to him and which of the police's greatest evidence against him is not his.

169
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:10,015
In books he has borrowed, notes have also been found where there is no comment all the way, seemingly as a call to other detainees not to answer the police questions.

170
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:20,857
January 19, 2023. Three incidents take place during the same day.
 Several shots are fired at an apartment in Farsta in southern Stockholm.

171
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:33,901
Several shots are also fired at an apartment door in Husby in northern Stockholm.
 On the death list is the address in Husby as "Foxy father" aka the Kurdish fox's father.

172
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:44,776
A shooting at a house also takes place in a smaller, exclusive neighborhood outside Uppsala.
 The target in the house is on the death list with address and name.

173
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:58,620
This is the same home and area where a completely innocent 24-year-old female student dies when the address is exposed to a bomb attack and several nearby houses are destroyed in September 2023.

174
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:05,726
On the evening of March 2, the television program broadcasts wanted.
 Two young men are wanted for crime.

175
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:16,935
They are suspected of performing the shooting on January 19, the Driveby attack directed at relatives of the Kurdish fox.
 The home is shot from a car with automatic weapons.

176
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:27,043
The television program publishes the names and pictures of the suspects.
 3-4 hours later it knocks on the door of a house in Tullinge, south of Stockholm.

177
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:39,653
A man in his fifties, the father of one of the sought after young men, lives there with his family.
 He opens the door and is immediately shot several times.
 A moment later he is dead.

178
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:49,194
Serdar, the victim, is believed to have been killed solely because he was the father of the 25-year-old man who, according to police, shot at the relatives of the Kurdish fox.

179
00:32:49,194 --> 00:32:52,230
A rapid and brutal revenge withdrawn by the Kurdish fox.

180
00:32:52,230 --> 00:33:03,072
January 2023, a hand grenade is thrown into the stairwell to apartments in Skarpnäck in southern Stockholm.
 They can also be found on the death list with the specified apartment number.

181
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:12,712
During the first 26 days of 2023, there had already been at least 13 bombings and a gunfire every day.

182
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:18,984
Explosions, gunfire, murder and other excessive violence.

183
00:33:18,984 --> 00:33:27,103
Over the past year, Swedish news has been dominated by such headlines and gang violence has taken a never -seen grip on Sweden.

184
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:38,600
According to police information from 2023, the Zero network was established just before 2020 and originated from Jordbro, which is located on the south side of Stockholm.

185
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,573
This neighborhood has been home to many notorious criminals throughout history.
 They eventually became an ally to the Foxtrot network.

186
00:33:46,573 --> 00:34:00,284
The Foxtrot network is led by the Kurdish fox.
 According to Swedish police, Foxtrot organized the network large -scale drug smuggling to Sweden for broader spread both within Sweden and outside its boundaries.

187
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:11,626
Cocaine, cannabis and other drugs are often marked with fox symbols.
 Initially, the police believed that the Kurdish fox was only involved in drug smuggling.

188
00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:24,169
It was not until 2021 that the police realized that much of what happened in Sweden could be linked to the Kurdish fox and how he went to take over existing markets and control them.

189
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:31,875
One of the most important alliances was, in addition to the bronze network, with the Zero network.

190
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:45,353
Initially, the Zero network began to distribute and sell drugs to the Kurdish fox.
 But later, the Zero gang became even more important in providing young boys from the area to carry out violent attacks against Foxtrot's enemies.

191
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:59,931
A member of Zero called himself Louise Gucci.
 Born in 2004, Louise Gucci was a young man early in crime such as violent robbery and small -scale drug trafficking, while slowly getting deeper.

192
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:06,870
Louise Gucci became one of the most important men of Foxtrot when it came to coordinating attacks against enemies for the Kurdish fox in Sweden.

193
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:24,383
On January 20, 2023, Louise Gucci oriented the attack directed at the gang member and rapper Thrife's ex girlfriend.
 Thrife is closely linked to the Greek and Dalen Network, a bunch with which Foxtrot has a war at this time.

194
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:32,557
The attack was recorded by the two young people who performed it and it was posted on social media for everyone to see.

195
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:56,909
It was Louise Gucci who recruited two 14-year-olds to commit the attack, provided them with firearms and instructed them in detail what they would do via SMS.

196
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:10,387
Just a day later, January 21, 2023, an eyewitness filmed something that happened in the middle of the bright day in Enskededalen, the base and the home ground for the Dalen Network.

197
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:24,364
A young man runs for his life between the houses in the neighborhood while being chased by two young boys, one of whom carries a firearm and shoots at the young man.
 The young man who was shot against was a random 20-year-old.

198
00:36:24,364 --> 00:36:32,204
The two boys who chased and shot at the victim were two 15-year-olds from the Jordbro area, which belongs to the Zero network.

199
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:44,814
They had been given instructions from Louise Gucci to kill someone young who looks like a gang member.
 Examples of people who either wear a Gucci cap or an expensive brand jacket were given as a description.

200
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:54,922
In principle, shoot at someone you think may be a member of the Dalen Network.
 Just one day after this incident, Louis Gucci recruited a 20-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 14-year-old for another assignment.

201
00:36:54,922 --> 00:37:04,796
Again, they were intended to shoot someone in the Dalen Network according to Louise Gucci's order.
 The 20-year-old was driving the car and the other two would be the shooters.

202
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:15,438
However, the police intervened just in time because they had this gang member's address in Hammarbyhöjden under supervision.
 The police tried to stop the car, but the suspects tried to escape.

203
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:28,182
After a short car chase, the suspect's vehicle in Gullmarsplan crashed the roundabout.
 All three were eventually captured and firearms were found in the car, and the police suspected that they had just stopped another attempted murder from happening.

204
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:33,686
Shortly after this event, Louise Gucci was arrested.

205
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:45,495
January 26, 2023. Explosion at a property in southern Stockholm where a company has its premises.
 A person on the death list is a defendant in this case.

206
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:59,840
January 27, 2023, an explosion at the gate to a multi -family house in Akalla in northern Stockholm.
 An address linked to rapper 5iftyy from Upplands Bro and gang member of the bronze network allied with Kurdish fox and fox trot.

207
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:17,521
At several other arrests, the police seized several mobile phones.
 By examining these mobile phones, they could gain insight into a network of thousands of signal messages that revealed how these attacks were orchestrated.

208
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:31,699
This information obtained led to Louise Gucci being accused of helping coordinating another attack, a murder that took place at a sushi restaurant on January 28, 2023 in Skogås on the south side of Stockholm.

209
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:39,171
Police were alerted about a gunfire that had taken place in a small but crowded restaurant.

210
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:47,978
The victim was a 15-year-old boy who was shot in the face by another 15-year-old boy who did not know the victim at all.

211
00:38:47,978 --> 00:39:05,959
Although Louis Gucci was already in prison days before this incident took place, he was a main suspect because messages showed that the days before the meeting asked where the goals could be and if anyone had extra information about him.
 However, he was released in the trial.

212
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:23,506
The motive for the murder of the 15-year-old boy was revenge.
 He must have been involved in a shooting against one of the family members of the Kurdish fox.
 Almost immediately after that incident, the retaliation was planned.

213
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:32,647
Louise Gucci was finally sentenced to 18 years in prison for her part in these aforementioned attacks.

214
00:39:32,647 --> 00:39:47,959
The shooter, now 16 years old, but at the time of the crime he was only 15 years old, was convicted of the murder but because of his age the hatred received the maximum penalty in four years.
 He was paid SEK 100,000 for the murder.

215
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:53,797
These young boys commit these cruel acts for relatively small sums of money.

216
00:39:55,798 --> 00:40:05,073
For the convicted shooter and the murderer, Zikke, the money was more enough to accept the job and afterwards flex with the money.
 He had taken several pictures of himself and showing bundles of cash.

217
00:40:05,073 --> 00:40:23,854
CCTV films from NK's department stores in central Stockholm show how he with cash buys a brand new Mooseknuckle jacket and new shoes for himself.
 Rapper Adouli present at Zikke's trial and was also thrown away.

218
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:35,363
January 29, 2023. An explosion in the stairwell to a multi -family house in Bro in northern Stockholm.
 At the address is rapper Moewgli and his brothers from the bronet plant written.

219
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:54,979
Prosecutors have now prosecuted nine people who are suspected of contributing in various ways to general destruction through bombs and explosions in January 2023. The defendants were all men and were at the time of the acts between 17 and 30 years old.

220
00:40:54,979 --> 00:41:11,425
All events are linked to the conflict between the valley and the Foxtrot network.
 The so -called bomb manufacturer for the valley side of the conflict was arrested when explosives were found at a house search in his apartment in Kungssängen in northern Stockholm at the end of January 2023.

221
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:21,667
The rappers Haval and Thrife are disconnected by the police and are considered to be senior members of the Dalen Network.

222
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:38,813
Rapper Pékénio, real name Amin from the gang 23st is also suspected of the bombings.
 The 23st gang is closely allied with the Dalen Network and has at one time been considered to be the same gang by the police.

223
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:51,657
Rappers 5iftyy and Moewgli from Upplands Bro belong to the bronze network and are allies with Kurdish fox and Foxtrot network, something you can clearly see in their music videos.

224
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:56,161
In December 2022, the totally ruthless and fatal conflict erupts between the Foxtrot and the Dalennäverket.

225
00:41:58,162 --> 00:42:06,769
March 2, 2023.
 Several shots were fired at an apartment in Farsta in southern Stockholm.
 Second attack on the same address.

226
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:16,377
March 16, 2023. Someone pours out flammable liquid and lights fire in the stairwell in Skarpnäck.
 Second attack on the same address.

227
00:42:16,377 --> 00:42:23,949
During the same day, a huge explosion occurs and someone blasts the entrance to a house in western Stockholm.

228
00:42:33,957 --> 00:42:45,933
At the address lives to the rapper 5iftyy, who also became a target on January 27.
 As mentioned earlier, the rapper from the gang 23st allies with the Dalennäverket has been detained since this day and been suspected of this crime.

229
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:59,277
For two days in a row, a designated key member of the Mayn network, Furkan, becomes the intended victim for a murder plot.

230
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:03,714
The Mayan network is at least at this time, a close ally to the Foxtrot gang.

231
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:22,095
Furgeon's name is on the death list.
 On March 19, 2023, outside the apartment house on the ÖstbergAcaparna, a car with masked persons inside, three young men from Linköping, is stopped, a murder command, is later arrested and sentenced to prison.

232
00:43:22,095 --> 00:43:30,035
The Fur was attracted to come and look at an apartment where the murder command was waiting for him to come.

233
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:47,015
A false real estate agent was used to deceive an unknowing ping.
 The day after, March 20, 2023, the Furkan, which is still unaware of the events from the previous day, will be contacted again by the fake real estate agent.

234
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:57,023
He says that has another apartment for Furkan to watch, in Bromma.
 On the way there, the Furkan is stopped by the police and arrested a few hundred meters away from the false apartment show.

235
00:44:01,026 --> 00:44:10,600
The police send additional patrols to the address Furkan would be.
 At the site, two black -clad and masked men await on electrical kick bikes.

236
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:19,510
Both flee when they see the police arrive.
 One of them throws a gun but is arrested after a short hunt on foot.

237
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:28,681
The arrested man is called JJ, 22 and is a member of the 22nd gang.
 Police take his phone when he is arrested on a bare deed, on JJ's phone the police later find the so -called death list.

238
00:44:28,681 --> 00:44:34,319
The other perpetrator manages to escape from the scene and is not arrested.

239
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:51,666
During the following investigation, Scar, 23 years old, is known to a member of the Dalen Network on surveillance films in the taxi he left the area in. The taxi picked up Scar near the place where the masked man got away from the police and shortly afterwards in time.

240
00:44:51,666 --> 00:45:10,548
Scar has since left the country according to police.
 JJ is sentenced to seven years in prison for preparation for murder.
 A total of at least 16 serious crimes were committed and documented in January to March 2023 against twelve of the 41 people on the death list according to police.

241
00:45:15,552 --> 00:45:22,057
Two of the men who were charged with perpetrators to several of the bombing targets aimed at the Foxtrot network are from Malmö in southern Sweden.

242
00:45:22,057 --> 00:45:30,764
One of them is called Sami.
 Two of Sami's brothers are shot dead in Malmö in separate shootings.

243
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:38,136
Samer's third brother, Meysem, was deceived by his best friend the same day as one of the brothers' funeral to Dansörgatan in Malmö,

244
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:57,719
Where he was left alone in a car by his friend and then he was shot five times.
 Despite serious gunshot wounds, the brother survived the murder attempt thanks to his bulletproof vest.
 His best friend was convicted of assisting in attempted murder and assisting in another murder of the "sheep".

245
00:46:01,722 --> 00:46:17,468
Sami can be seen to have conversations with a female acquaintance about who has paid them to perform these bombings against Foxtrot.
 Sami points out the famous rapper Haval, who was one of the goals for the violence in the end of 2022, as responsible for ensuring that he would be paid for his assignment.

246
00:46:20,437 --> 00:46:30,678
In a chat conversation he also mentions rapper Thrife.
 The conversation goes to talk about why Haval and Thrife, who are known rappers, do such things.

247
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:47,124
Samer says the two rappers were not the ones who started it.
 Foxtrot blasted Haval's gate and shot at Thrife's front door and recorded it.
 The police have stamped both rapper Thrife and Haval as gang members, and that they are both in the inner core of the Dalennäverket.

248
00:46:47,124 --> 00:46:57,166
When the conflict between the gang has been in full swing for a few months so in April a 25-year-old man who was linked to the criminal network Foxtrot becomes attacked.

249
00:46:57,166 --> 00:47:13,345
On April 17, 2023 at 18.59, the police received calls regarding a shooting in the middle of Umeå.
 A witness states that he heard several shots and at the same time the witness saw a person collapse to the ground.

250
00:47:15,347 --> 00:47:25,955
Patrick is then found shot with multiple shots.
 In connection with the incident, several eyewitnesses observe and film a person leaving the crime scene on an electrical kick bike in the eastern direction.

251
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:41,000
The victim has been shot with three shots.
 A few hours after the incident, Oliver and Liam and three women were arrested for suspected involvement in the shooting.

252
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:49,407
The shooter Liam and Oliver pose for a picture 33 minutes after Liam shot the victim three times and left him to die.

253
00:47:49,407 --> 00:48:07,021
They are linked to the local Dalennäverket Falangen in Umeå and are considered to be behind.
 The trial runs until December 2023. The victim survived the attempted murder, but in September 2023 he was arrested by the police's intervention force.

254
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:26,737
The victim, Patrick, is sentenced to two years in prison by the district court for serious drug crime.
 Police have pointed out a 23-year-old man as the brain behind the murder attempt in Umeå, he is suspected of instigating murder attempts, serious drug and weapons offenses.

255
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:42,983
It is about an organized business where they want to control the drug market in northern Sweden.
 Oliver visits John Alias Don Svenson, the alleged brain behind everything, on at least one occasion in Spain before the attempted murder.

256
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:59,963
In a picture in the preliminary investigation, you can see that John has published a picture of himself where he insults the Kurdish fox and Foxtrot.
 There are several pictures from Oliver's stay in Spain on his phone.

257
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:10,905
There are pictures of a meeting with John, Robble and rapper Wafi from Sundsvall from the same occasion.
 Rapper Wafi is linked to the Dalen Network's local and allied gang in Sundsvall.

258
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:19,879
The Sundsvall area has not been quiet since the great effort in January 2023.

259
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:35,858
An incident on July 9 turns out to be a continuation of the gang war when two teenage boys were found seriously injured.
 The boys were found on Sunday evening bleeding and severely injured after sought help in a villa in Sidsjö in Sundsvall.

260
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:55,807
A 20-year-old from Sundsvall is both suspected and victim in the same case.
 Just as at the big police stroke last winter, it is he who, according to the suspicions, was the target for a planned shooting.
 Twelve people are brought to trial after the gang settlement in Sidsjö in Sundsvall this summer.

261
00:49:55,807 --> 00:50:03,180
Three are suspected of preparation for murder, eight for human trafficking and sex for attempted murder - among other things.

262
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:17,758
According to the police investigation, the Foxtrot side again planned that one of Dalen's men in Sundsvall would be killed.
 It is about a 20-year-old who for several years belonged to the top tier in the Dalen Network's Sundsvallsfalang.

263
00:50:17,758 --> 00:50:30,368
He also still belongs to the suspects of the still unresolved \ Hödrojin in Korssta \ Hi Sundsvall in December 2020 when a 33-year-old man was shot dead with multiple shots, including rapper Wafi and KP were suspected of this murder.

264
00:50:30,368 --> 00:50:45,613
Three young shooters \ H-14, 15 and 16 years-had been recruited by the Foxtrot side to kill the 20-year-old.
 A 24-year-old Karlshamnsbo with Sundsvall's past had arranged housing for them.

265
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:51,585
But the talk about the plans began to go into the criminal circles, and in the end the information reached the target board himself-the 20-year-old.

266
00:50:51,585 --> 00:51:10,566
On the evening of July 9, a bunch of Dalen-confined people with the 20-year-old at the forefront sought out the three hired shooters, overpowered them and carried them away. \ Hde was badly abused for a couple of hours, \ hoch two of the teenagers were left to die in the villa area in Sidsjö
 in the middle of the night.

267
00:51:12,535 --> 00:51:19,540
Severe bleeding they sought help in a house, and the injuries were so serious that they were anesthetized down at the hospital.

268
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:32,217
A total of 12 people with connections to the two networks are charged in the case that have two parts.
 It is about, among other things, preparation for murder on the one hand, and attempted murder and more on the other.

269
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:40,190
The minor of the three hired shooters - who thus has not reached the age of 15 - is suspended but is not prosecuted because of his low age.
 He becomes a case for the social authorities.

270
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:51,232
21-year-old rapper Wafi was one of the goals to be murdered last winter, but he is now charged with, among other things, the murder attempt on the two boys in Sidsjö.

271
00:51:51,232 --> 00:52:10,681
KP was the central figure in the prosecution in 2023 since he left his former friends to become loyal to the Foxtrot gang.
 In October 2023, KP, which is actually called Soran Merzai, is convicted of several charges and was sentenced to eleven years in prison for preparation for murder.

272
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:23,658
After the incident in Sundsvall in the summer of 2023, the conflict between the valley and the Foxtrot seems to slow down, it feels almost quiet after six months of daily events.

273
00:52:23,658 --> 00:52:28,671
What happens behind the scenes?

274
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:41,305
In addition to the many enemies that the Kurdish fox has created in other gangs and networks, internal conflicts in Rawa Majid's own Foxtrot network began in the summer of 2023.

275
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:50,245
Disputes and disagreements on the inside of the Foxtrot gang started for various reasons.
 The members began to turn to each other.

276
00:52:52,247 --> 00:53:04,457
Ismail Abdo, 33 years old alias strawberry, was once near the Kurdish fox.
 The 33-year-old comes from a very well-off family.
 He has big money behind him.

277
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:14,098
Kurdish fox and strawberry have worked closely in each other in recent years and they know each other's weaknesses.

278
00:53:14,098 --> 00:53:18,034
They know where the other's relatives live and weak points are.

279
00:53:18,034 --> 00:53:30,344
After several violent actions against each other abroad, kidnappings, abuse and shootings, there is a shooting in Istanbul on September 6

280
00:53:30,344 --> 00:53:40,619
On surveillance films you can see that two men arrive on a moped and one of them jumps off and shoots several shots at five people.

281
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:47,557
These five people in turn shoot back.
 No one was seriously injured, but the efforts were raised.

282
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:52,661
The following events in the next 30 days appear to come directly from a movie.

283
00:53:52,661 --> 00:54:05,772
In Sweden the following day after the shooting as immediate revenge, Ismail Abdo's mother, a woman at the end of her 50s, was shot dead in her home in Gränby, an area in Uppsala.

284
00:54:05,772 --> 00:54:11,777
For obvious reasons, the intensity and brutality of this conflict shoot in height after that.

285
00:54:13,778 --> 00:54:24,253
Bombing and shootings in Sweden and abroad take place daily after this, a few days after the murder of the strawberry's mother, a shooting is directed at Rawa Majid's mother -in -law.

286
00:54:24,253 --> 00:54:30,191
An unknown attacker shoots several shots from the outside into the Kurdish fox's mother -in -law's home.

287
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:44,069
Then, two days after the shooting, a man was shot without connection to the conflict to death in the stairwell to his apartment early in the morning in Uppsala.
 The young man who was on his way to work was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

288
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:51,541
The intended target was a family member of the Kurdish fox who lived in the same apartment house.

289
00:54:51,541 --> 00:55:06,020
On September 11, 2023, gang violence in Sweden harvested one of its youngest victims so far.
 The remains of a 13-year-old boy were found in a forest area in Haninge on the south side of Stockholm.

290
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:16,661
The boy had been reported a few days earlier and the young boy SAS has gang couplings, one of which was to the Foxtrot network before the internal split.

291
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:31,440
During the summer months before this incident, the remains of Mohamed Suleiman and Layth al-Azzawi were found in the northern and southern Stockholm region.
 Both boys were 14 years old and had been murdered.

292
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:40,580
The police and the media speculated that both boys who were friends with each other sold weapons that they received from the Foxtrot network.

293
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:48,520
When they could not pick up the weapons, the leaders for the foxtrot were looking to make them an example and eliminated them both.

294
00:55:48,520 --> 00:56:02,231
No other country in Europe has seen anything similar in modern times.
 Despite Sweden has wrestled with gang violence for years, but the outbreak of shootings and bombing in September has been extremely brutal,

295
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:16,175
Three people are murdered in just 12 hours due to gang violence and also the same conflict.
 Sweden's outdated and naive laws are not designed for brutal gang war and child soldiers.

296
00:56:18,177 --> 00:56:25,716
The Kurdish fox is still on the loose, right?
 In any case, he is out of his hands for the Swedish authorities.

297
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:36,058
While Louise Gucci is in prison for following orders from the Kurdish fox, the internal conflict within the Foxtrot network has taken place six months later.

298
00:56:36,058 --> 00:56:49,568
For example, Foxtrot was once close to the so -called Zero network.
 But when the internal conflict went on, the Zero network decided to follow Ismail Abdo's strawberry side.

299
00:56:49,568 --> 00:57:06,482
It wasn't long before Benzema or Mustafa, who was still a member of Foxtrot also became a goal.
 On September 25, shortly after nine o'clock in the evening, it exploded in the stairwell in an apartment building in Hässelby and this explosion was very powerful.

300
00:57:10,485 --> 00:57:20,159
It was made and placed with the intention to cause serious damage to the targeted apartment and possibly even those who were inside.
 Three people had been injured and taken to hospital.

301
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:26,235
It turned out that this attack was directed at Mustafas or Benzema's family members.

302
00:57:30,234 --> 00:57:39,208
9 hours later on September 26 at six in the morning, a bomb exploded so powerful that the entire front of the apartment building flew off.

303
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:55,887
According to the bomb group that arrived at the site, the building was so damaged that some parts could collapse completely.
 Despite the magnitude of the explosion, only two women suffered from minor injuries.
 The target was again related to Benzema / Mustafa.

304
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:59,357
This time it was family member of his wife.

305
00:57:59,357 --> 00:58:10,766
With the increasing number of shameless attacks, it was only a matter of time before more people who had no connection to the feud would become victims.

306
00:58:10,766 --> 00:58:19,540
During this time, the Zero network has distanced itself from the Kurdish fox and Foxtrot.
 They are now on Ismail Abdo aka strawberry side.

307
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:34,952
Something that makes this particularly clear is that the rappers 5iftyy and Numberouno release a song and music video called "Gulag", 5iftyy belongs to Foxtrot and Numberuno is from Jordbro and is connected to the Zero network.

308
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:45,427
The video will be released towards the end of August, since September, rappers stop following each other on Instagram and disallow each other.

309
00:58:56,402 --> 00:59:03,908
September 27.
 On Wednesday evening, the police received several calls about a shooting in southern Stockholm.

310
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:13,315
An 18-year-old man had been shot several times, execution style on a lawn on Mälarhöjden's IP in front of a large number of witnesses, including teenagers and young children.

311
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:26,993
The 18-year-old was cared for at the scene, but his life could not be saved.
 The victim is a rapper, Adouli.
 He turned 18 the month before.

312
00:59:26,993 --> 00:59:32,431
According to information, the rapper was linked to the Foxtrot conflict and he was apparently on the side of the Kurdish fox.

313
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:47,242
The shots were intended for the rapper.
 The rapper wrote, among other things, on his Instagram "Free Zikke", a reference to the 15-year-old who was convicted of murdering a 15-year-old inside a sushi restaurant in Skogås and January 2023.

314
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:56,049
The murder of the rapper was filmed by one of the perpetrators.

315
00:59:56,049 --> 01:00:11,295
In the video, shots from several men are fired inside a car.
 A little to the right of them, a young man is still in the grass.
 The video was published and spread on an Instagram account.

316
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:21,770
At 23:54 just before midnight the same evening, police were called to another shooting in Jordbro, south of Stockholm.

317
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:38,750
In Jordbro Centrum, some fire opened with at least one automatic weapon from a car and the police find two people with gunshot injuries at the scene, completely innocent victims and not linked to crime or Foxtrot conflict at all.

318
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:53,562
A 23-year-old man was so seriously injured that he died a few hours later.
 After the deaths on Thursday morning, the police received calls about a huge explosion in a residential area outside Uppsala.

319
01:00:53,562 --> 01:01:03,236
Two houses were totally destroyed in the explosion, which was so strong that even three adjacent houses were injured.

320
01:01:03,236 --> 01:01:12,777
A 24-year-old woman, a student living in a neighboring house, was seriously injured by the explosion and she dies from her injuries.

321
01:01:12,777 --> 01:01:25,287
12 hours, three people murdered in the conflict.
 The bombed address in Uppsala has previously been noticed when the same house was shot with an automatic weapon from a car in January 2023 in the middle of the then wave of violence between the Dalen Network and Kurdish Fox's then intact Foxtrot gang.

322
01:01:34,294 --> 01:01:45,569
In October, Friday the 13th, an hour over midnight, a 16-year-old boy breaks in to Louise Gucci's big brother's house in southern Stockholm.

323
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:59,414
His big brother is a 40-year-old man, completely unrelated to any crime or his little brother's gang business.
 He is even a well -known musician and part of a music group known for his positive messages and spread joy.

324
01:01:59,414 --> 01:02:10,556
After somehow entered the house at night while several adults and at least three children were at home, the boy opened fire with an automatic weapon,

325
01:02:10,556 --> 01:02:19,897
After the smoke has settled, two women are dead.
 Big brother's mother -in -law who was sixties and a twenty -year -old woman are the victims.

326
01:02:19,897 --> 01:02:25,434
There was another adult and three children in the house as well, who fortunately were not physically injured.

327
01:02:25,434 --> 01:02:39,412
Less than an hour after the incident, they managed to seize the suspect sitting in the back seat of a taxi.
 It is not uncommon in Sweden that suspected flees from the site in taxis, often booked by a third person or some anonymous.

328
01:02:39,412 --> 01:02:55,925
The police stopped the taxi and in there sat a 16-year-old boy.
 He tried to escape on foot, but after a fight he was caught.
 The police searched the boy's pockets and they found ammunition and magazine in the luggage compartment on the taxi.
 In a bag, the police found an automatic weapon.

329
01:02:55,925 --> 01:03:14,607
They suspected this was the murder weapon that was just used.
 The arrested suspect, a 16-year-old boy from Linköping, was then also suspected of another murder just 24 hours earlier with a very similar approach.

330
01:03:14,607 --> 01:03:30,419
The 16-year-old boy is suspected to have shot a father inside his home in a shooting in the middle of the night of October 12, the man died from his injuries.
 The man's wife and child also suffered gunshot wounds during the incident.

331
01:03:33,422 --> 01:03:39,393
The victim could not be linked to any criminal activity.
 He just seems to share the same last name as a gang member.

332
01:03:39,393 --> 01:03:50,335
On Sunday evening, October 15, a well -known Swedish rapper, 5iftyy announced for his gang couplings to the bronze network and Kurdish fox that he would have an Instagram live.

333
01:03:51,336 --> 01:03:59,309
This would happen at 20:00 in the evening Swedish time and a special secret guest would show up.
 Many thought it would be the Kurdish fox.

334
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:13,086
In the same vein and week with all murders, gunfires and bombing, there is a rumor, especially online and in the media, that the Kurdish fox has been arrested abroad in Iran.

335
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:21,159
And that his so -called right hand in Foxtrot, a man who calls himself Benzema is now dead.

336
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:32,135
There should have been a large price on Benzema's head.
 According to these rumors, the strawberry oriented that Benzema was arrested and then killed in Iraq.

337
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:42,443
A short video circulated online that showed a bloody man sitting in the driver's seat in a car, this person seemed to have been shot dead.

338
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:52,217
When Benzema's friends began to post Instagram and Snapchat Stories containing rest in peace and pictures of Benzema, the rumors seemed to be true.

339
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:07,196
October 15, 2023. Rapper 5iftyy goes live on Instagram.
 After half an hour of playing some new music to be released, the rapper and his friends revealed that the guest had joined life.

340
01:05:07,196 --> 01:05:22,842
The guest was none other than Mustafa aka Benzema, alive.
 He sat down on a chair and posing with a gold -colored AK47A and there were three masked and men with automatic weapons that posed as bodyguards.
 He claimed that 300 men guarded his house.

341
01:05:27,846 --> 01:05:38,521
Benzema made several interesting statements during life.
 Benzema then claimed that the strawberry is a police informant, that he has worked with the police in several countries.

342
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:55,234
He also claimed that the strawberry paid $ 1 million to get Benzema killed in Iraq.
 Benzema got news about this and with the help of a hired camera team and actor he fake his own murder in Iraq and then collected the prize money for his own life, which he claimed was $ 1 million.

343
01:06:02,206 --> 01:06:12,214
He proclaimed that he would donate half a million dollars to charity and that the other half of the strawberry money would be used by Foxtrot in the war against the strawberry.

344
01:06:12,214 --> 01:06:24,190
Benzema also said that the strawberry alias Ismail Abdo only kills completely innocent people and has not injured a single person who is actually involved or is linked to this conflict with the Kurdish fox and fox trot.

345
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:35,166
He claimed that the strawberry was behind the bomb attack that killed a woman, a 24-year-old student who lived next door to the house that was blown up in September.

346
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:50,378
He also claimed that the strawberry and Zero network were behind the execution of 13-year-old Milo, the boy who was found shot in the head and dumped in a forest area on the south side of Stockholm in mid-September.

347
01:06:50,378 --> 01:07:07,358
Several members of Bro and Foxtrot network were arrested at the end of October in Tunisia.
 Five Swedish citizens were arrested since they had several guns and drugs in their ownership.
 The police also seized nine cell phones.

348
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:23,837
The gang members are currently under the investigation of a special legal authority dedicated to the fight against terrorism.
 They are investigated as suspected of terrorism.
 The crime classification may be due to the fact that for several years the Tunisian police specifically targeted a phenomenon called Islam Gangsterism.

349
01:07:23,837 --> 01:07:39,817
This has occurred in suburbs and poor villages where drug trafficking and radical Islamism has been intertwined and cartels have collaborated with jihadist groups.
 Several acts of violence in the Foxtrot conflict have been carried out by the bronze network on behalf of Rawa Majid.

350
01:07:39,817 --> 01:07:51,793
October 23, 2023. On Monday morning at 05:42, the police received several calls about an incident in Enskededalen, an explosion at a multi -family house.

351
01:07:51,793 --> 01:07:59,432
Now deceased superstar Einár's former close friend and rapper Hamko and his brothers are written at the affected address.

352
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:13,744
Hamko and his brothers have previously been involved in the Dalen Network before the internal divide within the gang took place.
 Hamko and his brothers' name and the address they are written on were on the death list that has circulated.

353
01:08:13,744 --> 01:08:25,086
Now 21-year-old Hamko has just served a prison sentence.
 Hamko, his older brother and a friend were convicted of an attempted murder of a 14-year-old boy in 2020.

354
01:08:25,086 --> 01:08:31,258
The 14-year-old went with two friends when a car suddenly stopped and shots were fired.

355
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:43,601
The 14-year-old was shot in the abdomen and the boy was close to dying, but managed to survive.
 Since Hamko recently released from his prison sentence, he has said he will release new music

356
01:08:43,601 --> 01:08:51,574
And has posed for pictures with what the police call a gang leader for Farsta-Fagersjöätverket, a 24-year-old man called Chris.

357
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:59,213
When old alliances are abandoned and new alliances seem to be created overnight, time may show how things will end.

358
01:08:59,213 --> 01:09:06,185
October 31, 2023. We are in Bosnia and the city of Sarajevo.

359
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:16,660
On Halloween and Tuesday afternoon, a gunfire takes place after 16 o'clock. Masked people on a moped opened fire in a residential area in Sarajevo and then left the scene.

360
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:25,634
A Swedish citizen, 30-year-old Harris Österdahl, died at the scene.

361
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:40,179
Another Swedish man was shot in the abdomen in the shooting and taken to hospital with minor injuries.
 According to the police, both victims belonged to the shooting in Sarajevo, Harris and Elvir, the Kurdish fox's side of Foxtrot.

362
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:52,355
Harris and Elvir were both shot during the shooting in Istanbul on September 6th.
 Both were arrested after the shooting, but they were later released and then quickly left the country and traveled to Bosnia.

363
01:09:52,355 --> 01:10:02,863
Harris, the death victim, was a figure from Stockholm's criminal world and the murder is linked to the internal conflict within Foxtrot.

364
01:10:02,863 --> 01:10:15,507
The same evening at 19.30, a 26-year-old Swedish man was arrested.
 Later in the night, two more 19-year-old men, Swedish citizens, are arrested, suspected of involvement in the murder.

365
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:28,017
According to information in 2020, after serving two years in prison, Harris joined the Foxtrot network.
 Several of the acts of violence in the conflict have affected family members or outsiders who are not related to the conflict.

366
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:34,555
This was the case earlier in 2023 when Harri's family was the target for an attack.

367
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:49,801
The detained 26-year-old Swedish man, Oliver, is also suspected of a previous gunfire in Turkey.
 Oliver is believed to have worked as a kind of hitman for the Foxtrot Splitter fraction led by the strawberry Ismail Abdo.

368
01:10:49,801 --> 01:11:04,612
Oliver is suspected of performing at least three documents against Foxtrot gang members since the split.
 After the shooting in Istanbul, Oliver is suspected to have followed five other Foxtrot members, including 5ifty and Elias Bäck, to Tunisia.

369
01:11:04,612 --> 01:11:13,720
However, Tunisian police arrested the five Foxtrot men before something happened and after that Oliver traveled to Bosnia and sought two of the Swedish men from the shooting in Istanbul.

370
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:33,936
26-year-old Oliver has been found in several investigations on Swedish soil as well.
 He is several times convicted in drug cases and has also been suspected of both murder and attempted murder.
 Among other things, he has been linked to the wave of violence that hit the Swedish city of Kalmar in 2022.

371
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:45,511
In early 2023, he was arrested on suspicion of a murder in central Kalmar in February 2022, but was released in the summer of 2023 when the suspicions against him could not be substantiated.

372
01:11:45,511 --> 01:12:03,059
The murder of the 22-year-old in February 2022 is considered to be the starting point for the wave of murder and gunfires that followed in Kalmar in 2022. Earlier this year, Oliver was also released in a trial that included assisting in criminals in a murder attempt.

373
01:12:03,059 --> 01:12:12,066
Oliver is believed to have previously been loyal to the Kurdish fox, but is now believed to have changed sides in the internal Foxtrot conflict and acts on behalf of Ismail Abdo.

374
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:16,970
Two young men at the age of 19 are the suspected shooters.

375
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:22,374
One of them is from Jordbro, south of Stockholm and is linked to the Zero network.

376
01:12:22,374 --> 01:12:33,916
The second is from Malmö in southern Sweden and he is also suspected to be the shooter when 19-year-old Giovanni was shot down and killed in Vasastan in central Stockholm on September 13.

377
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:48,395
Benzema or Mustafa has now stated again and says that he and Kurdish fox or Rawa Majid met in prison twelve years ago and have been business partners for a long time.

378
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:52,431
Benzema claims that he was never Rawa's right hand, but more an equal partner.

379
01:12:52,431 --> 01:12:59,070
He also says that he has withdrawn from the Foxtrot network and has started his own organization called La Liga.

380
01:12:59,070 --> 01:13:11,680
After this war between Rawa Majid and Ismail Abdo, people became tired of all the shootings and bombings, especially that completely innocent people and family members were affected.

381
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:22,288
November 28, 2023. The shooting occurred just \ Höre at 17 o'clock at the Mosshallen gym in the city of Moss, Norway, which is about five miles from the Swedish border.

382
01:13:22,288 --> 01:13:32,930
At least 7-8 shots must have been fired at the scene and the shot was a Swedish citizen.
 The police sought at least \ hvå perpetrators who must have left the scene in a dark car.

383
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:41,403
The victim, a 33-year-old man, was hit by several shots and his condition is described as serious but that he would survive

384
01:13:41,403 --> 01:13:53,246
The man is registered in the Stockholm area and in 2022 he received a penalty for minor drug smuggling.
 Before that, he is convicted of, among other things, drug crimes, abuse and theft and is also convicted of a series of crimes in Norway.

385
01:13:53,246 --> 01:13:59,051
According to information, he is linked to the Foxtrot network.

386
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:07,024
Since this takes place in real time, who knows what fate becomes for the Kurdish fox and the Foxtrot network?

387
01:14:07,024 --> 01:14:09,063
