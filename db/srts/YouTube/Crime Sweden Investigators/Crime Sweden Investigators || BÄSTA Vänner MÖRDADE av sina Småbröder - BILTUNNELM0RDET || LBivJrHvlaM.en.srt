11
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:38,612
It turns out that the young man has been shot once in the left thigh.

12
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:46,752

00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,705
June 8, 2022

14
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:59,495
The police are alerted to Tallåsvägen and Högbovägen's bus stop in Fröslunda in Eskilstuna on the occasion of a brawl at the site.

October 20, 2022

17
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:21,246
Kurdo with two others and his close friend Allan's little brother Darin is on his way from Eskilstuna to Stockholm to shop.

18
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:40,227
Kurdo must have called Darin and said he wanted to shop in various business and Darin says that he mainly buy some t-shirt at NK.
 When Kurdo comes to pick up Darin, the other two young men are already in the car with Kurdo, he states that he does not know them.

19
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:53,071
The other two young men in the car told me that Kurdo came by driving by car from Fröslunda center and thus came behind the guys and then stopped when he arrived at them.

20
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:58,342
It was about ten minutes past three on Friday afternoon.

21
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:06,748
Kurdo pulled down the box on the car and asked if the guys wanted to come to Stockholm.
 Kurdo would shop and wanted company.

22
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:18,724
Asking, he says it was not decided before that they would come to Stockholm.
 It was just a coincidence that they met.
 They had not had any contact earlier in the day with each other, he and Kurdo.

23
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:26,197
The third guy was not in the car when he and his friend jumped into it but they went a short distance and picked up the guy.

24
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:36,238
Asked if he recognizes the guy since before, he says "I know who it is".
 When asked, he says he knows what the guy is called.

25
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:50,383
The 4 young men with Kurdo as a driver then drive towards Stockholm.
 The trip takes a little more than an hour and they stay on the way to Stockholm at a gas station in Strängnäs and shop, the time is then about 15:38.

26
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:59,390
Darin then switches from the front seat to sitting at the back, Kurdo who drives the car sits obliquely to the left in front of him.

27
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:08,364
When they arrive at Stockholm, they drive into the Björktunneln at Gullmarsplan in the Södra link.

28
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:20,540
Kurdo drives the car while Nasir is sitting next to the front seat and Ahmed just behind Kurdo, Darin sits on the right side of the back seat in the car.

29
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:30,515
Kurdo sat at the driver's seat and looked ahead as he was shot with several shots from behind and from inside the car, the shots hit the right side of the head.

30
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:38,021
The car then stopped abruptly and the other three young men get out of the car and move from there.

31
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:47,361
Two of them will soon return to the car and one of them will call 112 which you can hear here.

32
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:50,164
SOS 112 What has happened?

33
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:54,133
You shot in your head.
 Hurry up, hurry.

34
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,669
we're coming.
 Where is he shot somewhere?

35
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,170
shot in the head, head.

36
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,337
does he breathe?

37
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:03,307
He doesn't breathe ... just come quickly!

38
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,982
The third young man moves further away in the tunnel and ends up in a shelter where he remains for a few minutes.

39
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:21,488
Then he moves out of the room and into the tunnel again.

40
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,961
Finally, he is met by the police who stop him and he is arrested.

41
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:35,933
The police are also there at the car where Kurdo is shot in the front seat and he is quickly deceased.

42
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:39,741
The two young men nearby are also arrested.

43
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:47,242
In the backrest compartment on the front passenger seat is found the suspected murder weapon, a revolver, with the barrel down.

44
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:54,815
A pair of gloves are also found in the tunnel about 100 meters from the crime scene / car.

45
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:05,790
Soon into the investigation, the suspicions are directed at Darin, Kurdo's best friend's little brother, as a perpetrator.
 He denies a crime.

46
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,661
You can never really get any clear motive behind the brutal murder or secure.

47
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:23,804
Later in the summer of 2023, the other two young men who sat in the car are released and the suspicions against them are written off.
 However, Darin is still being arrested and the suspicions against him are strengthened in the form of technical evidence.

48
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:33,012
April 17, 2023. Alarm about gunfire came to the police at 22.06 on Monday evening.

49
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:42,986
The shooting occurred in the district of Fröslunda in Eskilstuna and well in place the police find a shot -wounded man.

50
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:50,959
The 25-year-old man is previously known by the police and he dies later during the night by the gunshot wounds.

51
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,397
The 25-year-old is called Allan and is no less than big brother to detained Darin.

52
00:06:56,397 --> 00:07:05,704
4 days after the murder of Allan, Kurdo's little brother is arrested for probable cause for the murder of Allan.

53
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:15,178
Kurdo's little brother is detained for six weeks suspected of the murder of Allan, Allan is a big brother to Darin who is then arrested on suspicion of the murder of Kurdo.

54
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:25,887
In other words, the best friends Kurdo and Allan's two little brothers suspected of the murder of the other's big brother.

55
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:30,981
But after six weeks, Kurdo's little brother is released.

56
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:40,665
He is released because the suspicions have not been strengthened while he was arrested.
 At the same time, the prosecutor says the suspicions remain, but that they are weakened.

57
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:51,540
Back to Darin, at the end of August 2023 he is charged with the murder of Kurdo.
 Darin had just two weeks before the murder turned 18.

58
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:59,747
At first he denies crime but the day before the prosecution he must have changed his story.
 There he claims that the shots were fired in emergency defense.

59
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:09,521
Darin states that he has been threatened by Kurdo with the revolver and should then have managed to take the weapon from Kurdo and then in self -defense shot him.

60
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:22,765
The investigation shows that 21-year-old Kurdo was sitting in the driver's seat and looked ahead and drove the car when he was shot with four shots from a revolver, which hit the right side of the head.

61
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:37,310
Balls and fragments remained in the head and went out through the left side of the face and these bullets/fragments then hit the driver's A-pole, the top of the driver's window frame and went through the driver's glass pane.

62
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:51,822
The murder weapon, a revolver, was fully charged and fired at Kurdo's head at close distance.

63
00:08:51,822 --> 00:09:03,798
The gloves that were found in the tunnel, about 110m behind the car, are connected to Darin and ended up there after being in close proximity to a weapon that was fired and Kurdo suffered a bleeding damage.

64
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:15,574
After the shots, the other passengers fled from the car.
 While two of them held together \ hoch returned later, Darin disappeared on his own from the scene

65
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:31,753
All involved was the opportunity to be known by police since before and have been suspected of crime before.
 In the car was found afterwards the weapon used in the murder and the investigation shows that the police could find out from the angle of the deadly shots.

66
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:42,428
The district court writes in the judgment that it is clear that Darin was sitting in the right part of the back seat, and from there, four shots shot in the head of the 21-year-old man.

67
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:52,002
Now 19-year-old Darin is being convicted of the murder of Kurdo and receives ten \ hair and six months in prison for murder and serious weapons crime.

68
00:09:52,002 --> 00:10:01,777
According to the judgment, the person has been shortened because the now convicted person has cooperated with the police and contributed information regarding another murder.

69
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:05,013
Thus, he has become a so -called crown witness.

70
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:11,518
What do you think happened inside the car on October 20, 2022 and why ??
