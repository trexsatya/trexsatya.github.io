1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,974
The picture and associated text can be interpreted as the fact that there is "price" of the guys who are included in the picture and that it should be spread further with that message.

2
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:23,719
In the phone among the images, a screenshot is found from a chat from what appears to come from the Signal program.
 The picture sent depicts several individuals from the Ronna side in the Södertälje conflict.

3
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:33,560
Among other things, in the picture there is rapper Nineb Yok, murdered Lourens, as well as Marcus who is arrested in Portugal for a murder and also in the picture is Yousef Saado.

00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:49,873
24-year-old Yousef was sentenced to prison for seven years and ten months in prison for 17 cases of serious drug crime during the period June to September 202. Out of a total of 13 accused of this, 9 were released by them.

5
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:57,413
The fact that the guys in the picture with clarity belong to the Ronna side shows that L2 has part of the conflict in Södertälje.

6
00:00:57,413 --> 00:01:09,022
Another screenshot from the program shows how L2 wants help with "getting" the guys from Ronna.
 26-year-old L2 is said to be linked to Saltskog Falangen and is now being charged with stamping for murder.

7
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:18,129
The person L2 is talking to is in the Foxtrot network, it is no less than the leader, Kurdish fox, wanted Rawa Majid, the man is talking to.

8
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:29,071
In addition, according to the preliminary investigation protocol, the designated and prosecuted shooter "Guldish" poses with an AK47a in rapper Sticky's music video.

9
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:38,412
The Lourens Issa who was murdered when he was a designated leader figure for Ronna Falangen, he has a little brother who is reported by police in the conflict.

10
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:46,318
The little brother has also recorded various songs and freestyles as a rapper.

11
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:58,828
Here he rapes "Goldish on my neck and I talk no chain."

12
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,699
In other words, he suggests that the designated torpedo "Guldish" is looking for him.

13
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:22,647
“Brother, the grower How to get him?
 He sends to the kids from Ronna, the one in the picture I sent.
 Don't you think he could fix them for money?
 They have sought help from everyone, none except for acids from Södertälje help them and them from Västerås, Namo Stress Liga.

14
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:45,098
And Maykil Yokhanna's league the so -called May network.
 These are real Muslim haters.
 They tell people we get Muslims to the city and try to fight against the Syrians.
 Brother asks you to check with the grower, he could easily fix these h kids.
 Let's send them here to Jannah and I are loving both of your and the growers' business will go around everywhere in Södertälje via us my brother. "

15
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:54,139
"Okay my brother solves it now."
 Says Kurdish fox.

16
00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:03,112
According to the police and the prosecution, L2 must therefore contact Kurdish fox and offered him shot money to clear away three leaders from Ronna Falangen.

17
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:18,458
The prosecution is based on audio files that the police have come across.
 According to prosecutors and police, he is heard to talk to a person whose alias is linked to Rawa Majid, the so -called Kurdish fox, leader of the Foxtrot network.

18
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:32,469
According to the police, L2, SEK 300,000, offers per head.
 The targets discussed were Ronna Falangen's highest leader, a 27-year-old man, Markus who is now being arrested in Portugal suspected of murder.

19
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:41,977
Through voice identification, the prosecutor believes that it is Kurdish fox and people linked to his network Foxtrot.

20
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:52,285
Now 13 men are charged with crime in connection with the fact that Mitt i when the conflict was most intense, a 41-year-old man, murdered by mistake when he was mistaken for another person by the shooter.

21
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:57,122
Nothing in the view has shown that the victim should have had to do with the gang conflict.

22
00:03:57,122 --> 00:04:04,861
A little more than a year, that the 41-year-old was shot dead in Ronna, 13 men are now being charged with suspected involvement in the murder.

23
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:14,736
It was just before seven in the evening of October 2022, that the 41-year-old man walked at the Enhörnaleden in Ronna in Södertälje with a friend.

24
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:19,840
When they were at the intersection Enhörnaleden/Robert Anberg's road, the killer appeared on an electric bike, stopped and shot dead the 41-year-old.

The motif is believed to revenge a death shoot that took place the day before when George Shaya was shot dead, the event was part of the ongoing gang conflict between different phalanges in Södertälje.

27
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:57,770
The prosecutor's theory is that the murder of the 41-year-old was a so-called mistake.
 The shooting was the \ hfjärde shooting in Södertälje in a week.

28
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:08,679
The murder has been expected despite very high police presence in the area as a result of previous shootings in Södertälje and is founded in an infected conflict between two criminal groups in Södertälje.

29
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:23,857
After the murder of their friend the day, before probably performed by the Ronna side, the gang is revenge and bloodthirsty.
 Despite the massive police presence in Södertälje at the moment, they go out and spin for enemies.

30
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:38,302
The so -called Saltskog Falangen has a specific target they are looking for this evening.
 T who is linked to Ronna Falangen, T is appearance like the death victim and was near the murder scene but that the shooter was wrong.

31
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:53,414
Surveillance films show that the intended target T and two other people were at the Ron-A school on Robert Anberg's road 24 in Södertälje between 19:28 and 19:40 in the evening.

32
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:07,826

36
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:38,650
The same room as the rapper G1OCATOR in April 6, 2022 was seized within a day when his friend had been murdered in Norsborg.

37
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:46,289
According to the preliminary investigation protocol, the rapper is related to people who have previously been with Saltskog Falangen.

46
00:08:36,877 --> 00:08:44,917
One of the shots that hit the face was judged to be at least one close shot, a execution, fired in the Glock gun found on October 2.

47
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:54,825
As well as most noted gunshot injuries in the arms, back and chest.
 No visible damage was noted on the lower body.

48
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:59,795
According to several witnesses who also photographed, the shooter fled on an electric bike in the direction of Lina.

49
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:10,304

54
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:03,979
Because his actual age at the time of the murder is debated, we do not know which penalty scale becomes relevant if he is convicted of these crimes.
