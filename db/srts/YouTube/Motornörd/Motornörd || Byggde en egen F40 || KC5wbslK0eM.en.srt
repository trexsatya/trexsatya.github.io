1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
It could have been Alfa Romeo, but this particular body is very shy.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,960
-As the idea that you should build one yourself is completely crazy.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,200
Yes, that wasn't the idea from the beginning ...

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,260
... that's the only way to get something so I started.

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,340
-Hey!
 Well.

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,600
-How's it going?
 Well thank you, that's good.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,020
I changed the light so I try to fit a lid.

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,400
I removed the lid and will fix it now.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,100
-What is it for a car?

10
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,800
It is a Ferrari F40 replica of a 1988 model.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,440
I think the F40 is the most fresh Ferrarin so I want one so I did one.

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,700
-Which car!

13
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,760
I've done the whole car myself.

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,560
It is a pipe frame and the body is made of sheet metal.

15
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,215
I have done everything you see.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,800
-How long took this?

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,820
Yes, yes I started already in 2005.

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,260
I've done a little when there is time.
 Which I rarely had.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,960
Which all my friends know.

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,000
The car is an icon for me so it may take the time it takes.
 I think it's fun to keep up.

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,280
-Hehris have you done everything yourself?

22
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,320
Yes, I ordered beams home and started making a frame.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,580
Then I made a steel pipe chassis that I covered with sheet metal.

24
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,780
-Is the whole car a pipe frame building?
 Yes it is.

25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,360
Then you get the body and chassis as you want it.

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,760
If you were to buy a car and build on, it would be strange as the engine is at the back.

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,120
Then you have to buy a Toyota Mr2 or Pontiac Fiero but then the car will be completely wrong in the dimensions so it will be good.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,580
Then you have to do it right from the start and do a chassis yourself because there are none and buy.

29
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,700
-Yes I understand that.
 -What fantastic job you have done.

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,100
I am quite a lot of work.
 -As the idea that you should build one yourself is completely crazy.

31
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,260
Yes, that was not the idea from the beginning.
 It's the only way to get something so I started.

32
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,540
I have made the plate in this goat.

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,160
It is the only tool I have used.
 A homemade sheet metal and a hammer.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
-You're joking??
 No, that's all.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,260
-Is that the only ones?
 Yes, a knee or tire to bend some sheet metal.

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,500
That's how it went.
 Of that, it became this creation.

37
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,280
-And everything is in sheet metal?
 -It's not a kit-car that you built together?

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,760
No, it's no kit-car.

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,880
I have made my own frame and built the body pieces and sat on.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,240
It is a difficult body to build.
 All is swinged and bent back and forth.

41
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,240
There is sheet metal here and all the way up.

42
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,920
-You can only look at pictures?
 -You must have received the dimensions from somewhere.

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,740
Yes a friend of mine built a Lamborghini Countach.

44
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,940
And he thought I would build one for me but I said I wanted a F40 instead.

45
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,540
I had a Ferrari F40 toy car in scale 1:18 which I measured.

46
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,640
I have it in the cabinet over here.

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,620
It is this little car that I have peeled up from 1:18 to 1: 1.

48
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,600
And that's the one I've built everything after.

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,040
I haven't had a real car to build up but just this one.

50
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,740
-So you demolished a toy car?
 Yes exactly.

51
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,400
So you see what the car looks like and then you have looked at pictures online.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,100
It wasn't only a few years later I got hold of a real car so I could measure and the dimensions are very good.

53
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,840
-It's totally crazy!
 -How many Ferrari F40 are there in Sweden?

54
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,620
I don't know for sure.
 Know that there are 4 but there may be more.

55
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,260
It is difficult to find them because they are very rarely running.

56
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,900
-How many made Ferrari?

57
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:28,380
Ferrari made a little over 1100 cars but so people have crashed so you do not know how many are left.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,900
-I see that you like the F40 because you have all kinds of toys in this cabinet.

59
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,120
I have been a few over the years and when you have found someone you have bought.

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,360
-And I kept stumbling on something on the floor.

61
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,260
Yes it is my granddaughter's car that she goes around in.

62
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,140
It was just a small MC battery in from the beginning.
 So she was sad when the battery ran out.

63
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,840
We put in a 100 amp battery from a car so now she can drive all day if she wants to.

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,500
-I am completely mute and don't even know where to start.

65
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,800
-Where do you want us to start?
 We can start on the inside.

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,220
-It's no car you just jump in and out. No not directly it is low and tight to get into.

67
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,900
It is very wide edge and high threshold.

68
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:34,680
In here, the frame is and it is a crash zone because there is nothing that receives on the page.

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,140
So it's a pipe system inside.

70
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,960
-You sit a little oblique with your legs.
 Yes it is a bit like a Saab 900.

71
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,800
It is because of the front wheel is right here in front and so it was on the real car.

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,355
-Italen gorilla choir.
 Yes exactly.

73
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,000
I've made my steering wheel straight instead.
 The original is angled so it feels like you drive a bus.

74
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,960
This is a oscillate with a flat bottom so you can fit your legs underneath.

75
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,340
I think the steering wheel with a flat bottom is nicer.

76
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,240
I bought a Ferrari emblem and put in the middle.

77
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,080
I have chosen Sparco sprint chairs that I bought once in a while.

78
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,020
I think they fit well and the original also has red chairs.

79
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,800
I have used saber three -point belt.
 However, not all pieces are in place.

80
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,780
Also has regular belts that are a requirement from the car testing.

81
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,360
A 6-speed box from an Audi TDI.

82
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,120
-Many people who build use TDI gearbox.
 Yes exactly.

83
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,060
TDI gearbox can withstand much more turn from the engine.

84
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,820
It is a 01e gearbox from an Audi A4.

85
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,780
Curved sheet so it looks like an old -80s gear lever.

86
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,460
Yes exactly.
 Previously I had a regular one but this fits better.

87
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,380
Volt, temp for cylinders & water temp.

88
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,440
Then there are ordinary gasoline champions, oil, speedometer and tachometer.

89
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,060
-What is it for buttons under the voltmet?

90
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,480
It is the fan and the heat.

91
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,060
It is electrical heat as there is no water element in the car.

92
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,120
Then you would have to pull a lot of hoses for which there is no room so it became electric instead.

93
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,500
-Should we check out here then?
 Yes.

94
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,220
-What are you doing here?

95
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:39,640
I was not happy with the lights that sat here.
 I rebuild so it should fit in and be nicer.

96
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,340
I had to remove the lids so I could change.
 As you can see, it is a sheet metal.

97
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,360
When I cut off the lids, they got a little injured that had to be fixed.

98
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,675
-You have rebuilt so the lids should only be fitted?

99
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,820
Yes they should fit in and fix some of the plastic.
 -Ah, awesome!

100
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,560
-This is not really clear.

101
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,620
In here, a disc should be fixed and inserted.

102
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,980
The inner screens come from a truck.

103
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,880
-Ok, inner screens from a truck.
 I have cut to so it does not spray a lot of stone.

104
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,920
-What is hiding behind the cover plate?

105
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,380
Below there is a battery, fan to the compartment, brakes and oil to the clutch.

106
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,780
-What is that on a real F40?
 It is the same.

107
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,300
-There is there no place for a golf bag?

108
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,280
No, original there is a spare wheel there.
 But I chose that.

109
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,280
I could put a wheel down we the radiator but do not want to.

110
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:55,240
In the front I have done the same as the Lemans model.
 It has a great intake in the middle.

111
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,980
I'd rather have it but still the original front but I don't want the headlights that sat original.

112
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,660
Then I chose to mix the original and Lemans front.

113
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,360
-The cooler sits right behind the gills in the front?
 Yes it does.

114
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,060
Then I have chosen to make the hole in the front much larger.
 Original is the hole much smaller than this.

115
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,260
I chose to make that hole much larger so that the air can go through easier.

116
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,380
This means that the car is pressed against the hill when driving.

117
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,400
My dad made a fuel cap.
 He thought it was unnecessary to buy.

118
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,740
We turned up some tank caps that we could use.

119
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,240
-What is it for decal back on the screen?

120
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,820
It also sits on the real cars.
 -Yeah, they do.

121
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,080
-What does it say?
 Pininfarina?

122
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,800
Yes it was he who designed the body together with Enzo Ferrari.

123
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,460
-But so, that you got to all angles.

124
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,820
At first I thought it was angular.
 But the body is round and bent in all directions.

125
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,020
It has been very difficult to do.

126
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,920
This part consists of a single piece but this is a lot of small pieces.

127
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,680
Small pieces so you could get the shape together.

128
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,000
-The door handle.
 I am my own design.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,900
This is actually a lock to a window area.

130
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,260
-What does it matter?
 No, it works.

131
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,480
-Is it so it looks original?
 Yes, that's what the door handle looks like.

132
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,460
-The inserts your finger here to open.
 Yes exactly.

133
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,920
Is this car ready?

134
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,820
No, it will probably never be done.
 I am a little stingy and always want to rebuild things.

135
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:47,060
Have always tried to build something cheap.
 But then you find something more expensive that you screw there.

136
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,440
Everything works and it can be driven.

137
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,740
Unfortunately, we unfortunately no more can.
 You will see the rest in the next section.

138
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,000
But until then comment, subscribe and like, of course we will see in the next section.

139
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
-What do the taillights cost?

140
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,980
Ah, they cost SEK 5000 each when I bought them.

141
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,820
-You're joking!!
 It is SEK 20,000 for 4.
 Yes...
