1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,739
I say it is 50 shades of black and four shades of red orange.

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,699
Not very beautiful.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,340
It will never ever become original again, I can say.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,583
No!
 Not after I was here either.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,290
You and I have a project that will be one or two parts.

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,119
We'll see how many there are.

7
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:29,219
What is the thing we should do?

8
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:33,299
It started with someone who commented on your feature with the hint.

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,409
Yes, after the section, a viewer heard about it.

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,069
And I thought I recognized the name.

11
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:42,810
And then you answer to that guy, I chase him.

12
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:48,040
He was of course with Rat Bastard Crew Sweden and he has a Volvo 140.

13
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:51,860
Could it be something more iconic than even the right piece too?

14
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:54,180
It is higher front and lower rear.

15
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:58,220
I bought it in SÃ¤ffle from a young guy.

16
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:03,900
He had a little tired of it and would renovate some cheva instead.

17
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:07,640
Threw it out and I snapped.

18
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,060
From the beginning, the idea was that I would do

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,300
an original renovation on it, but I first

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,099
When I got home with it he was in much worse condition

21
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:20,340
than I thought, even though it was inspected two days

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,849
before I bought it.

23
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:24,489
The last inspection in life for exactly 50.

24
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:27,069
So when I got home with it so I discovered

25
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:30,900
That two shock absorbers were stuck with just one bolt.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,099
The other end hung completely loose and all four feathers were so exhausted

27
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:37,900
So they hung on the rubber impact.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,849
Bad repairs a little everywhere holes in the exhaust system.

29
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,799
How it went through the inspection, I do not understand that at all.

30
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:48,370
Much like the inspection was ten meters away from

31
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,839
And looked through a dirty milk glass.

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,410
But it was inspected that way.

33
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,870
I fixed well what was most urgent as I thought

34
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,349
There are brakes and front wagons and such things.

35
00:02:03,669 --> 00:02:05,830
But now there was no original renovation.

36
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:09,139
I actually had that thought for almost a year

37
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,669
That I would grab it.

38
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:15,360
It wasn't very rust on it.

39
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,309
However, the repairs were a bit like that you can say.

40
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,389
But roasting is, they are beautiful in some way.

41
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,619
After all, the rear screens are epic.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,339
Hahaha!.

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,139
Someone has stood with a sledgehammer and walked on there

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,800
And then they have thrown over the features with putty spade with such stripes in as well as

45
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,360
And drawn so you see the marks after the brush strokes on the front screen.

46
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:39,939
Yes, it is beautiful.

47
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,699
It will be interesting.

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,939
He was probably a brick and not a car plate maker.

49
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,039
The one who was on this one.

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,569
Have you had a 140?

51
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,410
Oh, I actually had a 140 from 1973.

52
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,320
But the big blinker, yes I rebuilt it.

53
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,783
The first rat I did Horny Hildur was called it.

54
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:06,259
It had three antennas with fox tail on each, one on the roof

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,179
And two on each on the rear wing.

56
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,199
It went off in the middle.

57
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,869
It was a flight of 5-6 meters so lands a little hard.

58
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,309
Then the entire rear axle and the stays and the berries loosen.

59
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,860
Everything went off the entire frame to the roof that held it together.

60
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:24,729
So I hope this one is in better condition.

61
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
I think so.

62
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,159
What plane was it in your head now?

63
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:31,399
Without revealing what it should do, no one knows what to do.

64
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,229
Green is good.

65
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,579
That's what I'm thinking.

66
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:41,550
Acid-Green has lots of different Green Goblin I think there is someone called.

67
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,678
It's exciting.

68
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:45,490
It's a lot of strange colors.

69
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,369
And then I drive with my pens too, my Montana, Easter and Molotov.

70
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,720
It will be a claner version of the heap maybe.

71
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,059
Now we drive on.
 It's a little time pressure so we can get ready.

72
00:03:57,059 --> 00:04:00,400
Today anyway, so that we can continue to be finished tomorrow.

73
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,500
This will take a while.

74
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Yes, it will take a while.

75
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,229
I have to think a lot and it is very busy and takes time.

76
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:10,727
This one, it will never ever become original again, I can say.

77
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,759
No, not after I was here either.

78
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,830
It says a lot that then it is run.

79
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,230
Then he is a work of art instead.

80
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,188
He has simply ruined the car, surely thinks some.

81
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:25,839
How can you do that way?

82
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,679
It's like this.
 We live in a free country.

83
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,470
Yes, everyone is entitled to an opinion.

84
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,160
That doesn't mean I agree.

85
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,200
No, I really like it blowing that just flutter even though I tense.

86
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,250
And I who are so long stand on toe even.

87
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,600
Not just easier to mask the taillights.

88
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,660
Male like this.

89
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,359
The lighting.
 You can only cover that lighting with some tape.

90
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,750
Yes, here you see how good the spring is to hold up

91
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,639
This standard stuff.

92
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:56,799
When the stuff is 50 years old.

93
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:57,769
Then it will be like this.

94
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:02,223
Then you have to have hefty pieces of wood or bumpers.

95
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,259
Original Volvo Planka.

96
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,359
Yes an original Volvo plank.

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,445
Yes, it must be easier to tape than to do this.

98
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:10,548
No.

99
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:21,840
That is the original color.

100
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,390
The original color is dark gray that was only available in two year models, 1968-69.

101
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:33,149
And just that it is a -68A is the only year model

102
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,160
as it was with white gallon decor and the white interior existed anyway

103
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,760
What I have been able to get together with the dark gray only.

104
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,729
So that was probably the reason I bought it from the beginning

105
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:47,889
And thought about doing an original renovation on it.

106
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:51,850
Stylish original color and it is a unique combination on Volvo.

107
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,079
Must love the finish on your taping.

108
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,919
This is something I can't buy any cars

109
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:00,440
In my days there have been some.

110
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:03,059
What is happening now?
 Should it be covered?

111
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:06,790
Well, yes, this color will not remain.

112
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,979
Then we get to see a lot that ends up here on the wall

113
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,790
As you say it blows a little.

114
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,431
Here it blows from all directions.

115
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:14,640
But I like this garage is like unlimited.

116
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,229
It is the free ceiling height.

117
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,429
You can see it that way.
 Can put this.

118
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:23,660
It will not blow away I hope.

119
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,450
Press it oh well it sits now.

120
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,729
So 70s plastic.

121
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:35,690
There you always had 50 trout you pressed between the list here

122
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,299
And there they pressed them with 50 trout.

123
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,260
Then it stopped sounding when you went over 150.

124
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:46,604
It started with seeing Doc down at Elmia

125
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:49,850
Actually, that he will be so awesome

126
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,470
To see what he finds for something.

127
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,119
Yes, he has his ideas.

128
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,470
He has it and they change themselves second by second.

129
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,470
So yes, we will see what results will be.

130
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,829
And the finish here, I really sanded down here.

131
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,959
Looks good.

132
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:10,619
You feel how polished here is really what I thought was dirt.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,682
But it wasn't here.

134
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,561
That's how.

135
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,470
Yes.
 You should have it there.

136
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,369
And today I have reinforcement of my mini me too.

137
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,259
He must be involved.

138
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,899
I teach him, I teach him everything I can.

139
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:30,899
I saw that he has already started painting on your car.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,519
Yes, of course he has full access to my inside on the car.

141
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,600
The decor is actually as much part of as I am.

142
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,400
Or what do you say Killi.

143
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,140
Can you show how much you can paint in there.

144
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:48,839
It is completely new that yes will fix.

145
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,829
Now it gets pink in the car.

146
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,040
This is one of the onsets.

147
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,809
They are replenished these too.

148
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,199
Can you buy these on ...

149
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:02,750
When you fill this now that it starts to come here

150
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,910
Damn what it shines pink.

151
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,089
So now you can paint pink painted on the inside.

152
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
No, the inside of the door.

153
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:16,149
On the door I'm there.

154
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,570
Wow, make a skull?

155
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,379
Show what you do.

156
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,320
There is some color that sits on the doors now.

157
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,020
Absolutely wonderful to know that Killi has been painting everything.

158
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:36,300
He can help me all the time.

159
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
That is the best one can do instead of letting the kids

160
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,280
Just sit and wait and watch.

161
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,619
You should let them participate.

162
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,719
It is probably the most important thing.

163
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,515
Now we will start where we will start with a little dark green,

164
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,330
put on the sides

165
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,460
And then we will move to another shade and further and further.

166
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,520
Damn, now I'm so hungry at Start.

167
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,800
That was really green.

168
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
Hmm .. sorry.

169
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,119
Paint around the blinker so.

170
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,849
I can control a little indeed.

171
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,950
The cap is very good!

172
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:14,049
Got the tip calligraphy cap for it runs very wide

173
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,160
and it sprays a lot of color at once so it covers at once

174
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:20,775
Also as soon as possible.

175
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:24,869
Oh!
 Yes, wait until you manage to blow all over you.

176
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,539
Now it is not visible, but I have the world's best increase in the back.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,741
Do you have tubes or?

178
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:33,490
Two hockey pucks from Biltema.

179
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,590
Yes that is good.

180
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:37,969
Always works with hockey pucks.

181
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:40,880
I learn to be able to fill in the car fairly quickly

182
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,400
When everything fine is all that takes time.

183
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,010
Everything else you do.

184
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:52,669
Oh what a nice repair it was here.

185
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:02,609
Thought it would blow less here, though.

186
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
It becomes like a wind trap instead.

187
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,250
But I say 4-5 different shades of green that I should use.

188
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,150
It has already dried.

189
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Oh I will have workouts.

190
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,000
But what kind of drying time is like this?

191
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,250
2 seconds about.

192
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:33,440
It also dries directly.

193
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:34,850
It is dry on the other side.

194
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,730
Which one should we use Sandra do you think?

195
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,890
It's not just six, it's two at the bottom

196
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:41,209
Also on each.

197
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:47,359
We are far from clear.

198
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,799
I want to get it reasonably uniform to begin with.

199
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,137
Pretty monotonous job.

200
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,414
It is.

201
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,940
This is what is boring to lay ground.

202
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,840
Yes, to base yes.

203
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,792
Do you take one more like that ....

204
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,953
null

205
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:13,671
Do you think the color is enough?

206
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:18,289
We'll see how it will solve considering a lot of colors with me.

207
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,609
But if I have 40 cans, I think I have a little to take off.

208
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,020
Nice to get it a little more uniform.

209
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,830
Will be easier to drive on then.

210
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,530
Looks like it's the grinc that you paint.

211
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,989
Yes, that's about this.

212
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,239
But the waffle, stop blowing, it blows in all directions now all of a sudden.

213
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,299
So there are throwing winds sometimes.

214
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:51,609
Hell how fast it dries.

215
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:54,570
The sun is shining on us and it pulls right away.

216
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,450
Now I run some half -paint this gray too.

217
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,760
Love that the cracks come out when I do.

218
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:06,459
Bird shit on the roof where it should remain.

219
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,260
What did you say?

220
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,700
The three spots with bird shit on the roof are the ones left.

221
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:13,580
We can remove them if you want, but it is optional.

222
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,490
You can do so.

223
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,590
But that's not right.

224
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
It's not art.

225
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:24,369
I was thinking about one thing.
 How should you be able to paint the ceiling?

226
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:30,630
I stand with an open door and paint improvise and overcome,

227
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,242
So you do.

228
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:34,610
It is not the first roof I paint considering cards I am.

229
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,710
But it usually works.

230
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,886
Though the worst that it blows so hell

231
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:42,929
That we may be able to take something that is a little longer than me.
 You never know.

232
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,376
In that direction?
 Yes, in that direction.

233
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,420
Drive closer and so a little faster.

234
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,340
Then it goes down as much color as possible even though it blows.

235
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,190
It must not reveal anything.

236
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:56,390
Yes I know.

237
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:59,100
Then when I get back from work tomorrow, when it's done.

238
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,080
Wait, you haven't seen anything?

239
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:02,890
Well, I know it.

240
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:03,680
Is it a break now?

241
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,650
Yes a little break.

242
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,730
Coffee break here so.

243
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,510
I have well bombed the car some now with gray

244
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:11,609
And green in different shades.

245
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,160
Have started with some of the design that will be.

246
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,680
We are out in the largest garage available, nature.

247
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,080
And it blows something terrible in all directions.

248
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,930
At the same time, I think I don't blown so much,

249
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,540
Then I would not have had to use as many cans

250
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,740
As I used now when the sun is on.

251
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,220
Warms up the plate when you burn and it is in the montana color

252
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,539
From highlights where the bracket directly dries at once.

253
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:40,140
It really does when you paint the car.

254
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:45,390
Then comes the incredible work that you put into rust cooking on this one.

255
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,880
I wonder many centimeters with putty it is, especially at the back.

256
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:53,320
The rear screens are absolutely fantastic on both sides as well.

257
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,140
Looks like those who have a flood with bread roller.

258
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:02,696
But it is about the same as here around the door handles.

259
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:05,774
But the grinding looks like they have good on

260
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:08,710
With the sharp side of the angle grinder.

261
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,309
Under work they have put down type above all the final finish

262
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,150
They put down non -existent.

263
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,730
That's what I like with this whole nice lamp

264
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,083
After 73 ans' front screen also there with gigantic flashers.

265
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,322
DN is cool this one a real 140.

266
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,740
This is nothing you had done an original renovation on.

267
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,280
No, then you had probably changed every part of both rear screens,

268
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:40,300
The front screens, the bottom, the top.

269
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,240
It is fantastic!

270
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,770
I love this.

271
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:46,119
Yes, they have pulled a farmer's screw on both rear.

272
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,219
The boxes are stuck with a farmer's screw.

273
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,369
It's male.

274
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:51,330
Farma screw should be used for a lot.

275
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,600
My exhaust system sits up with the same screw.

276
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,440
But it was fortunate that they did not drill into the tank

277
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:58,630
or something.

278
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:01,710
It is usually quite long screws too, kind of one

279
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,809
and a half to two centimeters.

280
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,150
You can screw through a lot when you are doing it,

281
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,820
But they have actually succeeded in the rear window because they have not cracked the boxes.

282
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,420
It's a little cheating I think.

283
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,500
But now I have soon covered so all the old is gone.

284
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:19,929
I'll fix the front and rear end too so it's over, painted and clear.

285
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,500
Then I can start driving.

286
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,070
With the design I will run a bit with tape and stuff and put up lines and stuff.

287
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,660
It is going to be fun.

288
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,760
And chalk should also be used.

289
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,419
For once, I shouldn't even use anything

290
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,440
Detergent I think.

291
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,739
I don't think detergent with this time.

292
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,318
It was a shame that I didn't have it with me.

293
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:40,400
It's stainless.

294
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,049
I've had this front.

295
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,563
I like the grounding.
 Yes it is amazing.

296
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,600
It is part of the whole car I think.

297
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:52,584
And if it works, it works.

298
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,349
It is a classic temporary permanent repair.

299
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,991
This one you mean?
 Yes, it is the best ground ever.

300
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,789
It works, why should you change it?

301
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,820
It doesn't matter where I stand because it blows me anyway.

302
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,575
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,849
But incredibly advanced the opener.

304
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,020
Love this.

305
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:20,860
Why is a white in here for?

306
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,479
Ask any previous owner who has started a renovation?

307
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:25,890
No.

308
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:28,994
When I bought it had it had

309
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:34,080
Seven different owners in seven years.
 And rolled 100 miles.

310
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,679
Many people have started and given up.

311
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,460
The deep sighs of the deep sighs believe yes.

312
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,400
Damn, this is going to be cool.

313
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,653
Where are you in the process?

314
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:46,150
I am long before what I do now I can say.

315
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,929
It is now that I think about lines and also some decor that I should do.

316
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,812
Now I'm going to draw some lines here.

317
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:56,880
I'll make a screen.
 Just get just for

318
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,559
That I can make a screen.

319
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,390
So it is not Finlir who takes time.

320
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,939
It will take time this.

321
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,210
I really like the screen sitting loose here

322
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,829
And that it really finish.

323
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,319
Amen fucking moldings and sit loose.

324
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,442
Ah, it was a difficult line.

325
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:27,180
There you can say that it is starting to get.

326
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,200
So fun to start when you start with the lines,

327
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Because that's when it really starts to what in?

328
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,729
It is starting to look really cool.

329
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:38,073
Then it should be shaded by 3D and then I will do some other stuff too.

330
00:17:38,854 --> 00:17:41,199
Crackling and glitter spray.

331
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,700
But this is starting to be fun so now I put the first one with black.

332
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,499
Then I haven't really decided yet that some parts

333
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:52,819
won't be with black lines but i put black as a background only

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,933
And then another color puts over.

335
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:59,359
The gray becomes very very nice together with with black.

336
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:02,770
I think that looks great, but the green will need

337
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:04,650
Another color in the end I think.

338
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,489
So we'll see what it gets.

339
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,989
It will be a surprise I know.

340
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,530
I think it's fucking awesome.

341
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,939
I am terribly excited about what it will be in the end.

342
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:15,170
Right now it is green.

343
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,020
AAA.

344
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:19,199
A little gray, but I like that it is two tons so the ceiling will be.

345
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:20,534
Yes you but ...

346
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:24,979
I had hoped it would be a little plum lile or something.

347
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,010
Now I am not in such a period in my life.

348
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:30,770
That's just the beginning.

349
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:33,640
In that I will work tomorrow too so we can work completely undisturbed

350
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,430
And I can't see any difference in the result anymore.

351
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,130
And then it's a damn plum red stuff.

352
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,189
So it will be a completely different car when I see it tomorrow.

353
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,260
Should we leave then?
 Yeah!

354
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,889
Then we continue tomorrow.
 To be continued.
