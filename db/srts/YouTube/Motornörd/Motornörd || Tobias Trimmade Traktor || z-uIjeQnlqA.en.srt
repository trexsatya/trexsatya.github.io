1
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,740
Hey, what's up?
 Great!

2
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,520
Should we look at a rally car today?
 Here you had nail tires.

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,480
Yes it can be good to have sometimes.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,800
Today we will look at my Fordson dexta with a 5 cylinder Volvo engine in.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
-Fordson?
 Yes a tractor ...

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,460
-A tractor!?

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,880
-Where do you have it?
 It stands here outside.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,540
What is this?
 It is a Fordson DEXTA from 1964.

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,020
-What do you use it for?
 I have to compete with it.

10
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,740
I run a tractor race, tractor-speedway and tractor-cross we run in Målilla.

11
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,580
-Tractor-cross?
 Yes we drive on a cross track.

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,260
-Is it even possible?
 It is possible but it is bounce.

13
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,300
-It's no suspension on a tractor?
 No suspension at all just the tires that swing.

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:19,440
We are completely stuck in the chair without cushioning.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,240
It works but it feels in the body when you have run some race.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,140
-Was there several different branches?

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,900
For the most part we run TRAKOR-RACE it is slalom and then we drive between set bales.

18
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,240
We run 5-6 competitions a year starting in June until October.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,460
-Is there any competition in the future?
 Yes it is Hylletofta on September 14th.

20
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,780
That's what we are charging for right now.
 May hope the stuff holds.

21
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,300
There has been some problems this year because it tempts pretty hard on the stuff.

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:00,800
It is a completely standard Volvo 850 engine with original crankshes, etc., it is not opened.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,840
A little for a single tractor in really but you learn to drive it.

24
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,660
How do you get the idea to put a Volvo car engine in a tractor?

25
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,440
Hmmm ... you have too much free time.

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,260
-Who have come up with the idea to trim a tractor?

27
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,900
Yes that is a good question ... I think it started with that ...

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,800
Rickard Nilsson from Gotland who unfortunately is no longer with us.

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,940
He started by posting movies on Youtube.
 Terror tractor.

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,480
I think many engine enthusiasts know who Rickard was.

31
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,700
It was well where it really started.

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,920
When Rickard posted his movies on Youtube, I kept building my own tractor.

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,760
It was a coincidence for a friend had been and looked at a tractor.

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:56,000
There is a T22A with a straight 6a diesel D24 lying next to which they have started to build on.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Should you buy it?
 Yes I can do that ... so I brought it home.

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,480
It stood in the workshop for a few years before I built it together.

37
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:13,100
It was not supposed that I would compete with it but just just a fun thing to build a tractor with a car engine.

38
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,960
Then was it a friend outside Sävsjö who asked if I would be on a tractor race?

39
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,340
What does that mean?
 I said.

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,500
Well you drive slalom between bales, etc.
 Okay, I can join.

41
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,880
I went to the scrap and picked up a cabin arch that I mounted and competed.

42
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,300
The first race I was 2a.

43
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,660
It gave added flavor ...

44
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,040
... it just continued and then more people were interested in the municipality.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,900
Then we started a team.
 Team Hylletofta.

46
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,560
We have been 5-6 active.

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,760
This is where it started for me and I have been doing since 2013 so there have been some competitions.

48
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,860
My old tractor went off in the middle of a competition.

49
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,280
Then it was start and finish in the same place.

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,500
When I got into the finish, it was starting pits I drove over and then the tractor started to jump ...

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,100
... when it had bounced twice so it bangs and then the tractor was like a folding knife.

52
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,300
It was a bit nasty and that tractor is cooked today.

53
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,540
I have sold it to a friend.

54
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,020
-You have 2 tractors here What is the difference between these?

55
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,880
This is a Fordson DEXTA and the other is a Fordson Super DEXTA.

56
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,500
Fordson is an English tractor.

57
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,480
It came in the early 1960s, perhaps even in the late 50's around 1958-59.

58
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,080
I don't have 100% control over history.

59
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,600
This particular model has learned a lot because I have screwed a lot with it.

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,900
This engine has a little more horses than DEXTRA has.

61
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,520
Super DEXTRA was a snap better than Dextra you could say.

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,680
-What do you use this tractor for?
 I have it as a truck.

63
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,700
I built a pair of pallet forks together so I can lift all my gearboxes and rear axles.

64
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,980
So it doesn't tempt my back too much.

65
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,880
It is a farm's wear and toss tractor you can say.

66
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,980
The idea is that it will get a refresh.

67
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,860
Now I have bought so many tractors because they break.

68
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,200
It is difficult to get hold of parts.

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,080
When I drove the rear axle last year, I called five different tractor scraps and there were no stuff.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,180
Then I got a little panic because it took me 2 months to get hold of spare parts.

71
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,300
I got hold of this tractor in Hylletofta of all places.

72
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,220
I posted an ad on Facebook that I was looking for parts.

73
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,480
Then I got a text message from a friend who had a tractor standing and asked you want to buy it.

74
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,680
Then I bought this and picked parts for the race tractor.

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,580
This is a standard tractor.
 And I don't know what to call the other ...

76
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,080
We call the little murf.

77
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,380
A pretty fun building.
 It has been spent many hours on it.

78
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,640
After work, every weekend.
 All the free time you had over you on the tractor.

79
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,120
Many friends pushed that now it is soon Målilla you have to finish with the tractor.

80
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,460
A week before Målilla we made the first start on the tractor.

81
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,200
Then it was 03:44 when it started in the garage.

82
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,840
Then my friend Jesper Fager was here and connected the computer because it did not light.

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,300
Then we had problems with trigger and get all the settings correctly.

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,580
But Jesper said I don't go home first it starts and we were very tired everyone.

85
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,720
People who were here watching went home because it was in the middle of the night, it is really crazy.

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,700
I am passionate about what you just want it to work.

87
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,820
When we got the tractor running we were pretty tired so we continued on Monday.

88
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:01,040
Then when I was out and tested and realized that it leaks oil from crankshaft seal.

89
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,920
Then you became quite less and said that you ignore this and can not hold on anymore.

90
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll be going to Målilla next year ...

91
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,600
... but then the friends came and said we help you remove the engine.

92
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,380
Call and ask if you can be free tomorrow.

93
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,300
At 22:45 we rolled the tractor into the workshop and at 00:20 the engine lay on the floor.

94
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,340
I tore flywheels and crankshaft seal.

95
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,880
I called Volvo on Wednesday morning and ordered a packing box and had it within 2 hours.

96
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,660
Put the tractor together and tested in the evening.

97
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,080
And on Thursday we mapped track towers on the street.

98
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,580
With the help of Natanael Ceder from Maxxtuning in Vrigstad.

99
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,420
Then it went away to Målilla.

100
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,060
I was thinking about one thing.
 The front car when I compare to the original tractor.

101
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,540
This is what the original front car looks like.

102
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,300
This one is a little reinforced.

103
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,940
Because I have built a frame on the tractor.

104
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,560
So I have had to move out the stabilization stages.

105
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,160
They sit in the outer holes watch the other tractor so they sit in the interior.

106
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,500
I have widened the shoulder.
 You can see that there are holes here.

107
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,020
I have moved out the shoulder and sanded out of the holes.

108
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,820
So I can angle the spindle joints so I get another camber.

109
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,420
I see it.
 The tires point outwards.

110
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,500
It is because that will go more on the inner edge of the wheel.

111
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,840
Actually, you want to angle the spindle joint forward so the wheels fold more.

112
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,240
Here is the wheel straight or almost so it points inward.

113
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,360
You have welded these stays on the inside.

114
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,580
Yes, the tractor I have extended 10 cm from original.

115
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,400
If we look at the back then I have made a sleeve.

116
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,940
As I have turned and knocked in and welded.

117
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,280
There are others who have built in a similar way that they have looked at.

118
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,580
They have had problems that they have gone off therefore I have strengthened on the inside.

119
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,940
So you have welded on a plate on the back.

120
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,040
Why do you have weights on it on the side?

121
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,820
Because the tractor is so short.
 It works differently from competition to competition.

122
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,760
This one is very smooth and I easily turn it around.

123
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,080
The disadvantage of a short wheelbase is that it wants to bounce and goes very much on the rear wheels.

124
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,460
And then you want to get the weight down.

125
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,440
I have made an abdominal plate in 15 mm sheet so it helps.

126
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,400
If it is not enough and wants to get the bite into the rear axle.

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,760
Then I have put weights here that weigh 40 kg each.
 So I have 120 kg on each side.

128
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,620
Then I feel that the tractor becomes steady.

129
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,300
Is the protection on the Speedway protection page?

130
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,360
Yes and for tractor cross.
 It is when we drive several at the same time.

131
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,860
When we drive slalom we drive on each path.

132
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,380
When it can be close contact, we have these pipes.

133
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,340
That pipe should be along so nothing can come in between.

134
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,060
-How phase you got this puzzle together ...

135
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,880
It was to think about first and foremost to think how long you want the tractor.

136
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,300
The engine is based on quite far.

137
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,160
I wanted hydraulic coupling so it should be easy to connect.

138
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,680
This holds the gearbox underneath and I have made an adapter.

139
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,480
To get the car engine together with the tractor.

140
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,500
Many times an adapter plate is built on the tractor or against the tractor's explosive cover.

141
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,980
In this case, I chose to cut away so much on the blast cover.

142
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,220
I took the angle grinder and cut it off.

143
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,360
Then I talked to a friend here in Sävsjö who works at a company with a mill.

144
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,240
He milled off the cover so I had to measure all dimensions.

145
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,860
I have taken from the dimensions from a Volvo 850 input shaft.

146
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,500
But has the tractor's input shaft.

147
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:06,660
I drive with a flywheel from rear axle parts and a Sachs 765 pressure plate.

148
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,040
There is no longer the same clutch pedal.
 I have taken it from a Volvo tractor.

149
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,060
It becomes like you drive a car.

150
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,280
For original, you switch and brake with the heel.

151
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:29,480
When driving you can decouple with the whole foot but with the heel.

152
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,280
Then it will be tough if you have a hard pressure plate.

153
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,680
So we have the cab.
 There we have come to the conclusion that we have to cross the cage.

154
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,280
It is if you overturn so it holds together better.

155
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,680
I have chosen to put pipes here.
 So it holds together better in the corner.

156
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,640
Have also chosen to tick the rear according to the rules.

157
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,100
I have made double crosses at the back to make it the belt.

158
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,880
The cabin is really just bolted at the screen an iron that goes down into the trumpet.

159
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,100
-The trumpet?
 That is called the rear axle.

160
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,380
Because it looks like a trumpet?
 Yes exactly.

161
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,600
Battery I see, is it a catch tank underneath?
 Yes.

162
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,640
-To a tractor?
 With it shooting, you do not want to lose soup.

163
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,400
Since I go E85 you do not want to lose the pressure.

164
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,640
Soup tank is a former air tank for a truck.

165
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,120
I put it back so I have an escape route if it starts to burn.

166
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,080
Original sits the tank under the steering wheel.

167
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,020
I don't want E85 there.

168
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,780
Should I overturn with the tractor and it would run the E85 on me it wouldn't be so nice.

169
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,060
That's why I want it behind me so I can escape.

170
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,680
Wide tires it was.

171
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,240
Yes I have switched to this season.
 I've been running with diagonal tires before.

172
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,320
They sat on the tractor before and tires cost quite a lot.

173
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,260
The tractor has been a little bumpy and I have not received the real grip in the starts.

174
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,400
Radial tires are much softer.

175
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,600
I have chosen tires that fit the rim that they become straight.

176
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,620
If I swing on the tractor you can see that it is soft tires.

177
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,280
The tractor is not so bumpy anymore.

178
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,260
I had some problems when I was driving speedway and it went like a duck kid.

179
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:31,040
It is probably because it is short.
 If it starts to bounce, it continues.

180
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,020
The only thing you can do about it is to stay but you don't ...

181
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,640
... first in goal wins.
 Then you can't stop.

182
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:44,320
Why had you dubbed tires before?
 It is so when you ball ideas with others who compete.

183
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,720
Rickard and some others also had ice tires ...

184
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,960
Yes, ice tires are probably good so you drive on that idea.

185
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,040
That was the first thing I had on was probably ice tire.

186
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,700
I have run that in the speedway.

187
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,980
Then others say that it works just as well with 3 ribs tires.

188
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,280
I had problems in the beginning that it goes up on the rear wheels.

189
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,520
The first competition in Målilla I made a giants at the start.

190
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,960
When the tractor struck, the rim was flat because the tires are too hard.

191
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,020
So it broke the rims for me so I went home and balled ideas with others.

192
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,560
I cut out a couple of edges that I weld stuck on the inside of the rim.

193
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,360
The rims I have in there are reinforced.

194
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,020
Now I have tried to run original tractor tires and then it can withstand more bumps.

195
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,800
And it gets a little right.

196
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,620
It controls well and I never change tires now.

197
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,960
Before, I was changing all the time but it is hard.

198
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,900
-What is this?
 Why do you have one?

199
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,460
It is the strength floor that sits there.
 It is orbitrol control.

200
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,760
-What is orbitrol for something?
 Hydraulic control.

201
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,160
-Hydraulic control?
 Do you have to have it?

202
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,880
It is much easier to swing.

203
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,520
If you have completely mechanically as original and you use the steering wheel ball and the nip to you have the kid wrist left ...

204
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,400
Hahaha!!

205
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,000
Many people get hurt when it shrugs.

206
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,780
Many people have done badly.
 -You learn the hard way.

207
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,260
It had become very much steering when driving slalom.

208
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,860
Then they had to be stepped back and forth all the time.

209
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,480
Therefore, I have chosen to build power steering.

210
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,240
Then this is a very special sport ... -Yo thank you!

211
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,420
You have to be a little stupid in your head to keep up with this.

212
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,100
It jumps and foams and the horns grow out.

213
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,580
But it's terribly fun.

214
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:57,200
We have the benefit of checking ideas with each other.
 No one is secret on competition.

215
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,720
If you ask the others how they have done, they are honest and help.

216
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,860
That's what is so fun about this.

217
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,760
-What do you have for backgrounds that are competing?
 Are you all doing tractors?

218
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,800
Many have agriculture.

219
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:20,140
I grew up in Sävsjö but have also been a lot in Hylletofta because my mother grew up there.

220
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,840
I was very much with Grandma and Grandpa when I was little.

221
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:28,520
It is well there from I have received it because I work with tractors now.

222
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,760
It is well from where I have been given the interest.

223
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,640
The engine is fully visible here.
 I we can lift off the hood you will see.

224
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,140
Here I have my little screwdriver that I always have with me.

225
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,060
This must be easier than screwing a car?

226
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,460
It is open so you can access everything smoothly.

227
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,380
The engine I found on Facebook.

228
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:57,860
It was a loose engine from a Volvo 850 with gearbox and front car.

229
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,320
I picked up in the engine in Husqvarna and knew nothing about this.

230
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,860
It went around and it felt like it was comp in it so it had to come home.

231
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,760
I have changed cam strap and some other things.
 It's a 16T so it's a small turbo.

232
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,680
It means that I have charge pressure very early.

233
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,880
The engine is completely standard.

234
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:25,060
It is said that they can handle about 300hp and it has lasted 3 years.

235
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,500
I have had help building a manifold.
 -It looks like a snake.

236
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,460
Yep, it's designed by Jesper Fager.

237
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,320
There are straight pipes on this.
 Yep there are straight pipes.

238
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,000
It's screampipe out of the Wastegaten.

239
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,380
I have pipes here that go from the cab to the front axle.

240
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:50,900
It is a reinforcement because I cracked the other tractor so you want it as strongly as possible.

241
00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:00,320
What I have been thinking about updating for next season is the brakes.

242
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:00,860
It is drum brakes original and that is what we drive with.

243
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:08,260
Drum brakes stop working fairly quickly.
 You disassemble and change the evidence ...

244
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,320
... run 2-3 competitions so they hardly take again.
 Brakes are quite nice to have.

245
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,740
The idea is to build disc brakes.
 This has been thought about how it should go.

246
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,600
This has been changed to disc brakes so there are ideas to build for next season.

247
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,120
It is probably the next step to go.

248
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,900
-Do you have a 4-point belt?
 Yeah.

249
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,560
I have one that is quite wide.

250
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,100
Otherwise, it cuts in because it bounces so much.

251
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,340
The chair is silently mounted so the only suspension available is the wheels that swing.

252
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:54,880
When I have the wheel straight and full steering wheel is 2 laps but I never think about that.

253
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,380
You see that Christmas is straight ahead.
 Because it's orbitrol control ...

254
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,000
When has run a race, the steering wheel ball is around here but I never think about that.

255
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,100
-Is that gas?
 Yes it is hand gas and there is foot gas.

256
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,320
You have 2 other pedals what is it?
 It's the brake.

257
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,600
For every wheel?
 There you have left and right.

258
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,160
Well, you press one of them when you want to swing.
 Yes, just I just brake with the heel.

259
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,280
When I turn left, I press the pedal.
 Similarly and I will swing the other way.

260
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,980
But when it bounces so much how do you know which pedal to press?

261
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,660
It sits in your head.

262
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,440
Now 2an is gear back and 3an forward and the hill back.

263
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,900
You see that I have welded an iron here.
 That is why one gear is here.

264
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,320
I don't want to get it when I put in 3an gear.
 It has happened that I got in one.

265
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,780
Then it screams in the gearbox.

266
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,800
Therefore, I have made a stop so I can't get in one.

267
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,840
Here I have charging pressure, water temp, oil pressure and oil temp.

268
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,360
Here I have charging and oil pressure on regular diodes.

269
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,940
Would probably not need any meters because you do not have time to look at them anyway ...

270
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,260
-What is it so breaks?

271
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,740
Everything possible ....

272
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,740
I have had problems with gearbox and rear axles.

273
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,200
Here we have the problem.
 Here is 2ans drive ...

274
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,040
This is also 2ans drive from gearbox No. 1 which broke down in Målilla.

275
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,900
There should be 41 cogs here ... Now no one is left.

276
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,220
Here are 2 pcs.

277
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,500
There have been a lot of pieces in the bottom.

278
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,660
It's pretty decent stuff so there are no small drives.

279
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:59,240
Now the ragging has come but what I think people want to see is when you start this ...

280
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,560
... and drive around a bit in the parking lot.
 Unfortunately, I can't keep up.

281
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,820
Lol!

282
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,640
We'll see if the gearbox holds this time.
 -Lol!

283
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,500
Hahaha, the cap blew off.

284
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,220
HAHAHA!

285
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,680
A tractor.
 Crazy.

286
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,400
-What fantastic machine!
 Yes it looks to work now.

287
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,840
Now I hope it holds in Hylletofta.

288
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,140
Now I have tried to make a start Iallafal.

289
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,080
So longer it does not rattle in the gearbox.

290
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,000
I will wish you good luck at the competition and I will see if I show up and film.

291
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,860
I definitely think you should do that and you will see some cool buildings.

292
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,440
See you later!
 See you, Hello!
