1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,089
Drove off the road in Spain.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,699
Stuck there and were commissioned by a farmer with a tractor.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:13,600
Then I got engine errors on the highway in Spain outside Valencia.

4
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,389
It was pretty nasty.

5
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:24,186
Hello Hello!

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,385
Thursday again and time for a new section of Motorur.

7
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:32,990
And today there will be a return visit to Tomas who sold his Tesla,

8
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:37,349
Bought a Renault truck and has converted it into a camper.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,729
So now we should take the opportunity and check the situation.

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,930
How has it been to be away for a whole year?

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,945
Hi Douglas!
 Fun to see you again.

12
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:45,976
It's the same Tomas, how is the situation?

13
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,956
It is very good.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,939
It is a bit strange to be back in Sweden.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Mixed feelings.

16
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:58,169
I have been on a long trip and now I am "at home".

17
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,305
But I don't feel like home because I don't live in Värnamo

18
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:03,389
Without just being in Värnamo.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,769
It makes me feel like an alien or outside the community.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,085
I haven't had that feeling when I was out traveling

21
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:12,940
Without you have been mentally another way.

22
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,886
Now i am back.

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,405
Absolutely fantastic year.

24
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:19,625
I am very happy and proud that I have implemented it

25
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,685
And I have learned a lot about it.

26
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:26,265
It has been a challenge and a fantastic experience.

27
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,166
I'm super happy with that.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,486
When I drove in here I have seen some changes.

29
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,131
Partly you got the cover on top where you were able to put in your Star-Link

30
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:37,045
Yep, the wind-by-scarre is in place.

31
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:39,886
The Star Link is recessed and it has worked.

32
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,739
The Star Link is a game Changer is absolutely incredible.

33
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:46,636
Had no problem whatsoever anywhere.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,576
It just works.

35
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,610
300 megabits anywhere all the time.

36
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,255
I highly recommend that.

37
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:53,346
It's great!

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,230
SEK 1050 a month it costs, but it is worth all the time.

39
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:58,076
It works well.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,326
No major problems.

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,940
I had little mishaps but you can count on that when you are out.

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
What is fucking then?

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Drove off the road in Spain.

44
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,470
Stuck there and were commissioned by a farmer with a tractor.

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:20,339
Then I got engine errors on the highway in Spain outside Valencia.

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,250
It was pretty nasty.

47
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,055
Went down in safe position.

48
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,139
Can drive 50 on the highway.

49
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,986
20 kilometers left to Valencia.

50
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,169
Google for a Renault workshop.

51
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,800
Coming in on Friday night at 17:55 principle.

52
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:39,055
Asked for help.

53
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,606
We can help you but you may come back

54
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,005
On Monday morning at 08:00.

55
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:47,639
Takes in at Camping in Valencia works well.

56
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,759
The thing is that on Sunday it was the summer time change.

57
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,360
When I, on Monday morning, wake up and step out.

58
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,100
Is it pitch black out so i sit in the truck, it starts

59
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,746
And what I don't know about.

60
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,335
When I drove out on Friday it was still bright outside.

61
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:10,550
Is that no lamps work at all front lights, taillights,

62
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,429
Warning flashers, position lights, instruments.

63
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,629
Not a single lamp in the entire truck.

64
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:19,789
I'm sitting in Valencia.

65
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,305
There is carbon black with a carbon black truck and drives on Monday morning

66
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,059
in rush hour traffic in Valencia.

67
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:29,606
That trip was not fun.

68
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,470
Gosh darn it.
 It was a bit exciting.

69
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,106
Come in to the workshop and they fixed an electrical fault so they fixed

70
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,680
And it was great and 4 hours later I was on my way again.

71
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,436
But how did the letters go then?

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,406
I gave up!

73
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,919
The letters were wrestling match.

74
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,039
I tried to get rid of them.

75
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:54,830
After I had removed all the letters, I took boat polishing agent,

76
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,705
antioxidant and plaster machine on it and it ended

77
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,649
with the letters becoming much shiny.

78
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:08,169
But there were also the other parts of the flat.

79
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,736
So even though I did all the work, there was the same difference

80
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,239
As it was before though everything was shiny and the letters appeared anyway.

81
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,895
So it ended with me buying color and rolling over them only

82
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
to get rid of the letters.

83
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,868
But all the boxes have worked?

84
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:27,799
I had that on one of my movies that I published

85
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:32,609
So it was one of the switches until the box had been water -filled.

86
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:36,605
After the rain it ran down after the side and straight down the switch.

87
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,215
Then when I emptied it, it had standing water

88
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:40,735
throughout the power switch.

89
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,250
So there I found a new compensation and replaced only that dilemma around it.

90
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,140
But it was only a ten minute job so it was no wonder.

91
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:53,730
When I drove down this fall, I drove south all the time

92
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,619
And then I had the sun low standing so I was dazzled all the time.

93
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,260
So I got less on it and put silver tape there

94
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:05,309
To get sunscreen.

95
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,715
I forgot about it so I had it during the entire period in Portugal.

96
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:15,540
So now I don't get the paste away, it sits in the Bängen.

97
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,690
It doesn't matter what I use for anything.

98
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,250
From razor blades to.

99
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,040
Acetone to bought this on the car theme.

100
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:28,006
Label off.

101
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,685
It works well?

102
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:32,255
Nothing works what I've tried.

103
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,510
It sits like burned in the glass in some way.

104
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,445
I don't know how to get rid of it.

105
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,045
Tips are gratefully received.

106
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,595
How do I get rid of the shit?

107
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:44,685
I have no experience of driving a truck before,

108
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:48,009
But I have to say that it has been incredibly easy to drive.

109
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,255
It's like any small passenger car.
 It's nothing heavy,

110
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,339
It is not difficult.

111
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:55,605
It works superb.

112
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,820
In size I have also discovered that I have.

113
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,920
Because I have the insulation, I have a dispensation.

114
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,790
It is extra wide so mine is 2.60 in total width.

115
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:11,065
Most large caravans are 2.35 so I'm really wide,

116
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,555
But I have no problems whatsoever with that bit.

117
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,019
I think that is almost more of a challenge and a little fun.

118
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,089
Try to try in with all the small villages with this wide.

119
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,669
However, what I find difficult for is the height.

120
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:26,209
Is happy something when it comes to height.

121
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:31,025
Total height is 3.42 centimeters and I've been under a couple of bridges

122
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:33,109
which is 3.50.

123
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,785
It's not funny.

124
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,655
I crawl.

125
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:42,709
I also have all the solar panels with glass outside which is the highest peak.

126
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,055
Is it 3.50 on the bridge.

127
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,435
Don't know how full the man was as measured or if it was before

128
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,519
Or after on the new asphalt.

129
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:53,885
The heights do not like.

130
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,045
It sits in so much.

131
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,155
Even when I drive on highways and you have five feet up there

132
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:02,269
So I sit and duck to wait for the bang.

133
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,040
So I have a phobia against bridges.

134
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,525
Motor in terms of motor it is fantastic.

135
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:11,805
It is pretty strong 220 horses which is more

136
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,425
than most of this size.

137
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,779
The Spanish mountain pass and all this.

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,475
Not the slightest doubt.

139
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,125
Not any overheating whatsoever.

140
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,209
No overheating of the brakes.

141
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,690
It has been extremely good.

142
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,105
Giant really pleased with it and fuel consumption

143
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,149
has been clearly beyond expectation.

144
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,875
I have no experience whatsoever with trucks before

145
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,835
So I thought it would be much worse.

146
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,715
3-4 liters of mile or something.

147
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:40,239
It is blocked at 90 but normally you are at 80

148
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:44,667
and i am at 90 and max so pulls about 1-1.9

149
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,175
and the lowest I've been down on when I drive 80

150
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:53,365
and drive quietly down there at 1.6 and 1.7 and 1.8 are normal consumption

151
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,510
On it and I think that is good when it weighs 7.5 tons.

152
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,335
There has been no problems and the diesel has been cheap

153
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,725
Down in Portugal

154
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:05,785
1.40 euros per liter.

155
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,869
SEK 14 liters costs it down there.

156
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,109
Yes you, it was different when we had SEK 28 liter here.

157
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:14,785
Yes.

158
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,779
It is a good fuel prices.

159
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,040
How many miles have driven the truck by the way?

160
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,235
I had an app that I have used.

161
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,425
It keeps track of me.

162
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,955
It has only been 1500 miles.

163
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,955
I've been standing still for so long.

164
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,435
I drive a 30 mile and stay there for a couple of days

165
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,520
And looks 30 miles and stays for a few days.

166
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,969
It's actually smaller than I thought it would be.

167
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:39,478
The ramp at the back.
 Did you do anything about it?

168
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,546
No, it's the same.

169
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,835
You get used to it.

170
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,955
It sounds pretty much to fold up/down it,

171
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,619
But I cared for about two weeks.

172
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:49,889
After that, I totally shit.

173
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:53,196
There are so much barking dogs and children who scream and so on.

174
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,710
It may let me too, but it has learned during the trip

175
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:04,000
That I went away with the intention to be stealth and be secret.

176
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:10,046
But that's not how I have lived but I have 25 % max

177
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,106
Like I fricampa.

178
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,056
But 75 % of the time I have been standing on court

179
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,950
And at campsites and lived on farmhouses and such things.

180
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,130
So making the truck in stealth to be secret, it was wasted.

181
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:27,440
It's not that I don't think I have used it,

182
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:32,566
Without the opposite effect has become that do you have a large one small old

183
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,276
or new motorhome and entering a campsite

184
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,980
So people look like a new one is coming in.

185
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,866
But when I come and look big -eyed because they think I have been wrong.

186
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,960
A goods delivery to the restaurant or something.

187
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,390
That I attract more attention to campsites than the usual motorhomes.

188
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:56,776
And I think that without exaggeration, it is maybe 200 people

189
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:58,959
Who has been inside the camper and looked at it.

190
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:04,306
I have received a lot of feedback, a lot of ideas

191
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,480
And a lot of suggestions and thoughts that put grills in my head.

192
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,246
What are you doing now?

193
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,560
I check how much sun there is

194
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:18,789
1680 watts incoming.

195
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:22,196
Such overcapacity so that I have

196
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,510
Probably fully charged the battery before lunch.

197
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,856
So I have very good solar panels and batteries

198
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,246
Have I been canon with.

199
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,726
It works great.

200
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:37,619
Again, no gas has at all but everything is electric powered

201
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:41,440
So it has worked beyond expectation.

202
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,760
Water manufacturing has worked but has been under -dimensioned.

203
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:50,979
It works, but what happens is that I delay water filling.

204
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,066
Instead of filling the water tank every fifth day

205
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,469
So you need to fill it once every 15 days or something.

206
00:10:56,609 --> 00:11:00,906
So I have a little too little capacity on it, but the principle works

207
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:02,166
So it's no wonder.

208
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,250
Do you still drink the water?

209
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,286
No not anymore.

210
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:09,070
I did it in the beginning, but of pure security or something.

211
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,806
When it has been several months and you do not know if there are bacteria

212
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,635
and so on.

213
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,969
So I use it to cook tea and cook pasta and all this.

214
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:20,630
The only thing I drink buy-water is pure drinking water.

215
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:23,019
Everything else I use for this.

216
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,026
And that's the same thing there.

217
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,575
The toan I use all the time, works great.

218
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,969
The shower I have used less than I thought I should do

219
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,645
And that is because my nest pattern has been different.

220
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,406
I don't have Fricampa as much as I thought but have toa

221
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:44,140
And shower easily accessible at campsites so it will be easy to run there.

222
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:50,686
The shower is overkill, you can call it.

223
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,145
In the last movie before I left, I said it was 90-95 % finished.

224
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:57,729
The last thing I will do during the journey.

225
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,739
It will be these last lists that should only be put there.

226
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,036
It never got rid of.

227
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:08,190
One of the stuff was that I had not painted into the wardrobe.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's still unpainted.

229
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:13,786
The idea is good, but not always.

230
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:16,929
It becomes so easy to forget it.

231
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:21,186
After all, I have a thing that broke very quickly.

232
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,140
It was probably no more than 10, 15-20 miles before I first broke it.

233
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,669
When I have slide out on the wardrobe module

234
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,549
So I had a locking device on it.

235
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:37,556
But it is so insanely very load.

236
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,926
When running in the turns, the bracket has high up

237
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,640
and it has a lot of weight so that when the truck swings

238
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,849
So tolete the brackets at once.

239
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:52,419
So it was a simple but effective solution.

240
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,099
That's when I'm going somewhere, I'll push it in.

241
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,006
All the way in I lock it.

242
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,099
A temporary solution I made after 10-15 miles.

243
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,726
It has been sitting there ever since.

244
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:10,210
There is nothing that is as permanent as a temporary solution.

245
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,856
In terms of boom, I am super happy.

246
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,325
It's a bit boring but nothing remarkable.

247
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:19,159
It just rolls on and works like any apartment.

248
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,546
I've never felt claustrophobic.

249
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,606
I have varying views through the rear door, but otherwise

250
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,776
Is it the same old apartment that you pull around.

251
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:37,666
I have actually eaten a lot inside, with the fold -down seat

252
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,229
So we've been six pers plus one child

253
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
As most in here.

254
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:49,789
6.5 persons have cooked so it has worked great.

255
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,630
Precisely because it has so much more volume in here

256
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:56,020
So it is bad weather so you choose to sit in here.

257
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,500
Rather, you are sitting in an awning.

258
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,746
So I have had a lot of people and people

259
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,330
Which I got to know that I chewed with.

260
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,070
This works well, it takes 5 minutes and shit down

261
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,429
And then it takes 5 minutes to clean up too.

262
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,656
It is surprisingly good.

263
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:17,059
It is made for cat hair and dog hair.

264
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,349
So it is motor driven and it makes it.

265
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,859
It is....

266
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:29,145
It is very satisfied with

267
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:32,916
And that's one of the reasons why I have a very hard time

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to see myself move back.

269
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:39,950
Buy a 200 square meter house or a 100 square meter apartment.

270
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,046
It's not going to happen.

271
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,159
It is a fundamental change that one values in a completely different way.

272
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:50,236
I have my 15 square meters and it is absolutely perfect.

273
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,825
Just what you need.

274
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,385
TV is the first thing I start in the morning

275
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,325
And then it's up.

276
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,126
All waking hours a day.

277
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,276
This works great!

278
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,496
Super happy with it!

279
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,276
By the way, I have a 360 security camera I have not plug in,

280
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:08,546
it has not got thumbs out and care about and the reason

281
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,656
is that I have never ever during the trip even known me the hint

282
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:17,690
to threatened or insecure or insecure anything.

283
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:22,476
So the opportunity to close again and close around has done

284
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,726
That I am completely relaxed all the time.

285
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:26,776
Wherever I have stood.

286
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,476
Before this trip I had the same old bike

287
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:36,460
For 15-20 years something and during this trip I have grazed four bikes.

288
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:38,833
Huh!?
 Yes...

289
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,419
I have become a bikeoman on the coup.

290
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,820
I bought an electric bike and it was very nice.

291
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:52,130
I had to use it three times before it was stolen down in Halmstad.

292
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,626
I didn't get far.

293
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,196
From Halmstad so I went on into the Netherlands

294
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,549
And if you are in the Netherlands, you can't do without a bike.

295
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:06,469
So I bought another electric bike that I had for a while and it was okay.

296
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,066
Not as good as the first one I had so I sold it at a campsite

297
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,856
to another.

298
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,799
Then I ordered an exact same as I got rid of.

299
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,929
With when there is some filur that has your blue in Halmstad.
 Yes.

300
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,216
It was locked up outside the savings bank and after 5-10 minutes there

301
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,299
So it was more pick up.

302
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,600
You get pissed off at this, but there is not much to do about it.

303
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,876
It has 4-5 miles of reach on it, goes away and uphill

304
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,895
And whatever can shop in the backpack

305
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:44,979
And just beep on.

306
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,739
When you live in a camper van, the bike is even a second car.

307
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:53,000
It is a central part of what you want a really good electric bike!

308
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,436
I got together eleven countries in total.

309
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,150
By far the two best countries that I am in love with

310
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,015
is Portugal and the Netherlands.

311
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:06,526
I probably have ten weeks as I was in the Netherlands

312
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,916
And then it was six months and over the winter

313
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,739
So I was in the Algarve coast in southern Portugal

314
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:16,430
And it's incredible.
 Recommend it!

315
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,346
But what you did for the days?

316
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,375
Have you made a lot of excursions and met lots of people.

317
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,959
As many exciting personalities that you can meet.

318
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,998
It feels....

319
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:32,329
Now I should be mean but you all pull over a comb and so on.

320
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:35,885
But for me it feels like the owner of the caravan

321
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:40,115
they switch on and then they pull out over the weekend with the family

322
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:43,359
And grilling and so on and then they go back on Monday

323
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,895
Or on Sunday.

324
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:48,400
While the motorhome people are very different.

325
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,625
There are a lot of pensioners who have sold their house in Sweden.

326
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:58,199
Have any small cabin left or something in a forest glade,

327
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:02,548
sold his house, buying a camper and they spend

328
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,383
6, 8, 10 months down in southern Europe where it is warm and comfortable

329
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,319
It is by far the most common.

330
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:12,820
Then we have another group that is digital nomads.

331
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,909
Very many people who work out on the move.

332
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,985
Has it been expensive?

333
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,729
No, especially not this year.

334
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:26,096
When you hear friends and acquaintances complaining of electricity bills and food prices

335
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,890
And other things you feel very privileged.

336
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:36,166
I have lived and long -term stands so I have a campsite

337
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:42,890
Where I paid 7 euros a day for the motorhome.

338
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:48,329
Then if you had electricity it was 1.40 euros a day extra.

339
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,336
It has cost and the food is not even half the price

340
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,446
Against Sweden.

341
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,160
There have been very little youtube videos from you too.

342
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,420
Yes, I have taken a break.

343
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,936
Don't know how yes to explain it.

344
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,729
Mentally, it has been difficult to do them.

345
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,346
It was fun in the beginning to tell you about the truck

346
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,865
And tell us about plans and everything.

347
00:19:08,949 --> 00:19:13,206
But then when I'm out on the trip it feels too boastful.

348
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,985
I don't want to describe it.

349
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:21,615
Me, i i look at me and watch me and it's rarely you post a video

350
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:25,389
One Tuesday afternoon when it is raining and you are fixing the laundry.

351
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,839
Without all the time I am in new places and I do not like the selfish focus.

352
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,459
I have taken a break, but it is definitely not dead.

353
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:36,650
I have one...

354
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,855
I have an upcoming project that will do

355
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:44,096
That I will resume Youtube again.

356
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,136
Then we have to say back!
 We'll do that!

357
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:47,541
Have a nice day!
 Hello to you!
