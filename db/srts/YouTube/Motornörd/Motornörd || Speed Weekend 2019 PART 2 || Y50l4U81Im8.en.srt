1
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,020
-They, it was an odd choice of MC to drive on the ice.

2
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,760
Do you think?
 Well, it's absolutely perfect.

3
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,600
It is an absolutely perfect motorcycle.
 I get to use what I have.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,320
And now this is what I have to drive with.

5
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,440
-It's a great hi.
 Thanks so much, it's from 1948.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,940
-What speed can you drive with this?

7
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,720
I drove 141 km/h as top speed.
 -Oj, wow!

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,700
It is good.
 -That is really good.

9
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,620
After all, there is only 40 hp on the rear wheel.

10
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,900
So it's not a racing machine.

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,260
-Have you been here before?
 Yes, I was here in 2017.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,940
I drove faster this year.

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,680
Now the mound got performance anxiety.

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,220
Now!

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,800
-mode?
 Yes it is good.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,300
-Can well mention first or mainly why we sit in the caravan.

17
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,460
-I think nobody understands how much it sounds here.

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,300
-We sit in the middle of the firing line and you will get an example of how it sounds here.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,080
If we are to get some decent sound, we can sit in the caravan.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,160
It is difficult to explain Speed Weekend for those who have not been here.

21
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,840
There are so many different vehicles and people who appreciate this weekend once a year.

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,760
This is the third year we are running with this.
 The first year it had original wheel suspension.

23
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,880
I had skates mounted on the tires.

24
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,420
But then I only came 150 meters before it started wobbling so I keep overturning.

25
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:36,840
Last year it was rebuilt with a scooter and own swing at the back with the skate.

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,500
Now it is stable.

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,340
Now I am looking for more effect so I can go faster.

28
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,300
-What do you have average speed?

29
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,960
I think it was 92.35 km/h.

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,860
Last year it was 83 km/h.
 Now we will turn more effect.

31
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,660
-What funny, good luck!
 Thanks!

32
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,700
Now it feels relatively stable.
 It's just a little semi-unpretable.

33
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,580
Now I will not go 200 km/h but it would have been fun to get up to 100 km/h.

34
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,100
My name is Rickard Eklund and comes from Ã…land.
 -Alland!?

35
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,700
It will be a little turn to get here.

36
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,720
-How much did you get to drive then?
 I just drove a scratch.

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,300
200 meters before the goal was broken.

38
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,440
279 km/h was input speed.

39
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,860
And 233 km/h out.

40
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,700
But I was probably up to 320 km/h when the engine broke.

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,700
Better happiness next time, hahaha.

42
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,440
Braked the engine of 920 hp on the wheels and just over 1000 hp on the engine.

43
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,100
I had problems with the charge pressure control on the straight stretch.

44
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,220
It could not hold on to properly ...

45
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,880
... I would only have charging pressure on 2.5 bar.

46
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,000
But the charging pressure was 2.7-2.8 bar all the time.

47
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,080
So I had about 100 hp too much.

48
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,560
We knew it would not endure.
 And it didn't.

49
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,640
The top cover gasket went, the top cap Sprak and holes in the valve.

50
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,640
We'll see what I can find until next year.

51
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,020
It's just starting over.
 -So you packed up?

52
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,820
We tore the engine yesterday to see if it was rescued.

53
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,660
We thought it was just the top lid gasket first.

54
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,860
We screwed out the spark plugs because the engine worked.

55
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,840
But the hole in the valve is difficult to rope.

56
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,080
We just let it stand so we have to pack up tonight or tomorrow.

57
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,360
This is the best there is.

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,880
It is completely crazy to drive on the ice.
 And all the people who are here.

59
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,715
You find so much strange stuff here.
 It is extreme in every way.

60
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,260
If you like jet parks, V8or or turbo machines.

61
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,480
There is everything for everyone and it's cool.

62
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,520
There is no other event that is like this.

63
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,600
It's only once in years.

64
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,940
-Why did it become such a machine?

65
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,580
I helped a colleague's brother change an engine on his motorcycle.

66
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,180
He gave me the engine for the job I did and said does something fun.

67
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,720
Then I found a garden trailer.

68
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,145
Everything you see that is original is as follows: the plate, bonnet, plastic and sides.

69
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:14,860
The screens are not original but widened.

70
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,120
On the ice I have driven 152 km/h on average.

71
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,260
The top speed is 162 km/h.

72
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,820
-Her God, on a lawnmower!
 It should go faster.

73
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,515
-How is it to drive?

74
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,500
It is very high.
 It's not like a go -kart because you sit high up.

75
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,240
Yes it feels because it is a high weight point and it jasses when driving.

76
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,020
The feeling is sometimes that it can overturn.

77
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,660
The last round I drove I kept running over the photocell.

78
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,125
The front wheels are not often in the ground.

79
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:54,040
So you have to plan if you are to turn.

80
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,580
It's fun, a terrified delight.

81
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,400
-Why Speed Weekend?

82
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,500
I saw that Hubbe Berg had built a garden tractor.

83
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,000
I was influenced and thought it was a cool thing.

84
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,720
It is well thanks to him.

85
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,580
It's a great event this.

86
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,360
I like things like this and I compete for myself.

87
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,580
-Is only me who thinks this looks fatal?

88
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,700
Stop, stop, stop !!

89
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Stop, stop, stop !!

90
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,820
We lift the whole car.

91
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,860
-Is it ready -made?
 Now it is ready with it anyway.

92
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,480
-What is wrong?
 Do you have no gears left.

93
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,740
1-2 an is still the rest has gone home.

94
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,820
Maybe there are more gears on the scrap?

95
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:10,000
I thought there was an accessory for the oil so you got the gears back, hehehe.

96
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,800
-It was probably the strangest loading I've ever seen.

97
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,420
It should fit another car then.

98
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,120
That car has survived so far.

99
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,300
But, well uh ..

100
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,960
You should have fun loading.
 -It looked scary.

101
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,295
Yes, the idea was good.

102
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:31,165
Just after I take this picture, the ramp folded.

103
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:34,015
We had to strengthen the ramp below.

104
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:37,265
Now the ramps weigh 60 kg each.

105
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,580
You learn as long as you live.
 And if it goes to hell, it goes to hell.

106
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,000
It is quite easy to change the gearbox here.

107
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,280
Yes, do you change it now?

108
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,035
-What have you done here?
 Have you operated on the track?

109
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:53,085
The idea was that I would have had another car.

110
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:56,540
But the parts did not come from the United States.

111
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,140
I have a compressor -fed Ford Mustang that I would have run with.

112
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,760
But it is not compiled yet.

113
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,595
I fly to the US in 2 weeks to pick up the parts.

114
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,340
-What practical!
 Yes, it is cheaper to fly over and pick up the parts.

115
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,880
It is completely crazy that it should be so.

116
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
But you get some vacation.

117
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,020
Now we are 2 who go to the United States.
 We have rented a Ford Mustang Cab.

118
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,360
So we'll see if we buy extra tires for it.

119
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,020
We'll see what happens because we don't really know yet.

120
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,135
-What is so good about Speed Weekend?
 What is so good ..

121
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,720
..there are all strange vehicles.

122
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,520
It's all people and strange vehicles.

123
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,060
Which builds up all the fun vehicles.

124
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,120
There are special people here.

125
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,520
It's everything from super serious to completely crazy.

126
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,140
It's just watching the black hole, they are ...

127
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,460
..not really wise.

128
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,180
There are no revealing parts for what they do.

129
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
I had wanted to try everything.

130
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,120
It is an eventman for everything and everyone.

131
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,420
You can do so much more than just drive.

132
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,720
Talk to people and watch all the cranky builds.

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,440
People are nice.

134
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
-And you can fly airplanes.

135
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,520
We were going to see if we could take a flight later.

136
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,620
We tried the hovercraft yesterday.

137
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,000
So we try aircraft today because we are not allowed to fly ourselves.

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,540
We will come next year as well.

139
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,800
Maybe with a little dumber stuff.

140
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,460
You never know considering what we brought with us.

141
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:44,055
It is a water rocket park.

142
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,840
It's like an oversized PET water rocket.

143
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,740
It is an old CNG tank from a Volvo V70.

144
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,340
The idea is classified for 200 bar.

145
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,495
It is 2/3 water then put an air cushion on top.

146
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,480
It pushes out the water with a high force, which means that you go on the reaction force.

147
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,940
It is not an optimal acceleration position to stand on a kick.

148
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,840
And accelerate hard with a lot of g forces.

149
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,320
The best scratch I went 0-80 km/h in 6 seconds.

150
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,860
It is decent, though not difficult to remain on the kick.

151
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,300
But you keep up.

152
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,500
The fired would be quick to build.

153
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,580
But unfortunately, there was geek at the detail level in this case as well.

154
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,640
I would guess that it has taken 200-300 hours to build it.

155
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,220
100 km/h is the magic no for all my vehicles.

156
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:55,700
Faster than 105.2 km/h I would like to go because it did Mobacken Racing a long time ago.

157
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,480
It would be a milestone to beat their record.

158
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:05,795
-We can comment on how much it sounds?

159
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:09,045
-How long away can we be 300 meters?
 We are enough.

160
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:13,220
300 meters in from and now the black hole will start the pulse jet the scooter.

161
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,340
I think we do.

162
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,280
Above all, it feels in the body.

163
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,300
I know it is heard all the way to Sandviken.
 (1.5 miles)

164
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,520
It is great fun guys who offer themselves.

165
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,120
Now they will start soon.

166
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,320
This is enjoyable.

167
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,380
Great!

168
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,420
There you heard a knee.

169
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,700
Now they are in the fuel.

170
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,980
Now it's full gas!

171
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,700
Wow!

172
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,520
It is wonderful!

173
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,540
We have to check how long they will come.

174
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:24,720
As a currios, the engine type has not been used since the 1940s to something sensible.

175
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,000
And it was not used for anything sensible in the 40s either for the Germans it had for the V1 missile.

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,160
Well, that's the most famous ...

177
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,640
... the application that has used large pulse dough engines.

178
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,360
They were used with varying success.

179
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,200
The Germans shot many towards England and some arrived.

180
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,460
The V1 missile was called "Buzz Bomb" because of how they sound.

181
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,760
There are probably still people who were involved and can testify to the sound.

182
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,560
It was probably quite horror I can imagine.

183
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,600
This engine we have I think it differs 10% on traction.

184
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,820
We have found some different information but it is almost the same traction.

185
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,980
However, our engine is less.

186
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,580
There is a V1 missil at the Arboga Robot Museum for anyone who wants to see one for real.

187
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,915
I was there looking and that engine was much bigger.

188
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,180
It went much nicer and I can understand that because it was probably worse material.

189
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,040
And it would last longer.

190
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,900
Jadu, do not know why you are in the pulse.

191
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,060
It is really banal technology.

192
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,980
Basically simple but then it gets complicated when you peel it up.

193
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,660
Especially with the durability.

194
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,620
The biggest problem the last few years is to get the engine brackets to hold together.

195
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,640
The engine becomes 4-5 cm longer when it is warm and then also increases the diameter.

196
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,380
So it is wearing the engine brackets.

197
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,860
What looks good is that we have not found any damage to neither the brackets nor the engine after this weekend.

198
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,020
And it feels good.

199
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,040
We made no performance increases for this year, but put all the energy on the engine brackets.

200
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,140
And it seems to have succeeded.

201
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,580
We get a salary for the effort when sitting in the CAD program and calling and discussing.

202
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,120
There will be a lot of debate in between.

203
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,220
And usually it will be good.

204
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,380
Warning signal, thank you!

205
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,600
The black hole aims for going faster than last year.

206
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,540
Which was 241 km/h on average.

207
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,400
But be f-n, yeah yeah!

208
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,560
We get it, 258.52 km/h!

209
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,240
254.86 km/h on average.

210
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,160
New world record for pulse dots.

211
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,180
Congratulations the black hole!

212
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,120
258 km/h at top speed.

213
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,100
Absolutely senseless!
 I didn't think it was possible today.

214
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,580
That was really good.

215
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,540
Congratulations the black hole!

216
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,000
Deeply impressed.
 That was hard rock.

217
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,540
Cannon!

218
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,920
-Personal record?
 Yes exactly.

219
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,360
Yes it was unsupported, I didn't really believe it but all of a sudden it went fast.

220
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,760
I'm not so used to high speeds otherwise.

221
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,560
And I'm not doing any other motorsport.

222
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,460
I think the course gets slim.

223
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,020
I put my thoughts down to beat a record.

224
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,380
But the second ride was absolutely fantastic and went well.

225
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,960
Then it goes straight and stable.

226
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,860
We haven't run it since last year.

227
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,740
Sometimes we usually spit on a motor show.

228
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,560
We have pulled down a bit.
 It's a little too expensive to break just because.

229
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
We have lost the desire a bit because of it.

230
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,960
But of course ..

231
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,340
... it depends on who calls.

232
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,060
254.86!

233
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,500
Hahaha, what a sync ..
