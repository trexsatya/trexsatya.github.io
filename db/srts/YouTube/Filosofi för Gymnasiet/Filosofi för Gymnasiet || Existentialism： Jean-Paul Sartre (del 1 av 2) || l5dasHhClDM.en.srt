1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,180
Sartre ...

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,660
Sartre ...

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,840
Sartre!

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,680
Sartre?

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,340
I'll say "Sartre".

6
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,700
My name is Joakim, welcome to this lesson on Jean-Paul Sartre-one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:28,220
In October 1945, Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) gave a lecture entitled "existentialism is a humanism".

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,380
The event was an enormous success and the influx of curious was huge.

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,820
The hard pressure to fit in the room caused the ticket door and large parts of the interior to be struck in pieces.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,200
The lecturer himself succeeded in the right and constantly pushing himself between the audience

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,880
Before he could start his speech with an hour delay.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,180
Existentialism was born.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,120
Sartre received his education at a noble school in Paris and later came to work as a high school teacher in philosophy.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,800
He was a little over 1.50 long, skewed heavily and described himself as ugly.

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,400
Almost always he went dressed in black polo, baskets, dark pants and jacket

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,620
- A clothing that became an existential fashion.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,040
He was often seen sitting in some cafe lively discussing meaning of life,

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,640
Not infrequently with a glass of red wine in your hand.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,160
In 1964 he was appointed Nobel Laureate in Literature but chose to demonstrate his freedom by refusing no

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,040
to the prize with the motivation that he did not want to dress up in the coat for the bourgeoisie.

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,300
However, he later came to contact the Swedish Academy with a request to have the prize amount paid in secret.

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,240
They refused.

23
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,440
Sartre was interested in how everyday life seems to us humans

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,700
And it is said that he was fascinated by the idea that one could philosophize about a cocktail.

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,000
Everything we do and perceive is charged with emotions and personal meaning.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,260
It is our consciousness that determines what is an event and what is background noise.

27
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,320
Suppose you will meet a friend in a cafe but that she never shows up.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,720
Then her absence becomes an event, but only for you.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,320
None of the other café guests will respond to your friend missing.

30
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,440
For you, the other visitors will only become insignificant background in this context.

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,840
It is actually remarkable that something that does not exist (in this example your missing friend)

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,600
May be of great importance to us.

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,340
Sartre, with his philosophy, tried to describe the basic features of human existence,

34
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,640
Why his philosophy is called "existentialism".

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,920
He built on, and deepened, the thoughts and concepts that Søren Kierkegaard

36
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,220
had presented 100 years earlier.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,860
We will now take a closer look at different aspects of Sartre's existentialism.

38
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,300
Existentialism, which became something of a fashion philosophy in the mid-20th century,

39
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,620
mean that man is free to shape his life himself.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,460
Sartre, as the main representative of the movement, even went so far that he claimed that man

41
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,320
Is "doomed to freedom", that is, we not only can but actually have to take a stand.

42
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,100
He agreed with Nietzsche that "God is dead", and that there are therefore no predetermined values,

43
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,140
No fact for right and wrong or good and evil.

44
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:19,640
This, unlike the example, the Middle Ages when people saw existence as filled with a higher meaning.

45
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,880
Most people felt that God created the trees, the animals, the stones and not least the people as part of their big plan.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,820
God had, as a craftsman, created the world and everything had his function and purpose

47
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,480
- Things and man had meaning.

48
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,980
But in today's atheistic world, man thus loses his essence, his purpose.

49
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,240
We have not been created for any definite reason and there are no objectively valid claims

50
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,260
About how man should be, no in advance given human nature.

51
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,940
We find that we are there and must decide for ourselves what we want to do about life.

52
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,820
Imagine, said Sartre, an actor who is suddenly fed on stage without any script,

53
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,060
Without knowing which play is played, what role he has or who is a director.

54
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:16,100
The actor must decide for himself something, become something - villain or hero, a comic or a tragic figure

55
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,780
- Or simply leave the stage, which also means choosing.

56
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,080
No matter how the actor chooses, he will never ever know what it is all about.

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,820
In exactly the same situation is man.

58
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,320
She is thrown into the world, existence, and has to decide for herself what person she wants to become.

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,720
Life is an improvisation.

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,900
Otherwise, it is with the thing that surrounds us.

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,020
If you build a house then you know even before you start the construction what its purpose will be.

62
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,080
From the beginning, the thing has a definition, an essence.

63
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,320
It is only man who is not something from the beginning, who has no purpose.

64
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,480
So we humans are not created for anything, we just exist.

65
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,420
First, we must live, exist, before we can get a definition, an essence.

66
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:15,340
This is central to existentialism, and was formulated by Sartre as "the existence precedes the essence".

67
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,520
For the thing it is the opposite.

68
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,720
"The problem is not what life has done to us but what we do of what life has done to us."

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,560
We humans are thus free, but freedom in the existential sense is no unlimited freedom.

70
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,600
We will never be able to do everything we want, we will never be able to fly or get super powers.

71
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,400
Then freedom could not be separated from dream or imagination.

72
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,060
Freedom instead arises in the meeting with the given conditions, what we cannot do anything about.

73
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,840
That we are born by our parents and with some genetic traits, that we are born in a particular country in a certain period of time

74
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,340
- These are the conditions of life.

75
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,160
These circumstances are also the starting point of freedom.

76
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
All this, Sartre said, is our fate.

77
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,960
And freedom arises precisely in the meeting with fate, with our assets and restrictions.

78
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:14,400
Of course, freedom is not just a state of mind, but it is in internal freedom begins.

79
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,940
Therefore, a prisoner may be freer than his prison guard.
 Internal freedom is a prerequisite for external freedom.

80
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,960
Thus, freedom is always independent of the situation we are in.

81
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,180
When we are born, the only thing in front of us is nothing - what is not yet.

82
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,440
What we fill Varat (what is) with, cannot be decided in advance.

83
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,100
Our essence, that is, who we are, is not determined by our genes or our social heritage.

84
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,220
It is determined by our choices - that is, what we fill nothing with.

85
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,300
Natural science sometimes believes that we are determined by nature and our genetic heritage

86
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,360
- That the essence therefore precedes existence.

87
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,420
For Sartre, it is the opposite.

88
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,480
We are thrown out in a world where we exist and "... man is nothing but what she does".

89
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,300
What is primarily distinguished man from the thing is that we are aware

90
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,680
And can reflect on ourselves and our situation.

91
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,080
In contrast to the thing, we also have the ability to imagine the world differently,

92
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,720
Being able to see nothing - what is not but that could be.

93
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,800
According to Sartre, it is precisely the ability to imagine the world differently that enables freedom.

94
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,600
For our actions is affected by what is not yet;

95
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,820
If you decide to become a doctor, it does not mean that you are already a doctor.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,820
What is not will be the driving force of the act itself, what we strive for.

97
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,660
Things lack this ability to see the possible.

98
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,700
In existential terms they therefore do not exist, they are just.

99
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,420
The same thing, says Sarte, applies to the animals.

100
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,880
They can only be "in themselves", which means that they are guided by their instincts and drives.

101
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,540
Existing means being able to relate to different modes of action and situations;

102
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:15,160
Being able to choose between one and the other action and see alternatives to the prevailing situation.

103
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,540
According to Sartre, we are in an absurd and meaningless world that we do not understand.

104
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,880
This is a world that lacks direction, goals and guidelines.

105
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,100
There is no God to rely on, but we are completely left out to ourselves.

106
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,420
The meaning and values we may still find are therefore only our own inventions.

107
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,340
Sartre does not mean that this makes life meaningless.

108
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,000
He believes that morality is important for our lives but that it is up to ourselves to invent it.

109
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,200
The same goes for the meaning of life - it does not exist in itself, but must be chosen by each individual.

110
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:58,480
It is thus not objective, but every person chooses his own meaning with their own life.

111
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,580
"We are sentenced to freedom," says Sartre.

112
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,080
Our world lacks inherent norms or right and wrong.

113
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,460
We can never rely on any rulebook or religion that describes how we should act,

114
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,500
Without all the values are human inventions and are thus neither true nor false.

115
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,760
Therefore, we must invent our morals ourselves and act accordingly.

116
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,820
“You are free, choose, find.
 No universal morality can tell you what is right to do;

117
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,880
There are no signs in the world to follow. "

118
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,760
Each event is a new situation and we can therefore never apply the same morality in all situations.

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,140
At this point he differs from classical moral philosophers who at all times tried to find principles

120
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,640
and general guidelines for assessing whether an act is right or wrong.

121
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,300
As if it were not difficult enough to choose for yourself, so you choose at the same time

122
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,020
Also for all humanity, says Sartre.

123
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,140
When making a choice you have to be prepared that there are those who will follow your example.

124
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,420
If you get involved against painful animal experiments, you demonstrate that others should follow,

125
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,200
For "nothing can be good for yourself without being for everyone".

126
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,760
So we're not just responsible for our own actions,

127
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,420
We also bear responsibility for those who make the same decision as us.

128
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,020
By showing the way we also show the option.

129
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,480
If the choice is right for me, it may also be right for you.

130
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,540
Here the collectivist Sartre is glimpsed.

131
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,080
He was also very politically engaged, far out on the left.

132
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,460
The fact that the world itself lacks values is the logical consequence of an atheistic philosophy.

133
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,180
It is man who gives things his meaning as we have now taken the role God previously had

134
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,020
in the human performance.

135
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,400
Things therefore, like the humans, are basically meaningless.

136
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,320
Despite this, we are constantly busy trying to control things.

137
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,560
We have plans for things.
 Only therefore they mean something to us.

138
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,140
But there are situations where we clearly feel the excess of things.

139
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,880
How meaningless do not get small memory things, newspaper clippings

140
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,820
And anonymous photographs in a relative's estate?

141
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,700
The dearest memories end up in the heirs' black garbage bags.

142
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,680
The whole existence sometimes becomes like a death estate after God where all things become meaningless.

143
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,840
The world is no longer a creation but a pile of debris, says Sartre.
