1
00:00:00,076 --> 00:00:04,098
Plato is undoubtedly one of the most important thinkers of history

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:08,116
And with him, philosophy was formed as we know it today.

3
00:00:09,034 --> 00:00:15,130
It has even been alleged that philosophy's continued history is only footnotes to Plato's thoughts.

4
00:00:16,092 --> 00:00:20,146
He originated from Athens aristocracy and the family's fortune

5
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:26,058
enabled him to devote his life to philosophy and searching for knowledge.

6
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:32,045
The name Plato is said to be a nickname he received in his youth when he devoted himself to wrestling

7
00:00:32,054 --> 00:00:36,062
- A name he chose to keep instead of the birth name Aristokles.

8
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:41,134
He must have been in his 20s when he was occupied in the circle around Socrates.

9
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:47,112
For seven years he studied his teachings, before Socrates finally executed.

10
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:51,114
At that time Plato was the foremost of the disciples,

11
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:56,016
And anyone who would also pass on and develop philosophy.

12
00:00:56,098 --> 00:01:02,154
With Pythagoras as a model, he decided after Socrates' death to start his own philosophy.

13
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:08,055
The school went under the name Academy (by Akademos, a hero in Greek mythology)

14
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:13,050
And came to become the role model for today's universities and colleges.

15
00:01:14,026 --> 00:01:21,092
Here, teaching and research was conducted, and in the premises there were lecture rooms, libraries and housing.

16
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:28,168
The school came to live as an important institution for education for over 900 years before it was closed

17
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:36,100
By the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I who considered that philosophy was a threat to the Christian faith.

18
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:40,044
Plato also began writing books on the topic of philosophy.

19
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:45,154
These texts all revolved around Socrates who discussed moral and political concepts,

20
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:51,090
And was presented as dialogues between Socrates and various interlocutors.

21
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:57,076
It is thanks to these books that we know of Socrates - but here also a problem arises.

22
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:03,084
The early books are likely to give a correct portrait of the historical Socrates,

23
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:06,176
But over time, Plato came to develop philosophy.

24
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:12,009
However, he chose to continue to have Socrates as the main character

25
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:15,015
But now put his own thoughts in his mouth.

26
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:22,082
It is therefore difficult to determine where the real Socrates end and where Plato begins.

27
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:28,046
Plato was the first Western philosopher whose writings are preserved,

28
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:33,110
And we have reason to believe that his entire production on 27 books is preservation.

29
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:37,062
In the center of Plato's philosophy is the idea of idea -

30
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:45,064
A theory clearly influenced by Pythago's idea that speech exists in an abstract world beyond our own.

31
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:52,096
But what starts as a speech at Pythagoras will develop into ideas or forms at Plato.

32
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:59,074
According to Plato, what we with our senses perceive as reality is not the true reality

33
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:08,096
Without only a shadow image of it - this when our soul is locked in a body with imperfect knowledge organs.

34
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,096
The idea of ideas can be explained by thinking about a circle.

35
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:19,006
A drawn circle - thus something that exists in our perceived reality - can never be perfect.

36
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:23,054
If you look carefully enough, you will always find someone small defect.

37
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:31,134
What all drawn circles that have ever existed have in common is that they refer to the perfect circle.

38
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:36,039
But the perfect circle does not exist in our world, it is an abstraction.

39
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:41,059
The perfect circle - the idea of the circle - is outside time and space.

40
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:50,012
It is non-material and eternal, and is perfect to its definition.
 In addition, there is only one circle idea.

41
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:53,058
And even though the perfect circle does not exist in our world

42
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:57,090
Is it available to us through conscious and intellect.

43
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:01,037
According to Plato, there are thus two levels of reality.

44
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:08,096
In the reality we experience with our minds-the world of mind-everything is non-perfect and temporary.

45
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:13,118
Then there is another reality that has its existence beyond time and room

46
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:17,104
And that is not available to our minds - the world of ideas.

47
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:24,040
Here everything is perfect and eternal, and here is everything's shape, template or origin.

48
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:30,090
Plato now wonders what all people have in common, what it is that makes us just people.

49
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:36,070
Individuals change - grow up, aging and die, but the concept of human remains the same.

50
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:41,054
According to Plato we are humans because we have part of man's idea

51
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:45,126
In the same way that the drawn circle has part in the idea of the circle.

52
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:52,112
Everything that exists in our world is only worse copies of a perfect abstraction.

53
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:59,108
It is because we humans have the ability to see through reason and thinking the idea of things

54
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:06,013
which we can also identify and understand them.
 This reasoning makes Plato an idealist.

55
00:05:06,074 --> 00:05:13,088
Idealism is a philosophical view where it is believed that reality is basically made up of something non-material

56
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,106
- An idea or consciousness.

57
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:22,116
This is in contrast to realism or materialism that believes that reality is mainly material.

58
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:29,148
To explain the idea of idea, Plato Cave Like - a famous Allegori created where he paints a picture

59
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:34,070
of a couple of prisoners who interpret shadows on the wall as reality.

60
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:38,110
We are all these prisoners, said Plato, caught in our world of mind.

61
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:43,019
What we believe is reality is, in fact, only shadows of it.

62
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:53,062
In a cave, a group of people are imprisoned with their faces facing the inner wall.

63
00:05:54,022 --> 00:06:00,030
They have been sitting there all their lives, and are bound so they have never seen anything other than this particular wall.

64
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:06,037
Based on the opening of the cave, the sun's rays shine in and throw shadows on the wall in front of the prisoners.

65
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:10,039
These shadows are the only object that the prisoners have ever seen,

66
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:12,098
and will for them constitute reality.

67
00:06:14,048 --> 00:06:20,062
It is around this shadow world of the prisoners' lives, and they talk to each other about the things they see.

68
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:29,108
If any of the prisoners were to detach themselves and escape into the real world

69
00:06:30,044 --> 00:06:33,050
- So he would immediately be dazzled by the sun, as he had never seen before.

70
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:40,780
When his eyes got used to the light could see that what he previously believed was the act of shadows only,

71
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,840
or worse copies, of something more real.

72
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,900
We are all these prisoners, said Plato, captures in our own world of mind.

73
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,160
What we believe is reality is, in fact, only shadows of it.

74
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,560
Plato's ideas have also influenced Christianity (which at this time did not yet exist).

75
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,460
Above all, his description of the idea world - has

76
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,480
A perfect and non-material world where our souls live on after death-

77
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,420
Works as inspiration for Christianity's view of the kingdom of heaven.

78
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:26,800
In addition to his ideas, Plato was interested in politics and how to create the perfect society.

79
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,340
However, he did not give much to the newly established democracy.

80
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,820
This was a state of affairs that, according to Plato, created bad people

81
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,320
Where no one wanted to submit to anyone else and everyone wanted to decide everything.

82
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,180
No one was willing to sacrifice anything either, but everyone wanted as much as possible.

83
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:52,380
But the fundamental error with democracy was that it ignored people's differences.

84
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,120
Some people were simply better suited than others to control, Plato said.

85
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,920
We should remind us here that Plato, who came from aristocratic burden,

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:10,120
seen his family's political influence weakening with the entry of democracy.

87
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,520
In addition, one of the city's first democratically made decisions was to execute Socrates,

88
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,260
So you can understand Plato's frustration.

89
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,100
Therefore, in the dialogue the state, Plato proposes a new social system where people,

90
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,780
based on abilities, divided into three classes of society.

91
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,480
First a class consisting of farmers, craftsmen and merchants

92
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,320
which can produce things that are needed in a society.

93
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,060
Then a class of warriors who become the protection of the state.

94
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:46,400
These individuals had important functions in society, but they were not suitable to control it, Plato said.

95
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:54,020
Instead, the state would be guided by the Visa, by the philosophers - for only they own true knowledge

96
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,440
Unlike everyday people who only had performances.

97
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,820
Only the most intelligent would be trained to philosophers, an education that went on to the age of 35.

98
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,960
Then followed 15 years of internship before being mature at 50.

99
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,240
He argued here for both class trips and complete gender equality -

100
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,140
Two extremely radical thoughts for their time.

101
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:29,640
The philosophers were not allowed to have private ownership so as not to be attracted to abuse their power to personal gain.

102
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,260
Everything was owned jointly and one would live in a collective under simple conditions.

103
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,860
The philosopher was not allowed to have any family but the state would arrange big parties

104
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,100
where philosophers of both sexes would meet so that children could be bred.

105
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,540
These children would then be taken from the parents immediately after birth and raised by the state.

106
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,520
No one was told who your child was, so as not to benefit them.

107
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,860
The children would thus consider all of their own age as their siblings

108
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,840
And all in adulthood as their parents - and thus want everyone well.

109
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,460
His purpose with this was to overcome the human selfishness

110
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,280
through a system based on social equality.

111
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,960
The goal was to get a people who would do well in war,

112
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,120
Clearly inspired by the nearby warrior state Sparta.

113
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,780
Plato's political ideas have influenced many of the totalitarian left and right ideologies

114
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,180
which characterized the 20th century.

115
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,640
He must have tried on several occasions to realize his political utopia, but without much success.
