00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,820
Western philosophy was born in ancient Greece about 600 BC.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,400
At this time, Greece consisted of several hundred different city states,

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,940
Also called police, where Athens and Sparta were dominant.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,700
A city state was a self -sufficient area ruled by a king or a tyrant -

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,860
- the latter only a term for a ruler who conquered power

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,960
(often with some popular support) instead of inherited it.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:35,820
The Greece of the time was also considerably larger than today and included parts of the present Turkey

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,180
and colonies along large parts of the Mediterranean.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,260
At this time, a number of thinkers appeared who began to question the prevailing truths.

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,420
They no longer content themselves with trusting myths and gods tales

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,420
Without the help of reason to understand the world.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:01,400
In the past, knowledge of the myths had been what made the people meaning and guidance in life.

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:10,160
Drought and illness, war and accident, birth and death - everything was due to the belief in the power and influence of the gods.

14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,160
These myths would be managed and were not allowed to be questioned or changed.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,560
Wisdom was long to be able to reproduce the myths correctly and interpret them so that existence became understandable.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,000
But now a slowly began a shift from mythosis to Logos,

17
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,360
That is, from myth to reason, in the Greeks' thinking.

18
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:36,654
This change was first noticed only in a few, but soon it came to permeate Greek culture.

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,080
Of course, one wonders how it was that it was precisely in Greece that this change happened.

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,720
Perhaps an explanation may be that the Greeks, who were a seafarer people,

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Had extensive contacts with other cultures through trade and shipping.

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,940
In this way, they gained perspectives on their own myths and explanatory models.

23
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,220
Furthermore, there was no strong central power and no organized priesthood that controlled the area.

24
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:10,320
Greece was an Ã–rike that together with the colonies formed a loosely cohesive civilization

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,280
built on freedom and agreements between the city states.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,660
In the older centrally controlled Babylonian and Egyptian cultures, the priesthood had in a completely different way

27
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,360
dominated cultural life and thus made it difficult for free and critical thinking.

28
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,740
As the power of the myths weakened, reason entered into its place.

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,780
One was now trying to see the world as an interaction of forces and laws

30
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,540
And wanted to find natural explanations even on things that seemed mysterious and difficult to understand.

31
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:50,360
The first thinkers, the so -called natural philosophers or pre -democrats, tried to form a worldview

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,340
which was not based on divine influence, a first step towards Logos.

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,360
The term philosopher is used during antiquity as a collective name

34
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,580
For anyone who devotes themselves to describing the world scientifically.

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,280
Many of the first philosophers therefore devote themselves to what we would today call science.

36
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,400
It is only later in history that we have come to divide the sciences into different categories.

37
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:24,160
An example is the father of healing, Hippocrates, which meant that human diseases were due to

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,000
The environment she lived in and the food she ate, and that no divine powers or demons were involved.

39
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,640
This was a radical thought for its time.

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,020
The historians who recorded the fate of the people

41
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,420
began to refer to human decisions and natural circumstances

42
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,200
- It was no longer the gods that decided the fate of man, it was herself.

43
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,520
Eventually Greece developed into an economic and military superpower

44
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,640
with Athens as the dominant city state.

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,840
Here, culture and free debate flourished in a way that was unparalleled in the ancient world.

46
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,460
To this cultural center, thinkers sought from all of the Greek civilization

47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,380
And now the city ended up in the philosophical eye -catching.

48
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,320
Old traditions and performances were questioned and abandoned - but what would come in its place?

49
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
How would one shape the new society and how would man know

50
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,380
Which way she was going to wander now when the gods no longer ruled?

51
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,300
The conditions for philosophy were now in place and it would not

52
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,320
Lasting long before Socrates, Plato and Aristotle take place on stage.
