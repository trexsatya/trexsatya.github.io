00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:14,848
Hello!
 My name is Olof Osterman and I work on the national bibliography.

2
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:24,320
And in this instructional film I will show how to update an entry with advance information.

3
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:30,432
Such an item also called CIP Post, Cataloging in Publication.

4
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:42,468
Thus, an entry that has been drawn up before the physical book has come out and contains rudimentary information that is updated.

5
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:55,446
The book we will be based on is the great seedling by Jens Nordqvist.
 It is about plant breeding during the 20th century.

6
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:56,818
It looks like this.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:10,544
When cataloging a book, it is very important that you first check that the book is not cataloged by another library before.

8
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
If it is, then you use that catalog post and hopefully you don't have to do that much

9
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,667
More with the post itself.

10
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:26,528
But sometimes they need to be updated even when other libraries have made the records.

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,530
But we should look at now is how to do when updating an entry with only advance information.

12
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:46,383
So what you do is that you search for the book itself and the usual thing is that you search for ISBN numbers.

13
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,000
So I do it, here only in the search box.

14
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
So, and press search.

15
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,672
And then we get this book.

16
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:14,674
And in this card you can see that there is a F here in the upper left, which means advance information.

17
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:20,744
That this item only contains it.
 It is not updated in any way.

18
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:31,226
But to be really sure there are no other items or maybe any previous edition that one can use

19
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:45,575
So I also search for something in the title that is pregnant.
 The seedlings included in this title I can also search to see what I get.

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Then I get three items.

21
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:58,324
And the first is an audio recording and then it is the one we got up earlier also with this ISBN number.

22
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:07,587
Then it is also an electronic, but then I see that there is no one before so I start from this

23
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
The post already here.

24
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
Then I press Edit here.

25
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:27,336
Now this is such a post with advance information and then there is only rudimentary information here and

26
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:39,480
Then you may need more fields than what is available, and what you can do then is that you can click here on the tool and you choose enrich from template.

27
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,000
And choose a book.

28
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,680
Then we see 11 properties added from the template.

29
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,800
Then we have added a few more fields that we can fill in.

30
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,664
But we start by expanding all the fields.

31
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,799
You can either do this with Alt or just use the tool here.

32
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:18,718
But I start with the instance so I fold in the instance of works by clicking on the arrow there.

33
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:31,001
Then I go through these information and see what is here and I see that the ISBN number is what is on the cover

34
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:36,292
And that is what is in the book, so the ISBN number is correct.

35
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:43,363
Then we have a distinctive addition that says that the book is hardcover and that is also true.

36
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,327
And the following three fields are just standard fields so I don't have to worry about them.

37
00:04:52,607 --> 00:05:03,801
But then comes next ... I'll pick up this little neighbor.
 So, so it looks a little better.

38
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:17,295
The next field is has the title and here we have the main title of the big seedlings, and then we will see what it looks like on the title page.

39
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,999
Thus the book's primary source.

40
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,327
There it says the big seedling.

41
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:31,305
And we also have a subtitle here;
 starvation, looting and murder in the century of plant breeding.

42
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
And it also corresponds to the book so we do not need to make any changes.

43
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:45,748
But often this can be a field in which errors may occur.

44
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,463
This is how you have to be careful that you really look for properly.

45
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:58,473
And then we also have a filing value here and we have that because it says "it" here in the main title.

46
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:06,298
So that it will index this title on the big seeds instead of the large seed solder.

47
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,687
But title and subtitle were correct.

48
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,783
Then we move on to the origin.

49
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:25,148
On the title page it is only Jens Nordqvist and it was not included in this advance information so we add it.

50
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
And then we have a circulation task and if there is a storage poison in the book then it should be included.

51
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:47,562
It doesn't, and then you just leave it shiny.
 It then disappears when you save.

52
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
The next field is publishing.

53
00:06:51,135 --> 00:07:00,882
And here we have publishing country and we have the publisher's name and we have a publication year here.

54
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:09,674
But we also want to add a place of publication and we will also add a date,

55
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:15,455
To show how it says in the book if there is any publishing year there.

56
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:30,815
But now I have used this template, but since there was already values in this field, no more fields are added

57
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:39,672
So then I have to add them myself.
 And then I click on the plus in primary publication.

58
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:49,819
And I have choosing a place.

59
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:57,183
And then I get a plus sign that I either just press Enter or press again.

60
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:05,216
And then I'll choose a place down here under Create local entity.

61
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,291
And then I get a field where there is space - term.

62
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:18,175
I look at the title page and here is only the publisher's name.

63
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
But on the back of the title page, they have stated that historical media is located in Lund.

64
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:32,297
Then I can just write it there, and then I write Lund just because it says in the book.
 Had it not done that, I would have had to cling.

65
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,375
On the title page stands the historical media and that is true.

66
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Year is also correct.

67
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,847
On the back of the title page we have a pressure year and a copyright year.

68
00:08:47,359 --> 00:09:01,650
Then we have to start from the two and then we will add dates and then we will put 2020 within staples.

69
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:11,106
Because there is no real publication year in the book.
 There were only pressure years and copyright years, but then we start from the print year.

70
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
We base our publishing year on the print year.

71
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,127
And if we have done so, we also want to bring the print year.

72
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,759
And this is added here during manufacture, so here we only write in 2020.

73
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
This book is printed in Falun by Scandbook and it is also in the book.

74
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,815
It is not a core element so you do not have to add it.
 NB adds it to Swedish publishing.

75
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:46,159
So we add Falun, Scandbook, as it says in the book, and 2020.

76
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,567
But other libraries don't have to.

77
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,295
Copyright years you do not need to add if you have the right pressure year here.

78
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
Next field, expected publishing time.
 This is a field that

79
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
occurs very often in this type of advance information and it is very good to know

80
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:21,311
If anyone asks, when can this book be expected to come out, it says that it is supposed to come out in October 2020.

81
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:26,687
But now it has actually come out for real so I have the physical copy here in my hand.

82
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:31,830
So now this task is obsolete so I just remove it.

83
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
And the next field

84
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,743
Range.
 For printed books, this is the pagination.

85
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,143
Here are 333 pages.
 This is a field that you have to pay attention to as well.

86
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:54,879
Here it can often be incorrect information.
 But in this case, the book is actually true.

87
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,407
It is on 333 pages.

88
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,824
And then there will be another field, dimensions.

89
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
There is nothing that is a nuclear element.

90
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,563
NB usually puts it in.

91
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:17,673
What applies then is to ... for other libraries then it applies if this seems to be plausible,

92
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:27,987
That it seems to be 23 cm when you look at the book and think it seems to be true, you can just leave it.
 Just accepted it.

93
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:39,679
But we at NB always measure the books and in this case it was actually over 23 cm and if it is over 23 cm you have to write 24 cm.

94
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,231
So I actually change that to 24 cm.

95
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
That's how.

96
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:57,283
Other physical details.
 The most common other physical details for books are illustrations

97
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:03,818
So I have to browse this a little quickly and see if there are any illustrations in the book.

98
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,489
And it does.

99
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,111
So that is true with the task that is there.

100
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:13,337
There are illustrations.

101
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:20,095
That is what we specify when there are illustrations.
 We just print it.

102
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,859
Serial membership.
 Then you have to look for if the book may be included in some series.
 It doesn't.

103
00:12:27,859 --> 00:12:35,208
So we just let that field be.
 It will disappear then when we update the post.

104
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,783
Then we have a note.

105
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:50,338
There is nothing that we need to add to any note without the bibliographic information we have provided here we are satisfied with.

106
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
This note will also only disappear later.

107
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:04,250
Then I finished with the instance itself and then I move on to the instance of works, so I will develop it again by clicking on the arrow there.

108
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,193
The type of work is text.
 Correct.
 You do nothing about that.

109
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,879
Then we have participation and function.

110
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:26,508
There we have already completed Jens Nordqvist.
 But what to always do is to check if Jens Nordqvist is authorized

111
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:29,624
And then link to the Aukt-Posten.

112
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:34,720
I do this by clicking on this link.

113
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,247
So, and then I get Jens Nordqvist here.

114
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,623
It says that he is a journalist and business area history.

115
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:56,783
If I want, I can check out what kind of books he has written before, but I have already done that so I know it is this person.

116
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:08,706
So I just click on this link here and then these local entities are replaced with a link instead.

117
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
That's how.

118
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,738
And then we have function, writer, that's right.

119
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,353
Late language, Swedish.
 The book is written in Swedish so that is true.

120
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:33,205
Genre/form, not fictional work and Marc is correct.

121
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,767
And then we have classification.

122
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,776
We have two classifications here that we can fill in.

123
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:49,855
On the one hand, we have DDK classification that most research libraries use.

124
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:58,945
This is a book about plant breeding and there is a number for what is 631.52

125
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,215
And then this was a historical aspect for it is about plant breeding during the 20th century.

126
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,591
So then we can add a historical aspect here too, 09.

127
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,633
And 04 for the 20th century.

128
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,467
If we want, we can also add a classification as well, for SAB.

129
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:35,841
And equivalent is QDDA: K.5

130
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:46,789
QDDA includes plant breeding and: K.5 becomes history the 20th century.

131
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,000
But each library adds the classification that you use yourself.

132
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,975
If you only use SAB, you can just put SAB.

133
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,327
And on the contrary, if you only use Dewey.

134
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:17,610
But now we want to add some topics to this one as well and in this book you have dealt with three geneticists,

135
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:25,000
Or plant breeders, quite extensively so we want their names here on topic.

136
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:36,476
So we start by adding the three people and the first is Vavilov, a Soviet plant breeder.

137
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,582
And he has here.
 So.

138
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:46,591
I have looked him up before.
 Russian botanist and geneticist also stands there.

139
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,711
Then we have a German, Brücher, Heinz.

140
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,233
So, now let's see.
 It may be good to write like that.

141
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
There we got him up.

142
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,815
Then we add him too.

143
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:14,662
And then an American is also called Borlang, Norman.

144
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:21,151
Strange, now I didn't get him up.
 Borlaug should probably be by the way.
 Now I looked wrong here.

145
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
There we have him.
 American plant breeders.

146
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:40,192
So.
 There we have the three people.
 But then we also want to add some general subject words as well.

147
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:52,520
And then we start by adding plant breeding, but we want a plant breeding with a historical aspect.

148
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:04,850
Then we will see if there is plant breeding history.
 It wasn't.
 Then we will make us add a compound term here instead.

149
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:13,524
This instructional film is not really about subject words so I take it a little quickly instead.
 There are other movies for that.

150
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,983
Here you add that it is included in Swedish subject words.

151
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,943
In that system.
 And then you should add the term components and then we will add plant breeding history here.

152
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,887
So then we write plant breeding.

153
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,999
So, then we take it.
 And then we add the aspect of history as well.

154
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,143
Here it can be good to add history SAO.

155
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,519
And then we will add it as an subdivision.
 This one then.

156
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:58,035
It should be an aspect of plant breeding.
 Not this general subject word history.

157
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,015
Then it looks like this.

158
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:07,810
But we had some more that we can add.

159
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:16,523
Now I have looked up these before and this combination of seeds with the aspect history is not found on any of these,

160
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:33,282
So I can only add them here by duplicating this one and then I take and add seeds.

161
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,951
And so we add history as well.

162
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:55,639
Then you could also add plant genitics, gene banks and war changes.

163
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,482
It also occurs in this book so there are also those that I can imagine adding

164
00:20:02,482 --> 00:20:09,599
But I'm waiting to do it.
 I can do it late afterwards, after this instructional film, because that's not what this is about.

165
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,719
But I can add to the 20th century as well.
 I can do that.

166
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,071
Now I actually have to get out of this box and start over here again.

167
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,663
Then we'll see here.
 Then I will have Swedish subject words.
 I see that there.
 It's this one then.

168
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:42,451
So, then I put some subject words in this post.

169
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,279
The next field is content type.
 Text.
 That's right.

170
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,887
We do not need to add anything about language.

171
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:00,538
It is written in Swedish and it is already stated in the post.
 Here.

172
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:07,455
Then I am done with the instance of works and then I can switch to admin metadata instead.

173
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
So I click here.

174
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:25,015
The first thing that shows up is bibliography and most libraries are not responsible for any bibliography.

175
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:30,496
So we just leave this field.
 We at NB add NB as bibliography.

176
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:39,349
We have two other fields here as well, control number and identifier.
 There are only two standard values that you leave.

177
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:50,105
But then we come to the description level and here it is very important to change to library level

178
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:56,002
or any other higher level.
 Either minimum level or national bibliographic level.

179
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:02,496
But most library catalogs at library level.
 At that level.

180
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:12,009
So we change here to library level.
 If you miss doing so, it may be that this post's information will be overwritten.

181
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:19,708
That there will be data flows that overwrite this information in the post.

182
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:28,989
There will be updates perhaps from someone else.
 Probably from book info or any such actor.

183
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:36,055
So it is very important to change to a higher level of description here.

184
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:47,100
Here you have even
 A warning in the next field, system technical note.
 Here it says, for example.
 that it is a machine -generated entry

185
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:54,836
And that you should change the level of completeness otherwise manually made changes will disappear.

186
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:05,620
Now we have done it so now this warning is not relevant anymore so now we can only remove it by clicking here on the trash.

187
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:16,614
Then we have post status.
 It is also something that is only automatically set.
 You don't have to think about that.

188
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:20,832
Created by, this one is created by book info.

189
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:27,232
They were called the Book Round before.
 That is why they have that sigen, book.

190
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,816
It just remains there.
 Nor should we change it.

191
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:37,858
Last changed it also says that it is bookr.
 So book info.

192
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:50,123
But when we will update and save the mail, we, KB, Library S, will be last changed.

193
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,611
And if someone else would go in and make any change and save, it will be those who last changed.

194
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,488
And it is also something that is only automatically set.

195
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:09,030
Next field, cataloging rules.
 Here it says that ISBD intersection is available.
 That's right.

196
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:18,968
I have not added any ISBD interview here, but it is automatically generated based on the fields we put the information in.

197
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:30,511
But we want to tell you that the catalog rules that I use are RDA and we add this here during the ISBD interview.

198
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,768
So we click on the plus here.

199
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
And then we end up here.

200
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:40,951
And then we will add a local entity here.

201
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:50,986
And then we click on this and then I get some options here, and then you should choose this option, cataloging rules.
 Just that.

202
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:59,713
Not one of the other options, but this is the case, cataloging rules, so we click there.

203
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:08,407
And so we just enter RDA.
 This is what we use as cataloging rules.
 That system.

204
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,288
And the other, cataloging body, system names, cataloging languages.
 They are also correct.

205
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,091
So there is nothing you need to do about it.

206
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:36,447
The next field we will add is upgraded by and it is not included in this template so we can click on the plus sign in the tool menu.

207
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:45,983
Then we click here on the plus and here we write upgraded by.

208
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,312
It is enough to write "stated" just so you get it.

209
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,640
And then we click on the plus here.

210
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,282
Then we get a new field there.
 Click the plus again, or just press Enter.

211
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:06,022
And here we will create a local entity, so we click down here.

212
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,283
And it's a library that has updated this post so we click library there.

213
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:21,060
And get a box where it stands sigel.
 We fill in our Sigel.
 S in this case for KB.

214
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
You fill in your own Sigel.

215
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,687
So, but then we have finished this post.

216
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:39,869
You can look a little quickly before saving it.

217
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,656
It looks good this.

218
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,520
Then we just click here on Save and stop editing.

219
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:03,785
Then the next step will be to put on a stock, but it is another instructional film, so I do not take it up here.

220
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:12,317
So then I thank you for the attention and end here.
