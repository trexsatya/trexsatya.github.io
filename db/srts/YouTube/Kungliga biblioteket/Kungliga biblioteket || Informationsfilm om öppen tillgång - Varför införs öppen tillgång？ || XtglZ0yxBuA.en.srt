1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,000
Since the end of the 1990s, a development has been going on

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,880
-mot a digitized publishing system for research results.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,720
The development has been driven by the deficiencies with the traditional system-

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,840
-For example, subscription prices increased and locked up research results-

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,360
-But also through the technical opportunities that the Internet entails.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,760
An important milestone in the development towards open asset-

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,720
-We the manifesto <i> The Budapest Initiative in 2001-</i>

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,760
-As as stated during a conference in Budapest.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,600
The manifesto defines open access like this:

10
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,160
<i> The Budapest Initiative </i> has been followed by several similar manifest-

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,520
-If example the Berlin Declaration from 2004:

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,680
The main reasons for the development towards open access are:

13
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,080
The need to be able to spread research results free-

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,040
-So that more people can access and use the research results in everyday life and work.

15
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,400
Both researchers, decision makers, professionals and the general public.

16
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,600
The high subscription prices in the traditional model for distribution.

17
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,240
From the beginning, open access to scientific publications-

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,160
-But nowadays also research data included-

19
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,760
-In the information that should be openly available.

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,440
By research data is meant, among other things, results from experiments, measurements-

21
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,800
-Observations, statistics and interview responses.

22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,920
Thus, openness has come to include the entire science system-

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,600
-and the processes that deal with collaboration, communications-

24
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,880
-and spreading research results.

25
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,120
That scientific publications become more openly available-

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
-The led to the benefit of society.

27
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,920
The UN body UNESCO emphasizes that open access is of fundamental importance-

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,960
-To achieve at least ten of seventeen sustainability goals for 2030.

29
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,440
In hospitals and health centers, there is a great need for access to research.

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,840
With a subscription system, the cost becomes an obstacle.

31
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,560
There is a hope that open access will be able to change this.

32
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,080
Even business, non-profit organizations, politicians and a number of other actors-

33
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,880
-will benefit from being able to freely take part in research results.
