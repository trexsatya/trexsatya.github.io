00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:19,213
Hello!
 My name is Fatima Klanco Al Mulki.
 I work at the Royal Library.

2
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:24,576
I will now show how to primarily catalog a book with non-Latin alphabet.

3
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:31,949
The described approach applies to version 1.19 of Libris cataloging and may change.

4
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:36,916
I have chosen a book that is in Serbian with Cyrillic alphabet.

5
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:43,776
I will now search for the Serbian translation of Christer Karphamam "judges in lawless countries".

6
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:50,607
We are looking for here in free text on the ISBN number.

7
00:00:52,687 --> 00:01:09,128
And we get no hits.
 I also search for a pregnant word in the title and writer, and I get no hits either.

8
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:18,619
Now that I have assured that it is not cataloged, I choose to press Create new.

9
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:28,983
Here I will get a menu of different templates and I choose printed monograph - RDA.

10
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:38,728
And before I start by filling in, I can briefly tell you about this menu on the right.

11
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:50,756
The tools include: Expand everyone, minimize, enrich from template and here you can choose different types of templates eg.
 Book.

12
00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:56,224
Plus signs in case one would miss any trait.

13
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
It is not relevant in this case because we are already based on a template.

14
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:13,215
Here is the Undo button and here is the Save button, or create the post button.

15
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:24,600
We can also see here that the entry is divided into an instance part and an Admind Datel.

16
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:37,432
In the instance of works, one is related to the work as agents, any preferred title, classifications, subject words.

17
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:43,883
The real instance begins at the identifier.

18
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:57,994
Here.
 And here are the descriptive characteristics and information to them we retrieve directly from the manifestation.

19
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:02,261
But we start from the administration.

20
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:10,871
The first thing that meets us here is bibliography and most libraries do not have to care about this,

21
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:19,314
But within Libris there are some bibliographies that we register and such a bibliography is the national bibliography

22
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:28,472
Another is Suecana, it is Swedish material that has been translated into other languages and the Royal Library has the task of collecting and preserving.

23
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:36,783
Since this is a translation of a Swedish work and I catalog for KB, I want it to be included in the Suecana collection,

24
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:42,129
Thus, the collection of foreign material with Swedish connection that KB preserves.

25
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,972
And I am entering here

26
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,516
Suec, which stands for Suecana, instead of Sigel.

27
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:01,408
Then we have the description level.

28
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:08,835
Most libraries need to settle at library level, or choose the library level.

29
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:15,144
Post status changes automatically when we save.

30
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:25,476
Cataloging rules.
 Here we see that it is an RDA post and that we use ISBD interview.

31
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:31,647
In most cases, the information should be divided into different and underlying properties.

32
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:42,879
In some exceptional cases, it is necessary to use ISBD interview within a property, to separate data, so we leave it.

33
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
Cataloging language is Swedish.
 We don't change that either.

34
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:56,946
And the cataloging body is what applies to Libris library.

35
00:04:58,234 --> 00:05:06,947
What we should add and that was not included in the template are two things.
 One is Systemtekinsk Note and the other is modifications.

36
00:05:07,353 --> 00:05:18,728
In System Technical Note, we specify which romanization home we will use when we transfer non-Latin signs to the Latin alphabet.

37
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,281
Within the Librian collective, we largely use the Library of Congress Romanization schedules

38
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:28,854
When transferring text with non-Latin writing to Latin writing.

39
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:34,350
Exceptions to this are made for church writing and Greek writing.

40
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:46,401
In the case of Cyrillic, KB/libris practice is that Slavic and most non -Slavic works with church writing should be translit according to ISO 9: 1995.

41
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:57,356
Instead, those libraries that need it may choose to transcribe according to KR76 (Kjellberg) and, if necessary, supplement with ALA-LC Romanization Table,

42
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:04,914
Non-Slavic Languages (In Cyrillic Script) for the extra characters that may occur in non-Slavic languages.

43
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:15,273
Exceptions make up Mongolic where the extra signs ө, ө are romanized as Swedish island, island and ү, ү as ü, ü.

44
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:19,135
And then we have exceptions for Greek which is:

45
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:30,228
Old Greek follows transliteration schedule established for scientific libraries in Swedish cataloging rules 1980 (SK).

46
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:39,575
Nygrecian texts follow transcription schedule stated for Swedish public libraries following the library service's practice for public libraries.

47
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:46,624
You can find more detailed information including links to the various schedules in the Metadatabyrån.

48
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:53,502
The important thing is that in this case you specify which table you use.

49
00:06:53,758 --> 00:07:04,688
And since we have a church alphabet here, we should state it.

50
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,871
We will first produce systemic remark.

51
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Like this.

52
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,965
And then we specify transliteration schedule.
 So there.

53
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:31,199
And the other thing we should put before leaving the admin meta is modifications.

54
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,127
Like this

55
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:45,758
And here we choose the last in the list: Non-Latin characters are available in both original and translated form.

56
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:53,002
And now we are done with the admin meta and move on to the instance.

57
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:58,133
Now I start with the bibliographic tasks I find in the book.

58
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:04,450
The ISBN I write here.

59
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:09,945
Distinctive addition.
 Most libraries do not use this field.

60
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:13,311
But here you can write about the book is stapled or hardcover.

61
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,568
You can also write other tasks that belong to this particular manifestation.

62
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,366
I choose to write here, stapled.

63
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,391
Late publishing method: Monographic resource.

64
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,682
When we catalog a regular book, it is always a monographic resource.

65
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:43,837
Media type.
 Wear type.
 It is right.
 It should always be unedated and volume.

66
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
Then we arrive at the title.

67
00:08:47,871 --> 00:09:00,694
And here we start from the title page and I write here the translated form of the title.

68
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
They look like this.

69
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:24,396
And I do not have other title information, but I will develop a variant title to put the title in original writing instead.

70
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:26,757
Like this.

71
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
So

72
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,144
And I have no filing values to take into account.

73
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:51,618
I also write the origin information in translated form as it says on the title page.

74
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:58,015
Next is a circulation task and there is rarely information about editions in new books

75
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:14,729
But if there is information then we will take it as it looks in the manifestation.
 And here I actually have, and it looks like this.

76
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,355
So there.

77
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,527
Publication.
 The first feature of primary publication is land.

78
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:37,996
And since we start from a template, Sweden is already managed

79
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:43,624
But we know that this manifestation comes from Serbia.

80
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,911
So I change it.

81
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:58,106
We write the place as it says.

82
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:08,621
Thus, the place of publishing.
 Sometimes it says in the publications only publishers and not the place of publication.

83
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:15,765
If it had not been a place of publication we would have to have it anyway, but then we would cling to it.

84
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,462
The following trait is an agent.
 Here the publisher itself should stand.

85
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:32,648
If the name of the publisher appears in the source in more than one language or in more than one writing, indicate the name that is in the main title's language.

86
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:39,697
If this criterion cannot be applied, specify the task that comes first in the source.

87
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:48,288
We follow the title page and write: Medija cents ...

88
00:11:49,119 --> 00:12:00,481
As it stands.
 If the task is not on the title page, then we take the charge from the place where the publisher is most highlighted, where it is most evident.

89
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,455
Then it's years and date.

90
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,017
Publishing time is a nuclear element for published manifestations

91
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:13,470
Year may only contain four alphanumeric characters.

92
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:22,655
It is not uncommon for the actual publication year to be in the book.
 The publication year can be based on the print year or the Cophyright year.

93
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,007
We have a print year and copyright year which is 2019.

94
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:43,715
Date is used if we do not have a secure publication year in the book and then need to specify characters other than those that are allowed in the capacity year.

95
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:53,712
In this case, we base the release on the print year and therefore need to enter 2019 within staples.

96
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
So

97
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:11,030
Then we have manufacturing.
 Since we have based the publication on the print year, we need to specify that year without staples in manufacturing.

98
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:16,159
We don't really need to fill in the place and agent, but we do it now.

99
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,197
So, here it should say ... so.

100
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:40,852
But as I said, most libraries do not have to care about the manufacturing tasks.

101
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
Range

102
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,874
Then we enter the last paginated page.

103
00:13:53,791 --> 00:14:09,392
Dimensions do not have to care either.
 But if you were to do so, you round up.
 If a book eg.
 Is 21.2 cm then you round to 22.

104
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:15,295
It is not mandatory but you can fill in if you want

105
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:21,951
Other physical details.
 Here you usually fill in illustrations, maps.

106
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:29,477
In this manifestation we actually have illustrations so I fill in here.

107
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,455
This manifestation is not included in a series.

108
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
To see how to enter series membership look at the instructions in the help texts.

109
00:14:51,391 --> 00:15:04,295
Remark.
 Here you can put in something that you think may be of interest to the end user and applies to this particular manifestation.

110
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,565
Now I'm going back to the instance of works.

111
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:25,226
Eventually, the works will be broken out and you will link to them from the instances but so far they remain as a local entity in the instance

112
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:31,062
And the work information is repeated in each entry in the same way as in Marc posts.

113
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:42,000
The title in instance of works should be the preferred title for the work and since this is a translation it should be the original title

114
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:45,663
And we should therefore check how it says in NB's post.

115
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:10,691
Then I put in here as it looks in the Swedish post.

116
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,789
So.
 Now we have checked that it looks right.

117
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,063
And we have no filing values to take into account.

118
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:33,738
Here I have participation and function and here I enter the author's name.

119
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
We check that the author has an authorized name form and we link to it.

120
00:16:48,639 --> 00:17:00,000
If we are unsure of the person, it is possible to click on the name and the entity will open in another window.

121
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,395
Then we have the opportunity to check that it is really the right person.
 But here we already see a judge and we are sure it is right.

122
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:19,634
So I link.
 And the function is already filled.
 It's a writer.

123
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:29,087
Participation.
 Here it can be a translator, illustrator etc.

124
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:35,231
Right in this manifestation I actually have no information about who the translator is.

125
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,726
So I skip it.

126
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:51,168
Now we come to language and since we are based on a template, the language is already Swedish here and we should change that.

127
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:56,381
The language is Serbian.

128
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,087
Genre/form.

129
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:08,271
Under "genre/form", different types of codes are collected such as the literary genre, and genre/form terms.

130
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:17,835
This is a translation of a Swedish book.
 There is an original to be based on which is cataloged by the national bibliography.

131
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,794
I can therefore look for it and link to the same genre/form term and subject words.

132
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:32,575
It is not possible to copy linked entities so I can look for them and link to them.
 First genre/form the terms.

133
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
Like this.

134
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:46,655
Like this.
 First.

135
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:16,713
And then I have ... Now we have linked the genre/form the terms.

136
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:27,891
For more information on how to add genre/form, subject word and classification, look at the instructional films: add genre/form,

137
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:32,555
Link subject words and primary cataloging of original works.

138
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,879
Lets see.
 Here we have two different parts.
 We arrive at classification.

139
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:45,279
We have two different parts.
 One is Dewey and the other is SAB.

140
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:57,909
SAB rating we do not do on KB so I will only do this dewey part,

141
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:02,058
And here I write lawyers - judges.

142
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:09,834
If I had chosen to leave this one, it would not disappear when saving.

143
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:17,314
Usually, if these fields are not filled, they will disappear when saving the mail.

144
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:21,707
But in this case, I actually choose to remove and just leave Dewey.

145
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:29,193
I am on topic and here I add according to ...

146
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,015
This is the right one.

147
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,135
And then I also choose

148
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
So

149
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,376
And finally I choose the person myself.

150
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,048
So there.

151
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,672
Now follows a note of language.

152
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:25,002
In this field we can add, for example, something that is important for the end user such as

153
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:33,873
That the Arabic that the text is vocalized, it is Serbian with Latin alphabet etc.

154
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,688
It is the catalog that assesses whether any remark is needed.

155
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,552
This is appropriate because there is a complaint about language.

156
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:54,859
Because this is Serbian and Serbian is usually written with church alphabet, and I have just one in my hand.

157
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,424
So I choose not to write any special note about it.

158
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:10,911
We should not forget that this is a translation and we develop that property via the plus sign here.

159
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,320
And chooses translation of.

160
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,345
Like this.

161
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:41,011
So.
 And we choose the right language.
 It is translated from Swedish.

162
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:47,574
For translations in several stages, use the property intermediate language to translations.

163
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:56,894
It is not uncommon for the work to be translated in two stages: to ex.
 From the Swedish original to-English and then to Arabic for example.

164
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:15,273
Here we choose intermediate language by using the property ... like this ... and click on the plus here.
 Then an entity is created.

165
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,528
And we choose works.

166
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:23,648
And then we put the intermediate language here.

167
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:32,352
We find now, English for example and with this we had said that

168
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:45,600
This is a translation from Swedish to Serbian, via English.

169
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:52,870
But I remove this now because it does not match my book.

170
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
So, now we are done with the cataloging.
