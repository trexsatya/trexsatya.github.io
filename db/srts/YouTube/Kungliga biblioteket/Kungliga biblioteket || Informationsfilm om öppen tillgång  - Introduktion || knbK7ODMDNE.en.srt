00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome to this training which is about open access.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,840
Open asset is a concept that has become current-

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,000
-In the research and library world in recent years-

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,920
-And that will increase in importance to the entire society in the future.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Simply explained, open access means that it should be possible for anybody-

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,400
-To free of charge take part in research results-

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,640
-For example, scientific publications, by searching the internet.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,120
This might not sound so remarkable-

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,360
-But the fact is that the open asset means a major change-

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,680
-For both the research world and the libraries that make the research available.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,040
Open access is part of another current concept, open science.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
In an open science system-

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,680
-In open access to scientific publications and research data

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,840
-But also such as open learning resources and citizen participation in research.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,600
The government has decided that scientific publications and research data

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,720
-while the result of publicly funded research-

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
-Do be openly available.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,440
Whether you work at a library such as kb-

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,040
-or any other research library or if you are a scientist-

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,840
-Will you be affected by the movement against open access and open science.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,880
The transition to open access and science has been going on for almost 20 years-

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,080
-But is still under development.

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:45,600
This means that we do not have all the answers to how open access will work.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,920
In this training, which takes about 30 minutes-

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,920
-will you get a broad introduction to what open access is-

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,640
-and how it can affect you in your work.

27
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,760
You get to meet colleagues who talk about their views on open access from different perspectives.
