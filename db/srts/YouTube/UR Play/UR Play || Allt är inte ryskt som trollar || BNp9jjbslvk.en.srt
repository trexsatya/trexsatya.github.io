1
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,040
-Good juice, this.
 -Really.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,360
-But you, where is Eddie?
 - Should he be free today?

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,200
-Oh, there he is.
 -Gosh.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,440
-So.
 -Hello!
 Why haven't you answered?

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,440
-Hello!
 -No don't answer when you need you.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,920
I had to connect to the intranet and into the big screen ...

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,560
-.. for you to even react.
 -You really are Edwin?

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,960
Someone on a screen that is on public service.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,800
-It sounds like a Russian troll.
 -Ad off, that's me.

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,200
You can't believe that people are Russian trolls because they are angry online.

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,720
Okay, okay, you're right.
 Sorry.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,040
No danger.
 I just wanted to check if you had ...

13
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,960
In fact, you have a good point.
 Now we make a section on this.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,040
Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the "Viral Reviewer".

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,760
They run the source criticism - Sweden's national team in source criticism.

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,280
Now they do and edwin safari "Källkoll Corona"

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,200
Last fall, Anders Ygeman held a speech-

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,000
-And said the Nordic region would be the world's first 5G region.

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:49,480
Instead of a few hundred Facebook comments, he received 2,000.

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,360
Most were critical of the 5G expansion.
 Sick huh, Edwin?

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,080
Yes.
 But I just wanted to ...

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,480
By New Year, Ygeman went out-

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,080
-And said that a Russian disinformation campaign was behind it.
 Russian trolls.

24
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,480
"Some interests want to whip up a negative picture of 5G"-

25
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,040
-"and disseminate uncertainty between state and citizens."

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,520
Then it became quiet until April 5.

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,960
SVT has investigated users who have commented.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,760
We can't find Russian bottoms.
 The tracks lead to an apartment on Södermalm.

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,800
-In who remembers section seven ... -We must talk about what 5g is.

30
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,240
We talked about 5G technology and how some are worried about the expansion.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,080
They had sat in their Facebook group and commented.

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,320
It does not mean that everyone was Swedish Facebook users-

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,120
-And we know that Russia is involved in the 5G issue.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,680
But Anders Ygeman had not proven that everything was Russian disinformation.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,680
They had urged each other to comment.

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,960
So it can go.

37
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,160
It may be misunderstood that 5G is dangerous, but you have to think so.

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,560
That's how opinion -forming works.
 People go together-

39
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,400
-To influence politicians to make good decisions.

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,560
It is not just opinion -forming, it is democracy.
 Cheers for democracy.

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,080
Sometimes drives and criticism is perceived as invented.

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,320
You do not experience them as real because it sounds too angry and strange.

43
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,960
But you can't dismiss them because you don't like what you hear.

44
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,880
Hello, listen.
 Can you just check if I ...

45
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,800
A critical debate is central to democracy.

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:12,280
You are not foam if you do not agree with Anders Tegnell and Stefan Löfven.

47
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,840
It is not wrong to think something else.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,720
The holders and authorities must have their eyes on whatever they think.

49
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,840
You want as many people as possible to eyes on what is right-

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,880
-And especially on what gets wrong, so that small errors are not big wrong.

51
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
Critical voices are super important-

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,600
-As the doctor Li Wenliang, who was one of the earliest to alert about Corona.

53
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,120
Errors are constantly noticed.

54
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,120
At the Public Health Authority's press conference-

55
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,480
-Where Emmanuel Karlsten last to ask a question.

56
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,760
By asking the question-

57
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,200
-He had a great deal of inaccuracy that the Public Health Authority had missed.

58
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,200
First, I have to get a clarification.

59
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,400
Did you say that for every confirmed case of Covid-19 there is 1,000 more?

60
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,760
I don't get the mat together.
 Surely there are 6,000 confirmed cases in Stockholm?

61
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,000
If you start from the material you have calculated-

62
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,080
-The for each confirmed case there is a dark figure of 999 more.

63
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,880
The math was not so easy to sort out.
 The error became a front page news.

64
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,200
The entire material had to be withdrawn and the report itself.

65
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,520
All because a single journalist had asked a critical question.

66
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
We should all have such eyes with us.

67
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,680
Eyes that are awake for wrong, small or large.

68
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,320
-Nice bonus at work.
 -Yes.
 But what happened to Eddie?

69
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,400
Eddie ... Jösses, what he is doing.

70
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,720
- He's on Mute.
 -Oh my God!

71
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,800
I just wanted to ask if I forgot a bottle of juice at work.

72
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,080
It's my birthday present for mom.

73
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,760
Wait.
 What are you drinking?

74
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,480
What the ---?!

75
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,200
Each section contains educational material at Urplay.se.

76
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,960
Search "Källkoll Corona" and select "Pedagogical Material".

77
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,720
Click on the worksheet.

78
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,880
