1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,480
A special temperature creates the perfect snow.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,040
-It who gives that ultimate powder.
 -We measure with the fluff act.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,240
The snow has many names and properties.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,360
If you look close, the world of the snow stars and the snow crystals opens.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,440
For what is hidden in snow ... arrives in the snow laboratory.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,040
My name is Johan Casselgren and I am a snow physicist.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,280
On the snow lab we try to map and determine different types of snow.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
Much like Linnaeus did with animals and plants.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,480
In the traces of climate change-

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,680
-is the need to understand the characteristics of the snow.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
-Then the need for artificial snow is increasing.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,200
One is looking for answers on how snow acts as material-

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,360
-and how to create safer winter tires, skis with more gliding-

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,640
-or understand how avalanches work.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,720
Knowledge that can both save lives and provide more Olympic medals.

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
We want to understand how the snow is created in the atmosphere-

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,000
-From molecules to snowflakes and snow cover.

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,200
The snow crystals are formed in the clouds when water vapor becomes drops that freeze.

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,720
Snow crystals have a hexagonal basic structure that gives beautiful designs.

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,560
The shape is due to the water molecules binding so to each other-

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,160
-When the positive hydrogen atoms attract the negative oxygen atoms.

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,000
Successfully, a hexagonal slice are built up where the molecules get easier.

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,520
Depending on whether the hexagon grows on width or height-

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,320
-Can the snow crystals just as well be tube -shaped or disc shaped.

25
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,760
The shapes depend on how water drops attach to the snow star and grow.

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,880
About one hundred thousand water drops are required to form a snowflake.

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,200
Down on the ground, the snow crystals are starting to form more and more round grains.

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,840
We go from looking at snow crystals to seeing the snow as a material.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,920
This is what we are researching: how the crystals affect each other.

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,520
The love of snow and man's relationship with the white is old.

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,000
For example, the oldest ski in the world has actually been found in Sweden.

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,200
It is 5,200 years old.

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,320
A thousand years older than the pyramids.

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,480
But it was not until the 20th century that the snow came to be about entertainment-

35
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,600
-With the growth of winter tourism.

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,240
The second hunt within skiing-

37
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,640
-Have made the snow increasingly interesting to research.

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,000
Now you try to find the recipe for artificial snow with good slide.

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,960
A fair snow that does not change during competition.

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,840
We look at different preparation methods for skis.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,080
The skis can be one to two seconds faster per kilometer-

42
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,920
-So that we can get even more medals in the ski gate next Olympics.

43
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,280
In dead snow, the snow grains do not attach to each other.

44
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,480
Moisture has been pushed out and makes the track porous.

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,560
The downhill is looking for the dry snow in the hunt for the best powder.

46
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,640
-We measure with the fluff act.
 -Fluffactor?

47
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,960
It describes how much snow it gets on the ground when the snow crystals land.

48
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,520
The powder is due to low humidity, dry air and low temperatures.

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,640
Then the snow will be much easier, which creates a fluffier snow.

50
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,760
The ideal temperature is minus 20 degrees, and then it should be cold for a long time.

51
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,280
Not many people dig in the snow just because it's fun-

52
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,440
-But like that I am, unfortunately.

53
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,320
