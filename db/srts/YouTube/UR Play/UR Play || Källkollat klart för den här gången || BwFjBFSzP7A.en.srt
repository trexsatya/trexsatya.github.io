00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:08,640
Good job with the series!
 Now there will be a lot of source criticism jobs.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,640
The future is light!

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,960
-God juice, right?
 -Scrumptious.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,960
-It was to my mom.
 -Now it became to us.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,440
Sorry, but we celebrate our successes.
 We are busy right now.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,840
Just for my sake, could we have a little recap?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,840
-Daprate through what we've been talking about?
 -Sure, why not?
 Absolutely!

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,920
Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the Viral Reviewer.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,320
Today, they run the source criticism, Sweden's national team in source criticism.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,360
Now they, together with Edwin Safari, are doing Källkoll Corona.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,800
We have handled urgent things.

12
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,400
Corona Virus!

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,600
-Jack, check out this video!
 -Atta so I'll just call Åsa.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,560
No!
 Don't say it's a scam!
 Can't something be nice in the world?

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,760
No wonder when it is very strange that is spread.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,000
I have a tip for everyone: don't cough on the elderly.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Corona is not just a disease.

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,560
It is power play and big politics.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,760
It's a lot now, but wait until there is a vaccine.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,080
-Top, but then: concrete tips.
 -Yes, we have also come up with.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,360
-There every day as April 1st.
 -The news picks up the deviant.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,920
-San it gets so big.
 -Richly hot it will be ...

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,840
... if you take the time not only to press the first search result.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Good, but I want to know more.
 Don't you have anymore?

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,000
-Yes.
 Do you know who Elisa Granato is?
 -No.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,120
I didn't know that either until I heard that she had died.

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,760
"Britain's first subject in vaccine study against Corona has died."

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,000
The article was widely circulated, also in Swedish Corona groups on Facebook.

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,320
But since this is our program, I guess it wasn't true?

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,720
No.
 Just.
 Elisa is microbiology

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,760
-And one of two subjects in Britain's vaccine attempt.

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,880
She had to wake up to the news of her own death and said this:

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,160
I live to the highest degree.
 I'm drinking tea.
 It is Sunday, April 26.

34
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,880
Three days after I got the vaccine or placebon.
 I enjoy Sunday.

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,360
What can you do when you see such a story?
 After all, we have distributed tips.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,720
Practical tips are to google things.

37
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,160
You can google on names, places and times.

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,720
Search the pictures.
 Check out different search results.

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Does it seem as if it is stated?

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
The last one might not be relevant.

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,840
The eyes should go to the most important thing: the sender.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,640
Who is talking?
 What is the site?

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,880
Use quotation marks when searching.
 Then you only get the wording.

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,840
You can delineate names, places and phrases that you want to search for.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,280
If you suspect that something is fake, try using it.
 For example...

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,960
... "Elisa Granato" and then the word fake.
 Then you get this.

47
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,040
You can also click around the site.
 Write "Click around the site".

48
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,520
Try it.
 Then it may turn out who is behind it.

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
It is a bit difficult to determine who is behind this site.

50
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
-There is no story about the site.
 -It is made two years ago.

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,800
Then it has not been used until recently.
 And the oldest articles ...

52
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,800
It is Stock Photos - genre images - used.

53
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,840
It is some kind of nonsen text fills the articles.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,960
Weird.
 One can conclude that it seems to be a click fishing site.

55
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,240
Someone tries to gather ad clicks and posts whatever seven ...

56
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,520
-.. Whether it's true or not.
 -Perfect!
 Thanks!

57
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,160
We have been educational.
 I designed the entire Swedish media market.

58
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,080
Things come in from the world and Sweden.
 TT sends them out.

59
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,720
And when I made my illustration of how rumors spread ...

60
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,280
So nice!
 Some circles.

61
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,120
We're talking about four events-

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,440
-But something that has been noticed so that so many people have heard about it.

63
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,560
Very good!
 I am so impressed with you!
 But what should you do now?

64
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,560
Now?
 This will roll on.
 We are out of for life here.

65
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,440
-Money in the bank!
 -We shall see...

66
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,640
-The producer!
 -The job offers!

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Social distancing!
 - Edwin, I received your email about the program idea.
 GREATE!

68
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,640
You are fully trained regarding source criticism.
 And you have such a ... young speech.

69
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,200
Should we go and talk about the program?

70
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,640
Yes, yes ... he left the juice anyway.

71
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,440
For each source check Corona there is educational material at Urplay.se.

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,240
Search "Källkoll Corona", Choose "Pedagogical Material"-

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,040
-And click on the worksheet to open.

74
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
