1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:09,160
Throughout history you have gladly painted paintings of people's good sides ...

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,120
... as knowledgeable, stylish, strong or brave.
 In the 1700s-

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,920
-If it is more common with paintings where people are crying crying.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,680
One sees, from that time, many paintings-

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,120
-There people are teary eyed with handkerchief, both men and women.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,960
During the era romance, the ideal is the knowing man.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,240
Poet Novalis writes: "The world must be romanticized."

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,840
It becomes modern to show off their feelings.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,160
He can lie in nature, look at an ant, think it is amazing-

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
-And is almost moved to tears.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,240
How did crying people get something positive?

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,120
How did it become more important with nature than with science?

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,760
What did you write and read during the emotional romance?

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,280
The romance lasts from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,440
The current is strongest in Europe-

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,840
-When just finished a seven -year war and is in change.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,600
The romance comes with its first emotional swallow sometime around 1780.

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,160
Then life was not fun, unless you were rich in an English castle.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,440
We live in gray cottages, because we have not started painting them red yet.

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,080
Sanitarily it is lousy.

21
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,280
At this time, the enlightenment has been dominant in Europe for a hundred years.

22
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,720
Science has been worshiped and seen bright in the future.

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,400
Man and society will be better and better.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,320
But then something happens that causes the ground to shake under the enlightenment-

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,840
-literally.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,840
Half past ten in the morning of November 1, 1755-

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,560
-The lavish Lisbon by a strong earthquake.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,840
Half an hour later, a several meter high tsunami pulls over Portugal.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,720
It will be a huge disaster with great devastation and close to one hundred thousand dead.

30
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,360
The news is spread throughout the world and becomes a reminder of the power of nature.

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,680
Many who followed the enlightenment put the coffee in their throats.

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,960
The enlighteners thought we would master the nature-

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,840
-But the terrible earthquake happens that makes them ins-

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,360
-That we have no control over nature.
 It is more powerful.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,280
Romanticism as a phenomenon is a reaction to the enlightenment-

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,160
-And against everything that the parents stood for: reason!
 What did you miss?

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,760
They missed the feeling, the glow, the inner driving forces and man himself.

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,280
The romance becomes an emotion revenge against reason.

39
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,280
Nature is central to romance, and as the cities grow-

40
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,840
-So writers and artists feel that they lose proximity to nature.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,800
Therefore, the draw to nature becomes stronger.

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,080
Not just the relationship with nature changes.
 When we move to the Stan-

43
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,600
-Communication is changed.
 Safer

44
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,800
-And the need to keep in touch causes the letter writing to explode.

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,720
One person could write ten to fifteen letters a day.

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,560
There was not SMS or telephone-

47
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,480
-Or you kept in touch with friends and relatives by letter.

48
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,000
Then they began to release authentic letter collection-

49
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,000
-But also write letter novels, as fictional form.

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,840
One of the letter novels was the important work "The young Werther's suffering".

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is German and 24 years old when he writes about Werther.

52
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,200
He participates with other young poets and students in a movement in Leipzig.

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,200
They call themselves "Sturm und Drang".

54
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,640
The words mean "storm and longing".

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,200
On that you hear about what it is about-

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,080
-And how important the strong emotions are.

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,560
The novel has a fairly simple action and is written in letter form.

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,440
Werther writes to his friend Wilhelm, and we get to read.

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Werther falls extremely in love with Lotte.

60
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,840
He meets her, but she is betrothed.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
After a while, Werther is not able to marry him-

62
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,120
-So in the end he commits suicide.

63
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,560
The book becomes a bestseller.

64
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Everyone should read it.
 It is printed in three million copies.

65
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Napoleon calls the "the best European book ever"-

66
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,880
-And boasts that he read it seven times.

67
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,240
It creates a subculture around Europe.

68
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,240
Young men dress in "Werther costume" with yellow vest and blue jacket-

69
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,200
-And dreaming of being unhappy as Werther.

70
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,960
Goethe took after a real event.

71
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,400
A young student, Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem-

72
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,240
-hade committed suicide of unhappy love.

73
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,360
Everyone realizes how dangerous this can be.
 What if our young men read the book?

74
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,040
They are in love and want to be like Werther.

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,920
They want to be unfortunate in love as Werther.
 Books are dangerous.

76
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,280
Some German Principality forbids “Werther” for health reasons

77
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,960
-To people not to shoot themselves.
 There is no indication that people did.

78
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,680
They read and cried, and fell in love again.

79
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,400
But that the authorities believe this is symptomatic.

80
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,920
They realized what effect the romantic craze had.

81
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,360
Books got spread and an incredibly large impact.

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,360
One wondered how people would be affected by the fantasy world-

83
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,280
-and especially when the fantasy worlds did not come up with useful messages-

84
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,960
-If how one would be as a human being, without affirming the crazy and wild-

85
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,160
-When you do in "Werther".

86
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,640
Hans Christian Thulin has performed "Werther" as a monologue.

87
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,520
Håkan Hellström had a song, like this: "Young Werther's suffering" something-

88
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,520
-And everything that Håkan took in I thought was cool.

89
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,280
"'The young Werther's suffering' must be cruel as a monologue."

90
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,440
I knew I would never get Miss Lotte.

91
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,000
I hadn't read it, but thought of Sturm und Drang and hot feelings-

92
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
-Wigs and powder, so it must be fun!

93
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,320
We sat down and read the book ... and were disappointed.

94
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,200
We had almost thought that a book written in 1774 about love-

95
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,600
-Must be superdum and super fun.

96
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,920
But instead it was very real-

97
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,200
-Sorious and touching for real.

98
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,560
There is no measure.
 It is important that romance-

99
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,600
-opposes the idea of moderation and tastefulness in literature.

100
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,920
To convey emotions, Goethe uses many exclamation points.

101
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,920
"The young Werther's suffering" contains 420

102
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,600
-What is 17.3 % of the book's total amount of punctuation.

103
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Enlightenment's "Robinson Crusoe" has 2.8 % exclamation mark-

104
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:42,440
-And "Harry Potter and the Wise Stone" has 6.5 % exclamation marks.

105
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,080
If we read we see that "Werthers" first sentence-

106
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,720
-"What I'm glad I'm gone!"
 ends with exclamation marks.

107
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,040
The second sentence of the book "Dear Friend, what is human hearted!"
 Do it too.

108
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,360
When the writers of romance do not violate the rules-

109
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,080
-They look back and write novels about the past.

110
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
A well-known, romantic Swedish work that bubbles by nostalgia-

111
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,440
-As Viktor Rydberg's "Singoalla".

112
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,080
Just like "Werther" it's a tragic love story-

113
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,400
-But in a historical environment.

114
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,880
It is about the knight's son Erland and Singoalla who is Rome.

115
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
Singoalla!

116
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,520
The language of Singoalla is typical of romance.

117
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,080
"At the top of a hill in the forest grew a spruce, young and pain"-

118
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,760
-"But higher than all the surrounding trees."

119
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,160
"Her top appeared from the castle windows over the forest."

120
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,360
"When she signed up against a red evening sky, it was"-

121
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,840
-"As if it was seen out in the world and wanted the land of the palm trees."

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,360
We see the painting nature depictions and imagery-

123
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,760
-Where a spruce has emotion-

124
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,120
-and how dreams are used as a narrative element.

125
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,720
"Singoalla" takes place in the Middle Ages, which was considered töntig-

126
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,080
-and been called "the dark time".

127
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,480
The romantic should of course be counter -halls and like the Middle Ages.

128
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,040
The Romantic loves the Middle Ages.
 They worship it!

129
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,480
What figures do we have?
 King Artur!
 Our old Vikings.

130
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,680
You pay tribute to the dark, the past and the irrational.

131
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,240
Romance causes our culture to make a streaming-

132
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,280
-From reason to emotion.

133
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Nature, the stylistic grips and the craze for the past are important parts-

134
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,080
-But the center is the knowing man-

135
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,760
-which is more than reason and brain.
 Love and longing are common themes-

136
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,880
-But what happens if the knowing man is exposed to something negative?

137
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,720
If she is exposed to something scary?

138
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,440
Well, we get one of the most popular literary genres ever: horror.

139
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,200
On the one hand, romance has said that we really should feel-

140
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,440
-and be an experience self.

141
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,600
But if you are exposed to something scary, what does it do with the self?

142
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,280
A genre that becomes bestseller's and beats knock-out on everything-

143
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,320
-And that pops up now, it's the horror romance.

144
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,200
This kind of story-

145
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,680
-Had never worked before, but now they went home.

146
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,440
A horror book that is relevant today, two hundred years later-

147
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,000
-written by only eighteen -year -old Mary Shelley.

148
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,040
Again, nature plays an important role-

149
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,120
-But with something less dramatic than an earthquake: a bad summer.

150
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,560
At Lake Geneva in Switzerland, in the romantic Alps-

151
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,320
-You would spend some young friends spend the summer.

152
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,080
Mary, her future husband Percy and Lord Byron-

153
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,400
-Imagine walking and sailing ...

154
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,760
... but it was an unusually rainy and gloomy summer.

155
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,680
They needed to pass the time and Lord Byron came up with the idea-

156
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,720
-In the evenings, tell ghost stories.

157
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,600
Mary Shelley has written in her diary-

158
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,120
-That when it approached her turn, she got nervous.
 She didn't come up with anything.

159
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,080
But one night she had a nightmare.

160
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,560
She saw a pale, young man cast life into a dead creature.

161
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,280
She was terrified by the dream.

162
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,400
From the dream came the foundation of Frankenstein's monster.

163
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,600
It is not the monster called Frankenstein, but the creator, Victor.

164
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,800
The novel is about his attempt to create a creature out of dead matter.

165
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,000
Give me life!

166
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,240
Under there is criticism of the enlightenment's idea of enchanting nature.

167
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,360
"Frankenstein" is relevant when it is about things-

168
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,080
-As we struggle with and think about in the present.

169
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,640
When Victor Frankenstein built the creature and wanted to breathe life to the-

170
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,600
-So it is like when we develop artificial intelligence.

171
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,040
We want to create autonomous creatures-

172
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,680
-As in different ways interact with people, and help people.

173
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,880
I think we can draw lessons from Frankenstein.

174
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,200
What can happen to us if we do not handle the development-

175
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,280
-In a good and responsible way?

176
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,680
We must not rely on technology but need the human aspects.

177
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,840
Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" re-released and has been filmed several times-

178
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
-As everything from horror movies to comedy.

179
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,200
The monster with screws in the throat-

180
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,560
-As even today one of our most iconic figures.

181
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,120
More female writers achieve success during romance.

182
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,800
We have Julia Nyberg, by many considered the best Swedish poet of the time.

183
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,760
Doors open in the literature that have been closed to women.

184
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,400
"You write letters like a woman" becomes a compliment.

185
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Women were given opportunities, thanks to the emphasis on emotion.

186
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,920
It is also because women-

187
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,320
-Not had the same education as men.
 They were not schooled in Latin-

188
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,880
-And the classic rules that had applied in literature.

189
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,200
But now they got an opportunity when writing from within the subject.

190
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,880
But despite more women's names on the book riders during the romance-

191
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,560
-Is no golden age for equality.

192
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,600
During the sensible enlightenment, the women were able to elbow themselves ...

193
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,560
... but the female image presented in the romantic works around 1800

194
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,680
-Is an idealized picture of the woman as a innocence.

195
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,400
It is also something that has a clutch-

196
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
-To the literature that inspired, from the Middle Ages.

197
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,280
It recurs under romantic-

198
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,720
-This with the innocence and the unattainable woman as an ideal.

199
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,600
When romance was strongest, many got a new way to see the world.

200
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,800
Suddenly you had to place yourself and the emotions in the center.

201
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,400
Horror is still popular, especially as movie-

202
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,880
-And there is no lack of literature on emotions.

203
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,920
The romance came to stay.

204
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,080
The values of romance are still guiding us.

205
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,720
We are not as incredibly emotional in our style-

206
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,320
-When Sturm und Drang, with Goethe and Werther.

207
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,920
But the idea of the feeling as the important thing - "Don't bump your feelings!" -

208
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,480
-As the principle that most people live by.

209
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,520
The romance controls us.
 We are romantics.

210
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:57,080
Not everyone has been beaten, drugged or been in Thailand on sun holiday-

211
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,160
-But everyone has been in love, or will be.

212
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,000
Everyone has been dumped and knows how it feels.

213
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,600
We can see traces of the same discussion between emotion and reason, then as now.

214
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,120
If romance was a reaction to the enlightenment-

215
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,880
-So there are parallels for today.

216
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,680
We have been focused on technical and medical development for a long time-

217
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:31,520
-But may have lost the human sciences, the humanities.

218
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,600
Although we do not make crying portraits, it is not to show emotions.

219
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,280
We can often put our needs and emotions in the main room.

220
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,960
I think we live in a time-

221
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,160
-Then their own feeling is set very high.

222
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,840
"Listen to your heart. Listen to yourself, not to anyone else!"

223
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,880
Then "Werther" becomes important, because it is about the heart being wrong.

224
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Then maybe it is unwise to listen to the heart?

225
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,680
