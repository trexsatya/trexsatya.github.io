1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,680
-Ring Åsa.
 We have to talk.
 -Wo?
 Okay.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,600
-Heh, Åsa.
 -Os.
 We must have an intervention.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,840
-Wo?
 -Wo?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,960
I have a lot of alarming information.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,280
Your coffee drinking is Beyond Control.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,160
This graph shows that you drank 20 cups only last Sunday.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,320
-Hher God, Åsa.
 -I have a sneaky picture ...

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,960
... which shows that you have been drinking late at night even

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,640
-This is awful, -The only that is awful ...

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,200
... is your use of information.
 We make a section on this.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,360
Journalists Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the Viral reviewer.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,680
Today, they run the source criticism, Sweden's national team in source criticism.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,600
Now they, together with Edwin Safari, are doing Källkoll Corona.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,200
There have been a lot of graphs and statistics in recent weeks.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,680
The Corona Pandemic is a worldwide business.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,400
This is something that affects a lot of people, finances and numbers.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,680
If one is to understand the development-

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,640
-It is often best included with graphs and statistics.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,520
But that does not mean that all graphs show the truth.

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,600
The difficult thing is to understand the statistics right, like Edwin's absurd hopes.

21
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,840
But then see me.
 What claims are wrong?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,240
You make it sound like I drank 20 cups only on Sunday.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,720
But you have summarized all the cups for my household all over the weekend.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,320
Then you present that figure that it applies to be a day.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,120
This is how the figures about how many people have died in Corona have been reported.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,160
One has taken the numbers for all who have died during the weekend-

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,800
-And presented them on Monday or Tuesday.

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,680
Then the figures will be higher, although in fact, one assumes for days.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,760
A bit like you did here, your cheeky.

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,520
-The curve is often much more even.
 -But not everyone knows.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,240
We called Peter Håkansson-

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,680
-Whith has written the book "Statistics in the news".

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,600
His sister -in -law in Croatia had heard about Sweden on the news.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,480
Large increase in the number of dead.
 We must explain that this is not true.

35
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,960
We have this backlog over the weekend-

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,320
-And then there will be new peaks when the backlog comes.

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,600
In addition, Edwin, your statistics are extensive.

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,200
You have brought water, decaffeinated tea and soft drinks.

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,520
That in itself is five of the twenty cups you mean I drank.

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,560
It is credible and relatively free from political influence.

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,640
So here it is in Sweden.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,560
We include more and more in our statistics and our data.

43
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,360
Other countries do not include those who die in old age homes.

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,480
Therefore, we get bigger but also more accurate figures.

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
We are told here already-

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
-This in some other countries you become aware of much later.

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,800
Okay, maybe it was a little cheating with the graph.

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,320
But still, 15 cups you have been drinking.
 15!
 How sick is it, Åsa?

49
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,080
There you are wrong.
 You count copper per household.

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,400
It makes it sound like I've been drinking everyone alone.

51
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,760
I have three people in my household and everyone has been drinking coffee this weekend.

52
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,160
You probably also got some coffee this weekend.

53
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,280
This is a problem when counting outbreaks per million inhabitants.

54
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,760
It causes less countries' outbreaks to seem worse than larger countries.

55
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,080
Take e.g.
 This comparison between the US and Sweden.

56
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,800
It makes Sweden's outbreaks look worse than the US: s-

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,720
-But the United States has much more residents than Sweden.

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,200
The disease spreads as quickly from person to person-

59
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,640
-independent of how many people live in the country.
 You infect just as quickly.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,720
This means that the number of infected people is emerging about as quickly.

61
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,920
Therefore, there are as many infected in both countries.

62
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,040
Then it looks like Sweden has more infected per million inhabitants.

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,560
Small countries' figures will always look worse than large countries.

64
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,720
But the picture then?
 I have a photo proof where you sit with a lot of cups.

65
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,200
It's a classic trick.
 The picture is taken from a tricky angle.

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,520
This is the same as the picture the police in Stockholm posted.

67
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,800
It looks packed on the street-

68
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,200
-and there some taverns on the street were later closed-

69
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,320
-To they had had too poor infection protection mode.

70
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,480
But there is still a point here.

71
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,040
How far do you think it's-

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,840
-Between the left corner of the picture and the lightboard you see there?

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
-Scare 30-40 m. -90 m it really is.

74
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,840
The picture is a bit inzoomad-

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,600
-And then it looks like it is closer between the points and narrower.

76
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,720
We took a new picture on this part of the street, where it looks much further.

77
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,160
A girl in Norway-

78
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,680
-EVearing how to take pictures from different angles and show different things-

79
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,000
-By footing lego guys.

80
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,360
Here they appear to be many.
 From the top you see that they are sparse.

81
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,160
Here is another picture that shows that I do not drink coffee without water.

82
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.
 I only care about your health.
 But then you come and ...

83
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,560
He would only know how many cups of coffee I drank.

84
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,200
For each section of Källkoll Corona there is educational material.

85
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,160
You can find it at Urplay.se.

86
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,800
Search "Källkoll Corona" and select "Pedagogical Material".

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,520
Click on the worksheet to open.
