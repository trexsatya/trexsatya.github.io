1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,998
-What fun to do new "Källkoll"!
 -Really.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,278
It always needs to be checked.
 Fun to meet Edwin again.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,958
-Have you seen his new channel?
 -No.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,118
Hello World!
 Welcome to my channel!

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,638
-Oh my God!
 What are you doing here?
 -Hello Hello!

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,078
Fun that you support.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,678
Do you remember your tips for me to start my own?
 "It's going Fabulous!"

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,758
Very funny, but shouldn't you be with us and do new "Källkoll" programs?

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,478
Check out things, go deep, source criticism online?

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,558
If I have time.
 I have many followers to take care of.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,198
-Many DM's.
 There came a new one!
 -Do you really have 700,000 followers?

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,438
-Sorry?
 -Okay, lovely, wow!

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,718
-But now we're going to do "Källkoll".
 -Yes, "of course, Darling".

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,238
Then we have to "level up" a bit, give it "Production Value".

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,078
I mean, your outfits, for example?

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,678
So ... like this.
 We go away and file on a press release ...

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,558
-.. So we see what it gets.
 -"Oh my good, yay!"
 New "Källkoll".

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,038
With edwin and company.
 Explosions, smoke machine, confetti.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,198
Here we go!

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,158
Okay, it's a news, but is that a big news?

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,518
-What?
 -That we start over with "Källkoll".

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,838
-Yes, now that I'm involved.
 -Yes Yes.
 Yes, yes.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,918
I guess the newspapers write more about something-

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,878
-If a celebrity is involved.

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,958
Therefore, gossip magazines use celebrities as click bait.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,638
"Ooh! Juicy!"
 But how do you know what will be a news?

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,438
We can address this when we learn about information, communication ...

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,118
Yes, but I want to know what makes a news big!

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,078
I checked with my "fellow gen-zedders"-

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,438
-On my channel, and they said like this.

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,878
There is something that has happened that may need to be noticed.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,158
A new event that affects society.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,838
Something that has happened in the world that is posted on the internet or in newspapers.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,518
Something important to lift up, type.
 That is worth knowing.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,118
What has been big news since we last saw?

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,958
-Pandemic.
 -"Miss Rona, We Know Her."
 What else?

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,558
The storming of Congress in the United States.
 I sat up all night watching.

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,958
I also.
 And I got stuck because they found a hole in Estonia's hull.

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,998
It sounds awful.
 Does it have to be awful to be a novelty?

40
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,078
It tends to be greater news of things that are not good.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,158
It is not always so, but unfortunately often.
 Bad news beats higher.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,318
Estonia was a ferry in the Baltic Sea which fell in September 1994.

43
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,598
According to information from the rescue management in the Turku-

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,518
-Had probably 838 people died in the Estonia disaster.

45
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,798
It was one of the largest vessel disasters in modern times.

46
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,678
And one of the biggest news events in Sweden.

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,518
-A national trauma.
 -No the State Accident Investigation Board ...

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,758
... who did an investigation, it was due to the bog visor raging off-

49
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,478
-And it came on board water, she sank.

50
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,958
But wait a bit.
 This happened in 1994.

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,318
-Why will it be a news now?
 -Ward objection.
 Temptuality.

52
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,958
It is one of the criteria for a news.

53
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,638
The news here is not that Estonia fell 30 years ago, but that ...

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,678
One can say this: the disaster has been surrounded-

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,638
-A of conspiracy theories and speculation since it occurred.

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,358
Not everyone believes in the Commission's conclusion.
 There are theories-

57
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,878
-If Russian submarines and blasts.

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,558
Last fall, a filmmaker was down and filmed at the wreck-

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,198
-The trot that there is grave peace there and it was illegal.

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,798
But he found a hitherto undiscovered hole.

61
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,638
Oh, look!

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,598
And the hole thinks many ... "Think if it occurred in connection with the sinking."

63
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,358
Then it may have contributed to her sinking.

64
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,958
So of the old news did it become a new one?

65
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,078
Not just one - several big news.

66
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,878
The filmmaker behind the grip to dive down with a drone and film the wreck-

67
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,518
-Where alone about doing so.
 It is because there is grave peace.

68
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,558
There are hundreds of corpses there.
 There is a grave peace since ten years.

69
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,798
So he was alone about it and broke against the law on grave peace.

70
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,838
Therefore, he was prosecuted, but he was also alone in the pictures.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,478
And being alone and first with a news is important in news context.

72
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,878
"Got it!"
 What else makes a news a news?

73
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,238
Proximity in time, space and identification.

74
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,718
Time is simple.
 It just happened, or we were told about something recently.

75
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,198
Room is that it happened near us, or pretty close.
 In Sweden.

76
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,838
And it happened to people who could have been, and also where-

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,638
-No neighbor, a friend in the same school, a mother.

78
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,318
Just.
 But identification is a bit tricky-

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,518
-The all of us are not and tjenis with everyone else.

80
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,318
I do not share the experience with you two of being a warm-up-

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,118
-But if something would happen in Värmland-

82
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,998
-I assume that you would also feel with affected warmers.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,678
It depends on who you are as a person, how much you take in the outside world-

84
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,118
-And how much you identify with others in it.

85
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,318
However, we generally seem to identify ourselves more with those who are like us-

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,318
-An like that we perceive as strangers or different.

87
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,438
It also seems to be so mournful that we care more about celebrities.

88
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,958
<i> Kim and Kanye's love story ... </i>

89
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,758
Jireel and Alice have ended.

90
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,438
But he is a completely different person ...

91
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,478
-"Absolutely."
 -San we have the effect.

92
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,318
Thus, whether what has happened affects many directly or indirectly.

93
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,878
Just.
 Therefore, the pandemic has become so great.

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,318
It affects every cone cone in the whole world-

95
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,998
-and it keeps happening.
 We don't know what's going to happen-

96
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,718
-So we have to continue to care about this.
 When can you go out?

97
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,558
But on the other hand, what is happening now tends to fake as news.

98
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,718
Most are pretty tired of hearing about Covid.

99
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,318
While in the beginning you panicked every time something came up.

100
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,998
Corona has become everyday.

101
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,158
The big news had been if Corona had disappeared.

102
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,518
A news is not something that is as it always is.
 There is something different.

103
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,158
Or dramatically, like finding a previously unknown hole in a shipwreck.

104
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,718
-How went the trial, by the way?
 -He was released p.g.a.
 a technicality.

105
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,358
They dived or sent down their drone from a German -flagged ship.

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,878
-He was released, anyway.
 -But was lowered the boat, right?

107
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,358
We don't know yet.
 The documentary has been criticized for being speculative-

108
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,118
-And that those who are interviewed produce conspiracy theories.

109
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,038
And he did not show that they had found more holes.

110
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,798
They only showed one.
 Maybe because it weakened their case.

111
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,278
That it would have had something to do with the sinking.

112
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,358
It seemed as if it were spectacular.

113
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,598
Now it is perhaps that it was naturally causes.

114
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,238
The hole they found has been enough for it to be worth an investigation.

115
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,278
Sweden, Finland and Estonia have said: We are thinking about a new investigation.

116
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,918
This news has potential.
 It may come out of it.

117
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,598
Just.
 Then it becomes like ... Sometimes media blows up large air castles.

118
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,958
And then, when you review in depth, it turned out not to be anything.

119
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,758
All this talk about water ... I'm getting thirsty!
 Coffee?

120
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,638
-Yes!
 -"Let's go!"

121
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,718
-Mm, editorial coffee!
 -Lovely.

122
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,518
Right!
 The storming of capitol, how does it stand as news?

123
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,678
As news - pretty good.
 It was very, very violent.

124
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,398
There was deadly violence, many injured themselves.
 It was heavenly upset.

125
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,438
USA!

126
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,558
Then the question is: Was it unexpected?

127
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,638
The police did not seem to be prepared for so many to come.

128
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,918
<i> The Capitoli Police had counted </i> m <i> ed a dissatisfaction demonstration. </i>

129
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,638
<i> instead it became a storm. </i>

130
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,638
Then it was also so that if Trump tried to stay at the power-

131
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,198
-Then many people said in advance: "This is getting messy."

132
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,558
Sure, it's been talking about it for a long time.
 But that's another thing-

133
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,038
-When the warnings for Trump's behavior become reality.

134
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,638
Thus, when a "parliamentary building" is stormed.

135
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,638
It is hard to see the pictures from the storm-

136
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,998
-Or to raise the eyebrows.
 That is sick!

137
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,438
Then it is not in Sweden.
 It is in the United States, on the other side of the Atlantic.

138
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,678
On the other hand, we seem to care a lot about what is happening in the United States.

139
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,198
But that may change in the future.
 You don't know that.

140
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,918
That is the most important-

141
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,158
-This more than seeing it on TV, are things that happen in our everyday lives.

142
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,878
There is a criticism of the media:

143
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,598
News is what the media says is news.

144
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,918
It happens very important things that affect a lot of people's life-

145
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,198
-But it does not end up on news sites, so it will not be news of it.

146
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,918
A bit like news is something you can make money from creating?

147
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,678
Absolutely!
 One can make money on news-

148
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,638
-and "borrow the news clothes" to do it.

149
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,278
Journalism and news are something that we should confidence in.

150
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,678
Confidence you can try to earn without having earned it-

151
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,078
-Do to dress up their advertising so that it looks like journalism.

152
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,678
-There are fraudsters who work that way.
 -In last election, 2016 ...

153
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,958
... when Hillary Clinton stood as a candidate against Donald Trump-

154
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,118
-It there a guy who created a fake yelling:

155
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,278
That she was involved in the murder of an FBI agent.

156
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,998
He pulled it up on a fake news page-

157
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,438
-What was built around the fake, but there was nothing on it.

158
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,198
The goal: to make people believe that what they saw was a real news site-

159
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,278
-As could fool people.

160
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,958
This with news and articles ... We can draw it a little better.

161
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,278
If Edwin can have a channel then we can have a channel!

162
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,398
-Obvious!
 -I go away and fix it.

163
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,358

164
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,678
We will talk about news and the news formula or recipe.

165
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,558
First we'll just talk about: When you scroll in your news feed-

166
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,078
-Then a lot of things show up, mostly probably entertainment-

167
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,438
-But some things are news and articles.
 What do they look like?

168
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,318
First, top, a heading, which will summarize what the article is about.

169
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,238
Then we have the preamble - the extra -black text at the top.

170
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,758
There, the thing should stand, what it is about.

171
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,078
If you are going to tell something to a friend, then you will not start from the beginning-

172
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,878
-What you say what has happened.

173
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,078
"It rolled down an aircraft wing on the road in front of me."

174
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,318
Not: "I started walking along the road this morning."

175
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,478
So the thing itself is what is going on in the preamble.

176
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,438
Then comes the rest - the article - with all the details-

177
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,798
-All that will comment, the background, etc.

178
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,038
What is going in here is what is relevant to the article-

179
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,558
-D.V.S.
 Things that matter for what happened.

180
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,158
Fake items and advertising would like to borrow the article's clothes.

181
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,238
So, look like a real news and signal it.

182
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,678
They want to borrow the credibility that comes with it.

183
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,078
Remember the ingredients for a news:

184
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,398
It must have happened recently and close.
 It should be unusual or unexpected.

185
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,478
The more you affect and the more you influence, the greater the news.

186
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,238
Okay!

187
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,318
"Ah, Cute!"
 So it really is enough to just read the headings on a news-

188
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,278
-To know what it is about?

189
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,758
Admittedly, the heading should be about the thing itself-

190
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,318
-But if you just read the headline, you miss shades and details.

191
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,358
A friend did an experiment.
 He wrote a chronicle with the headline:

192
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,918
"Researchers: People who don't read books are smarter."

193
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,158
In the chronicle itself it said: "No, I was just joking."
 But!

194
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,878
A study shows that 59 % of all articles on social media-

195
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,438
-Delete without being read.
 That was the whole point to show:

196
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,598
"Lol! You are so departed, you who share articles without reading them."

197
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,558
Then there is the problem that headings do not keep what they promise.

198
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,918
You attract people on false grounds.
 Clickbait and so on.

199
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,078
So basic, what we need is celebrities, a little action, a little drama.

200
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,038
-Do we have any good gossip?
 -What so, big news ...

201
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,118
Then the principle of proximity applies, if it affects society ...

202
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,438
A celebrity?

203
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,758
"Moi!"
 A second, only!

204
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,198
It would be good if we ...

205
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,918
Hi, Babes!
 I have heard that educational radio, or ur-

206
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,878
-Sh change name to VR.
 They will do everything in virtual reality!

207
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,318
You have to have a VR headset to keep up.

208
