1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,320
We have always been fascinated by space-

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,720
-But if life can live there has long been a mystery.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,800
It was believed that space was hostile and that everything would die directly-

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,400
-But that's wrong.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,720
A human being survives seconds without space suit-

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,680
-But other life on our planet is better at surviving in space-

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,400
-for example.
 The bacterium that produced the air we breathe.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,320
That knowledge can make it easier if we move out into the universe.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,800
My name is Natuschka Lee and I am an astrobiological scientist.

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,760
I investigate how microscopic life can survive in extreme environments.

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,200
In astrobiology, research on life in the universe.

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,800
You are particularly interested in extremes:

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,920
Microscopic organisms that live under extreme conditions-

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,200
-like the ice on Antarctic or inside volcanoes.

15
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,560
These environments are similar to those on other planets, such as Mars.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,000
It is important partly to understand how life has arisen on our planet-

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,440
-And what conditions we have to colonize other celestial bodies.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,400
Some day our own planet will be swallowed by the universe again.

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,680
It can be through an asteroid, as on the time of dinosaurs-

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,040
-or that the sun goes out.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,400
No man has yet set foot on Mars, the race is underway.

22
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,600
Natuschka Lee is researching the European Space Organization Esa-

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,960
-It to demonstrate life in space in general and Mars in particular-

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,480
-Ope which life from the earth can survive there.

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,480
We have sent different organisms to the space station.

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,040
There have been extreme bacteria, fungi, lichens and mosses.

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,480
They have been sitting on a container that we attached outside the space station.

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,800
Then they have been allowed to circulate around the earth for 1.5 years.

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,600
So we hope to simulate how organisms from the earth can react-

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,720
-Or genuine space conditions, e.g.
 If they ended up on Mars.

31
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,080
Many survived cosmic radiation-

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,000
-Or oxygen and nutrition and under extreme cold in Natuschka's experiment.

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,880
I.a.
 bear animal

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,440
â€” which can turn off its metabolism and can withstand the radiation-

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,720
-But even five viruses, ten plant species, 25 fungal species-

36
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,080
-and 60 bacterial species - including cyanobacteria-

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,760
-which with the sun's energy creates its own nutrition through photosynthes-

38
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,240
-Ornan the atmosphere of the earth.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,440
All survivors managed without oxygen uptake-

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,440
-And some could make new oxygen.

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,520
Here we enrich algae and cyanobacteria.

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,400
It is these tough organisms that have been shown to withstand outer space.

43
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
In addition, they have changed our own planet.

44
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,160
It is thanks to these, which are enlarged 1 billon-

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,640
-As we have got oxygen in our air.

46
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,320
Cyanobacteria produced oxygen that enabled multicellular organisms.

47
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,760
It was the start of life's development on earth.

48
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,560
One can say with high security--

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,520
-Oft cyanobacteria have existed for at least 2.5 billion years.

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,840
It is amazing that organisms here-

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,840
-In all cases to some extent can survive in space.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,160
The hope is to use them-

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,480
-To create better conditions to survive on another celestial body.
