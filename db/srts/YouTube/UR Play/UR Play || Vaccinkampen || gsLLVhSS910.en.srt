1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:08,480
-In crises, "fake news" thrives.
 -There's been a lot now.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,440
We are fighting not only against an epidemic, but also against an infodemia.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,800
Anyone who works with source criticism is full.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:25,040
Covid-19 dominates the news.
 It is important to think about what is true.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,400
But if you think it's a lot now - wait until there is a vaccine.

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,560
Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the Viral Reviewer.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,080
Today they run the source criticism - Sweden's national team in source criticism.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,800
Now they and Edwin Safari Källkoll Corona are doing.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,480
I will show how a vaccine works.
 Edwin, you are a regular, healthy person.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,440
And Jack, you are a disease.
 - Jack has a good "killer move".

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,920
You want to be able to defend yourself.
 - Let's see.

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,160
–Okay, close.
 -Okay.

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,520
If it comes as a surprise, Edwin cannot defend herself against it.

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,680
For example, like this.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,560
But Jack has only one Killer Move.
 It's boring, but that's how it is.

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,720
You only have one Killer Move, and now Edwin knows how to defend himself.

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,480
So I am exposed to a little jack-

18
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,680
-To be able to prepare for the day when I am exposed to a lot of Jack.

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,120
Just.
 Coronan has only a secret Killer Move.

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,800
You need to learn to defend this.
 No one knows it on the whole earth.

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,520
With vaccine, the immune system can prepare.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,000
This is not a new knowledge.

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,400
As early as the 17th century was taken in China was from the Slidex-

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,480
-And injected it into healthy people to make them immune.

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,200
It still works.

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,920
Every year, vaccine saves life of up to 3 million children

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,120
Society is based on taking them.

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,480
If we were to stop doing so, many would die or get sick.

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,160
WHO has a calculation that we have saved 10 million life-

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,760
-During the period 2010-2015.

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,080
-What years are you born, Edwin?

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,960
If you were American, you would have included in the documentation American CDC had-

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,680
-When they investigated how a mass vaccination program in the 90s ...

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,880
... prevented diseases and death.

35
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:09,240
Between 1994 and 2013, 322 million cases were prevented

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,040
-21 million hospital stays and 730,000 deaths-

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,160
-Thank you to the vaccination program.
 You could say that ... no, wait.

38
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,840
We say there were 10 children who received a vaccine between 1994 and 2013.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
If they had not received vaccine-

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,360
-hade three of them ended up in hospital sometime during their lifetime.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,720
One of them had died, and all these ten children-

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,200
-hade got sick not one or two but four times during their lifetime-

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,080
-If they had not received the vaccine.
 Four times over!

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,320
It is good efforts over a long time.

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,240
The problem is that there will be bad action for news brokers.

46
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,560
Say that one would film the speedometer in a car-

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,640
-And just time and time again say: "Now the traffic rules saved life."

48
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,200
- After a while I probably had tired.
 -Many people probably did.

49
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,160
We humans are looking for things that make us scared or worried.

50
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,520
When we consume information, we are not looking for what makes us safe.

51
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,440
-We are looking for what scares us.
 -It ends up in the news.

52
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,680
Some are vaccine skeptic.

53
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,520
-Sithees believe that vaccine is dangerous.
 -It's mass poisoning!

54
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,880
-Where's that fear comes?
 -No like injections.

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,120
It is human not to enjoy getting syringes with foreign substances.

56
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,920
It feels instinctively bad.

57
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,360
-Hello?
 Narcolepsy?
 -Absolut, it happened.

58
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,960
This was the mass vaccination at the swine flu.

59
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,840
After that, there was an increased risk for some young people to get narcolepsy.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,840
This is not a fun disease.
 The research said in afterwards-

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,800
-That there has been some ambiguities about what affected what.

62
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,600
For example, you can get narcolepsy from the swine flu.

63
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,840
But Anders Tegnell, our state epidemiologist, who was responsible-

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,640
-DEsed this and said that the side effects were so unusual-

65
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,600
- Not even the best quality assurance system could catch them.

66
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,680
Those who got these side effects were relatively few.
 I'll quote him:

67
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,960
"Our actions were absolutely logical and we will make the same decision"-

68
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,600
-"If or when the next pandemic occurs."

69
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,840
-But how dangerous is vaccine, then?
 -All drugs involve a risk.

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,320
A headache tablet involves a risk.

71
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:28,160
But when you do vaccines and drugs, you test on animals and then people.

72
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,960
When you are reasonably sure that there are no severe side effects ...

73
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,760
You want it to do more than harm.

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,360
When you are safe, you release it, but there is no total security.

75
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,920
Unusual side effects may occur.

76
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,040
- But we have a vaccine injury register?
 -Yes.

77
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,920
One must report damage that arises-

78
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,280
-A some time after a vaccination.

79
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,680
It doesn't say anything about cause and effect.

80
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,360
-What do you mean?
 -It doesn't always depend on it.

81
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,280
Say that a child fails on a math test after a syringe.

82
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,280
It may not depend on the syringe.

83
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,560
The vaccine will receive attention.

84
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,200
It will have been produced quickly, maybe even stressed.

85
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,080
A whole world has screamed for that.

86
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,560
Vaccine and drugs are added under hard control.
 A whole world is looking.

87
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,320
We know that drugs involve risks, and that will be debated a lot.

88
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,440
You have to assume that you want well.

89
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,760
If it had not been for vaccines, both we who do the program-

90
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,480
-And you who are watching, have been much fewer in the number.

91
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,480
So vaccines are good.

92
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,280
Each section contains educational material at Urplay.se.

93
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,280
Search "Källkoll Corona" and select "Pedagogical Material".
