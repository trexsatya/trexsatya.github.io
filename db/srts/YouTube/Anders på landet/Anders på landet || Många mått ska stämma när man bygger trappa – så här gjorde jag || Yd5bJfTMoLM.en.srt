1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,640
The slope of a staircase should actually be a maximum of 46 degrees.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,740
But it depends on what area of use is.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,380
The most important thing is to get the angles right.
 I do this so as not to make mistakes during the transfer from a drawing.

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,980
To get the right angle at the bottom, I use the same dimensions of rule and floor as on the top of the stairs.

5
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,240
Then just cut to both angles and test that it has become right.

6
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,980
And here's the spot on.

7
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:24,300
When the first piece has become right, I over the angles to the other side.
 So they become identical.

8
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:11,180
The best step height is 17-18 cm and here I make a template to make it just right.

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
It is important that the steps become as high so that you do not stumble into the stairs.

10
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,900
I have measured the height from the floor in the machine room to the floor of the attic.
 With twelve steps, the step height becomes 18.3 cm.

11
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,080
And that's so wide I saw the template.

12
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:52,300
Then I make a jig to get the steps just the same.

13
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,500
I start by attaching the template by the step height so that it has the same angle as the underside of the piece.

14
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,820
Then I have a piece of sacrifice and a piece of support that I attach so that it becomes a sledge that can slip on the piece.

15
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,520
To get the right distance, I use the circular saw plus a rubbish piece of the same thickness as the steps.

16
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,280
If you want the exact pass, if it is to be really neat, then pull away the double thickness of the blade.

17
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,880
I build a staircase for the machine hall and it becomes much easier with some play.
 That's why I ignore the fin.

18
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:08,060
The depth of the saw blade I set to fifteen millimeters - one third of the thickness of the vang.

19
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,900
The sacrifices can be thrown away.

20
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,640
I am now making a beginner's miss that it takes a while for me to discover.

21
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,540
See if you discover it before me ...

22
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,820
It's now I suddenly realize my mistake.

23
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,700
You may have noticed it earlier.
 Look here you'll see:

24
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,380
I have crossed what is to be cut away.
 But sawn on the wrong side of the line all the time.

25
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,060
But since one of the pieces is clear and I have come halfway with the other, I do not intend to start over.

26
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,640
I adjust the error afterwards.
 It can be solved, I have calculated that.

27
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:42,940
A little frustrating when doing an instructional video and making the most basic mistakes yourself.

28
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,860
But - you may not do the same thing now.

29
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,440
So the mistake fixed.

30
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,500
Since the distance between the steps is right all the way, the stairs just need to be adjusted to the top then.

31
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,260
Then I pre -drill for the screws that will attach the steps.

32
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,480
And recesses the holes for the screws to sit against the wall.

33
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,540
While the color dries, I take the opportunity to cut the steps.

34
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,600
I use the same thickness on the steps as for the pieces.

35
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,720
I think it will be the nicest - and it will be a lot too.

36
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,500
Also, I do not have to count on the width.
 Thinner steps do not withstand wide stairs.

37
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,700
Now I drive 75 cm wide steps and then the thickness is no problem.

38
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,160
As you can see, the top step is a little too far, but I saw it so it fits perfectly.

39
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,340
As you can see, I have attached the stairs with just one screw in the side that faces from the wall.

40
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Why should I show just soon.

41
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,740
To secure the stairs, I attach it with two screws on the top.

42
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,900
The stairs in place but not yet finished.

43
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,840
I will look for it by changing the screws to wooden plugs.
