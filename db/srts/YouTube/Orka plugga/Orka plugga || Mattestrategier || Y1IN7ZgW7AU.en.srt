00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,120
Do you sometimes think: "I'm not a math person"?
 You're not alone.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,520
With the right strategies, everyone can get better at math.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,360
Here are some tips.
 Learn the words.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,640
Mathematics is a language and you have to check out what you do not understand.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,600
It is good to introduce a math test or national plug in some words.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,920
This way you can easily get directly into the task.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,440
Ask questions!
 But try to ask specific questions.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,040
Instead of saying, "I don't understand!"

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,840
Think about what it is you understand, and what you do not understand.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
Based on that, you can ask questions, such as:

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,440
"Why is there a similarity sign there? What does that word mean?"

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,880
"What are I going to get out? What is it asked for?"

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,960
Take it easy!
 Mathematics is nothing to go fast.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,640
It is important to think slowly, and make it thorough.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,360
If we try to do the information quickly, we get stuck, and have to redo.

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,120
Usually we lock ourselves and get stressed when it doesn't get right.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,520
Dissolve the task slowly and systematically.
 Take your time.

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,160
Simplify and split.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
A number may look very complicated out-

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,280
-But at a slow pace you can divide the task into small parts and simplify.

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,760
A major problem may need to be broken down into many parts.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Verify.
 Always check your results.

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,960
For example, by inserting the response into the equation-

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,280
-To see that it works in both directions.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,080
If there is something that is not true, it is important to troubleshoot.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,880
Start by reading again.
 Have you really understood the task?

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
Read it again so you haven't missed anything.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,840
New page.
 Write down the task again and figure it out on a brand new page.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,600
Do you get the same result twice-

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,280
-Is the risk that you have made a careless error.
 Compare!

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,480
If you get different results you can compare the calculations-

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,720
-And think about what has gone wrong.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
The right method!
 Think about whether you have chosen the right method to solve the task.

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,240
Can you do it in a different way?

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,880
Character error!

36
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
Check that you do not have a calculation error or have written the wrong character.

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,520
There may be some brackets or minus signs that are missing.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,960
It is when we challenge ourselves and learn new things-

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,320
-As our brain develops and becomes stronger.
 Do not give up!

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,600
Everyone can be maths.
 Good luck!
