00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,800
In math you can't fool yourself.
 It is better to do few tasks carefully-

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,360
-and really understand, than to catch up with many.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,520
If you do not understand, go back to something that you understand.
 It is important.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,720
Mathematics is a language, and as with other language-

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,120
-So have to check something when you don't take it.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,600
You can look it up in a book, google it or ask someone who knows.

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,200
Break down the task into many part problems.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,760
A major problem may need to be broken down to many parts-

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,200
-When you solve individually.

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Always check your results.
 You can put them into the equation you just loose-

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,720
-And make sure it works in both directions.
