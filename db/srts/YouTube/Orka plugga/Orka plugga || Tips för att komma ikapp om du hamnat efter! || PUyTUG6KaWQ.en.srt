1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,000
Are you behind with school assignments?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,320
Has teachers started to remind you of submissions you haven't even started?

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,320
HÃ¶rni, Reading Log Two should be finished until Tuesday, so ...

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,640
-Isn't that next Tuesday?
 -No, it was now on Tuesday.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,600
Maybe the plan was to plug in yesterday, but instead you hung with a friend.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,040
It is easy to close your eyes and postpone the tasks to be done.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,080
But it just gets more difficult the longer you wait.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,160
Here are tips on how to catch up if you ended up with the information.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,760
Overall picture.
 Start by thinking about everything you need to do.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,960
Write down all the information so that it becomes clear to you.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,520
The English we have this week, well?

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,320
Write when the information is to be Klara-

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,960
-And think about how long you need to spend on each task.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,120
-Sweden was still pretty much.
 -It will take five days.

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,160
When you are done with a task, check it.

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,160
It is motivating to see that you get things done.

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,800
Hold on.
 Is the list of things to be made long-

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,760
-Attempts to visualize how it will feel when you have done everything.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,840
Maybe you have an intense period right now-

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,160
-But try to see it in a larger perspective.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,280
And even though it feels far away now, you will do it.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,600
Prioritize.
 A good way to get started is to structure up-

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,720
-What is most urgent and what can wait.

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,280
What is important is the chemistry test.
 We have that next week on Friday.

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,920
Yes, and the language selection test and the Reading log in English.

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,040
Although everything feels urgent, prioritize anyway.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,680
Decide what to do first - you can't do everything at the same time.

28
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,840
Talk to your teachers if you get stuck with a task.

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,960
Aim to get all the information in time.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,000
But if you feel it is impossible, talk to your teacher.

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,840
-We don't understand what to do.
 -And we won't have time.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,280
Maybe you can get guidance and help with how to get started.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Start by describing core line ...
