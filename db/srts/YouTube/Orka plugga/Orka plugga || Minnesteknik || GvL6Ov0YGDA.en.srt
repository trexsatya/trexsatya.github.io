Here are some tips on memory techniques-

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,400
-What makes it easier to remember what you have learned.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,080
A good method is the ten -minute rule.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,480
The key to remembering better is repetition.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,520
Because without repetition, what we learned disappears fairly quickly.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,720
And keep in mind that you have to repeat before you start to forget.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,920
The first rehearsal event should thus come quickly-

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
- After the learning - already after ten minutes.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,480
Otherwise, you will forget pretty quickly.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,160
The next rehearsal will take place after a day and then after a week.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,080
If you want to remember all your life you have to repeat again-

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,160
-After a month and then after six months.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,360
A good method when repeating is to interrogate yourself with flashcards.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,840
Thus patches where you write the gloss, the name-

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
-or the concept that you should learn on one side-

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,040
-And the answer to the other.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,040
So if you eg
 shall plug in Englishaglosor-

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,560
-Es you write the English word on one side-

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,200
-And what it's called in Swedish on the other.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,880
Flashcard is also easy to bring-

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,760
-So take the opportunity to interrogate yourself on the break or on the bus.

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,080
Another effective method for remembering is to use association.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,000
Then you connect new knowledge with something that you associate them with.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,480
It will make it easier to remember.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,920
For example, if you
 Should teach you new gloss - what do you think the word sounds like?

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
What makes you think about?

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,280
Feel free to create images in the head of what you think.

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,000
You can also find your own frames that link the associations.

29
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,080
The snapper they are, the better, because then you remember them easier.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,920
You can also use a so -called
 Memorial walk, or the loci method.

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,720
It is about the fact that you think you are placing out the fact-

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,520
-When you need to learn in different places that you know well.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
As your home or maybe along the way to school.

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,480
Then you connect what you should learn with the different places-

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,560
-And creates an association.

36
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,600
When you then sit on the test, you can walk the walk in the head-

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,320
-And pick up the fact that is linked to the different places.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,560
It is important that you follow the walk in the same order-

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
-As you placed the fact.

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,360
One last trick for not forgetting on the test-

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,880
-As to use a permitted cheat.

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,360
So - when you sat down on the test - ask for a scrap paper-

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,480
-and write down all the facts, all words, concepts or formulas-

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,480
-When you think you should forget.
 Then you can release it-

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,320
-And does not have to sit with unnecessary stress during the test.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,840
Instead, you can use your energy to answer the questions.
