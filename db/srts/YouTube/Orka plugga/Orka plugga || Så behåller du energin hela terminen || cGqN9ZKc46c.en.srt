1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
To start a new academic year and new semester

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,280
May feel like a new start.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,360
And just like at a new year set many new goals

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,880
And want to change or improve on the new academic year.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,800
But as common as it is to set goals

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,000
Is it to lose interest after a while.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
It is difficult to keep the energy and the will you felt from the promise.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,720
But there are things you can do to make it easier for yourself.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,520
To improve and reach further requires effort and will.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,560
So think about what exactly you would like to improve.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,080
It might be about getting into the right high school line

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,560
Or just prove to yourself that you can if you are striving.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,120
Keep in mind that everyone who is good at something has spent a lot of time.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,200
Whether it's about counting math,

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,880
Write well or run fast.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,880
In order to cope with the entire semester,

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,800
Start by writing up your goals

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,240
And think about why you want to achieve the goals.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,680
Motivation works like with almost everything else.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,080
It must be maintained.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,080
To achieve your goals you need to maintain your motivation!

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,200
So write down what you want to achieve and what is important to you.

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,000
When you may have lost later during the semester

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,920
a bit of your will and your motivation

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,800
Go back and look at what you wrote!

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,440
Try to write down why you want to reach your goal

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,920
and what is important to you as accurately as possible

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,640
so that you can get into the same feeling

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,160
When you read it at a later date.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,120
Because you will spend a lot of time at school

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,840
With your classmates and with your teachers.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Put extra energy into helping to create a nice climate.

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,160
Even though you and your classmates may be different.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,280
Make sure to respond to everyone in a nice way.

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
It will be much nicer for you and your class

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,440
If everyone exerts a little extra

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:01:59,706
to include and show appreciation for each other.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,680
It becomes much easier to keep the energy during the semester

39
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,720
If you have a good atmosphere in the classroom.

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,360
So do what you can to maintain a nice atmosphere!

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,240
And remember,

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,200
No matter how easy or difficult you have for school, you can reach your goals.

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,920
To reach where one wants to be much more about

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
motivation, will and endurance

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,360
than what talents you were born with.
