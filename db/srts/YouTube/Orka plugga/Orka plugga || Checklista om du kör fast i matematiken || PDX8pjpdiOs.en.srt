00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,520
Sometimes your math calculation does not match the fact.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,400
It is good.
 Too as important as being able to count right-

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,320
-Is to have good strategies to understand what went wrong.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,560
Being able to troubleshoot.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,560
Have you understood the task?

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,640
Read it again so you know you haven't missed anything.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,480
Think about whether you have chosen the right method to solve the task.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,720
There may be another way.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,800
Check that you have not made any calculation error or written the wrong character.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,800
It may be some brackets or some minus signs that you have missed.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,760
You still can't find the error?
 In that case, you should do this:

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,120
Write down and calculate the task again on a new page.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,400
If you get the same result twice, the risk is small that it is a careless error.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,040
But if you get different results you can start comparing your calculations-

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,000
-And think about what has gone wrong.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,240
