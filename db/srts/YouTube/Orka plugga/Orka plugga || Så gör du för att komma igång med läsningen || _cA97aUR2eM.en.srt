1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,840
You can use different strategies-

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,640
-What, during and after you read texts.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,480
Here you get strategies you can use while you read.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,120
The first thing to do is turn off everything that disturbs.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,800
If it is difficult to start or to keep concentration-

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,920
-Is well to follow the text with pennan-

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,000
-or lay a ruler under the line.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,360
Skim past places that feel sluggish instead of completely stopping reading.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,200
Set a clock and read in short workouts.
 Take breaks in between.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,640
Start with five minutes and make the passes longer when you can cope more.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,120
Another good strategy is to divide the text into shorter pieces.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,240
Like reading one piece carefully at a time, and then taking a break.

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,240
Then the brain can process a smaller amount of information at a time.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,680
When reading, it is important to ask questions to yourself.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,640
"What was it I read? What is most important?"

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,960
"Is that something I don't understand? Is it related to what I read before?"

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,760
You can also formulate the text with your own words-

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,240
-And this way to increase understanding.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,720
Be patient as you read.
 Exercise is required to become a good reader.
