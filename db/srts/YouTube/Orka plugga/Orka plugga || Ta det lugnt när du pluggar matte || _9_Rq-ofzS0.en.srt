1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,320
<i> See how the hare hunts, guess and run </i> all directions without getting anywhere. </i>

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,080
<i> But what do we have here?
 Turtle! </i>

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,240
<i> methodical, smart, factual. </i> one step at a time.
 It was different that! </i>

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,480
<i> It is a bit similar to mathematics. </i>

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,200
<i> math can be difficult, </i> sometimes it may feel impossible. </i>

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,280
<i> then one should not increase the pace. </i>

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,600
<i> Take it easy instead. </i> one step at a time.
 It's no competition. </i>

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,440
<i> Do not do like the hare running, hunters, </i> and hope it will be right. </i>

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,960
<i> Think a little more like the turtle. </i> objectively to weigh. </i>

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,480
<i> It is not going fast, </i> there no speed competition. </i>

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,120
<i> In the end it is still the turtle </i> gets the correct result. </i>

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
<i> There are many strategies </i> take in math. </i>

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,200
<i> one of them, perhaps the most important, </i> to take it easy. </i>

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,320
<i> Take a deep breath, look at the result. </i> the reasonable? </i>

15
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:20,040
<i> It is an equation you calculated, replace x </i> your answer and count again. </i>

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,640
<i> Then you know if you've done right or not. </i> is pretty smart. </i>

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,600
<i> So, take it easy with the mat. </i> one step at a time.
 Was a turtle. </i>
