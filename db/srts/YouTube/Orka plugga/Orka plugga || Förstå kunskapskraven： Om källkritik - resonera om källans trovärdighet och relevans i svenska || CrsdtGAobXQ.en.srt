1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,400
To reason about a source's credibility and relevance you do in several school subjects.

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,160
But source -critical ability is also important in other contexts and throughout life.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,160
A reasoning explains and deepens your thought or opinion.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,960
You can claim something, e.g.
 that a source has low credibility-

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,760
-But what do you base it on?
 What makes you think that info is not reliable?

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,560
Is it biased?
 Does anyone seem to angle the information to win it?

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,040
To assess the quality of your work and tell you what you can develop-

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,240
-Tis your teacher from the knowledge requirements.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,960
The requirements for Swedish in grade nine stand:

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,880
The quality of a source -critical reasoning depends on different things.

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,400
It is important to have source -critical width:

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,000
To describe several different strengths and weaknesses that the source has.

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,120
Credibility is a perspective.

14
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:24,760
You can also assess relevance: How the source is important for your question.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,320
You should also show connections between the source of the source and your arguments-

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,160
-Do to give concrete examples.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,680
Another way to develop a source-critical reasoning is-

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,560
-To use your knowledge of the subject or context-

19
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,480
-To evaluate the source's content.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,560
An example:

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,800
The sources are about anonymity and monitoring on the Internet.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,800
The first source is a blog post from a security expert in IT.

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,680
She describes how anonymity can protect and harm-

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,000
-And shows both advantages and disadvantages.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,760
The source becomes relevant, because it gives me information about both sides.

26
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,960
At the same time, it is credible because it is not one -sided.

27
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,440
Your source-critical reasoning becomes more developed-

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,120
-With concrete examples that support your conclusions.

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,000
What advantages and disadvantages are taken up?

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,720
IT expert writes that anonymity can help human

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,800
-To report on things they couldn't tell otherwise.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,640
But anonymity can also be used by criminals.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,600
In addition, lies and prejudices are spread by anonymous.

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,480
Good!
 When you concretize claims by reference to the content-

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,520
-Do you show that there is support for what you say.

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Can one assume that the author knows the subject?

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,920
Yes.
 An IT security expert at the Internet Foundation in Sweden should be inserted.

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,680
In addition, the source refers to research that confirms the descriptions.

39
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,600
What about the other source?

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,200
It provides a one-sided and angled image-

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,000
-For it just describes everything bad that anonymous can do on the internet.

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,800
A source that gives a one -sided and angled picture of reality is tendentious.

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,560
Your reasoning will be more developed by concrete examples.

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,680
In what way is the source tendentious?

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,400
It takes a clear position for increased surveillance.

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,280
The text is only positive that the police should be able to request traffic data-

47
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,960
-Os criminal offense or court decision.

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,000
But can you still use the source?

49
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,760
Yes, the source is still relevant to the context-

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,520
-For it shows arguments from those who want to make anonymity more difficult.

51
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,720
With my other sources I can also describe the benefits.

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,280
Do you know anything more about the source, which can develop your reasoning?

53
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,240
It comes from an organization that fights crimes on the Internet.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
They want to increase surveillance, because they think it would be good for their work.

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,520
And the third source?
 What strengths and weaknesses do it have?

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,680
It is an article on Wikipedia.

57
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,920
Everyone can contribute there, although there are volunteers who control.

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,080
The quality varies, so you have to review each article.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,640
-How do you do that?
 -As usual.

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,120
I am aware of word choice and how the problem is described.

61
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,000
Then I can discover if the article is tendentious.

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,880
I also have to check if the article provides relevant answers to my questions.

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,240
With Wikipedia articles I can investigate three more things.

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,640
First, the article will be based on many good sources.

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
Secondly, there is a dialogue on the discussion tab.

66
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,480
Thirdly, I see in history that many have contributed.

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,160
There were three good tips for reviewing articles on Wikipedia.

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,440
The article has the latest judgment from the European Court of Justice on data monitoring.

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,440
It came just a month ago, so the article is up to date.

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Good!
 Now you developed your reasoning by using your knowledge.

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,040
A source-critical reasoning-

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,080
-Can become more developed by good knowledge of the subject sources are dealing with.

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,880
Now we leave the example.

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,320
In order to obtain source-critical width one must identify strengths and weaknesses-

75
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,240
-Outside of the perspectives credibility and relevance.

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,640
Source criticism is not about finding the ultimate truth-

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,640
-Or about being able to evaluate different sources.

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,240
Concretize by giving examples that confine your claims.

79
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:12,080
It may be well -chosen quotes or fair minutes of what the source says.

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,800
Contextualize by using your knowledge of the subject-

81
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,840
-or the context where the source came into being, and evaluate the source based on it.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,400
You will benefit your source -critical ability in all subjects and your entire life.

83
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,640
On social media, it is an ability that everyone exercises every day.

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,480
It is important to review what you share.

85
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,240
