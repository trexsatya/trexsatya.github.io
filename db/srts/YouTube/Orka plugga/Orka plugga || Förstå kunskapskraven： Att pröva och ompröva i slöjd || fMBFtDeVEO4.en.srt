1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,400
Trying and re -examining different solutions to problems is part of existence.

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,240
In games, you test different ways to get past challenges.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,840
In cooking you try different spices and it becomes more or less good.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
Or you may sew a t-shirt.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,560
In school you learn things by trying solutions several times-

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,960
-and by finding new ones.
 It is impossible to do everything right right away.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,600
It's not exciting either.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,520
When the teacher assesses the quality of your school work, the knowledge requirements are used.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,200
The knowledge requirements can be found in the curriculum that controls the teaching.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,560
In crafts, image and technology, one must systematically try and rethink.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,520
In craft, it is about how materials and techniques can be combined.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,600
You should formulate different action alternatives that lead the work forward.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,520
You are constantly thinking about new solutions.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,960
A student has been given the task of manufacturing some kind of storage.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,000
The material should be reusable.
 The object should be created with flat technology.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,800
That task can be solved in many different ways.

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,040
It is extra important to systematically test and rethink their ideas.

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,080
It would be good with storage for chargers and game controls.

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,800
Maybe a wooden box with recycled fabric as a lid?

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,160
And with handles in wood.
 Or does another material get better?

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,840
Isn't a box in wood unnecessarily heavy?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,640
Yes, exactly.
 So I sketched a solution with narrow moldings instead.

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
It becomes like a network pattern.

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,880
It becomes more fun to build together but it becomes more useful in the long run.

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,480
Good question from the friend.

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,280
The student reconsidered his sketch early and above all his choice of material.

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:19,320
One option goes faster but the other gets better in the long run.

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Just so you should test your first idea when you make something.

29
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,560
Look at the pros and cons of the material.

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,920
Also ask how the finished item should be used.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,200
So there.
 I combine the wooden box with a handle of cotton bands.

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,280
I can make the bands of old clothes so I recycle some fabric.

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,480
Cotton band?
 Didn't you have a wooden handle in the sketch?

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,200
Yes.
 But I braid them so it gets strong.

35
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,240
It will be more comfortable to lift compared to wood.
 I made a model.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,960
Compare your first idea with another solution.
 So make more sketches.

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,360
You can also make a prototype, ie a simple model.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,480
You certainly combine different materials and techniques.

39
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,520
Motivate and explain your choices.

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,040
How would you do with the lid?

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,280
I tighten up fabric on a frame.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,000
But this fabric may be too thin.
 It may not work.

43
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,600
But I have another I can try too.

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,520
Exactly!
 Plan options before you start.

45
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,200
Thus: you need time to test several solutions and materials.

46
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,160
To try and re-examine something systematic-

47
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,000
-Soping about planning and choosing from options.

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,320
Also document your work process and your choices.

49
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,360
It facilitates evaluation and if you want to show that you have worked systematically.

50
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,400
Last we look at the work process.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,000
It is important to plan the work.
 In what order should the elements be made?

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,760
Can you make a model?

53
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,360
What materials become functional?
 Can you combine different materials?

54
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,960
Make several sketches and compare solutions.

55
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,000
How should you go about it?
 Which techniques are appropriate?

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,080
Which methods and tools are best suited?

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,560
Analyze different options and justify your choice.

58
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,800
This is what is meant by choosing and formulating action options.

59
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,800
Finally: Document the entire work process.

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,680
You can foot and write notes.
 Write why you chose as you did-

61
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,480
-And if you encountered technical or aesthetic problems.

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,040
This approach, to systematically test or re-examine-

63
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,920
-Do you have the benefit of in many situations.

64
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,560
