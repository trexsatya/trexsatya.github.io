00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,960
Reasoning is done in many subjects and has the use of your entire life.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,440
You often make different decisions and have to reason about advantages and disadvantages.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,680
Reasoning means developing thoughts and opinions.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,600
You can say something: Meat is bad for the environment.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,840
But why?
 What do you base the claim on?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,400
A reasoning should explain and deepen a thought or opinion.

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,800
The teacher tells us what you can develop by starting from the knowledge requirements.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,440
They describe the different levels you can show knowledge.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,920
The knowledge requirements define what rating you receive.

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,160
According to the knowledge requirements, a reasoning can be simple, developed-

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,520
-and well developed.

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,080
Superbly, right?

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,920
No, an example is needed.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,600
This is how a book tip can be a well -developed reasoning.

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,320
Why should you read the book?

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,120
Wait.
 Here are thoughts to develop.

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,080
Explain what you mean.
 Why do you think like you do?
 Give examples.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,480
It raises the quality of your reasoning.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,160
The book is thus exciting.
 Why do you think that?

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
What does it lead to?

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,000
Just!
 You developed the reasoning-

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,320
-When of telling us what was exciting with examples.

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,800
The book is about courage.
 Problematize by using different perspectives.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,000
"On the one hand" lets you show how you see things in different ways.

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,720
Why is it important not to judge others?
 What could it lead to?

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,200
Does the book have any message?

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,400
In what way would it be better?

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,160
There you got thoughts that the book aroused.

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,360
You also generalized by showing what others can learn from the book.

30
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,480
When developing a reasoning, you should stick to one thought at a time.

31
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Then develop what you want to say by asking why, how, when and what.

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,400
It becomes even clearer if you give examples.

33
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,800
Use binding words to tie together and get a good flow in the reasoning.

34
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,400
You do not just do any reason in school.

35
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,440
You make others understand what you mean and develop your own thoughts and ideas.

36
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,200
You will benefit from this in several subjects and in your spare time.

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,720
