-and choose a text that everyone reads silently for themselves.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,160
It can be a short story that is a page long.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,840

-Do you start the conversations by each presents their summary.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,120

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,600
When in front of a point of view, it is important to have evidence for it.

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,000
Therefore, consider the reason for your opinion.

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,040
You can also start from an example when sharing a point of view.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,760
If you liked the text.
 What was it you liked about it?

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,880
Is there any special part, character description-

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,960
-or a specific piece you liked a lot?
 And why?

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,040
You can also compare the text or your views with your own experiences.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,280
Have you been to a similar situation as the character of the text?

28
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,480
Try to drag parallels between the text and your everyday-

29
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,720
-And ask about someone in your group sharing the experience with you.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,080
Listen carefully to the instructions and actively participate in the discussion.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,800

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,360

33
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,440

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,880

35
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,560
