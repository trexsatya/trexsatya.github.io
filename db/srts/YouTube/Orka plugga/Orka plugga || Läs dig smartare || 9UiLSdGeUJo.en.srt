1
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:05,360
There is a lot of talk about the fact that today's young people are not reading enough

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,240
But why is it so important to read books?

3
00:00:09,032 --> 00:00:11,160
In order to manage a regular adult life,

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,840
That is to say, be able to keep up with news broadcasts,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,640
able to follow instructions and instructions

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,520
And understand newspaper articles.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,520
A vocabulary of about 50,000 words is required.

8
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:25,000
For a 17-year-old who has not regularly read

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,880
Or listened to books, the vocabulary is about 15000-17000 words.

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,949
However, if you regularly read

11
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,320
And take part in different texts, your vocabulary is stimulated and replenished.

12
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:41,720
Then your opportunities to express yourself in both speech and writing are improved

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,040
Because you gain access to a much more varied language.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,720
This obviously has great benefit from in school

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,320
where you often with your own words

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,960
Need to explain how you think and reason.

17
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:56,760
Reading comprehension is the basis for all subjects in school.

18
00:00:57,304 --> 00:00:59,040
In Swedish it is perhaps given

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,120
But good reading comprehension also benefits you in all other subjects.

20
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:07,080
You need to be able to understand instructions and texts in almost all subjects.

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,691
Good reading comprehension is also a prerequisite

22
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,400
In order to critically review messages

23
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:16,000
And avoid being manipulated in everyday life.

24
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,560
Reading books helps the brain stay fit.

25
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:23,640
The brain needs to make much more effort

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,320
When reading than when, for example, watching a series or movie

27
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:30,720
And thus strengthens your brain capacity.

28
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,440
Reading also stimulates your imagination and analytical ability

29
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:39,080
Finally, our empathic ability also improves

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,920
By allowing reading to make us more easily get into the situation of others

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,480
And understand how other people think and feel.

32
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:49,720
Read different types of books and texts.

33
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:51,557
And of course,

34
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:53,520
The more you read the better!
