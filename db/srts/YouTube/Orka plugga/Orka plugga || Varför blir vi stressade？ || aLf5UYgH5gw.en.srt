00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,760
Most of us detect and have difficulty dealing with stress.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,760
Why is it like that?
 How does it affect the body?
 What is stress?

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,960
Stress is a natural reaction found in all animals and humans.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,160
It is the body's way of preparing for a challenge.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,280
For example, you should compete or lecture.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,240
During challenges, the body's functions are tightened.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,640
It may be good to know that stress is not dangerous.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,400
The short -term stress is good.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:44,480
The problem is when the stress becomes prolonged without the body going down in turns.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,280
One should distinguish between short and long-term stress.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,880
Short -term stress raises the immune system.
 You don't have time to be sick.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,880
In case of prolonged stress, the immune system is broken down.

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,600
In prolonged stress, the stress hormone cortisol is excreted in the brain.

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:23,240
We get too much of it.
 It can adversely affect the brain.

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,360
In an information society, it is not clear when a threat is over.

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,440
Brown bear is dangerous, I run, but then the danger is over.

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,800
Now that we live more in our heads, we can start stress by thinking.

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,960
"God, think what embarrassing I wrote yesterday."
 "The test I will never fix."

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,160
This thinking gives the same physical response as a brown bear.

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,960
It is a challenge how to rest and go down in turn-

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,960
-and not stress by thinking.

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,440
Not to start the stress response by thinking.

23
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,120
Short -term stress is not dangerous.
 But during prolonged stress-

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,480
-Sjunker the immune system and the content of cortisol are increasing.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,760
Therefore, it is important to let the body go down in turns so you can recover.
