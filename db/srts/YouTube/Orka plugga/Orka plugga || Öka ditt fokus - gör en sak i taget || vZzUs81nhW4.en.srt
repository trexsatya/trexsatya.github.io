1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:05,640
To do several things at the same time to try to be more efficient-

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,440
-Can of course sound like a good idea.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,480
But there is a risk that it instead makes a less effective.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,440
Because the brain's working memory is limited in how much it can handle

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,920
-can too many things to focus on, and things that are disturbed-

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,320
-Glag that you lose focus.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,000
Because it is not true that you focus on several things at the same time-

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,640
-Outan you share and shift your focus-

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,880
-And for each replacement, your concentration is broken.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,480
Then it may take time before you find back again-

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,480
-and for the brain to change.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,320
Time that you could have utilized better.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,640
On lessons it may mean you miss important information-

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,760
-Fear harder to learn, will have less-

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,640
-And may be allowed to bring more information home.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,280
At home it can cause homework or other tasks to take longer-time-

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,840
-An what was really needed.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,360
So not so effective.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,200
So the best thing is to do one thing at the time-

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,520
-And reduce the number of times you are disturbed or switching between tasks.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,600
Therefore, try to reduce the risk of being distracted.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,960
Find a place that fits well for you-

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,440
-Funder on what distracts and what makes you better focused.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,120
Often a quiet place can work well.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,880
To plan what you are going to do and when reduces the risk that you change-

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,080
-Between different tasks.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,560
Divide large tasks into smaller parts.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,640
Then the chance that you can keep up increases.

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,680
Plan special time for tasks that require a lot of concentration.

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,560
Then it is extra careful not to be distracted.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
If there is something special that you go and think about-

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
-Can you try to decide a time for when you have to think about it.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,720
Put off your mobile and turn off notes-

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,440
-And tell friends and family that you are busy.

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,240
By focusing on one thing at a time and relieving the working memory-

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,880
-Can you increase your focus and concentration.

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,840
This in turn can make you more efficient-

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
-Both in terms of learning and time.
