1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,280
To reason you do in several school subjects and in many other contexts.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,240
As you reason you develop your thoughts and opinions.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,600
The teacher tells us what you can develop by starting from the knowledge requirements.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,560
The social science states that the pupil should bring nuanced reasoning-

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,200
-and describe complex relationships.
 So how different things are interconnected.

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,760
It can be a little tricky.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,680
An example of how to nuance a reasoning and explain the relationship.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,560
The subject is opinion formation.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,720
They use relevant concept-

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,640
-And addresses factors that affect the possibility of reaching out.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,680
They give concrete examples that they also problematize.

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,000
Complex relationships are formed when they reason about how everything is interconnected.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,040
Here we must find out which factors are important for influence.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,840
It is easy to start a group in social media.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,080
But how do you get an effect?
 It is about power.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
It matters who you are and who you know.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,680
Interesting.
 They use relevant concepts and have mentioned two factors-

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,400
-which is important for the opportunity to influence.

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,440
In this case, status and network.
 Can they develop using examples?

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,200
Yes, status plays a role.

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,000
If a celebrity I like takes a stand for something, I will be affected.

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,760
Surely others too.
 Many people follow their updates.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,280
Many followers give power.
 On the one hand, celebrities immediately get many followers.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,880
On the other hand, social media has evened out the opportunities to influence.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,880
With the right timing, anyone can create opinion.

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,440
The reasoning is nuanced.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,040
Students problematize examples of opportunities to reach out-

28
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,920
-And uses the expressions "on the one hand" and "on the other".

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,160
If you develop your thoughts in several stages, reasoning chains are formed.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,640
And so complex relationships, how different arguments and examples are interconnected.

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,720
How does the students show it?

32
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,160
We change perspectives.
 If two ordinary people want to drive the same question-

33
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,600
-What improve school food, is there a difference in who we listen to?

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,440
For example, it is about how to say something.
 Do you have the habit inside?

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,000
Or which words you choose.
 The person's socio -economic background plays a role.

36
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,440
It affects how you express itself.

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,680
You can be more or less credible.

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,400
The background is not decisive whether they were herself affected or witnessed.

39
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,560
But how others interpret what you say also depends on gender and appearance.

40
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,360
The story becomes different depending on the storyteller.

41
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,800
The background can be decisive for who they know.

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:32,480
Even if you are not a celebrity, you can feel influential people.

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,720
Yes.
 You have to reach someone with the power to influence.

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,400
You have to be strategic, choose the right channels.

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,720
Yes!
 Complex relationships are formed when explaining how factors are connected.

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,360
Then you can describe similarities and differences in several stages.

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,640
Students are in complex relationships depending on socioeconomic background-

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,760
-When they link to other factors such as credibility, gender and appearance.

49
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,120
They also address networks and strategy.

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,720
We leave the example of opinion formation and look at the knowledge requirement.

51
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,200
In all subjects one must know relevant concepts.

52
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,560
Find out important concepts before you start.

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,800
Find different factors that affect what you reason about.

54
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,480
Explain how these affect each other.

55
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,680
Give real examples.
 Show that you know what you are talking about.

56
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,720
There are different ways to look at most.
 Which perspective have you chosen?

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,600
Finally: How are your different arguments related?

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,400
Describe the relationship by pointing out similarities and differences.

59
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,800
Then you show more or less complex relationships.

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,440
Being able to explain how things are connected, you often benefit.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,920
Both in several school subjects and in other situations outside the school.

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,000
