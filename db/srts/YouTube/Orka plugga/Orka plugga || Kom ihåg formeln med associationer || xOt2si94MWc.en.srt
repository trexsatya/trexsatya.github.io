1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,240
When I remember math concepts, I use a memory strategy.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,200
I make a story about the word to remember.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,720
It works in all subjects but I have chosen to use it within the mat.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,120
First I think about the word.
 Then I wonder: What does it really mean?

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,880
And what does it sound like?

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,400
But I have to do one thing first.
 Namely to close your eyes.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,040
Pythagora's kit.
 Pytha, python ...

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,920
Yes, python!
 Pythagora's kit is python.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,760
Is that snake long or maybe it is short?
 How should I find out?

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,360
Pythagoras well calculates how long a page is.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,400
So a side of what?

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,040
Pythagora's kit fits well ... SATS ... cat.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,840
Yes!
 A cat's face I think about.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,920
A cat looks like a triangle, a threesome.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,400
By thinking of a python and a cat's face-

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,000
-I remember what Pythagora's kit is for something.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Cylinder ... bicycle wheels.
 Rotating wheels.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,880
Hamster wheels.
 Yes, but it's around.

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,680
Cylinder, it sounds like my bindings.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,280
What do I do of my used bindings?

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,440
I usually put them in a toilet paper roll.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
And it is shaped like a cylinder.

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,800
Then I don't forget it.
 Yes, but then I have my bindings in a cylinder.

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,840
Now I never forget what a cylinder is.

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Isn't there such a road cone?
 Cow, phone, con- Ny ...

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,320
Conny, that's my guinea pig.

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,760
And he loves cancerous disc.
 Then you have party hats on.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,400
And it's cone shaped!

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,040
It's my guinea pig.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, then I just think of Conny when I remember a cone.

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,280
So I do to remember the different concepts.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Everyone can make their own stories.
 There is no right and wrong.

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,040
By associating words and building a story, it becomes easier to remember.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,080
Images are usually easier to remember than names.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,000
So try yourself.
 The crazier the better.

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,720
