1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:09,140
"Why should we know this?"
 Say you maybe when the teacher pulls out some old text that was written hundreds of years ago.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:18,280
The question may initially seem reasonable, but you - even if it sounds strange - were not created when you were born.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,820
You were born into a world that has been shaped by people who have thought and thought things for thousands of years.
 It is very good.

4
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:37,220
Therefore, every person who is born does not have to reinvent the wheel and mobile phone, or come from the ground up how to build houses or bake bread.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:44,340
It is already fixed.
 By reading old texts we gain an understanding of the world around us.

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,040
We get smart fucking who knows things.
 Those you listen to.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,760
Some call it general education.
 You can also see it as a way to avoid appearing as an idiot.

8
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:12,420
Literature history is the story of how different texts have changed society and how society has changed the way we write texts.

9
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:21,440
Thus, by learning about literary history, you automatically learn a lot about society and thus also about yourself.

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,700
You become one of those smart bastards - a one you listen to.

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,640
The written language has not always existed.
 First, people just talked to each other and then they started writing down important things.

12
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:43,000
It was pretty short things you wrote down.
 Name of a person who had died, how many horses you had or otherwise important to remember.

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,320
The writing has, like the advantage that the words even live on after someone dies.

14
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:01,760
After a while it developed there and texts became longer and longer.
 You started writing and reading texts to find out how other people think and what other people think about things.

15
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,900
People finally started reading and writing without any other direct reason than it was fun.

16
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:18,100
You realized that with reading it was so nice that you could call such texts that you just read for pleasure for "fiction".

17
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,980
You can divide literary history into something called epoch.

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,200
"Epoch" is about the same thing as time period.

19
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,040
A man who lived in the eleven centuries lived during an era called the Middle Ages.

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,100
This they had no idea whatsoever that they did because it is a name that we have found afterwards.

21
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,680
A simple epoch for literary history looks much like this:

22
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,660
null

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,530
null

24
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,990
null

25
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,930
null

26
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,850
null

27
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,460
null

28
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,070
null

29
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:44,260
Actually, those eras go into each other.
 And it is difficult to say exactly when an era starts and ends and when the next begins.

30
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:54,360
Right now we are living in a postmodern time, but in a hundred years people may think that our era should have a better name such as "Snapchatism" or "Instagramism".

31
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,700
But let's travel back in a small time machine.
 Back to that first literary era.

32
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,800
And then we have to go back so far that not even Jesus had been born and no one had heard of Christianity or Islam.

33
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,800
At this time, people sat in Sweden and froze in small huts, chased animals and ate berries.
 Nobody wrote anything at all.

34
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:29,900
The oldest attempts with us to carve small simple words on wooden pieces and later stones, it was done at about the same time as Jesus was born in Palestine, that is, when we began to count our time.

35
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:43,400
This era - the first era - it is called antiquity and takes place first in Greece and later in the Roman Empire, which was based on the city of Rome in Italy.

36
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,540
Down in Greece had come so much further in their development than we Swedes had done.

37
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,940
In Athens, people lived in a way that much more is similar to the way we live today.

38
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,040
They even had large cities with water pipes.
 They had theaters and high school.

39
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:08,960
Yes, though a high school was not quite the same as today.
 It was a place where you sports naked.

40
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,900
In Greece during ancient times, democracy arose - that is, the idea that people together can decide things.

41
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:28,520
It was a pretty cash democracy but it was better than what you had before.
 In this democracy, only men had to decide things.
 And not even all men, but only free men.

42
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,080
And a third of all people at this time were slaves.
 They were not allowed to decide anything at all.

43
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,800
In ancient times, a lot of gods were believed.
 This is called "polyteism".

44
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:49,360
The gods had a lot of different powers and if you teased a god it could go really bad.
 They were not always so forgiving and understanding.

45
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,960
During ancient times, different kinds of texts were written and you wrote in three different genres.

46
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,680
A genre is the same as a certain type of literature.
 You talk about genres with movies today too.

47
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,020
You know as comedy, action or drama.

48
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,880
In literature you have a slightly different division.

49
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:18,480
The three genres that existed in ancient times were "lyric" that are kind of the same as short poems.

50
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,180
"Epos" which is narrative poems - thus something that is quite similar to what we today call novel.

51
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,640
Although they can say in a special way.

52
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,840
The third and final genre it was "drama", which was texts written to be played in theater.

53
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:47,780
The first known writer was named Homer.
 It is he who has given his name to Homer Simpson.
 Homer is named Homer in English.

54
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,520
He is known for two important texts: the Illiad and the Odyssey.

55
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,780
The first - Illiad - is about the war in Troja and hero Achilles.

56
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,620
They cheat into the city with the help of a huge wooden horse full of soldiers.

57
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,680
The other, the Odyssey, is about the hero Odysseus trying to get home from the war.

58
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:19,600
He annoys the sea god Poseidon by hurting his son who is a gigantic giant with just one eye - one so called cyclops.

59
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:29,100
Since Odysseus has annoyed Poseidon, he happens to be horrible storms and adventures at sea before finally getting home.

60
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,500
Another famous writer during ancient times was Sapfo.
 She lived on an island called Lesbos and wrote love poems.

61
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,080
They were aimed at women and therefore many have thought that Sapfo might be a lesbian.

62
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,140
And maybe she was.
 Or she just wrote about good looking girls anyway.

63
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,240
In general, it was not so stingy in antiquity with sexuality.

64
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:58,660
You could lie a little with who you wanted.
 Society did not care if people were in love with any of their own gender or the other.

65
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,780
The next era is the Middle Ages.
 It fell the young sphere in 500 and extends a thousand years ahead.

66
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,100
It has been named by the fact that it was a typical medium period - an average period.

67
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,880
A rather boring time between two good eras.

68
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,240
Although that is not really true.
 There are a lot of fun things then too.

69
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,360
During the Middle Ages, Christianity has spread and the church had great power.

70
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,620
It takes a good bit into the Middle Ages before Christianity reaches Sweden.

71
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,680
Most texts written are about God and Christianity and most people can neither read nor write.

72
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:50,980
People live quite poorly and especially in the countryside, but more and more cities are growing where people live, exercise different crafts, change and sell goods

73
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,120
These cities are quite dirty.
 Or even very dirty.

74
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:08,060
We should probably be happy that it is not possible to record a movie with scent because then you would have felt real medieval scent of people who did not wash and waste and stool.

75
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,300
During the Middle Ages, the plague spread in Europe.

76
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,520
It was a terrible infectious disease that was sometimes obliterated by entire cities.

77
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,260
One of the most famous writers of the Middle Ages was Dante Alighieri.

78
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,880
He wrote a book called "The Divine Comedy".
 It's not very funny.

79
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,680
But it is about a person and the person's journey through the different floors of hell.

80
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:42,660
When you read it you realized that it was best to sharpen and follow Christianity.
 Otherwise, you could get really bad.

81
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,400
At the end of the Middle Ages, there was another Italian writer named Giovanni Boccaccio.

82
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,200
Not pikachu.
 Boccaccio.

83
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,940
He is said to have invented the short story - you know those short texts that you sometimes read and write in school.

84
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,400
Hans Decamerone is a short story collection that has a frame story.

85
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,020
By frame story you mean a story that makes the other texts fit into a whole.

86
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:15,440
The Fam Story in Decamerone is that a number of young people have moved away from the pest's Florence.

87
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:22,020
They settle in a large house and to get the time to go, they tell different stories to each other.

88
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,060
These short stories are quite often about sex and religion.
 Not infrequently in combination.

89
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:40,440
In Iceland, a special kind of fairy tales were written at this time.
 They did not resemble today's fairy tales with "Snipp Snapp snout so the story was over" and "it was once" and princes and princesses.

90
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,220
Instead, it was stiff stories about family feuds and revenge.

91
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,880
Here, honor was vital.
 Worst culture of honor.
 These were no stories for children.

92
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,180
One of the most famous Icelandic writers had the somewhat unhappy name Snorre.

93
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,480
We can laugh at that today.

94
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:08,480
After the Middle Ages, the Renaissance fell.
 Renaissance means "rebirth".
 It comes from the French "Renaitre".

95
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,500
What one wanted to be born again - it was antiquity.

96
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,920
It was thought that a lot of crap had been written during the Middle Ages.
 A lot of boring lyrics about the church and a lot of sad knight stories.

97
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:27,500
Instead, they wanted to write like antiquity.
 Exciting drama and beautiful lyric.

98
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,240
Now you came up with how to print texts and suddenly ideas and words could be spread in quantities.

99
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:43,520
Before, they had to write every new copy you wanted from a book.
 A rather tough job that made books extremely unusual and valuable.

100
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,800
But now books began to become something that ordinary people could own.

101
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,883
During the Renaissance, Europeans discover the world-

102
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:57,936
Columbus discovers America (which he believes is India).

103
00:11:57,936 --> 00:12:02,716
And also forget that one cannot discover something that someone else had already discovered,

104
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:07,742
that is, the Indians who lived there before and who did not understand why they would be called Indians

105
00:12:07,742 --> 00:12:15,104
Just because some madman had been wrong on North America and India.

106
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,340
During the Renaissance there was a writer named Miguel de Cervantes.

107
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,020
He was a Spanish and wrote a story about the failed knight Don Quijote.

108
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:31,222
Cervante's story became incredibly popular and people laughed at the tragic failed hero

109
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:36,331
Who mixed up dragons and windmills and princesses and peasant girls.

110
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:39,556
Another writer during this time was William Shakespeare

111
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:42,424
- The world's most well -known writers.

112
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:47,284
He wrote drama inspired by ancient ideals and a lot of lyric.

113
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:54,112
Some of Shakespeare's most famous texts are Romeo and Julia, Hamlet, Macbeth and a midsummer night dream.

114
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:57,560
Several films today are inspired by these texts.

115
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,510
Not least Romeo and Julia that follow a typical theme of unhappy love.

116
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:08,490
After the Renaissance came the enlightenment.

117
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:13,791
It is called the enlightenment because people became increasingly enlightened and began to think critically and independently.

118
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:18,817
They were tired of the church's power and thought that the only important thing was knowledge and reason.

119
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:22,905
In France, revolution was made and the head of the king.

120
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,945
The people would decide.

121
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:30,682
Important writers during the enlightenment were Rosseau who wrote a book about child rearing

122
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:35,012
And Voltaire who wrote a lot of angry lyrics where he attacked the church.

123
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:42,185
The romance emerged as a criticism that the brain had pushed away the heart of literature.

124
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:45,732
With the romance, the horror stories appeared.

125
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:53,186
Texts about vampires and monsters, but also love texts about the deep passion that breaks down all reason.

126
00:13:53,525 --> 00:14:00,342
Goethe wrote a text about the young Werther who is so unfortunate in love that he kills himself.

127
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:07,834
Mary Shelly wrote the story of Frankenstein's monster and Bram Stoker wrote the story about Dracula.

128
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:17,610
The romance was a kind of criticism of enlightenment's boring factual world and realism became a criticism of the lack of anchoring of romance.

129
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,630
During realism, texts wanted to describe what it really was.

130
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,317
They wanted to tell about poverty and starvation and ordinary people who lived ordinary lives.

131
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:31,383
It should be pretty boring lyrics, but it didn't.

132
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:37,374
In Russia, literature flourished with writers such as Dostoevsky and Tolstoy or why not Gogol -

133
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:44,384
Who wrote a story called the nose that is about a nose that suddenly disappears from a face and then is out walking on the street.

134
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:51,464
Not so realistic, which shows that all kinds of literature have always existed during all eras.

135
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:54,588
null

136
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:58,516
After realism comes modernism.

137
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:03,036
Important writers are Franz Kafka or James Joyce.

138
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:08,004
At this time, artists start painting paintings where things don't really look like things look.

139
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:10,582
You know Picasso and stuff like that.

140
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:17,549
Modernism is a kind of revolt against the boring fixation of realism in accuracy.

141
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,595
A writer named Hugo Ball dressed up in a star gossip and read incomprehensible poems

142
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,425
consisting of words that were no real words.

143
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,000
Nowadays you talk about something called postmodernism.

144
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,790
It is a kind of clip and paste time full of different texts and directions.

145
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:42,178
We live in the middle of this so we have a hard time understanding what it really is.

146
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:49,138
Postmodernism means that there are a lot of different truths and that it is difficult to know who to really listen to.

147
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:51,779
And what to follow.

148
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,123
People think a lot of different things and like a lot of different things.

149
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:59,783
Postmodern writers do not choose between heart and brain, between social criticism and feelings

150
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:03,806
Without it, like the best of everything.
