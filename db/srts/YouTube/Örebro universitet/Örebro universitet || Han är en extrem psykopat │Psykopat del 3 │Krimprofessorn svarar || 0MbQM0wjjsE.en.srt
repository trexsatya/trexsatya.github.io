1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,060
He had a fairly normal family life.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,840
A wife.
 Two children.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,980
Lived in a villa.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,220
Said he worked as a consultant.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,760
It seems that he has killed a lot of individuals.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,360
If you want to talk about any example of a person who exhibits psychopathy.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,060
Then you can partly think like this.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,380
Because we know that 15-30 percent sitting

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,660
In prison, this diagnosis is likely.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,220
So you understand that there are some examples there.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,160
He is interesting in many ways.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,660
An American who committed extremely many crimes.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,620
He has deceased today.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,700
He lived a double life.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700
In psychopathy you sometimes talk about

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,860
“The Mask of Sanity”

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,500
He managed to have a surface and a fairly normal family life.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
A wife.
 Two children I think.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,000
Lived in a villa.
 Said he worked as a consultant.

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,540
Went away some strange times of the day.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,540
He worked as a hitman among other things.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,200
He was a leader in organized crime.

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
And made many types of crime.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,660
It seems that he has killed a lot of individuals.

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,040
The figures he mentions himself vary widely.

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,000
Sometimes he seems to want to boast about how many he had to death.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Sometimes not.

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,760
He is a good example because he is very clear.

29
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,760
He almost completely breaks in empathy.

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,540
He is extremely impulsive.

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,540
He can go out in extreme anger.

32
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
He can also be controlling if he needs it.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,760
Extremely manipulative.

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,280
Extremely lying.

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,940
In this way, he is not a good example either.

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,800
We have talked about that not all psychopaths are the same.

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
He is very, very extreme.

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,580
All people with psychopathy do not kill hundreds of people.

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,460
As he may have done.

40
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,460
Therefore, he is not such a good example.

41
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,460
He becomes an extreme example.

42
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,460
So it does not look for all people psychopathy.

43
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,660
That you have the extreme crime.

44
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,460
After all, not all people with psychopathy live a double life.

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,060
It may be a myth.

46
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,140
We will find psychopathy in a group of fairly ordinary criminals.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,440
If you put it that way.

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,340
It doesn't have to be on this exceptional Hollywood double life.

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,140
Could it be functional to be a psychopath?

50
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,140
The short answer is: hardly.

51
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,000
A psychopath is very uncontrolled, impulsive, need for change

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,700
deficiencies in empathy and are lying.

53
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
We have the whole syndrome.

54
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,000
It will be very difficult to be a functioning manager or whatever it would be.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,960
On the other hand, one would imagine that individual personality traits from here

56
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,300
That is, if you fail in empathy.

57
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,440
Would it be functional?

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,040
Maybe not nice.

59
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,120
But would it be functional for people in some social positions?

60
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:13,000
A manager who may have been ordered to kick 1000 people tomorrow.

61
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,240
Then maybe it is functional?
 Can we see it that way?

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
That you are not very, very empathetic.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,120
Because then maybe you can go to work the day after too.

64
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,700
But think that you should work well with the whole psychopathic syndrome.

65
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,220
That you break in empathy and are very impulsive.

66
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,220
And are lying.

67
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,080
You hear that and understand that that combination will burst.

68
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,060
It will knock around that person.

69
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,020
It is an uncontrolled person who is unemployed, manipulative and lying.

70
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,180
That it would be a functioning manager, politician or something else I keep too unlikely.

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,180
A fairly common view from the public based on Hollywood

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,620
is that psychopaths are particularly smart.

73
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,620
That they would have very high IQ.

74
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,940
Is it really so?

75
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,520
No, this is not what we see in most research studies.

76
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:19,220
We cannot see that psychopaths are particularly smart when we try to measure IQ in a good way.

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,720
We can probably kill that myth it seems.

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Thank you for being with us today.

79
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Like if you think what we do is good.

80
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,080
Feel free to comment and do not forget to subscribe.

81
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,500
This is the series about crime where we are seriously talking about crime.

82
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,000
It is important that we give nuanced images of crime.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,660
Instead of what happens in your information flows every day.
