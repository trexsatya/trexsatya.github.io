1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,920
Maybe you are interested in educating yourself as a criminologist?

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,780
Maybe you are interested in everything that has to do with crime?

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,480
Then maybe the criminal profession is something for you?

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,820
How can you train as a criminologist?

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,820
You can read at college and university.

6
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,820
You can read independent courses in criminology.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,380
Criminology 1, 2 and 3 are often called the courses at different universities.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,140
You can also read criminology programs.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,820
A three -year program.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,780
Leading to a philosophy bachelor's degree.

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,140
Here at Ã–rebro University we have a criminology program

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,660
which is based on integrative modern criminology.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,200
One may also practice very practical on how we can

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,400
Preventing crime and insecurity.

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,060
One is well prepared for a professional life that

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,640
Crime prevention strategist, analysts, investigators or administrators.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,620
When you read the three years you can also read advanced level.

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,620
You can read a master's year.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,860
You can even read even more and become a PhD student.

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,620
And doctorate.

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,300
And when you have doctorate four or five years

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,100
So philosophy doctorate.

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,420
It is such a path that I as a professor have gone.

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,140
Then I have researched on and been promoted to associate professor and professor.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,140
So that opportunity exists too.

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,340
But the vast majority of students with us are our three -year program.

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,340
Then they go out into the professional life.

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,980
It is only a small group that goes on and becomes a researcher.

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Who can really call themselves a criminologist?

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,160
Many people usually ask me about it.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,600
It is not a protected title.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,480
With those words we can say that we can decide it together.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,440
I think it's reasonable that when you have a degree

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,220
from college or university in criminology

35
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,620
Then you can call yourself a criminologist.

36
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,700
If you wish.

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,820
Just as when you have read political science for three years at the university

38
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,840
and has a bachelor's degree.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,240
Or behavioral science.

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,700
You probably hear people who call themselves political scientists and behavioral scientists.

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,880
Then maybe we can be called us criminologists when we read a bachelor's degree.

42
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
In criminology.

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
What can, but really work with as a criminologist?

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,660
You know a lot about crime and insecurity.

45
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,100
And security.

46
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,280
Almost all businesses are affected by it in different ways.

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,900
You can work as a strategist to plan: What should we do in our municipality?

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Or our business or our organization

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,660
to prevent crime better.

50
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,120
And investigate crimes better.

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,720
One can work as an analyst and analyze crime

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,280
To understand how we can better prevent them.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,140
For example, as an investigator, qualified manager.

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,140
And so on.

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,060
Where can you work as a criminologist?

56
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,380
We know a lot about it.

57
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,240
We follow our students after they left us after a degree.

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,040
And ask questions about where they work.

59
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,140
We see that many work within the Police Authority,

60
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,360
The Prison and Probation Service, the free care or other authorities and municipalities.

61
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,660
County councils and regions.

62
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,880
Of course, you can also work in the private sector.

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,540
For example, within larger public transport companies

64
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Which prioritizes security and security highly.

65
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:42,620
And there are other private players as security and security companies.

66
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,020
As there may be work for criminologists within.

67
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,760
There are more examples of employers.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,280
As you hear, there is a fairly proper labor market as criminologists.

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,640
What is the benefit of criminology?

70
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,340
You as a citizen and taxpayer:

71
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,360
What should you expect from us as a researcher in criminology?

72
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,200
Or a criminologist who has a bachelor's degree from us

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
And calls himself a criminologist?

74
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,080
I think you should high expectations of us who are scientific criminologists.

75
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,940
We should not just be thinkers and thinkers.

76
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
You should expect us to convey

77
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,840
Research to you and our decision makers.

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,580
We should be able to talk about what works better and worse.

79
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,180
Based on research we should be able to speak as which are the

80
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,180
The most important risk factors for crime are.

81
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,560
Which should be able to talk about which methods work best

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
to investigate and prevent crime.

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
And which ones work worse.

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,660
And as we should avoid.

85
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,120
I think we should place such demands on us criminologists.

86
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,460
There are many thinkers and thinkers regarding

87
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,080
Crime and insecurity in the debate and in the media.

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,300
It may be allowed to exist because it is good fuel for a debate

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,360
But we who trained criminologists at a university:

90
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,300
Our role should be to convey the scientific perspective.

91
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,180
I think that expectation should be wearing.

92
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,640
We should not just think and think.

93
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,640
It makes others so good.

94
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,940
We will also convey what we know from actual research.
