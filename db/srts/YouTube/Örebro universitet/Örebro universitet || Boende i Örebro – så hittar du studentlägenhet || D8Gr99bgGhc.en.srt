1
00:00:01,477 --> 00:00:04,740
Here in Örebro it is easy for you as a student to get a home.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,163
Many students choose to live in the university area, close to campus.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,658
Here there are several different student housing, in mixed sizes

4
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:15,582
Depending on how you want to live.

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,276
You can, among other things, live in corridor with shared kitchen and living room,

6
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:22,324
in a collective or in a separate apartment.

7
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:27,025
There are both student apartments but also ordinary rental properties

8
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,454
Around Örebro.

9
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:33,008
This is how it may seem to live in one near campus.

10
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:35,033
In this student housing lives Isabelle,

11
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:39,932
Like all her neighbors, stay here because they are plugging in the university.

12
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:44,394
This is her second student apartment during her time as a student in Örebro.

13
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:46,871
The apartment is at 25 square meters

14
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:51,048
And Isabelle pays about SEK 4,900 in monthly rent.

15
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:54,779
What she likes best about her apartment is that it is so close to the university,

16
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:57,387
But also for gym and grocery stores.

17
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:02,619
If you prefer to live more centrally

18
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:05,811
Of course, it is also possible to live near the town.

19
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:13,580
In this rental apartment lives Eva, which originally comes from Örebro

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,648
But who still wanted to find something of its own.

21
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:18,568
The apartment is 42 square meters

22
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:20,890
And costs about SEK 5,000 in monthly rent.

23
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:27,103
Eva likes the proximity to the pulse and being able to go to town in just minutes

24
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:29,156
And therefore enjoy the area very well.

25
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:34,162
If you instead want to live in an area that is constantly growing and developing

26
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,610
So the southern barn bed is the place for you.

27
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,755
Here are modern buildings and many different types of accommodation to choose from.

28
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,934
Here Jacob lives with his partner Sofie

29
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:47,669
Both moved here from Stockholm when they started plugging.

30
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:50,967
Their apartment is a third of 65 square meters

31
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:53,652
And costs about SEK 8,400 a month.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,055
What Jacob likes best with the area is the tranquility and proximity to nature.

33
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:02,687
As you understand, there are several different ways

34
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,238
Living as a student in Örebro.

35
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,077
But how have the students gone about getting these apartments?

36
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:11,462
Here are some tips on how to get hold of a home

37
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:13,780
before or at the beginning of your studies.

38
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,377
You can stand in a residential queue

39
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:19,379
At, among other things, the municipal housing company Öbo

40
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,781
or with other private landlords.

41
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:24,343
In Örebro it is free to stand in a residential queue,

42
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,975
and you can queue up before you seek education,

43
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:28,268
So do it now.

44
00:02:28,268 --> 00:02:31,651
Some private landlords do not use a queuing system

45
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,806
Without it, it is important to be first come, first served with a statement of interest.

46
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,110
On Örebro Municipality's website there is a list of all private landlords.

47
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:44,880
If you would probably not find any apartment in time until the course starts

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,772
So Öbo has a so -called housing guarantee.

49
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:50,381
This means that you who fail to find any apartment

50
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,613
may receive a time -limited agreement

51
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:56,470
So that you have somewhere to live during the first semester of your studies.

52
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,470
Read more about how the housing guarantee works at obo.se.

53
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,177
Now you have got a little better control over

54
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:06,716
What it is like to live as a student in Örebro.

55
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:07,880
Welcome here!
