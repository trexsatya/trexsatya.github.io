1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello and welcome to Örebro University!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,562
At Örebro University, more than 15,000 students are divided into three campus areas.

3
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:10,914
Main Campus Örebro, Campus USÖ and Campus Grythyttan.

4
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:12,914
Right now we are on the main campus.

5
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:17,496
The main campus is the biggest campus and this is where most students are.

6
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,709
There are all twelve buildings here

7
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:25,759
And during the tour you will visit these buildings plus Campus Grythyttan and Campus USÖ.

8
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:27,873
Join us and discover the university!

9
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:35,669
Welcome to Novahuset.
 Here, the School of Business has its premises.

10
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:39,199
Most people you find here plug the economy with different orientations.

11
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:44,214
In the Novahuset we have our largest hall which can accommodate just over 500 people, Aula Nova.

12
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:48,560
But here at the university we are not just sitting and plugging all day, student life is so much more.

13
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:51,474
You meet new friends and have a lot of fun together.

14
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:54,968
A house to have fun in, it sounds like the corps.
 Join us and I'll show you it!

15
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:58,948
Here we have the Kårhuset and that could be called the students' own houses.

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,436
Here there are café and study places in the days and some evenings there are also pub and nightclub.

17
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,509
Welcome to the longhouse!

18
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:13,029
And just as the name reveals, this house is very long.

19
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:18,436
If you want to go in length throughout the longhouse, it is 325 meters long.

20
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:24,692
Here in the longhouse that can be seen as the university center we find students from all programs.

21
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,775
And now I'm going to show you the forum house!

22
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:29,356
Then we were there here in the Forumhuset!

23
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:33,331
In the Forumhuset we find mainly students who read programs in the humanities.

24
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:36,997
It may be that you read, for example, to become a political scientist or a staff scientist.

25
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:41,006
Here in the Forumhuset we also find media center that I have right here behind me.

26
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:46,590
Here are students in the film program and my program Media, Communication and PR primarily.

27
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,876
For here we have different editing and recording rooms.

28
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:54,296
The Forum House is actually together with another house, Prismahuset.

29
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:59,037
Instead, in Prismahuset we find students who read medical programs.

30
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:03,872
But that's all I had to say.
 Now I pass you on to the School of Music.

31
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:11,840
The School of Music is for the students who are studying in music and theater.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,012
Next to the Music University is a building called Bilbergska.

33
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:18,633
It is for students who study for science subjects.

34
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:21,254
But now we will go to the gymnastics and sports houses.

35
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:23,792
Right now we are at the Gymnastics and Sports House.

36
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:26,044
This is one of the oldest buildings here on campus.

37
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:30,762
Those who plug here usually plug in sports within Sports Management, the coach program

38
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:32,911
or teacher orientation sport.

39
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,483
This is everything for me, the next stop is the library!

40
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:38,557
Now we are outside Örebro University Library.

41
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:41,725
At the University Library there are over 300,000 different books.

42
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:45,838
In addition to borrowing books, you can also sit and plug with your friends

43
00:02:45,838 --> 00:02:49,480
And then there is also the study workshop Lyktan where students can get help with their writing technology.

44
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:57,947
Now we are in our robot lab, which is located in Teknikhuset.

45
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:02,036
In Teknikhuset we find our engineering students.

46
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:11,021
In the lab, a lot of research is being done.
 We are researching, among other things, robots and AI technology.

47
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:18,083
It was everything from Örebro University's main campus.
 Now it's time to move on to Campus USÖ.

48
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,014
This is Campus USÖ.

49
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:31,200
Campus USÖ is located next to the University Hospital and it is a campus for us who plug in doctors.

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,279
At Campus USÖ we have our own library which is mainly focused on medicine.

51
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:39,029
Something that I think is great that is here is a clinical training center.

52
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:44,000
There we can practice various practical elements like listening to heart and lungs.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,749
You learn so much more than what is in the books.

54
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,757
Hello and welcome to Campus Grythyttan, to the Restaurant and Hotel Academy.

55
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:59,851
One of Sweden's foremost education in meals and hosting.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,498
And it is a very unique environment to plug in.

57
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:10,447
Everyone who plugs here is seen in their spare time very much and learns from each other, where everything is about food and drink.

58
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:13,520
That was everything for us, hey then!

59
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,800
Now we are back to where we started the tour.
 I hope you thought there was fun!

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,805
Bye!
