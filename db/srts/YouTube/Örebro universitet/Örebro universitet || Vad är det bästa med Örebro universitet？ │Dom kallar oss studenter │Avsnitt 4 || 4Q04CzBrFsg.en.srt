1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,220
Of course you have to fight a little extra to get into your dream education.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,520
It's worth it.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,460
It's definitely worth it.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,320
Ok!

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,380
I was fat seriously!

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,660
I was completely in it.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,180
Hello and welcome to a new section of

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,040
They call us students here on our Youtube channel.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,540
And today we will talk about what education

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,460
We have chosen to go.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,460
Why we have chosen that education.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,900
And why we chose Örebro University.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,960
A little also what we have for future dreams.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
And what we want to do with our lives simply.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
And also some tips for you how you can think

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,040
When you are going to the university.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,020
And don't forget to launch, comment and subscribe.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,260
Let's go!

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,780
Should one follow the heart or brain?

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,060
So I kind of think like this.

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,500
It is difficult.

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,700
But I kind of think like this.

23
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,600
Both are needed.

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
For one cannot work without the other.

25
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,880
It is important to choose something that you are really passionate about.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,260
As the heart thumps a little extra for.

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
At the same time, one must think rationally.

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Priority number one is to be able to support yourself.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Therefore, you have to think a little rational as well.

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,320
Then you have to have something you are passionate about and think is fun.

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,400
Because that's the most important thing in life.

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,588
That you yourself enjoy what you do.

33
00:01:16,588 --> 00:01:19,120
When you have no idea what you want to plug.

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,380
There are those who are them and I was one of them for a while.

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,960
If I say so.

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,900
I would probably say that you almost always know what you don't want to plug.

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,940
Right!

38
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,020
Because it is the best way to or in my opinion

39
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,280
To find out what you actually want.

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,620
And all of a sudden you have sung away maybe 20 programs.

41
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,780
And then you can take a university, or take our catalog for example.

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,380
And check all the programs, they are at the back of the catalog.

43
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,380
And then you have to iron.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,860
"No, but this I don't want to"

45
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,380
Finally, you may still have 15 or something.

46
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,100
Then you start to find something in common for them, "what is it I actually want to do?"

47
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,540
If you don't know what you want to do in high school

48
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,940
So I would recommend testing new activities.

49
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,600
I really believe in this with testing on things

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
To learn more about oneself.

51
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,240
That is, "I think this is fun or not?".

52
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,800
The only way is really to test it.

53
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,640
Did you know?

54
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,480
I knew quite early in high school what I wanted to study afterwards.

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,240
And it was precisely because I read a course on individual choice.

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,900
Which was business administration.

57
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,900
And how fast I started in it.

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,900
I had great teachers in it.

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,640
I knew right away.
 "I want to do this".

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,760
But then I think it's okay to not know.

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,680
You don't always have to know everything and

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
Life takes one somewhere anyway.

63
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,180
It is clear that one must fight a little extra to

64
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,820
have the opportunity to get into their dream education.

65
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,720
But it's worth it.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,020
It's definitely worth it.

67
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,020
But there are always other ways.

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,600
There is the college exam, you can read at Komvux.

69
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
So it's never driven to 100% as well.

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,400
Do you have an education you really want to plug and want to invest in

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Is it good to invest from day one.

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,260
I believe very many in high school anyway in the beginning it takes for granted

73
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,000
And it looks a bit more like elementary school.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,240
But high school plays quite a lot of role how far you come in.

75
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,180
It was like "either I plug in finance or law".

76
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,460
Since I had a greater interest in law, I chose to plug it instead.

77
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,380
I knew that the law program is a program that has high admission points.

78
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,960
So it was a motivation when I read in high school to study hard.

79
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,180
Then I did not plug all the time, you have your periods when it goes up and down.

80
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,320
During high school, that thought process was what one wanted to become and

81
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,520
Rights and check out a little at universities, it might get started in second.

82
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,060
At the end of the second and more in the third to first year in high school

83
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,260
was everything very new and it's all about getting into it and so

84
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,900
So you might not think the next step already then.

85
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,060
I was a real pluggis from one to third in high school.

86
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,080
I knew I wanted to go to university.
 I had not decided exactly at the beginning

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,580
Without it, when I got to test on the business economics course.

88
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,860
I knew I bet pretty loud as well.

89
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,480
There is a fairly high competence in these courses.

90
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,800
I wanted to go someone who was popular.
 It was something that appealed to me.

91
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,540
I can imagine many in high school do not know what there is for programs

92
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,900
at university, and hence not know what they want to do in the future.

93
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,160
So one tip is to go to a study guide and check out what programs are there.

94
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,420
Because there are an incredible number.
 I don't have exactly the number in the head but

95
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,100
Surely 80 programs we have at Örebro University.

96
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,320
I think economy that I have got a little insight into now is much more

97
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,160
than just numbers.
 There is a lot of leadership, organization, marketing.

98
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,420
The concept of economy is quite large.

99
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,360
And economists can work with lots of different things.

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,400
Absolutely.

101
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,360
I think it's easy to happen that when you look at programs

102
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
So it is believed that finances are just numbers.

103
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:14,000
So you think this is just what I can be, but the programs are often wide.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,680
Then there are programs where you get a title like to

105
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,400
If you plug as a teacher then you become a teacher and it is a concrete way to go.

106
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,640
But examples like economics, there is a lot you can do afterwards.

107
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,140
Just.

108
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,520
It took five years for me before I even knew I wanted to start plugging really.

109
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,040
When you go back to high school when choosing programs

110
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,460
I felt that I didn't know if I wanted to go on after that.

111
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,800
I was a little tired of school.
 I was a little defiant teenager if you say so.

112
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,720
And then I started looking around a bit at what was there.

113
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,740
And realized that I still want the options open.
 I didn't want to choose one

114
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,400
vocational preparation without a study preparation.

115
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,240
So after the student I started working.

116
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,020
And continued to work and have been out and traveled some.

117
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,820
And never had a thought of plug really.

118
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,860
I wanted to work my way up to a company.

119
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:11,360
But I wanted to learn more.
 And on the jobs I have had, communication has been the most fun.

120
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,620
I would rather not plug in Stockholm where I come from.

121
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,900
I wanted to plug anywhere else was not too far away.

122
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
But not too close either.

123
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,860
So I still felt that Örebro is still a central location in Sweden.

124
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,660
Partly that and that it is not so far from my hometown.

125
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,100
So I need to come home I can make it very easy.
 It takes almost two hours by train.

126
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:41,340
I had heard very well about the university.
 And that the city is a city for students.

127
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
You can cycle everywhere and it is a comprehensive campus.

128
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,400
Most students still live near campus.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
Which is very nice.

130
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,820
It becomes more of a cohesion as well.

131
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,100
I wanted to move to Örebro because I wanted to start over again.

132
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,880
Get to know a new city and have the opportunity to create a new contact network.

133
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,300
It is very difficult to get hold of an apartment in my hometown.

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,100
And I heard that in Örebro you had quite good opportunities to get a living.

135
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,140
Where are you from?

136
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,020
I come from Lindköping.

137
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,680
It is also a student city.

138
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,060
It is quite difficult to get hold of accommodation but it is a little easier here.

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,140
One thing with Örebro University is that it is a comprehensive campus.

140
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,020
Exactly.

141
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,240
All buildings are in the same place.

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,660
Teachers, economists, rhetoricians.
 Everyone is really together.

143
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,980
Then in some buildings you have the most lessons in.

144
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,980
So it gets a little divided that way.

145
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,060
But unlike some other cities, it will not be scattered.

146
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,240
With a building being in one side of the city

147
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,820
And the other in the other side of town.

148
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,200
Without it, it really is that everyone is together.

149
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,920
And everyone has the common bible.

150
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,540
You could say that there will be a city in the city.

151
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
Yes, I agree.

152
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,780
Campus is a little outside the center so you have your campus bubble here.

153
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,420
Which I can appreciate because I want to get to know student life.

154
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,940
What markets a manager is perhaps some company.

155
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,220
And control and set a little.

156
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,540
Democratic.

157
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,940
Not such an authoritarian "You'll do this!"

158
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,780
But be the leader who is popular.

159
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,560
That influences.

160
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,940
I would prefer to work in criminal justice and good targets.

161
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,380
And more with people that way.

162
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,960
I think business law is as interesting as criminal justice is.

163
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,380
For example, I could work as a defense lawyer.

164
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,980
Or plaintiff's assistant.

165
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,840
Or something in that style.

166
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,180
Programs are extremely broad with rhetoric and communication.

167
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,040
And it's something you can apply to life.

168
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,280
On everything really.

169
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,660
Yes really, generally for life.

170
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,720
And like any company.

171
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,880
So it has been very high and low with my thoughts.

172
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,900
I wanted to be the communication that stands between companies.

173
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,800
The face out for a company to be their communications manager.

174
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,620
And similar.

175
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,120
My goal right now is to become an authorized accountant.

176
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,840
I will work within just auditing in a year.

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,680
Since I have already got a job.

178
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,940
Because within this industry you are very early to hire people.

179
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,220
So I've been lucky to get a job there.

180
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,820
It's like a career ladder, where you work upwards.

181
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,880
And then the goal is to become an authorized auditor in the long run then.

182
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,940
