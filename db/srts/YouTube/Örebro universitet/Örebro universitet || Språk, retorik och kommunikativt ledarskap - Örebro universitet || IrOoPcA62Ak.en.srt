1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
Are you ready to sit and talk a little?

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,639
Always ready!
 Are you ready?

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,580
The program is called language rhetoric and communicative leadership,

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,559
So it's really the three parts that permeate everything.

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,899
Then it is language where we read courses in both Swedish and English.

6
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,260
rhetoric that is both written and verbal communication.

7
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:31,739
And then we have communicative leadership that is very much developed in all different courses.

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,679
We really learn what good communication means.

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,939
Term five is completely optional.

10
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:48,600
Then you can choose partly study abroad, an optional course or an internship.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,060
You can work with a lot of examples as a communicator, you can coach or write speech.

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,079
It is very much because the program is so wide

13
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,840
And have so many different components that you fit a lot afterwards.

14
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,359
I am very attracted to the leadership bit.

15
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,579
And I want to work with some kind of education.

16
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,560
I've always had a dream of being involved in influencing and inspiring people.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,480
So I have not decided any form of education since in which industry.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,840
It is a very warm climate here at Ã–rebro University,

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,780
I would say that is the reason why you find the belonging to university

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,980
And that you feel at home.

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,280
University is a little outside the city center

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,719
Which means that when you are at university you are really with students and get that feeling.

23
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,400
Then you can get into town and do activities there as well.

24
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,099
Are you interested in communication,

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,920
want to understand how people communicate between each other

26
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,560
And how you reach out in the best way?

27
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,560
Then you should read the language, rhetoric and communicative leadership.
