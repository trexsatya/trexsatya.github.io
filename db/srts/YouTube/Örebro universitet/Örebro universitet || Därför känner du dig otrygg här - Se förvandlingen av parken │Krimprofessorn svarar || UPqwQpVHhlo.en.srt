1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
Look at this park.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,500
Many feel insecure here in the evening.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
What do you think of the lighting in this park?

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,620
Is it a good lighting?

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,320
This is the series about crime

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,960
Where we nuance your picture of crime.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,440
The picture of crime you and I get in our media flows every day.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,900
What does it mean to work crime prevention?

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,840
What requirements should we place on the police, the municipality and other collaboration actors?

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,200
How do I as a citizen think they should work?

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
What do I think as a researcher?

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,820
Look at this park.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
We have some problems in this park.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,740
Many people feel insecure in this park in the evening.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,740
What do you think of the lighting in this park?

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Is it a good lighting?

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,520
Will it be a good even light?

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,180
Or does it rather create a wall of darkness?

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,180
Where the light cones end.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,620
This is probably not such a good light design in a park.

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
Because we really have a wall of darkness.

22
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,020
The problem is that it is not a physical wall.

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,320
Without it, people can actually stand without being seen.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,880
Because we work knowledge -based and systematically

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,100
we look at reported crimes and

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,320
We get reports in other ways from here.

27
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,880
And there is suspicion of drug store in the dark here.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,400
In general, this route does not feel so inviting.

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
We don't get people here.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,360
We would like to get an even flow of people who create security.

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,200
There are tall bush cakes here on the right side that create insecurity.

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,780
One can wonder if there is anyone behind the bush?

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,140
Now we have analyzed and mapped the problems.

34
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,840
There are many people who feel insecure in this park.

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,820
And we also see this drug crime.

36
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,580
Or at least suspicions of drug crime.

37
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,040
Now we analyze this that is the next step in the systematic way of working.

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,040
What is this because of?

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Why do many feel insecure?

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,860
Is it the defective lighting and light design?

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,440
We are not just about it.

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,440
It's not just common sense.

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Without we also look at research.

44
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
We also hit the knowledge.

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,080
That is why it is called knowledge -based work.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
What does the research say about this?

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Is it that lighting can make people insecure?

48
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,260
So defective or certain type of lighting?

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,140
In this case, we might be supported by it.

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,440
Can the high bush create insecurity and uncertainty?

51
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,020
Can darkness facilitate drug sales?

52
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,620
Now we do this analysis.

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,620
Before we put in an effort.

54
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,860
Now we are planning efforts on analysis grounds.

55
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
We try to access the causes.

56
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,840
Now we are also thinking about:

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,820
Now we believe that improving the lighting gives a security -creating effect.

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,000
We believe it will reduce drug crime in this park.

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,340
And now again we turn into research:

60
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,400
Are there evaluations that have tested this before?

61
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,520
Is there research that shows that improved lighting gives changes?

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,680
Now we are planning for efforts.
 Improve lighting.
 Change the bush.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,660
We are doing quite a large intervention in this park.

64
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,660
In this next picture.

65
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,640
So we look after the efforts.

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,340
We have rebuilt this park quite a lot.

67
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Now you see that the lighting is completely different.

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,680
We have even lighting that spreads lighting throughout the park.

69
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,060
This is the same time of day as the last picture.

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,740
But the lighting has done wonders with how we can see each other.

71
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,000
There are really no dark spots in this park at all.

72
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,800
Look at the bush and the height of the bush.

73
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,540
No one can hide with ease behind these bush.

74
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,460
We have an inviting park that invites you to spontaneous activities.

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,700
A slightly wider route where we can do things.

76
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,860
And we have benches that invite people.

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,220
Benches can certainly be a problem.

78
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,220
There you have to think about how to design benches.

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,420
Maybe so that you design so you can't sleep on the benches.

80
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,420
There are techniques for that.

81
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,700
When making such a situational effort.
 That you change the environment.

82
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,260
Then we always have to think about this with redistribution.

83
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
And spread.

84
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,520
That is, do we move on the problems?

85
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Has drug crime, which we see has decreased drastically.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Now that we have made this change in the park, we get much fewer reports of insecurity in the park in the evening.

87
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,600
We see that drug crime has almost disappeared from the scene.

88
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,900
Then we have to ask ourselves: Has the crime moved on?

89
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,580
Has it been printed to surrounding areas?

90
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,980
What we do now we are also following up and studying neighborhoods all around.

91
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,600
After the effort in the park.

92
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,940
Has the problems with drug traffic increased around?

93
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,320
Then we have support that we only pushed the crime away from the scene.

94
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,960
The spread effect means a good effect in the park but also all around.

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,800
We will not always move on crime.

96
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,980
It partly depends on what kind of problem it is.

97
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,660
What kind of crime it is.

98
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,440
Now that we have made the efforts and made this change.

99
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
This is what the park looks like when we have rebuilt it.

100
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,100
Then we follow up.

101
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,000
Because in our municipality we work systematically.

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,960
We map, analyze and follow up.

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
After all, we map all the time.

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,220
We follow the crime and other reports we receive.

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,140
And we see now: before we made this change.

106
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,880
So we had so much reports of insecurity.

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,220
And suspicion of drug crime.

108
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
And actually drug crime.

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Now that we have made this change, we have followed the incident reporting and crime

110
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:36,300
A number of months and see that we have been given a fairly large reduction in crime.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,500
We follow up and create knowledge about what works and not.

112
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,240
Of course, it is appropriate to compare with another park.

113
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Which may have similar problems.

114
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,500
To see if the same problems do not change because they do not rebuild the park.

115
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,920
And see if we get a change when we rebuild the park.

116
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,920
That we have a control area.

117
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,740
Then we get an even stronger reliability.

118
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,700
If we do well in our follow -ups.

119
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,780
I think we should all ask ourselves:

120
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,460
Regarding this with working systematically and knowledge -based.

121
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,200
How do you work in my municipality?

122
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,980
How do you work in your municipality?

123
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,340
If you work in the municipality with the police and other cooperation actors.

124
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
So I think you should ask the question:

125
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,440
Do we work systematically and knowledge -based?

126
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,940
Why don't we?

127
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,440
I think we should make demands to work that way.

128
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,260
There is much to indicate that we will be more efficient then.

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,860
Must also think about what the alternative is?

130
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,260
Would it be that we work unsystematic?

131
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
And don't listen to knowledge?

132
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
And don't follow up on what we do?

133
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
It's worth thinking about.

134
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,580
We can not only be driven by common sense and logic.

135
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,460
It will sometimes lead us wrong.

136
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,120
Therefore, it is so important to look at what research also says.

137
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,100
It is also generally one of the big reasons why we have research.

138
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
That we have some kind of facts we can lean on.

139
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,200
Thank you for being with us today.

140
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Like if you think what we do is good.
