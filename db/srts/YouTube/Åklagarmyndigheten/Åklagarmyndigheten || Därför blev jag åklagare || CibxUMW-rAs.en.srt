Hi, my name is Tobias and I work as a prosecutor in Eskilstuna.

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,099
I love my job as a prosecutor!

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,419
It is both exciting and varied and I feel that I often have the opportunity to make a difference in people's lives.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,199
There were many reasons for me to apply for a medium -sized Swedish city.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,920
My family and I had the opportunity to buy a house, without making a housing career in a larger city.

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:28,000
So now I live in an urban area outside Eskilstuna but I can still cycle to work in about 20 minutes through wonderful nature.

7
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,340
As an employee of the Prosecutor's Office, I am entitled to wellness, one hour a week.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,420
When the work allows, I come out more often than that.

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,520
And it suits me perfectly, because I train to survive mountain marathon this summer.

10
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,020
So that's why I'm going to the local ski slope and now run for lunch.

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,399
As an employee of the Prosecutor's Office, I have confidence working hours.

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,079
And of course it means that I sometimes have to sit on a Sunday night and prepare Monday's goals.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,100
But above all, it means to me,

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,500
A certain opportunity to dispose of my working hours I want.

15
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:03,520
And it has facilitated incredibly, in my everyday puzzle with toddlers, pick -ups and remains.

16
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:07,500
Do like me, become a prosecutor!
