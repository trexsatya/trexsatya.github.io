1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,460
Due to the Corona crisis, we interview researchers at Lund University.

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,480
Today we have with us political scientist Åsa Knaggård.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,700
You have been interested in how politicians make decisions under great uncertainty.
 Welcome!

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:34,440
During the Corna crisis, Sweden's strategy has been extensively discussed.
 Among other things, you have compared to other countries.

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,560
But you mean that it is almost impossible to know whether we choose the right strategy or not.
 What do you mean?

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,540
When you talk about what is the right strategy, you cannot give a clear answer to that.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,480
It is always dependent on the framework you set or the perspective you have.

8
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:58,480
If we have an narrow spread perspective, you get an answer to what is right.

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Then it is about reducing the spread of infection as much as possible.

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,380
If you have a broader perspective where you take in the slightly more long -term financial health issues

11
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:11,760
So maybe you get another answer.
 Therefore, it becomes very difficult to say what is right.

12
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,640
To that should be added that I do not think that we will even be able to say what was right, in retrospect, we will be able to say, what was right,

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,320
If Sweden chose right, so to speak, because we can never know.
 If we go back and say that

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,160
Sweden had chosen Norway's strategy instead, what would it have meant?
 We don't know that.

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,780
But it feels a little frustrating that we may never ever know which strategy was right.

16
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,040
No, but that's how it is precisely when we have this great uncertainty, that it may not be possible to say.

17
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:46,720
You have to make decisions anyway.
 I would say that is the content of this with decisions under uncertainty.

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,480
You can only cook by position.

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,360
What do you think stands out with Swedish politicians' actions during the Corona crisis?

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,980
Two things I would say.
 It is not so much about which strategy we have chosen in Sweden

21
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,240
The first is that politicians listen to the experts to the extent they do.

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,980
It is quite unusual if we look at politics in general.
 I think about school policy for example

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,700
Which is an ideological battlefield.
 No one listens to the experts if we harden it.

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:28,440
It is a bit surprising, I would say that they listen to the extent they do.

25
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,500
But this applies in many countries, not just in Sweden.

26
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:40,660
The other thing that I think stands out in Sweden is that they have kept to continue listening to the experts.

27
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,680
That is, I really expected that when there were more people who began to die

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,680
When the figures began to leave, that we had seen more politically motivated decisions then

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,840
That you said that "this is not possible, we have to do something" but we have not seen that.

30
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
And I think that is interesting and exciting, that you have not done so.

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,680
Another thing I think about is that they also seem to be very unanimous.
 Is it also something that stands out?

32
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,340
Yes I would also say that it is something that would be very interesting to study late afterwards

33
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,000
That the government appears incredibly agreed in standing behind the line to listen to the experts.

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:30,420
There is no criticism from within.
 And you might wonder, is it really that way?

35
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,660
And it's hard to say.
 We only see what they show outward at press conferences and in interviews.

36
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,920
So far, it has basically been total agreement.

37
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:52,380
Maybe not entirely surprising but it is interesting because it shows that they have talked together

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,420
before they have decided on a line they hold.

39
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,540
But how do you think before making a decision under great uncertainty?

40
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:09,360
Is there any template that the decision makers can hold when making decisions under such great uncertainties?

41
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:18,360
My research is not so much about templates.
 What I research about is how the decision makers actually make decisions.

42
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,920
What I see, I have primarily studied environmental and climate issues.

43
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,380
What you can see there is that you can either concentrate on the uncertainty

44
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,240
Or can be concentrated on the knowledge that exists.

45
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:43,080
What it means having a strategy where one focuses on the uncertainty

46
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,100
This means that you want to reduce uncertainty.

47
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,480
It is said that we know too little about this to make good decisions.
 We need to buy ourselves more time, get more knowledge

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,300
So that we can later make a better founded decision.

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,040
And in this case, with the Corona epidemic, it is about limiting the spread of infection

50
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,040
as much as possible and wait for new knowledge, for example if

51
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,100
Do these masks work?
 What does it look like with the spread of infection when you do not have symptoms?

52
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,980
Lots of things that you can gain more knowledge about gradually.

53
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:27,720
Could a strategy be that we are running a lockdown now throughout the country waiting for us to have more knowledge?

54
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,240
Is that an example?

55
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,480
Yes it is.
 And one begins to open up society again

56
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,140
Once you have gained knowledge that allows you to do it safely.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,360
But then there is another strategy too?
 And then you take in the existing knowledge.

58
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,040
Can you develop it?

59
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,740
Then it is about saying instead of saying that there is so much uncertainty here you say

60
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,760
We still know quite a lot.
 We know how epidemics work.

61
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,220
And we know pretty much about viruses and spreading.
 We know about how society works.

62
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,360
We have to base our actions on it.

63
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,660
And that is probably the strategy that Sweden has chosen to deal with the uncertainty with.

64
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,540
So, for example, you use model knowledge to see how the infection can be spread.
 What is likely?

65
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:27,720
If we put in different restrictions, how would it affect?
 This is how you can look at in these models.

66
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,820
But also such things as what we know about healthcare and healthcare capacity,

67
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,680
How elderly care works.
 It can also be about the type of steering you are used to

68
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,900
And know works in a particular country.

69
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:49,560
The interesting thing about this type of strategy is that different countries can end up in completely different conclusions.

70
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,800
But that they are still based on the knowledge that exists.

71
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,720
Then it is partly that the experts may do different analyzes of the same knowledge

72
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,160
But also that you have completely different conditions in different countries.

73
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:13,600
It sounds like this is rational, now we will find some good strategy to fight the spread of infection.

74
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,800
But are there not completely different reasons why politicians make decisions?
 Don't they just want to show action too?

75
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,680
You have to make a decision to show that you are doing something?

76
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,140
Well, it is clear, to a large extent it is.
 Then I would not say that it is not rational.

77
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,860
It is not easy to draw that limit.
 It again depends on the perspective you take.

78
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,720
If you take a broader perspective and say that a large part of this is to calm the population,

79
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,880
That people should feel that politicians take this seriously, that they do something,

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,500
That they do not care when people get sick, die and become unemployed.

81
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,460
It is a very important part of politics.
 So that with action is rational

82
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,180
From such a perspective, to show that you do something.

83
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,040
And there that can close boundaries or say that you should have face masks to be great.

84
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
In that perspective, so to speak.

85
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:16,660
But if you look in a broader perspective, we see that some politicians use this after all

86
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,620
For example, to benefit their own political party.
 You want to be able to win elections.

87
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:30,460
In the United States, it is very clear that Donald Trump uses this party strategically, or what to say.

88
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,340
Even in Poland, there have been discussions about it anyway.

89
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:45,620
And then also actually, and I think it's much, much worse, what we can see in Hungary, for example,

90
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:54,840
where you use infection -limiting policy to further dismantle democracy

91
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,740
It's really worrying.

92
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,540
You talk about different strategies that you can have but this crisis goes so fast.

93
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:12,900
There is constantly new information that is to be decided.
 Is it possible to stick to a strategy?

94
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:21,260
Hard to say.
 The important thing really, and the most important thing, when it comes to decision making under uncertainty

95
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,760
is that you go back and re -examine the decisions you make.

96
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,900
You can never think that we have made this decision already and then we do not have to think about it anymore.

97
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,840
You have to go back and rethink, partly because you get new knowledge but also because the situation can change.

98
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,320
So to go back and rethink and be very humble with this that one must be able to admit

99
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,820
That that was a stupid decision.
 Now we do differently.

100
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,160
As a political scientist, during this Corona crisis, what has caught your curiosity?

101
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,540
Yes, all this is very exciting for someone who is doing decision -making under uncertainty

102
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,160
Because it is a single long decision -making, under uncertainty.

103
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,780
But that one would like to study afterwards it is this with

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,460
What are the balances that have really done?

105
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,860
Partly between the narrow spread perspective and the broad socio -economic,

106
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,240
But also how you have thought about uncertainty, what is the knowledge you have leaned on?

107
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,960
How have you weighed in uncertainty and thought about this with caution and so on?

108
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,420
So it would have been wonderful to sit and hear the conversations they have had.

109
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,960
Thanks so much.
 It must be the last for today.
 Thank you for being with Åsa.

110
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,320
Thank you very much.

111
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:50,200
And thank you for being listening.
