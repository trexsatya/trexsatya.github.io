1
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,552
Welcome to debate in Lund, both all of you who are here in the hall

2
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
At the Grand Hotel

3
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,880
and you who follow us via screen

4
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
Or TV someone elsewhere.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,500
Debate in Lund is a forum for in -depth conversation, for intellectual debate.

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,000
It is a collaboration between

7
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:40,850
Lund University, especially the Faculty of Social Sciences, and Sydsvenskan

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,517
Which sends directly from here tonight.

9
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:46,592
My name is Lars Mogensen and I am a journalist.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
Such a small grunk ...

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,017
Do you see sitting at the back and you who look on the screen?

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,344
Such a little thing with crank,

13
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
A crank radio.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Does anyone have such a home?

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
A gang.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,850
This is a bubbler for this year's Christmas present 2022.

17
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,496
Another bubbler as this year's Christmas present 2022,

18
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
a woodwood.

19
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,176
Both of these things, after all, pretty crunchy gifts

20
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
If you see it back in perspective.

21
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,600
Think the other year when people wanted VR glasses and robotic vacuum cleaners.

22
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,134
Now it is firewood that bubbles.

23
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
Something has happened.

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,500
Putin's war against Ukraine,

25
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:42,350
The gas pipes that were blasted off our coast, at Bornholm.

26
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
Company forced to put down or postpone

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
their investments and plans

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
due to completely unreasonable electricity bills.

29
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,117
Private individuals who cry for concern that they are afraid that they will not cope with their electricity bills.

30
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,750
And besides, some understanding

31
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,576
that paints up horror scenario

32
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,850
About a Sweden that is partially extinguished in winter.

33
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,384
So the question is: How do we solve the Swedish energy supply on one

34
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,534
fossil -free, in a robust and stable way

35
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
And how should prices be set?

36
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,000
Now we have a new and much more nuclear -friendly government.

37
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:26,067
The question is whether it has power, energy enough to give Sweden new electricity.

38
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:31,296
This will try to find out here tonight along with two former ministers

39
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:39,084
And two engineers with control of energy systems and power work technology.

40
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:44,096
At the far right we have Mikael Odenberg, a known face, former

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
Minister of Defense in the Reinfeldt government

42
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
In the early 21st century,

43
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,767
CEO of Svenska Kraftnät between 2008 and 2017.

44
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
Welcome.
 Isabella Lövin, former environmental and climate minister, environmentalist.

45
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:09,267
Minister of Löfven's government in 2019 to 2022 and a past as EU parliamentarian,

46
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,720
Author and more.

47
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,376
We have Magnus Genrup as a professor of environmental and energy systems at Lund University.

48
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Beside him...

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
Well, now it was wrong.

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
It was wrong.

51
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,592
Magnus Genrup is a professor in power plant technology

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,650
And closest to me Lars J Nilsson, professor of environmental and energy systems.

53
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,760
So I got it right, excuse.

54
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,904
Warm welcome, they are worth an applause!

55
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,384
The last few days so the electricity prize has suddenly gone down a bit again

56
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,376
But we are in a very worried,

57
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,434
advice and awkward time.

58
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
We begin with

59
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Lars J,

60
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,900
closest to me.
 A brief situation, how serious is the situation?

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,456
The acute situation is well -seriously severe

62
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,750
But I think in a longer perspective so we have had

63
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,112
A safe, stable electricity supply.

64
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
We have no shortage of electricity.

65
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
We exported

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
25 terawatt hours electricity last year.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,583
Now we have a problem in the short term this winter and next winter,

68
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,384
driven by the war against Ukraine

69
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,200
And consequences on gas prices that print our prices.

70
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
Magnus Genrup, your location description?

71
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
My position description is that in

72
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,455
principle we have gone from a very stable system, we have discontinued

73
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Very much effect

74
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,267
And should it get really cold then we have a pretty huge deficit that we have difficulty dealing with,

75
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,634
that can mean, what we talked about before,

76
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,403
Manual disconnect but it is quite unlikely.

77
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:49,023
What I called darkening.

78
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:50,815
But that is quite unlikely, I want to say.

79
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,119
There is still on the map that it could be so?

80
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
It is always on the map.

81
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,239
It is always on the map and Svenska Kraftnät has flagged for it

82
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,284
But at the same time, the probability is greatest now.

83
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Isabella Lövin,

84
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
How do you describe the situation?

85
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Yes we have no shortage

86
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,063
on electricity in Sweden, on the contrary

87
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,100
Do we produce more electricity than we consume and export

88
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
and has been

89
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
the largest exporter even in the EU

90
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
during certain periods.

91
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,550
But we have an electricity crisis

92
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
can you say because it is so large

93
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:32,031
Demand for electricity in Europe right now.

94
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
It's tough

95
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,943
For many, for all of us would say in electricity area 3 and 4

96
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
Which has very high electricity prices right now.

97
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,087
But one should also remember that you have very high electricity prices in

98
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,879
Virtually all of Europe.

99
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,719
One should also remember how people suffer in Ukraine right now

100
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,034
And that the big reason we have this crisis,

101
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,117
It is Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

102
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
We have in common

103
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
decided that we should not buy gas by

104
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,900
Putin and otherwise we have no pipeline left after

105
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
This blast you mentioned.

106
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
Mikael Odenberg, your picture of the situation?

107
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,567
Yes, it is more that we have problems in the electricity market with very volatile and

108
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,667
Occasionally very high prices and large price differences

109
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:23,487
which sets it for

110
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,767
Industry's competitiveness and for households, especially in southern Sweden.

111
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
But the electricity system itself is robust.

112
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,447
It shines in the cabins and what Isabella said,

113
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,484
Swedish electricity is a successful export industry.

114
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,517
Then the electricity should also last a cold winter when it is not blowing.

115
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
It will do it

116
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,934
Although the margins in the system have decreased with the closures of Ringhals 1 and 2.

117
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
It is important to have clear to itself that when Pågens

118
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,150
Had trouble investing in a new bread factory in Skåne was not due to electric deficiency

119
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,150
Without it, it was due to restrictions in the distribution network.

120
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:02,117
And when Uniper runs the Oil Foundation power plant in Karlshamn

121
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
so it does not depend on electric deficiency without

122
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
It is because the price then is so high

123
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,767
So it pays for the owners to run the production.

124
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,567
So what is our basic problem now?

125
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:13,407
Is it in the war that Isabella answered and you others have been in?

126
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,417
Or which is the basic problem?
 What does Lars J say?

127
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
Yes, I would say that this is the basic problem we have right now.

128
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:27,100
Then we have some problems out in the distribution network with capacity.

129
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,017
But the urgent now is of course the high prices.

130
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,191
Yes, the basic problem is the EU's dependence on Russian gas

131
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,007
And that we have sat down in this dependency relationship.

132
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
Now no one has been able to foresee

133
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:51,117
That we would see an invasion of a European country in our vicinity 2022 or 2021.

134
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,415
And you have not been able to plan for it.
 Then you can see that there has been a

135
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
lack of planning for too

136
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,535
climate change that one has

137
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,350
seen the gas as a transitional energy type

138
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,200
On the way to completely renewable electricity.

139
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,534
They could not be able to help it in the rearview mirror.

140
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,467
That we have sat down in that addiction is the big problem.

141
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,000
We also have an electricity market model

142
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,850
But marginal pricing ensures that it is the most expensive power that comes in,

143
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,200
In this case, the gas, which sets the price on the entire market.

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,300
Many people think it is strange but at the same time one should be aware that

145
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,834
Marginal pricing is not a phenomenon for the electricity market,

146
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,935
It is not so that Norwegian oil for example

147
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
Is very cheap just because it is cheap to produce.

148
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
It is probably a reasonable principle.

149
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
But then the problem is also,

150
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
If you take SE4 that we belong to,

151
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
Our production capacity is

152
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
About half the size of our export capacity from SE4.

153
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:02,463
This, together with our internal cuts in the country, will drive the price picture in SE4.

154
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,617
Which leads us into this with electric areas, thought as well that we wash it right away

155
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:11,167
Because I think there are quite a few who are thinking about that.

156
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,751
So we can move on then into what the energy mix should look like and such.

157
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,615
But we received these four electricity areas in 2011 after the bumps from Denmark

158
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
And the European Commission.

159
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,527
Since a decision by Svenska Kraftnät whose then Director General was

160
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Mikael Odenberg.

161
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
This was your invention.

162
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:34,167
It was I who made the decision and for a long time I had a loose beard when I went to Skåne.

163
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,317
How smart was this in the rear view mirror?

164
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:42,655
It was smart given the conditions.

165
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Thus there is very much

166
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,079
ignorance of electricity areas.
 It's nothing like bureaucratic invention,

167
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
Something you find for fun.

168
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,759
Without electricity area division is ultimately about operational safety.

169
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
It is because in an AC network network you cannot influence

170
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,517
How the electricity flows without it flows where the resistance is the least.

171
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,535
When we are going to transfer a lot of electricity from the production in the north to

172
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
Consumer Center in the south,

173
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Then it runs a little too much electricity in some wires.

174
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,767
Then they risk being overloaded and can break down and then you can get big power outages.

175
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,586
Then you have to limit this flow in these bottlenecks.

176
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:25,017
And that is why these four areas were invented?

177
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,455
Until 2011 so

178
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,551
We limited the flow in a very elegant way, we screwed the cranes to Denmark.

179
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,000
Then the flows decreased in these bottlenecks

180
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,695
And then the Danes complained.

181
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
They already complained in 2006 to the Commission whose competition directorate started the whole

182
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
the investigative apparatus.

183
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,983
When we arrived at 2010, 2011

184
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,934
So were there many meters -high document collections that

185
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,650
The Competition Directorate came along and the message that:

186
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,267
"You can't do this, you can't discriminate against Danish customers".

187
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Okay.

188
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,900
I mean, they were right.

189
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Unfortunately

190
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,815
Then we have to relate to this and what do you do?

191
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,167
Yes, then the conventional wisdom says that then opposes man, that is

192
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:26,000
The system operator Svenska Kraftnät goes in and shops up

193
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
consumption reductions or production increases

194
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
so that you affect the actors on both sides of the bottle neck.

195
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,800
And on that road you reduce the flows.

196
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
We estimated in 2011 that it was not a viable path,

197
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
that we did not have enough opposite resources in

198
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Southern Sweden to

199
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
Be able to handle the bottlenecks only with counter -trading.

200
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
This situation is even worse today.

201
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
It is often the case that it is described as these four electricity areas is about providing incentives to more

202
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
Production in the south but that was not what was ...

203
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,967
It was not at all on the map.
 Besides, we had very

204
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:07,551
Small price differences between the electricity areas in the first few years.

205
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,239
According to economic theory, of course it is so

206
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,951
that there should be more investment if the price is higher

207
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,535
But that was never a reason, but it was exclusively operational safety reasons.

208
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,117
We must be able to handle our bottlenecks

209
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,519
in order not to risk large power outages.
 When it is not possible to do only with counter -trading

210
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,767
Then only one electricity area division remains.

211
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,407
It also has a different point, namely that it is a fairly market economic

212
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,407
ways to handle the transmission constraints.

213
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,234
And really it is that the problem we have today,

214
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,367
We had the same in the 50s and 60s so we had our water production up the north

215
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,463
and problems to bring down the effect to southern Sweden and then we built

216
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,815
A number of power plants, Öresundsverket in Malmö, Karlshamn and Stenungssund

217
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,050
And basically drove drove daytime.

218
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,467
Then came nuclear power and then we removed them.
 Now we remove the nuclear power and have back the same

219
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:59,775
Problems we had at first.

220
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:06,017
But Germany has no such electricity areas, Finland has no such electricity areas.

221
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:09,450
What does Isabella Lövin think about this introduction?
 Was it so neat?

222
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,317
Thus, it is a lack of power generation

223
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,791
In the south today and there is a surplus in the north.

224
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
But that is today.

225
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
Now we see how industry ...

226
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,543
Those investments in green industry now explodes in the north so it does not

227
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,943
sure it is so smart to export this power to the south now without man

228
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,967
Need to expand the power to the south.

229
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,135
Although it was not an incentive from the beginning,

230
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,487
that this would be incentive to more power generation

231
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,095
In the south we have that situation today.

232
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,617
We have very much

233
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
Sea -based winds located on the government's table for example.

234
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:08,334
60 terawatt hours.
 We have very much

235
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:14,271
Even land -based wind power that today municipalities have refused to here in the south,

236
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
that more than well cover up for the closed,

237
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,207
suspended reactors.
 So that I think this mechanism

238
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,815
Also, it should work to the fact that we actually get more local production.

239
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,911
What does Lars say, how do you assess these electricity areas?

240
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,168
Do they work?
 There are many who are very critical of them,

241
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:36,517
Who would like to see that they disappeared completely.

242
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
How do you judge it?

243
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
I think they are quite reasonable.

244
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,687
You have to divide in some way and have them,

245
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
where one bids in your production and

246
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
Buy and sell electricity so I ...

247
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Then you can, after all,

248
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,159
one can certainly change that division, it depends on

249
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
If there is something specific you want to achieve with it.

250
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,500
But I think it is a reasonable approach at all,

251
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,850
provides incentives to increased production,

252
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,950
Provides incentives to flexibility as well.

253
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,017
You don't have to have the loose beard on you anymore it seems, in this gang anyway.

254
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:12,895
No, but you see that I have left it at home.

255
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:17,234
We need to expand production in SE4 but we actually do the opposite

256
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,584
So we have put down Sweden's most modern power plant that had the best

257
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,975
environmental performance, it is a rather sad story plus it was also

258
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,350
Our ability to implement hydrogen on a wide front.

259
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,850
Is it Öresundsverket in Malmö?

260
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,119
Yes.

261
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,191
And instead you can say that you should criticize it.

262
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,505
There are two levels and partly it is power reserve

263
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:44,100
But there are also preparedness dimensions around this so total defense stuff,

264
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:48,184
Where we happily invest a billion in Stockholm on a power plant that is 50 years old

265
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:52,517
While in Malmö we throw out one that is new and that is actually quite unreasonable.

266
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,400
Is it due to commercial grounds or political or administrative?

267
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,084
Commercial grounds can be said.

268
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,934
The problem was that they wanted to have paid because they were there as a reserve, so to speak.

269
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,567
Had they been lying on the other side of the strait they would have received quite a lot of money

270
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
in the Danish system.

271
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,935
Here they bidded to Svenska Kraftnät but you did not get it

272
00:16:18,935 --> 00:16:20,684
And then you had to close down.

273
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,319
Svenska Kraftnät would have no opportunity to trade up either of the simple

274
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:30,367
The reason that there is no special legislation on this reserve.

275
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,047
There, the Riksdag's successively reduced the scope of it.

276
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:44,184
We can certainly return a little to the electricity areas during the question time that we drive forward eight hours.

277
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:50,431
I want to get into what the energy mix should look like in Sweden in the future.
 Now we have

278
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
the moderately-led government and SD who presented their visions in the Tidö agreement

279
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
Which, after all, opens for new nuclear power.

280
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,717
400 billion in credit guarantees and new construction of nuclear power.

281
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,550
Is that a good idea Lars?

282
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
New nuclear power?

283
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
I think it will be too expensive.

284
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
It was a card ...

285
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,031
I think no one will want

286
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:22,334
Invest unless you give the right far -reaching subsidies.

287
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
The example is in England with Hinkley Point

288
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,750
that has an agreement on

289
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
in 30 or 35 years of age they shall deliver

290
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,400
For SEK 1 per cent per kWh, it is quite expensive.

291
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,250
In Finland, we have a power plant that has extracted a lot at the time.

292
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
It takes a long time to build new nuclear power.

293
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,367
17 years they have been there.

294
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
So it gets too expensive simply?

295
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
I think so,

296
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,567
There will be no investments for market -based grounds.

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,407
What does our second engineer believe?

298
00:17:53,663 --> 00:18:00,017
I think like this: that we can be much better than that.
 The other Swedish we built at 5-6 years each

299
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:05,179
And my attitude is that we will need just all the power we can get.

300
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:06,719
We need a healthy mix between

301
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,303
non-planning and planning and there I see that

302
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,084
Nuclear power has an important part to fill.

303
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,384
It is partly planned I would say.

304
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,184
If we are to say how planned, Svenska Kraftnät counts 9 % accessibility on wind power

305
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,871
And 90 on nuclear power so it is better.

306
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,984
But Lars J, when it is not planned, what makes it thrill then?

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,017
Is it when it gets too hot in the cooling water because of the summer heat?

308
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:39,743
It can be anything possible.
 In France Har you had the problems

309
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
now with the hot summer and lack of water,

310
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
lack of cooling water and

311
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
technical problems that arise as

312
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,667
We now have that Ringhals could not restart

313
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,823
And the other day I hicked up when Oskarshamn 3 went down.

314
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:02,117
So fortunately they got it up again fairly quickly but otherwise it would have been tight.

315
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
Lars describes that it gets too expensive, it's just like that but

316
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,967
You see a completely different opportunity.
 How do you get to it?

317
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:11,467
No, but I think like this

318
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,839
that the figures presented today because the production cost of new nuclear power is

319
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
Very optimistic.

320
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,184
So I don't think it will be as cheap as we think but at the same time

321
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:24,543
So we are short of other alternatives.

322
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,359
So we should not have to import,

323
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,400
in the future, fossil power

324
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,711
From other countries this is what applies.

325
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,000
And then maybe it should cost then?
 Or must be subsidized in some way.

326
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,223
No, but it will be bid as usual so I don't think

327
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,463
that it needs subsidized that way.

328
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Isabella then?

329
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,583
Yes, the name ...

330
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,935
This will not, firstly, solve the climate issue.

331
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,014
I think that has become quite painfully obvious to most

332
00:19:56,014 --> 00:19:57,567
the last few weeks here now that

333
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,407
If we do not have the climate policy that

334
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:08,319
Reduces emissions by 2030 so we have to abandon our climate goals so that the whole discussion around

335
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,384
nuclear power as a solution to the climate issue

336
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:17,279
have been severely misleading and it knows that everyone who knows something about

337
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,583
How long it takes to build new nuclear power.

338
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
So we can leave that like that.

339
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:27,519
Then the next question is: Okay, but we must have this planned power supply.

340
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
Then I think it is important that when issuing 400 billion in so -called

341
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,467
Green credit guarantees that you do it technology neutral.

342
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
We have all the possibilities

343
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
To use the entire innovation power that exists today in Sweden and in the world

344
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,351
To store energy, to stabilize the electricity grid and

345
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,167
Cut the peaks when it gets very expensive.

346
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,543
We can energy efficiency, we can have smart electricity grids

347
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,834
And it just bursts out of power in business right now.

348
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:10,015
I was in Estonia a few weeks ago

349
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,111
and there you plan for a huge

350
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:18,208
Pump water power battery can be said about a mining hole.

351
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:24,350
So when we are thinking of storage of energy we have mostly talked about making hydrogen

352
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,704
of electricity when is very cheap, when one has an excess of

353
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,008
wind or sun or hydropower

354
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,824
So there can even be negative prices in the market,

355
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:37,664
You can do a lot during that period.

356
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,064
One can produce green hydrogen and that is what industries in the north

357
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
has already invested in.

358
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
But there is too

359
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,696
A variety of other ways to do this.

360
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:57,184
If you looked at Agenda's debate yesterday, then one of the experts tells us that

361
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:03,520
There are sodium ion batteries, when we think batteries we think lithium and

362
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
"Okay, this is a deficiency".

363
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:10,400
But you are in full swing with making batteries with sodium.

364
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,050
We will return to them.

365
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:20,672
I mean that this with planned power, that nuclear power is the only answer to that,

366
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
It's simply wrong.

367
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,792
We stay in nuclear power.

368
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,584
Mikael, as old moderate, heavy politician,

369
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,417
How do you assess the future of nuclear power?

370
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
I think there is

371
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,800
Two problems that one should not deny.

372
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
That one is to

373
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,248
It is not so easy for a normally found capitalist to invest SEK 100 billion in a processing

374
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,317
Who will start to yield a return of 10-12 years in a market that you do not know what it looks like.

375
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:55,184
The second problem that one should also affirm it is to

376
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,840
As soon as you lose a screwdriver in the wrong place in a reactor somewhere in the world so added

377
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,850
It to new cost -driven safety requirements.

378
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:08,184
With that said, I think that

379
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,867
There are very bright prospects for the concept of small model reactors

380
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
where one could keep down the capital tied up,

381
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:20,576
where one might conceivably get a system of

382
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,904
serial production of these facilities and there is no doubt about

383
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,744
that new such nuclear power in southern Sweden would

384
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,784
Make the Swedish electrical system very well.

385
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,834
Then I am allergic

386
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:38,029
against this religious belief that not only energy -interested people have

387
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:40,767
As for what is good electricity generation

388
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:43,360
But unfortunately, has crept into politics as well.

389
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,456
Parties believe in certain types of electricity generation and against other kinds.

390
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,320
What I have advanced ever since I was an energy political spokesman for the Moderates

391
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
94-95,

392
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,634
And which unfortunately is forgotten now,

393
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,967
So it is that it is not the task of politics.

394
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,304
The task of politics is to ensure

395
00:24:03,084 --> 00:24:07,680
that electricity producers may meet the demand of electricity consumers

396
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,700
in a market that is as free as possible.

397
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:15,300
The Riksdag should not decide to turn off Barsebäck.

398
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:19,400
Parliament shall not decide to restart Ringhals 2

399
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,016
Without the Riksdag, the rules of the game,

400
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
the rules for the market

401
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,850
And that the market has to relate to.

402
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,950
Then we should not develop subsidies, but we should discontinue subsidies.

403
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:41,216
Magnus Genrup, this with SMR, small modular reactors, one can of course drop a

404
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,017
wrench in them as well.

405
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:45,568
There are the high security requirements, for every accident that occurs, they increase the requirements and

406
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
Of course.

407
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
Is that where you also see an opportunity?

408
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,793
No, I am personally not convinced that SMR is the right path

409
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,567
But it is something that has become popular and one believes that

410
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:58,624
will be cheaper but as I said,

411
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,232
You will need many SMRs and the question is whether it will be cheaper to build a large

412
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:06,534
And there I have not landed myself, I can say.

413
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,650
The logic of nuclear development has always been so -called shell economy,

414
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
So building bigger it will be cheaper.

415
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,600
Now you say that you should do the opposite.

416
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,760
I agree with Mikael in a lot of what you say, it can certainly go a little faster.

417
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,368
I am not very hopeful that one will be able to push down the costs

418
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
So awful much.

419
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,767
For it is still a reactor with

420
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,400
Pipes and generators and turbines and capacitors.

421
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,120
But significantly less than a conventional?

422
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
A little less yes.

423
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:47,200
And maybe 60 years of operating time so it's a good time to pay off.

424
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:54,432
It is very important to inform people that there is no country that has SMRs.

425
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,267
There is no series production of these small nuclear reactors.

426
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:04,867
That we will get this scale advantage then we must start

427
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
bring with us a very bunch of countries on wanting

428
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,792
Very many SMRs.

429
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
Then one will also come

430
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
Problem to into the picture

431
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,912
And that is the availability of uranium.

432
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,288
So today, the existing mines and assets that exist

433
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,000
They will last between 50 and 100 years it says on Vattenfall's website.

434
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,920
We say 80 years then.

435
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,016
If we see a doubling of investment in nuclear power around the world

436
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,576
yes, but then we will end up uranium about

437
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,123
40 years and then we have to start looking for new assets.

438
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:38,720
Then maybe we have to start thinking: "Well, but then we have to

439
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:45,120
secure a national access to uranium "and start breaking again in Sweden and then

440
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
Do we know that there is

441
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,496
Assets on Österlen for example.
 Do we want it?

442
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:55,334
I mean, this is no quick fix.
 This is nothing easy

443
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
to invest in nuclear power.

444
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,016
That SMR does not exist, every submarine has one

445
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:08,386
slightly larger variety, even a number of Russian nuclear submarines so technology is there,

446
00:27:08,386 --> 00:27:11,400
It is not that it is brand new.

447
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,817
But there are security aspects of that too.

448
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:17,376
Now think if we had 10 SMR placed around Kiev,

449
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
No height.

450
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,960
Nah.

451
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,520
Is it an aspect that has become

452
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:28,384
More important or more acute Mikael?
 Thus purely security policy aspects of

453
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,650
Nuclear power plants as targets in war?

454
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:34,528
Yes, it is clear now that we have a war and

455
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:42,208
battles around the nuclear power plants in Ukraine, it is clear that it puts an increased focus on

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,767
That aspect, of course it is.

457
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:52,617
But I don't think it disqualifies nuclear power.

458
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,616
But you still have to weigh.
 Now we have applications that are rejected by

459
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
Municipality by municipality

460
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,504
on wind power that corresponds to approximately all of Sweden's production.

461
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,112
We have one side, on the other hand we have a technology that

462
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:16,512
We have no economist whatsoever of today, we have just approved

463
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
Final repository for

464
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,376
the fuel or for the waste,

465
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,960
But it is only enough for the existing nuclear power we have today.

466
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,544
If we start to scale this up then we will have new waste laws.

467
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:31,616
We must ensure uranium from somewhere.

468
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:35,712
We just said no to uranium from Russia which is a big

469
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,808
exporter out of uranium to

470
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,136
Lots of countries.
 It is another such security policy

471
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:46,976
problem.
 I mean we shouldn't ...

472
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:53,888
It has really been portrayed in this electoral movement as something completely safe and

473
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
reliable and cheap.

474
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,017
It is wrong on all points.

475
00:28:58,017 --> 00:29:01,140
Magnus, I don't want to put on the total nuclear power

476
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,848
But you still have to try to respond to that.

477
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:08,224
No, but of course we have to solve the waste problem.
 There is no doubt about it.

478
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:12,832
But the reactors of the future, the generation beyond those we are talking about today

479
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:15,392
will generate less waste.

480
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:16,928
Absolutely.

481
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,232
So it can resolve that way?

482
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
Partly.

483
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,096
Back to the task of politics, I mean

484
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,912
Svenska Kraftnät today has an investment program on

485
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
75 billion as they call north -south

486
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,750
Reinforce the transfer from north to south.

487
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,967
The problem is that if Hybrit and O2 Green style are really realized,

488
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,944
You know nothing about that then maybe that electricity is needed up there.

489
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,504
How do we solve the situation?

490
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,784
Yes, then it's all about getting large amounts of electricity

491
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,160
In southern Sweden and what should the government do?

492
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:54,767
Yes, it is reasonably to eliminate obstacles to investment, create a nutrition -friendly climate.

493
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:58,405
What one is very focused to do when it comes to nuclear power,

494
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:02,200
Remove the restrictions for where to build and how much you can build.

495
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,935
But we have similar problems in the investment climate

496
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:06,592
In terms of land -based wind power,

497
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
closest to the municipal veto.

498
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,736
One may very well have a municipal veto

499
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:17,550
But then you have to rig it on such a investment so that invests

500
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
not first get yes and then get no five in twelve

501
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,636
And then finally you need to create an investment climate

502
00:30:22,636 --> 00:30:24,768
For sea -based wind power that is

503
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,017
The stroke of power where we could quickly get very large amounts of electricity.

504
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:34,325
There is no arranged process today at all

505
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:37,312
And the new government has also stoked to it further.

506
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
Let's take wind power because, as I said, there are a number, seven large projects

507
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,016
of sea -based wind power waiting for

508
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,160
Permissions and the process and the new government and the Tidö Agreement have then decided to

509
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:58,560
Place the connection cost to the companies themselves just like maybe on other types of energy before

510
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,096
The former government, you know everything about,

511
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,167
have said that the state would subsidize or account for that cost.

512
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:08,288
What does this change mean?
 Is it sticks in the wheel for the wind power Lars?

513
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,616
I don't think it needs to be a huge change.

514
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,944
It is a connection cable that needs to be built.

515
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
It is longer than that?

516
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
No, but I thought ...

517
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,384
Sure, then either Svenska Kraftnät can stand for the cost or sheep

518
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,232
The projector is responsible for the cost.

519
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,017
Finally, it is the customer collective that pays somewhere.

520
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
So it's more how to post it.

521
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
So in Denmark

522
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,912
Do you have exactly that arrangement,

523
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,700
that is, it is the projector as self

524
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,264
pays for the connection

525
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,467
And they think they are great.

526
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:42,600
They take it out on the electricity price later.

527
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,664
Yes, because Ørsted thinks we can build

528
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,700
Cheaper than their network companies can.

529
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,880
But I was going to say to Mikael.

530
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Well, it's a debate!

531
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,560
No, but I think that if you need the electricity in the north then you should expand wind power in the north

532
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,617
too and those in this

533
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:13,312
The Hybrid project, for example, they are set to the fact that it is cheap wind power that will drive their

534
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:14,336
processes so that they

535
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:18,944
Dimensions electrolyzers and hydrogen layers just before matching against wind power.

536
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,992
All my point is to

537
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,600
the entire tool image radically changes when you consume so much up there

538
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,051
And in a few years, like the conditions for Svenska Kraftnät's

539
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:31,488
Planning was actually eliminated.

540
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:35,534
It may not be invested so much in this transformation at all.

541
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Then when it comes to

542
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
Wind power is that

543
00:32:39,434 --> 00:32:42,240
When the government introduced this

544
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,517
The assignment to Svenska Kraftnät to establish connection points at sea so there were many

545
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,688
who had objections to it in the referral round not just the bourgeois parties

546
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,017
And the Swedish Democrats, but also some authorities as the Swedish Competition Authority.

547
00:32:54,017 --> 00:32:55,900
That you treat differently?

548
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,904
Yes, one had in principle objection that it could partly be perceived as a subsidy

549
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:03,744
to that kind of electricity generation.

550
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,352
This is type example on when politicians are to be sensible

551
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,656
for there they would have left short lying

552
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,728
and said: “Good that they introduced that because we had never been able to do it with our

553
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,312
Principal attitude but now we leave shortly lying ".

554
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,584
You did not and it creates then

555
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:27,296
New ambiguities about investment conditions again, there is no organized process.

556
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,136
Investors in offshore wind power, those behind this seven applications,

557
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,184
they were assumed

558
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,540
Invest SEK 10 million in bottom surveys,

559
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,072
planning without having any rush about

560
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,632
they will ultimately get the necessary permits.

561
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:47,264
This is hydropower that corresponds to all current nuclear power

562
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,824
And it is sad if it gets delayed.

563
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,691
There are very large amounts of energy,

564
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:55,456
Still with the major disadvantage that it is weather dependent.

565
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,320
So that a combo of sea -based wind that could be in place,

566
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,136
If the permits, worked before 2030

567
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:07,488
and new nuclear power that could be in place before 2035

568
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,024
Would be an excellent mix.

569
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,517
Magnus.

570
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:16,960
There I agree too, that mix.
 Then there is a dimension that is important, it is

571
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
Total defense dimension.

572
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:23,559
We cannot start the country with wind power if we were to get a big disorder.

573
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,408
We need a real production

574
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,968
With real turning mass in the system.

575
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
You like turbines?

576
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,900
Yes, what you say is that wind power can deliver turning mass,

577
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,184
Yes if it blows but it does not blow then there is no swinging mass.

578
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:41,317
Is the real foundation nuclear power or cogeneration?

579
00:34:41,317 --> 00:34:43,406
Cogeneration in principle,

580
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,869
It doesn't have to be nuclear power,

581
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:47,680
There may be other generators but we need the right foundation in the system.

582
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:55,360
No, but I agree very much what Mikael says except that I don't think

583
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,750
It is just nuclear power ...

584
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:57,517
Not?!

585
00:34:57,517 --> 00:35:01,984
No!
 Surprising!
 But this particular with permit processes

586
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:08,160
And how you have been messing with it now and it seems to be almost ideological reluctance

587
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,996
against us having renewable energy because you have locked up so incredibly

588
00:35:11,996 --> 00:35:14,767
With this with nuclear power in the current government.

589
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,144
You even voted no, ie it applies

590
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
This municipal veto that Mikael mentioned

591
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:26,567
So it is so that the municipalities can say no to new wind power

592
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,128
But not only

593
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:32,450
At the beginning of the process, you can say no when there is a shift if,

594
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
let us say

595
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,344
A member of the City Council changes page

596
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,421
So all of a sudden one turns in opinion on this wind power investment

597
00:35:41,421 --> 00:35:43,744
And suddenly you don't want it anymore.

598
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,072
At any time in the process, this can happen.

599
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:55,934
So it is not for any other establishment of anything else in Sweden, just for wind power.

600
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,134
It is clear that it gives extremely high doubts for those who are going to invest in it,

601
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,480
Uncertainty that it can turn around at any time.

602
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:10,567
And it is also very contradictory when the same parties,

603
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,917
When we had one

604
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,267
Completed proposal presented for the Riksdag this summer

605
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,352
So voted

606
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,216
These nowadays the Tidö parties no to this because you ...

607
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,568
Yes, there was no good explanation as to why you voted no, you just voted no to

608
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,968
To abolish this extended opportunity to change, to say no at the end of the process.

609
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,784
What do the engineers say about the municipal vetot

610
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,084
Who can mess with it for both wind power and other facilities?

611
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,184
Yes, we are not experts on really

612
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,256
Maybe but of course ....

613
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,817
You can appoint national interest and change such things.

614
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,144
I would call that one

615
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
Political question where I have no ...

616
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
But I have a question for Magnus.

617
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
You are welcome.

618
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,568
Won't be, you say nuclear power,

619
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:05,152
If we can get very cheap wind or solar,

620
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,736
cannot be cheaper to make electrolysis hydrogen

621
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
Methanol

622
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
and then back in

623
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
Nice gas turbines for electricity.

624
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
One loses half of the energy on the road

625
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
But they can still be cheaper than nuclear power.

626
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
In principle, one can say like this that

627
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,168
Do we talk 1000 operating hours a year

628
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,496
So we are at 2.50 kW per hour approximately

629
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,032
in that production.

630
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:35,544
It may be worth it.

631
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,803
On that kind of production do you mean?

632
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,342
Unfortunately it is so that you only get a quarter when you drive back

633
00:37:42,342 --> 00:37:44,800
So it's a big pin on the road.

634
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,880
It all is based on the fact that

635
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:50,720
We have a surplus of wind production that we do not need here and now.

636
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:55,617
If we are also going to double our cargo in the country, the question is whether this electricity will not go.

637
00:37:55,617 --> 00:37:59,117
I don't know that but still,

638
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,382
The efficiency back and forth is very, very bad.

639
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,800
You mentioned hydropower before, pump power.

640
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,384
It's so much more elegant really.

641
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:13,504
There you talk about getting 85 % efficiency and it is very good, and this one at 25, at best.

642
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,576
I think that question is very relevant

643
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,416
But it would be good if it was not answered by professors or politicians

644
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
Without the investors.

645
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
We have a consumption today at somewhere around 140 terawatt hours and according to calculation

646
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,700
In a few years, 2030, we will be up at 220 and 320 in 2045

647
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:43,917
So it is like a steep increase in our needs if we are to electrify this country of the future

648
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,500
And then a mix is required, I guess?

649
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:52,160
No, but they are the forecasts vary.
 The Swedish Energy Agency

650
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:57,024
says much less than that and one should remember that 1970

651
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,376
So did you think that 2000 would have the least

652
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,168
twice as large energy needs

653
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,704
in Sweden

654
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,000
and we've actually been just lying still

655
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:12,350
All the time since then, despite increased population, despite a huge growth.

656
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,385
So energy efficiency is also a very important instrument

657
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:18,784
As we have not mentioned here at all.

658
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:26,950
But now think the last month when Swedish households have reduced their electricity.

659
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
by almost 20 %

660
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,067
Without even we even had a campaign that we should.

661
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:37,472
The industry is usually said to have about 25 % the possibility of energy efficiency.

662
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,104
Now it will go to huge amounts of electricity in the north to Hybris to H2

663
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,152
Style and all these.

664
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
We know that.

665
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
But I also see that

666
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,808
There is a huge innovation force in

667
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,136
How to also want to rig these systems.

668
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,744
Again storage is something we have not mentioned much.

669
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,517
Should we have nuclear power plants or small nuclear power plants

670
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,168
that should go all the time to cut the tops

671
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,960
When it is not blowing?

672
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
When we could, on the other hand

673
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
have huge energy storage in old mining holes, battery storage, hydrogen,

674
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,736
Methane, all this you are talking about now.

675
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,832
We are going to the future, we will not be back.

676
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,231
Lars, as an engineer if you met, now they are former politicians

677
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,256
But if you got to meet the responsible politicians, what would you advise them for something?

678
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,800
What should the mix look like?
 What is the most important thing to think about?

679
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,704
I would probably go on Michael's line rather there,

680
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,544
that they should try to create stable conditions,

681
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
A game plan

682
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,152
so market players know they can trust

683
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,712
block -crossing agreements.

684
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,576
It may contain space and conditions for

685
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
Plan for nuclear power

686
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:03,950
And then you will see if the investors go on that ball or not.

687
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,096
Personally I am not so hopeful that you will be able to push the costs

688
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,632
But I don't exclude it.

689
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Magnus and then Mikael.

690
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:15,200
It is also true that Swedish cogeneration that is the base in district heating

691
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,567
Is pretty bad at producing electricity on the heat substrate.

692
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:21,664
It is fully sensible because we have had low electricity prices but

693
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,016
We could build so much better and more efficient facilities

694
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
With tremendously more electricity generation than we do today.

695
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
And they are driven by?

696
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,368
Biomass.

697
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,400
So it's good production in that moon.

698
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,304
I was involved a little bit in the last Energy Commission's work and it came

699
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,328
From 2016.

700
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,864
At that time

701
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:47,200
Then, like still, Northvolt and Hydbrids were not on the map so that

702
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:51,084
The Swedish Energy Agency's estimates of electricity consumption 2030 to 2040

703
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:53,600
Be quite modest.

704
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
Now all of a sudden it is doubled.

705
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,734
It has then happened in 5-6 years.

706
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,317
It indicates that an important task and

707
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,879
And politics is quite different.

708
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
Namely to shorten the lead times

709
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:09,767
to build new power generation and to build new transmission.

710
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:14,850
It takes 10-12 years to build a 400 kW power line, from ax to limp.

711
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:16,959
It goes half as fast in Finland.

712
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,823
There is very much to do here.
 Politics has begun to take hold of it

713
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,639
But there is much left to do.
 We need radically

714
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,431
Short these times.

715
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,354
Should we check if anyone in the audience feels urged to comment

716
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:34,111
anything of this or setting a

717
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:39,383
Ask and you are welcome to signal, raise a paw.

718
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,815
If you run forward here we have a man in light blue shirt

719
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,350
Who wipes the second row, you are kind.

720
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:51,717
I can add that if I had met politicians then I would probably have given a little lecture

721
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,283
About nuclear power that I usually give at LTH.

722
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,383
There seems to be a lot of ignorance ...

723
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
In politics?

724
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,881
Yes.

725
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,247
Briefly introduce yourself and a short question.

726
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Hi, Torben Claesson.

727
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,050
I live out in Veberöd in Lund municipality.

728
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,767
Out in Veberöd it is 70s villas that are bad

729
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,733
Isolated and electrically heated the entire gang.

730
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:18,067
After all, we are badly forced to turn off the electricity and go and freeze in there.

731
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:24,767
So when you say that electricity consumption decreases it does because we cannot afford to pay the bills.

732
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,567
And I wonder,

733
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,507
What do politicians intend to do about this?
 Should we go and freeze the hedge of us and get

734
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,967
Mold problems with the house

735
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,759
And allergies and that?

736
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,855
I would have liked to see more action and less talk.

737
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,383
Build something, God knows what,

738
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,975
Just so we get power in the wires again.

739
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,583
Thank you.
 Now we do not have active politicians here but Isabella feels anyway ...

740
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,239
Thanks.
 First, the EU has agreed that

741
00:43:55,263 --> 00:44:01,683
one should save 5% electricity during the hours it is highest

742
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:06,271
Load in each Member State and energy researcher counts on it and says that

743
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,599
With only the little savings

744
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,671
So the electricity bills will be halved.

745
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,463
So it's amazing.

746
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,559
But then we need more

747
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:20,607
Electricity production in southern Sweden.

748
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:24,933
I mean, again, we have a total production

749
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,983
In Sweden at 140 terawatt.

750
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:32,350
125 terawatt has been said no to in moderately led municipalities at

751
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
land and sea-based wind.

752
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:40,267
So then you just get a new power, so that you have to think about that situation.

753
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,415
Magnus Genrup, speaking of this with being afraid of

754
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,023
That it will be extinguished and such, you told me that at a given time, you

755
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
pretty recently,

756
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,345
Fixed a diesel aggregate at home.

757
00:44:53,345 --> 00:44:56,703
Yes, in the middle of Lund I have a diesel unit so I can go off the grid with my house.

758
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
How did you think then?

759
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:04,267
That I have worked with power plants since 94 around the world.

760
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:08,991
I have seen such here in Pakistan, India, Africa and Indonesia.

761
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,831
But the idea in Lund was completely absurd from the beginning but then,

762
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,927
This with manual connection is a bad idea and then it became so.

763
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:21,717
But you judge it as a

764
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:26,399
Possible risk or possibility that you need to connect it one night or day?

765
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,983
Would we trade in something called mfk

766
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,643
So is it that there is a return load that communicates and handles the risk

767
00:45:34,643 --> 00:45:36,717
with secondary interruptions, they are

768
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,663
I thought about the most.

769
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,017
Do you invite your colleagues home then?

770
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,991
Yes, and neighbors.

771
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:47,583
I have my own steering list that includes the coffee maker as well.

772
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:51,683
You can also put some solar cells on the roof and get a battery.

773
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,767
But then I can't secure tension.

774
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,600
I belong to those who do not

775
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,471
thinks it is very wise and foresight policy that

776
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,591
with parliamentary decisions try to compensate for the swings in the world market prices on

777
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,591
Oil and gas.

778
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
At the same time

779
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,233
If this is a little neighbor a unique situation.

780
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,879
And then I think it is right to use these capacity fees,

781
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,917
The bottleneck revenue they are commonly called.

782
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,750
55 billion.

783
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,303
Yes, they are generated by the price differences between the electricity areas

784
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
and accumulated at Svenska Kraftnät

785
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:32,857
To be used for investments that build the bottlenecks away

786
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:35,007
that has generated the price differences but it will take a long time

787
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:39,359
And then I think it is reasonable, it is probably 80-90 billion that has accumulated there,

788
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,151
then tag thinks it is reasonable that one

789
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,711
in one way or another re -resign

790
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
to consumers so that one can

791
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:50,367
Protect those who happen to be the most bad, both in the industry and

792
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,383
Those with electrically heated detached houses.

793
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,535
But it is important that the return is done with some accuracy.

794
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,375
Here it seems that things are going fast rather than right.

795
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,679
Many industries have after all

796
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:10,079
bound agreements and such and may be overcompensated when you are just putting

797
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
50 öre per kw.

798
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:17,025
What does Isabella Lövin say about the bottle neck money that is now being repaid to customers?

799
00:47:17,025 --> 00:47:18,015
Are these the correct signals?

800
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,583
So I think it's just right

801
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,333
Take back the money that ...

802
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:29,791
After all, this prism mechanism has, as Mikael described,

803
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,327
that this is like a commodity market

804
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,417
There is the highest price is what sets the price of everything, even what is very produced,

805
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:37,215
Very cheap.

806
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:42,591
So 55 billion is great.
 But it is clear that it cuts in the heart that it does not go to such as

807
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:47,417
In fact, can remove the crisis, but we go back to those like us.

808
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,015
You can buy your

809
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,599
diesel units for the money maybe but

810
00:47:55,391 --> 00:48:01,535
It would be better if we could bet them on a safe climate change for example

811
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,095
or energy efficient action

812
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,447
So that we save energy.
 Especially what is concerned it is, after all

813
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:12,250
that if you send signals to all people to, yes but,

814
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:16,467
It does not matter, you will be compensated for this on the electricity bill

815
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:18,687
Then no one saves energy.
 In this

816
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,015
emergency situation and again, this is about

817
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,599
That the supply of Russian gas has been strangled, it is gone.

818
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,903
It has led to very, very high

819
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:34,047
Will in Germany, among other things, to buy electricity from Sweden that exports.

820
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:39,200
It is the highest price that sets the price of everything, that is the problem.

821
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,467
If we look at what the electricity costs to produce,

822
00:48:42,467 --> 00:48:46,335
hydropower is about 10 öre kilowatt hour, nuclear power approximately

823
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,639
35-40 öre kilowatt hour.

824
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,479
So to some extent, the hit award is all.

825
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,831
The problem is also like this, pose that this persists so we have to

826
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,927
take the bottleneck revenue for a number of years and pay back to

827
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,487
Us so that we get reasonable electricity bills.

828
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:07,583
It is fundamentally wrong and then at the same time we have

829
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,191
VAT and tax revenue that this year will be approximately SEK 47 billion to the Treasury.

830
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,775
So that somewhere we have to do something else.
 Either look at it

831
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,895
or the pricing model because we can't put back the bottle throat all the time,

832
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,199
Over time, how should we handle this?

833
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,500
So, I have a hard time seeing ...

834
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,087
I think you are wrong, Isabella, there.

835
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,647
I think you save electricity

836
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,183
Although you know that you will receive compensation.

837
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,071
This is exactly what we have seen with households in southern Sweden that have actually saved 20%.

838
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,600
Then it is a blunt tool and man

839
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
Prioritizes that it should go fast.

840
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,287
There are household customers who have tied electricity prices coming

841
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,567
Earn good at this too.

842
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:56,479
But then when there is a lack of firewood, you get crank radio, it is a completely different kind of consciousness

843
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:00,831
among customers or consumers now as we see that makes us start

844
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,383
Save and streamline?
 Although we think we should be compensated?

845
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
Yes, I think so.

846
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,487
You can't count on

847
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:11,071
to be compensated with certainty.
 Those who counted to get ten

848
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,631
Tighten cheaper diesel at pump ...

849
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:18,751
Or not.

850
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:28,735
But this situation then at last as we have with concern, high electricity prices, power shortages,

851
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:35,317
Sinks very badly with the high-flying plans with a fossil-free future-Sweden,

852
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,951
electrified from north to south

853
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
With Northvolt

854
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
And hydride and everything it is.

855
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,067
Can we get out of that lock?

856
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,133
We have a great starting point

857
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,215
and with new nuclear power

858
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,775
and large -scale sea -based wind power,

859
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,823
4-5 miles outside

860
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,633
the coast, beyond the municipal veto purely geographically,

861
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,271
so we get a emission -free electrical system

862
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
And then the climate issue becomes for us

863
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,133
Completely focused on the transport sector.

864
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
Isabella.

865
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:17,983
Yes, so we basically already have a, to some extent, a emission -free electrical system and it is important to

866
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:23,007
Build on it and it is important to build for the future so that it is also smart.

867
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,583
It includes energy efficiency, it includes smart

868
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,683
Control systems, it includes storage and storage capacity.

869
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:36,500
It will also be a service that you can pay for.

870
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,500
And demand flexibility, absolutely.

871
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:46,267
So I don't see any major problems at all.
 What I see as the great threat to this,

872
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:50,064
It is that you are now so fixated on building new nuclear power

873
00:51:50,064 --> 00:51:51,935
That you put a stop to everything else.

874
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,467
One sends very strong signals about

875
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:58,079
That we should not have sea -based wind power, now you get

876
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:03,350
Invest themselves in these connection fees.
 You veto to get ground -based ...

877
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:07,067
And do not invest in storage and smart electrical systems, ie plan for it.

878
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:09,599
We have to plan for such a system.

879
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,900
Now you are planning for SMRs that do not even exist

880
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,463
and there

881
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,815
prices will be so high so it can make the industry hesitate in

882
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:25,215
to invest in these processes that will require huge amounts of electricity that need to be

883
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:25,983
Very cheap.

884
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,055
And that is what can put obstacles in the way.

885
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:34,431
Energiforsk presents the figure 56 öre kW, should we believe them?

886
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:40,063
Energiforsk has presented the figure 56 öre per kilowatt hour.

887
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,111
IPCC says 1.50.

888
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,647
On what energy then?

889
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,517
Energy body.

890
00:52:45,517 --> 00:52:46,017
Small, small modular ...

891
00:52:46,017 --> 00:52:49,017
For nuclear power plants?
 Okay.

892
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:56,700
But what do they say about renewable energy with the full system cost?

893
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:00,833
I don't remember the figures but the report is available.

894
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:01,833
Sea -based wind is in the same piece.

895
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:05,100
Okay, not get stuck to those numbers but then Lars then, at the time,

896
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,431
Now you heard Isabellas

897
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,733
Problem description there, is it so bleak?

898
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
No, so I think ...

899
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:16,617
As Mikael started with Sweden having fantastic conditions with existing

900
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,385
Hydropower, bioenergy, good wind conditions.

901
00:53:19,385 --> 00:53:23,071
We can build solar cells, we can even build solar cells in the Arctic.

902
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
It can be interesting

903
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,399
If we have the basic industry up there.

904
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,959
So all conditions exist

905
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,751
So I think like this:

906
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,359
Now it is war and a fairly acute energy crisis.

907
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
I also think you get

908
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:43,233
have some ice in the stomach and think that it worked pretty well just a year ago

909
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,599
and maybe not tear up everything

910
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
in affection.

911
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:56,033
With the words from Lars J Nilsson who is a professor of environmental and energy systems here in Lund

912
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,952
So we end debate in Lund here.

913
00:53:57,952 --> 00:54:01,215
Thanks to you Lars, thanks to Magnus Genrup, Isabella Lövin

914
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,263
and Mikael Odenberg and to all of you as

915
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,799
come here tonight and all of you as

916
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
followed us via screen

917
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
And TV and so on.

918
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,383
Many thanks!
