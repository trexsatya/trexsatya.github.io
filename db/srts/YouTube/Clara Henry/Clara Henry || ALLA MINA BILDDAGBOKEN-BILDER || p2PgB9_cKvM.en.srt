00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:03,375
Hello!
 Do you know what I have done?
 I have downloaded all

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:06,895
My old pictures from the picture diary.
 All!

3
00:00:06,895 --> 00:00:07,895
Holly ...

4
00:00:09,535 --> 00:00:10,535
... cow!

5
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:14,285
Forgive in advance that the light changes a lot.
 It's a lot of clouds

6
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:17,105
And the sun outside.
 You who are my age - a little -,

7
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:20,085
I am 23 - you will probably have well -to -do

8
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:23,445
Colorful memories of the picture diary.
 You who may be a little younger

9
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:25,665
Maybe not at all know what the picture diary is.

10
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:28,315
However, maybe dayviews call a small clock?

11
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:31,325
I had the picture diary between 2007 and 2010

12
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:33,320
So isch from being 12 until I was 16.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,500
You could say that the picture diary was the Instagram of the time.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,260
Although you were not as selective with what pictures you draw.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,120
It was not uncommon for you to go for a school day,

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,700
Take Kamran, Foot Type 50 Photos,

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,020
Get home and upload everyone on the picture diary.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,080
You had no barrier there.

19
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,280
Or was it so because I went in seven?

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,500
Anyway, the picture diary which is nowadays called Dayviews will close down.

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,440
Dayviews, the picture diary will not be advanced anymore.
 ... there will be no more I mean hi hi hi

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,900
So that's why I went in and saved every picture from 2007 to 2010.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,460
And today I thought we would look at them.

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,240
A, what do you say?
 I say we can start.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,080
Ok, first picture.
 Huh.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,440
Hello and welcome to my picture diary from 2006 through - I lied to you.

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,520
August 16, 2006. Here I am 12 years old.

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,360
Here you also get a hint of what a fantastic taste I had in decor.

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,440
From being a kid, I had pink walls with big rabbit stickers like a board.

30
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,140
12-year-old Clara thought "No. That is baby wallpaper. Now I'm a big girl. Now I want other wallpaper.

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,840
Check this out!
 Lime green wallpaper with such large pink flowers.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,500
Fy fuck.
 If you easily get sick then you do not want to be in my old room.

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,780
On the other hand, pink and lime green were my favorite colors.
 I had to choose wallpaper all by myself.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,860
Mama thought it was a bit crisp and encouraged me to choose this.

35
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,180
Since I also raised in a family that does not have so much money.
 So the next time I tapyaized about my room then I was 18.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,020
It was fun to bring so cool gymnies or the first date home.

37
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,920
What else do we have?
 Hohohoho.
 Creshing brills.

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,720
13 years I am here.
 I have long hair and I have started to get quite a lot of pimples.

39
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,300
So my whole forehead was like a small hot tub.

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,380
I remember once when a girl in the class, so damn good, but she just like this:

41
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,180
"Ah Clara, you have something in the forehead."

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,840
And I thought inboard:

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,400
Ah I know.
 Unfortunately, I can't just remove them.

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
And I then answered aloud:

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,000
"I know. My cat tore me."

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,660
Kungiiiiii

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,060
Ooooohoooooheho

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,940
Selfie session.
 Here I am 13 years old.

49
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,680
Don't have as much pimples.
 It may have been for periods.
 I do not remember.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,120
And it is also my acid, Kimberly who is 11.

51
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,740
I don't really know what to say about this picture.
 I also do not know what it is we are looking at.

52
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,820
Because at this time you had like ... you couldn't see yourself in the camera.

53
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,860
At the same time, we are and we are very aware that we are footing ourselves.

54
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,160
It is a mystery.

55
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,160
And that is so bad.

56
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,160
I also thought I was pretty good at it.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,800
Here I have made a little, a little more tan in the skin.
 K. got red hair and I got brown hair.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,940
We have both got brown eyes.
 We also got whose little Kajallinije.

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,580
I mourn a little that I still can't photoshop.
 I could have learned quite well.

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,200
What do we have?
 ... oooohhhh.

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,000
AAAAAA.
 This is a bit cute.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,360
God what a little.

63
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,140
This was also the period where everyone was forties.
 Except me.

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,760
Everyone had bleached their hair white.
 Everyone had so here tupped

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,720
Brown cream

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,320
Remember Those Days?
 Ah God, I wasn't cool.

67
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,880
Here I am on my way to a Fridrot competition.
 I jumped height and ran heck.

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,160
A, sweet.

69
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,340
Ahhh for cute pictures.

70
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,480
To all 13 year olds: It gets better.

71
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,040
So puberty met me like a frisbee.

72
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,660
In the back of a frisbee golf course.
 Eij.

73
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,100
There are 13 -year -olds today who go up in the morning and make up it full and then go to school.

74
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,700
This girl did not.
 This girl had never even heard of hair spray.

75
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,140
Fun that you are not a teenager anymore.

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,100
Yyyyyyy

77
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,100
My mind and interest in fashion have still kicked in.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,095
Lime green Winter Jacket.
 Again the favorite color.

79
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:28,125
And then we match it with an Aik cap.

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,060
Did I know what AIK was?
 No.

81
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,040
Did I watch football?
 No.

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,940
Which team am I on?
 Sweden.

83
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,940
I tried.
 So cool I was.

84
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,500
Do you remember what I said if everyone else were forties?
 Everyone else had so tufted hair, push-up bra, started drinking.

85
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,080
I was doing this.

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,440
Oh my good ... no what is this?

87
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,780
Charming.

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,880
Oh good.
 I think I've been like the definition of White Trash when I was 13.

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,160
I mean I was pretty cute when I was a kid.

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,560
???

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Ment the years in between?

92
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,440
Can you like to see there in the background?
 Do you see what comes flying?

93
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,580
Yes, it is puberty like a fucking truck.

94
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,060
A. Nice stuff.

95
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,580
No but check!
 Here I am at a Fridrot competition.

96
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,440
From the time I was twelve to being 18, I jumped high jump.
 And I burned for it.
 I loved high jump.

97
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,060
Please note the little tongue here.

98
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,880
I couldn't skip the bar without pray ...

99
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,620
This is Stockholm.
 Please note the large Clara grill here and then there is a owed where Clara stands here.

100
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,460
And then Papa thought: "Clara, now we have to take a picture."

101
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,380
What else do we have?
 Oh good God what is it?

102
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,140
I remember we sat and played mit you know with such IQ-test-Puzzle,

103
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,540
All pieces look different and so will get it together into a square.

104
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,780
We took these pieces and I threw them up in the air and my sister photographed when they fall down.

105
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,980
And then I would kind of look a little funny.

106
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,820
I look like a five year old on crack type.

107
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,160
Just that, I had an answer period too.

108
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,440
I never think I talked about it but I thought high school was a very difficult period.

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,140
In short, my friend and I had a brawl, and it was so much bigger than it had to be.

110
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,400
And our parents pulled in and we stopped socializing.

111
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,740
And then I realized like this "Shit, she is kind of my only friend that I like to spend time with."

112
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,540
Then I have other friends in the class but I do not spend time with them.

113
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,740
And suddenly I was like this.

114
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,260
And like that had no friends outside the school.
 And it was really hard.

115
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,520
And then started taking these pictures that I thought showed how I felt.

116
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,300
This was also at the time there as well as such emo pictures

117
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,780
There ... they were either far too overexposed or undexoned was trendy.

118
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,780
I would like to belong to emo.

119
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,020
Here is also fun.
 This is the day before I turn 15.

120
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,220
And as we all know, it's a team of having a helmet when cycling and when you under 15.

121
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,500
And this is a pretty grinding description of how strong my teenage revolution was.

122
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,580
Non-existent.

123
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
When I was 15 I thought it was fun with - A but it way too bright in here -

124
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,480
Thought it was a bit cool to take some artsy photographs.

125
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
The caption is: "I don't know who I am."

126
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,840
* sings* "I don't know who I am but I know I'm yours"

127
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,880
Here I have come second and third in some district championship I believe.

128
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,160
I think I have come second in high jump and third in hedge running.

129
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,920
Wooo, here I cut my hair short, God.
 This is right at the beginning of nine.
 And I cut off my hair.

130
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,640
This was the first picture I took on my hair too when I was on my way home from the hairdresser.

131
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,260
After all, it's not really a nice frill.

132
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
Again: Hair products.

133
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,060
In with some shit.

134
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,540
Because now it just hangs there, Clara, I asked it.

135
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,960
It was probably the same day when just cut it.
 The snelog was fucking my best friend through high school.

136
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,820
I loved this hairstyle so hard.
 It was damn the best thing I did when I was 16.

137
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,280
Again: Artsy image.
 Black and white.

138
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,300
This was also when you started drawing mustaches on their fingers and prayed

139
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,140
Frock coat!
 Sacre Coeur!
 Je Suis Francaise!
 Come over here and kiss my French lips!

140
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,900
Not this a frill that type all image teachers have?

141
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,220
Myyyy.
 Check!

142
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,440
Also a hairstyle that is a bit on growth.

143
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,200
Damn.
 I see the uncertainty in my gaze.

144
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,780
Did not like being in the picture at that time.
 Little did I know that I would live on putting videos on myself on the internet.

145
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,580
If I had known it, I would have received heart fibrillation.

146
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,740
Friends, these were all pictures.

147
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,940
Now I have not shown it all because I have so very boring pictures on my picture diary.

148
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,380
But this was easy and most interesting.
 But still fun.
 Imagine that these pictures have put out on the internet for everyone's.

149
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,480
Ok friends, this was everything I had for this time.
 Thank you for checking.

150
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,060
Don't forget to write comment, subscribe, share this vidon with friends!

151
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,180
So you can take it beautifully and then we will see you just as usual next Monday.
 Bye.
