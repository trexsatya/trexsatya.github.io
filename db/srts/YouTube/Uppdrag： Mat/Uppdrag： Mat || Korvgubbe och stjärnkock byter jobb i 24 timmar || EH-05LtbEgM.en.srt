1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,240
No, now I've happened to lock the cash register!

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,840
- Then it's time to change keys.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,240
- I want it to go well for her, but I don't know.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,360
I don't think she will have any benefits in here.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,960
- In Janne's kiosk, the sausages are ready.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,320
Here we have to cook it from scratch all the time.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
- This is going to be fun!

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,320
So Agnes should now without help run the kiosk for a whole day and receive hundreds of customers.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,320
At the same time, Janne should be responsible for the staff at a luxury restaurant-

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,320
-And also cooking for a large bunch booked evening guests with extremely high demands.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,320
But one thing Janne and Agnes do not know about.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,320
At the end of the day we will bring in a professional jury and let our challengers compete against each other.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,320
Who is doing best?
 A cutting chef in the kiosk or a sausage guy on a luxury pub?

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,320
- The news grill.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
- Now are you feeling bad be Agnes?

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,320
- Yes, now I'm feeling bad for real.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
It can probably be among the most difficult I have done, I think.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
- Is that so?

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,320
And then you have made it very difficult anyway.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,609
- Yeah

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
- A little bigger than the street kitchen anyway.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Nice to do away with the Swedish people later.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,960
- Does it feel nice?
 It feels good in the stomach?

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,920
- What is a sausage sausage as well?
 If I sat in the shit before-

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,600
-So I think this will beat everything with horse lengths.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,120
- As you now step in, there is no return

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,600
There will be hundreds of guests today.
 You don't even know where things are.

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,619
Is it hell that hides behind you?

29
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:47,720
- Ahh, fuck.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,720
- Welcome in, Agnes.

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
- Here is your staff today.

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,240
- Hello!

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
- Hello Hello!

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
- Hello to you!

35
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
- Yes ...

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,634
- We have a menu we're going to drive here tonight

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,240
- Swedish Flatostron Edu ...

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,238
So what is this?

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,560
- This is then the menu

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
- Yep.

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
- Thoughts?

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
- No.

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,600
- They do not know that we are guest by you in the kitchen, so it is super important that we keep the level we always do.

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Which is world class.

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
- Yes.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,720
At the same time at Kungsholmen, it was time for Agnes to enter her new workplace.

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
- Yes.

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
- Are you kidding?

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Does it call on?

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
So literally it is.
 You haven't seen the kitchen ...

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
- No, fuck!

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
The news grill?

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,520
- Yes Hi.
 I was going to order a jalapeno burger.

54
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,520
- Jalapeno burgers?

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
-Yes.

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
- When do you want it then?

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,520
- Yes, as soon as possible.

58
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
- In ten minutes you get one.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
- You have to make a jalapeno burger directly!

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
- What the hell is that on it?

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
- We have sausage bread here.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,800
- We have sausage bread there.

63
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
- Here he will have a hamburger pocket.

64
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
- Good good good.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Pommes!

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
- We should have french fries.

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Now the burger will need ...

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Oh, Satan!

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
- Oh, heart attack.

71
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
- You have received an order so far.

72
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
And you are already close to heart attack.

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,240
Are you the one who has ordered?

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,520
- I have ordered.

75
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,920
- Bank card 25 bucks.

76
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,720
I can't take 25 bucks for a burger.

77
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,440
- Now it will be 10,500.

78
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,400
- For 10,500, then I really expect it to taste special.

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
- Here.

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,720
Oh, damn!
 Overrun requested

81
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,840
What should I do then?

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,040
Great.
 You are welcome.

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,560
- This first I can say that ... I'm a little worried about how Burgarn became.

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,800
At Restaurant Sparrow we start preparing the food.

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,200
In 30 minutes, guests will arrive.

86
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,840
- Who should do what?
 We have to go through.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,960
-  I will...

88
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,240
- You are the manager, Janne.

89
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,520
- Then we have the calf year here.

90
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,720
- And this one should we just have?

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
- Yes exactly.

92
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
- you will ..-

93
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,280
Yes.

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
- I fix.

95
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,440
Linus, now this is clear

96
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,960
- So, there is a bit of a lot of membranes left.

97
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,880
- I would just show you that is right.

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,440
- Yes.

99
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,840
- Don't delay it now.

100
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
- Did you say not?

101
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,200
- Yes.

102
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
- Janne ...

103
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,800
- Linus?

104
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,320
- Yes?

105
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,640
- I want you to enter my office after the end of the work session.

106
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,680
- Okay?

107
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,840
- I hope you are at checkout.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
- You already have a new attitude as soon as we gave your managerial role.

109
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,680
Celari 94 degrees inside temperature combi it says.

110
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,563
- What the hell is this?
 I can call a friend.

111
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,771
- Who are you feeling?

112
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,763
- A friend, adib.

113
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:01,027
- Is he good at root celery?

114
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:01,920
- Yes he is the best.

115
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,730
- Best in Sweden on root celery!

116
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:06,520
- Hello?

117
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,520
- Adib, it says 94 degrees inside temperature combi.
 What does Combi mean?

118
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,520
- May I ask why did you get more break now by talking to Adib?

119
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
- Yalla FaceTime

120
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,170
How to make 94 combi?

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,026
The root?
 What does the root mean?

122
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:30,000
Have you seen?
 I have made a great dragon mayonnaise, check out.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,670
- It's like another guy when he talks to Adib.

124
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,167
- Do you see?

125
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:36,944
- There are two different people.

126
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:38,944
A Svenne -janne.

127
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:40,944
- And a blatte - Janne.

128
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:42,944
- What are we going to do now?

129
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,559
- Set up the station for service.

130
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:46,520
What does it mean?

131
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,641
Well, set up station for service ...

132
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:49,641
I do not know what to do.

133
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
- Are you starting to wash your hands now?

134
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
- No, I'm going to my kiosk instead.

135
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
This is hard for me.

136
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,574
- Hi welcome!

137
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
Now let's make a roll.

138
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,819
- Yeah.
 You still have control, I think!

139
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,680
- 100%

140
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,988
- Oh, wait.
 No wait.

141
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:08,988
- Agnest, now you actually have to think about here.

142
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,553
It's a very nice customer here.

143
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:12,855
- Oh no...

144
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,480
-What?
 Why did this get so bad?

145
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,484
- Yes ... I regret.

146
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:20,800
- Yes, me with ... extremely much.

147
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
- That's not what I would have.
 I would have a maradon roller.

148
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,400
The sausages feel half -finished haha.

149
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,855
- Now I think it is a meeting with the staff, because now the guests will be coming soon.

150
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,400
- Is there anything you wonder about?

151
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Jalla, then we drive.

152
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,400
- I'm really going to clarify, it's like no extras, but it's real people.

153
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:50,661
And you are responsible for their money and food now.

154
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:54,280
- Yes then we run

155
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,577
- You think we fake this?
 So there will be people!

156
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
- What should they eat then?

157
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,540
Your food Janne.
 That's the whole concept here.

158
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,229
I wasn't kidding when I said you would take over the job.

159
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:15,200
Then they came one by one.
 All unsuspecting guests.

160
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
That did not have a rush that this star's pub

161
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:20,900
Right now was run by Janne from the local grill.

162
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,400
I think I should have a tartar

163
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,900
Yes, but we are sucked on the oysters

164
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,703
Nice, thank you very much.
 Lovely, we fix it.
 Thank you, thank you very much.

165
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
- I think...

166
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,900
- Yes, damn.
 This is not okay.

167
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
- There, yes there.

168
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Bullseye.
 Like a glove in hand.

169
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Why don't they buy pre -peeled?

170
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Please, bling!

171
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
- Four oysters?

172
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Yes, one without onions.

173
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
- one to tartar?

174
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
- Okay, a tartar.

175
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
- What does it say on the menu?

176
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
- Dragon salad.

177
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
But what is dragon salad?

178
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
- Do you know what it looks like?

179
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
- No.

180
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,400
- Imagine if the guests knew that the chef stands and googles dragon salad inside the kitchen.

181
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
- What the hell, check out, it became a refrigerator.

182
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Here.

183
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Halloumi.

184
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,360
Oh oh oh.

185
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
Without onions, please.

186
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
- Two tarts here on the calf of the vessels as it should be divided on

187
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,480
- Yes.

188
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,120
- Nice

189
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,640
- Thanks.

190
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
- Can I taste.

191
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
- What do you feel?

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Are you satisfied with your bet?

193
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,400
- So the thing is that the arrangement was ...

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
- It doesn't feel like that.

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,680
- No.

196
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,520
- The sauce I thought was very good.

197
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,400
- Yes, it was very good.

198
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
- Oh oh oh.

199
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,160
Now I got sauce.

200
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,280
It was delicious.

201
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,400
- They seem to be happy.

202
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,440
- This was delicious.

203
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
- It was delicious.

204
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,920
- Two pepper roast, then I want a medium well and a medium rare.

205
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
- What the hell does that mean?

206
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,080
- We can make meat we can do in the meantime.
 Heat on so that it is warm.

207
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
- That sauce huh?

208
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,220
- No.

209
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:16,940
- It?

210
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,440
- No.

211
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,440
- I'm so cash on this.

212
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
- Someone ordered the medium.

213
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,560
- I don't even know what that means.

214
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,160
- What's his name?
 Linus?

215
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,960
- Yes.

216
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
- Does it work well?

217
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,800
- Yes, it goes well.

218
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,120
- Good, tell us if you need help.

219
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
I just fool him, I know nothing.

220
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,440
- Do you know huh?
 I don't think you've cheated him.

221
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,720
I will cover the sauce here with the meat because then it is not visible how much they have been fried.

222
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,220
Okay?

223
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
- No.

224
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,420
- It tastes like rubber, but it's good.

225
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,820
How many pepper roast, six pepper roast should we have then?

226
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,540
Six???

227
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,040
- Three ...

228
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,100
- Okay, I'll fix, I'll fix.

229
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Give me just a few seconds.

230
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,100
They will be satisfied my customers.

231
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,540
- Fort now!
 You have to fry.

232
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,540
- But then no, I put too much.

233
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,420
- Janne that is not professional.

234
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,820
This is not good.

235
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,220
- This one is medium, this one is well.

236
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,140
- It's well done?

237
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,640
Yes.

238
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,780
And these are two french fries for them.

239
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,580
- Oh, thank you.

240
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,580
- Hope it tastes!

241
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,080
- I make that more worried about, they ordered some mediums, some ordered medium well done.

242
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Everyone became ...

243
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
- But I think it will be good.

244
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
- Is it grilled?

245
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
- This piece of meat was dry.

246
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,080
- I got a tough bite now so I can't chew in it.

247
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,080
- I might get this for me, but the salad was ... It wasn't good.

248
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,080
- Ten out of ten.
 Minus points because it was cold.

249
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,080
- I have no connoisseur, but I thought it was dirty.

250
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
- But you're not that difficult, right?

251
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,480
- The news grill.
 Hello?

252
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,080
Oh, he hung up.
 He heard it wasn't Janne.

253
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,360
What the hell is Mauri?
 He would be my sidekick.

254
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,960
- Now we have run Håkan Söder, chairman of the Friends of the Tunnbrullen.

255
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,680
Now you should order a thin bread roll by Agnes and see if it keeps the measure.

256
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,960
-Welcome.
 -Hello.

257
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,614
-What do you crave?

258
00:11:25,614 --> 00:11:27,120
- I was going to take a thin bread roll

259
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,400
- What does it cost then?

260
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,560
- Then it is up to you to decide what it should be in it.

261
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,520
A little currytchup if you have.

262
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,400
- This was a good bong.

263
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,680
Ketchup.

264
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,640
Curryketchup.
 This was not currykhetchup.

265
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,440
Now we have to find Curryketchup.

266
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,920
- A little shrimp salad is good.

267
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,720
- Shrimp salad, do you want roasted dive?

268
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,285
- Ah

269
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:52,765
- and now to the rolling then

270
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:56,640
- Now I think he looks a little uncomfortable.

271
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,560
From the customer oh, it was a fun shape today.

272
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,260
- You are welcome!

273
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
- Yes thank you very much.

274
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,280
- Now I was just going to tell you, Agnes.

275
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,800
- No, what is it now?

276
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,740
- This is Håkan.

277
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,240
- Yes.

278
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,520
- He is chairman of the friends of the thin bread roll

279
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,240
- No!
 It's true!

280
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
I am redoing.

281
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,560
- You usually say that you want a tight roll.

282
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,440
That it should hold together well.

283
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
- Yes.

284
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
- I'm not really sure.

285
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
And then she made a very strange strut, huh?

286
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,640
Yes, but it was almost just ketchup.

287
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
After all, it became like a children's roll a little neighbor.

288
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,640
But still interesting that she works as a chef

289
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
But this one ...

290
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,640
- All tables want creme caramel so there are eight.

291
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
- Okay.

292
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
What did he say?

293
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
We fix.
 I have to have plates.

294
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
- Janne, it looks terrible.

295
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
- No no no.

296
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
- What is this?

297
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,920
- This...

298
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
- It must be dried or how.

299
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
- You can't serve it anyway?

300
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
- No absolutely not.

301
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
- No.

302
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
- Janne, this one is impossible even worse ...

303
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
- Do you think this is better?

304
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
- No, problems.

305
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
- Problem?

306
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Classic problem.

307
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
- Yes, I think we have to have a coffee now.

308
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
- Coffee?

309
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
- Do you feel that you have control?

310
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
- Yes.

311
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,172
- We give them some ice cream then

312
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,011
Oh check out!

313
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:28,877
So she can't give me failed now

314
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:31,470
Then she gets fired too haha

315
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:35,805
Pling!
 You are welcome.

316
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:38,043
- Vanilla ice cream?

317
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:38,735
- Yes

318
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,713
- With cream?

319
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:40,445
- Yes

320
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,073
- And lemoncest?

321
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:43,087
- Yes

322
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,803
- But I don't understand you got any kind of mess?

323
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
- It was because I was a child.

324
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Then I got glass.

325
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
- God, they look completely different.

326
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
How fun.

327
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,920
- It was pretty good indeed.

328
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
It doesn't look good.

329
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
- Oh, this one was cute.

330
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
- The grade goes down because you look at it

331
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,637
But then it is good.

332
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
- The same dish, it is completely different.

333
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,181
- Is it a tastiest dessert you have eaten or?

334
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:12,672
- Not in my life but ...

335
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,127
10 out of 10.

336
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:24,000
- Now my Adamer and gentlemen are the lunch rush up and Agnes Puls has risen from 110 to 140.

337
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,960
- God, then.

338
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,840
Oh my God.
 Oh, Satan.

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,381
Ahhhhh !!

340
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,088
- How are you doing right now, Agnes?

341
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:36,292
- really bad, money just lies everywhere

342
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,240
It's totally sick.
 Now it's not fun anymore.

343
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,800
Now you have to call Janne.
 Now I can't cope anymore.

344
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
- For real?

345
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
- Yes, call Janne.

346
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,200
- Jan, you have to come.

347
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,840
- There, Janne!

348
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
- Everything in the burger.

349
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,320
- Check out what a good looking it is.

350
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
- Oh, damn!

351
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
- Oh, damn!

352
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
- So there, then my friend sorry you had to wait.

353
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,280
- This kiosk means a lot to me.

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It is...

355
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,560
I do not know.

356
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,560
In fact, I see almost many customers more than I see my own family.

357
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,600
So, now the last three months I have opened and closed every day.

358
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Seven days a week.

359
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,040
But at the same time, I know nothing else.

360
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,480
Alongside my family, this is my life too.

361
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,000
- Now dinner is type ready.
 Now they have eaten all dishes.

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,200
I go and now check how they thought it tasted.

363
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
- I am waiting.

364
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,700
- huh?

365
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,560
- I'm waiting for you.

366
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,400
- That's really good.

367
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,680
- I just would like to thank everyone for being here at dinner.

368
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,000
And then I would like to present today's chef.

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Which has cooked all food itself.

370
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,720
But as has never been in a restaurant kitchen.

371
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,920
Welcome to Janne from the local grill!

372
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,080
Come Janne, come!

373
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
- Hope you liked the food.

374
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,720
- But Janne, this was just heating.

375
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
Now the real challenge begins.

376
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
Now it's time for step two.

377
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
- Okay.

378
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,240
What have our challengers really learned during the day?

379
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Now it is time for a competition where Agnes and Janne get to cook whatever they want in their new workplaces.

380
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,840
A sausage guy with access to extremely exclusive ingredients and a star chef with the limited supply in a kiosk.

381
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,840
The question is, who makes the best right?

382
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,240
And then will be judged by a real star jury.

383
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,640
- Everything I've cooked in life has led me to this particular moment.

384
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:01,280
- This could be the most important event in culinary history.

385
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,640
- I resigned from Sweden's master chef to join this jury.

386
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,800
- But this is ... it's like ...

387
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,240
- It's a bit like this ... If the sausage guy succeeds just as well, then the whole chef church falls as well.

388
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,440
- You could probably say that it is your reputation as a chef in the future that is at stake.

389
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
- mm.

390
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,760
- Hello?

391
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,040
- Hello, Adib.
 I need your help to cook.

392
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,480
Adib, you are the professional now.

393
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,520
- What should you cook?

394
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,880
- Adib, this is serious now.

395
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,080
They are filming.

396
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,400
Then followed a ten-minute confused conversation there-

397
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,040
-Jan and Adib came to a fairly safe card.

398
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,760
Dragon Mayonäs, clove potatoes and a really good piece of meat.

399
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,800
- Okay, does it feel safer or?

400
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,160
- No.

401
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,880
- You then start with liquid egg yolk.

402
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,520
- Yes.

403
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,640
Damn, this doesn't look good.

404
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
- No, it's fluid.

405
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
- Yes.

406
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
- Yes, yes, yes, Janne!

407
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
- Adib listen, it gets loose.

408
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
- Yes, it has cut.
 It has cut.

409
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
- And maize, should I put in the maizena?

410
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
- No, it's best to make new ones.

411
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
- Okay, Jalla.

412
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,640
- What will be the big challenge of the sausage guy?

413
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,640
- It is perhaps if you put the bar too high and want to do too much.

414
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,640
- If you use ingredients he has never tasted and machines he has never tried-

415
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
-Then it can go really badly.

416
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,200
- Warning?

417
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,480
New attempt.
 Try number two.

418
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,240
- I think you should taste this now.

419
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,880
- Should I?

420
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,040
- Yes what was it called?

421
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,160
- Mauri.

422
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,320
- Taste this one.

423
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
- Now!

424
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
- Taste that one.

425
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
- Next step.

426
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,880
- Now I'm going to try to wash some vegetables and start frying the potato to the meat.

427
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,240
- I'm going to try a gnocchi thing.

428
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,040
- Are you going to make a gnocchi in a street kitchen?

429
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,760
- Yes.

430
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,400
- It's like luxury food.

431
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,120
- It's delicious.

432
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,600
- That's what you get at finer restaurants.

433
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,480
- Really.

434
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,360
- Will it go?

435
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,520
- I do not know.

436
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,600
Hope.

437
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,120
- And what will be the star chef, big challenge?

438
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:08,200
- I think the big challenge is to find a red thread and know quickly what to do.

439
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,920
Yes, it is exciting.

440
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
- This will be ruffled.

441
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,960
- It's so cozy that you start singing for yourself.

442
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,080
-I can do it, oh!

443
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,200
- Are you a little annoying?

444
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
- Yes, 100%

445
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
- You want a sweet tomato sauce.

446
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,200
And you get that as well.
 When you caramelize onions it becomes sweet.

447
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,880
We will try to make a flavored butter.

448
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
- What, so you should taste butter with chorizo?

449
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,800
Mashed potatoes?

450
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,680
Now you have pulled out an onion.
 What are we doing with the onion now?

451
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Oh God!
 Oh God!

452
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,320
Hand on heart.
 If you can guess, will you beat Janne?

453
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,720
- No I do not think so.

454
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,189
- Can you show me Agnes Cup?

455
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:54,120
- Which trophy?

456
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,960
- As she should get now when she wins.

457
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,320
- You, up with self -confidence.
 She also has a tough time.

458
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,240
- Who will win?

459
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,720
- I'm not entirely sure.

460
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,440
If the sausage guy only serves as he is used from his own kiosk-

461
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,760
–Desa delicacies that he gets access to-

462
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,960
- So it should be very good anyway.

463
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,640
It is difficult to do something extremely interesting in a sausage kiosk maybe.

464
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
- Nice colors.

465
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:20,900
- Yes.

466
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,400
- A little autumnal.

467
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
What kind of meat is that?

468
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,900
- Back steak.

469
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
- How do you know that?

470
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
- ehm ...

471
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,940
- huh?

472
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,700
- Oh...

473
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,140
You ask so much.

474
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,140
So this is not good meat.

475
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,340
- Hahaha!

476
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
Janne, Janne, now it's black!

477
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,140
- imagine a little of the good bearnaise sauce I did

478
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,180
- The bearnaise sauce?

479
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,620
- No, the dragon sauce.

480
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,900
- The dragon sauce?

481
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,580
- What was it I did there?
 The dragon butter?

482
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,700
- Dragon mayonnaise!

483
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,220
- Dragon mayonnaise

484
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,900
- So.

485
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,900
- Oh God!

486
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,580
- Damn what good!

487
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
- Now gnocchi is going into the tomato sauce.

488
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,580
- Yes exactly.

489
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,380
- Aa ...

490
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,580
- It should attract a bit.

491
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,580
Now comes the chorizo butter.

492
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,100
- In terms of taste, where do you think we are there?

493
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,460
- So better than it looks, I think.

494
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
- Cheers!

495
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,660
- It's really good!

496
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,060
Will you win this now?

497
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,580
- No, I know maybe.

498
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,580
So I don't know.

499
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,460
- Voila!

500
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
- There we have it, Janne!

501
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Bullseye!

502
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,660
And quite frankly, I get really excited to eat it there.

503
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
- Thanks Bram.

504
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,660
- Thanks!

505
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
- Stop talking to me like I'm Adib.

506
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,660
Before you go to the jury, it still feels like it's a guy who should come here-

507
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,460
-And check how it was before you present it to the jury.

508
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Welcome in...

509
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
Adib!

510
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:50,227
- What a hero you are, Adib!

511
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:55,473
- How the hell did you succeed?

512
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:58,368
Check out, check out what sexy plate.

513
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:00,263
- Walla it's fantastic!

514
00:22:00,263 --> 00:22:01,313
It's really neat.

515
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:03,313
- When you talk to me ...

516
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:05,788
Your break also disappears when you talk to me.

517
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:07,823
Why is it like that?

518
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:08,737
- I do not know.

519
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:11,689
- But now I think, as this has somehow become your right,-

520
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:15,372
The question is whether you should not present it to the jury together

521
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,720
- Yes.

522
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
- Are you nervous Jan?

523
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,260
- Yep.

524
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,220
I don't know what to say.

525
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
- You can imagine telling you what you have cooked anyway.

526
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,180
- Fried steak with fried potatoes, some fried vegetables and ...

527
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,380
What's the name?

528
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,180
- What kind of thing?

529
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
- That sauce.

530
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,760
- Then we release you Jan, and then the jury should eat.

531
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,760
- Thank you, Jan.
 Thank you all.

532
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,760
- The sauce.
 What do we say about the sauce, mayonnaise?

533
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,760
- It almost needed a little more, I think.

534
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,760
-Everything is quite dry, like the rest.

535
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,760
- I think it's pretty good.
 It has a good acid in itself and it is resilient

536
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,800
Compared to a finished bea or some finished sauce it is very good.

537
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,240
- What I appreciate is that it is not a mayonnaise consistency.

538
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
That it is a little thinner.

539
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,840
- If you had stood there in the kitchen with me, you would have understood what an unlikely randomly it is.

540
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,840
That this mayonnaise is still approved for you.

541
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,640
- Or is it also the feeling that he may always cook on some kind of intuition?

542
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,840
- Yes ...

543
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,240
- You continue.
 Now I see that you are sitting and pressing.
 You eat the more.

544
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
- 100 percent!

545
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
- You have to rate this later.

546
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,280
But before that we will take in the next competitor.

547
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,253
Agnes

548
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,600
- Hello!

549
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,120
- Hello!

550
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,120
It's a gnocchi I've done on the mashed potatoes.

551
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,560
So it's a tomato sauce and then a little onion.

552
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Just that, it's a chorizo butter too.

553
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,240
- Yes, I would say it is completely vegetarian.

554
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,240
- No, it's with Chorizo.

555
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
- you set up worried

556
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,771
- Hahahaha

557
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,560
- Like this.

558
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,040
- See you Agnes soon.

559
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,720
- Bye.

560
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,520
- I like the presentation.

561
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,280
It feels like something hip like in Brooklyn or something like that.

562
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
- So sometimes the simple is difficult.

563
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,600
The chorithzo butter really made the trick.

564
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
That is what lifts the whole right.

565
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,080
Because it adds so much taste.

566
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,560
- What impresses I think in terms of the chorizos butter is that it is just right.

567
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,640
She has found an incredible balance in this.

568
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,840
- Blown Away by her creativity.
 I really have to say that.

569
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,080
- But hopefully there were a little more fresh tomatoes left that you could have had.

570
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,760
There were probably roasted onions in the street kitchen that you might be able to do ...

571
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,160
She could have ...

572
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,520
- Then the question is how to judge it all?

573
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,840
Because it is quite obvious that she is a better chef than Jan.

574
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,440
It is the conditions themselves.

575
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,800
- But the question is which right you thought was the best.

576
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:24,919
- Now it's time to count how much points they get.

577
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,622
And we will start with ... should we start with Jan?

578
00:25:28,622 --> 00:25:31,395
- Now we really slaughtered

579
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:34,161
- Jan, of me you get one ...

580
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Second.

581
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,600
- Edvard Blom.

582
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
- Jan, of me you get a four.

583
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
- Gullis

584
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
- Jan?

585
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,840
- I am satisfied.

586
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,000
- In total, Jan gathered ten points.

587
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,760
And now it's time for you, Agnes.

588
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
- Yes, ush.

589
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,840
Not fun.

590
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,200
- And tea, you start.

591
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
- Yes!

592
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
- Five

593
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Great!

594
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,680
I did not believe!

595
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,280
- Extremely impressive cuisine, but ...

596
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,520
At the same time, I'm a meat guy, so it's ...

597
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,160
- Yes, totally okay.

598
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,160
- This means that Agnes, you now have eight points in total.

599
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,680
If you get three or more of Marcus, then you win.

600
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
This is a shudder.

601
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
- And it is he who is so strict.

602
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
That's it, we know him.

603
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
- Yes, so so severe that it almost gets sexy

604
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
So you are so really strict.

605
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,680
- I can say this, I always try to be very professional and fair.

606
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
But now it should be decided.

607
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
Gnocchi ...

608
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
It's not really my favorite dish.

609
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,680
So that I still landed in a point ...

610
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
That gives you ...

611
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
YES!

612
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
- We have a winner!

613
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Congratulations!

614
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,664
- Thanks!

615
00:27:08,664 --> 00:27:09,680
- Congratulations!

616
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Or what a congratulations, sorry.

617
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Well fought!

618
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
But should we end with?

619
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
- With a pilsner?

620
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,766
- Hahaha

621
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:20,381
It's actually a great idea.

622
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:22,381
Should we have a beer or?

623
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:24,311
- Get chairs.

624
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:26,731
That is why you have with Edward Blom for such proposals.

625
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:28,867
Bowl!

626
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,040
There we sat and drank beer and found that it is about as difficult for a sausage guy as for a star chef to change jobs.

627
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Then Jan was introduced to the priest's little crow.

628
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,840
The priest's little crow would go out and go, no one had him driving.

629
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:51,880
And he slimmed here, and he slipped there, and he slipped you in the ditch.

630
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
And then he slips into the ditch!
