00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,520
This morning, Victor asked if I wanted to be a rabbit on his birthday paintball.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,680
So now we drive!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,080
My name is Mauri Hermundsson.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,680
Since I became Youtuber I have started getting lots of requests in my inbox.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,080
But I always say no because I'm a coward.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
Now, however, there will be a change in that.

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,080
This week I will open my inbox every day and accept the first thing that shows up.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,880
What strange places will it lead me to?

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,280
What unexpected people will I meet?

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280
And how far will I be prepared to go?

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,280
- Do you want to take Elin Olander to your wife?

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
This section is also in collaboration with Wolt.
 But now we are running.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,280
- Monday we have cleared.
 Now we will accept something new.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,280
And the first thing that appeared now is that a woman named Pirjo wants to show me Finland.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,280
You receive such mail.
 That is why we do this section.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,280
I get so heavenly random mail.
 She did not write her number, but I will look for it.

17
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
If you see this now, then that's what we do tomorrow.

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:33,280
It is early in the morning and now I will pick up Pirjo for today we will be traveling to Finland.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Is it Pirjo?

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
- My name is Pirjo.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,861
- Mauri

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,280
- Who has been so stupid?

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
- Yes.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,280
- Does it sound too damn good or?

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,280
- It's an old guy.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
- Is it?

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
- No it suits you.
 You look like a Mauri.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,280
- Okay.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,280
Against the boat!

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,280
- Against the boat!

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
- Now!
 What fun to go on vacation with a strange guy.

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Or guy or boy what are you called?

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
But I'll watch you.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
There are cute girls in Åland.

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Or boys.
 You never know.

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
- If you can guess what do you think I'm most craving?
 Boys or girls?

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
- Both.

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Is it true?

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
- Is it true?
 Hit me hand!

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
What is yours?

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Yes, that's right.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
- What are you looking for then?

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
- Just old men.

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
- Just old men?

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,800
- Yes, I think you might find someone.
 I might find someone captain.

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
- You are craving the captain?

47
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,080
- You just never know, these nice hats and stuff.

48
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,760
Yes, and a little stomach and like this.

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
- Is it sexy?

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,480
- The old man should have some stomach.

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,360
- Not under 200 boilers?
 300 kilos?

52
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
- No.
 Where does the limit go?

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
- It's two and half.

54
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,240
- 250 kilos?

55
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,280
- But if he's big!

56
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,507
- You should suffocate when you are under him.

57
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:01,960
- or over.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,560
- You should suffocate when you lie above him.
 Then you are big.

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
- Who is the longest of us?

60
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,880
- I.
 I have much more strength.

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,920
- Are you stronger?
 - I can lift you.

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,597
- It's easier for me to lift you.

63
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:19,464
- Try

64
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,360
- It will look strange for all cars?

65
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,960
- No, it doesn't matter.
 You should lift me.

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,399
- Don't I wave?

67
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,280
- I take everywhere on your body?

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,080
So!
 So, don't!
 Me too, me too!

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,520
- It's a lot of cars.

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,320
- Yes, we are going to the ramp.
 Now I get a stomach ache.
 Now I go under.

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,040
- Pirjo is very afraid of ramp.
 Pirjo, it doesn't help you lie like that.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,000
- Now we're in the middle.
 Now brake, brake, brake.

73
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,680
- We are going to Åland and have fun.

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,760
My God, I hate them.
 I hate these ramps.

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,680
- Goodbye Sweden!

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,240
- We will come back for a while.
 We are going to Lilla Finland.

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Now the captain talks to me.

78
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,040
Welcome Pirjo the boat.
 You're fine.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,120
- Now we have got hold of the captain.
 You're not single, right?

80
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
- No.

81
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,840
- If you change your mind, honk.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Just honk here.

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
- Tuta if you become single during the journey.

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
So Pirjo knows about it.

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
- Great captain.

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
- Thanks.

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
- Thank you for your time.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,640
- I think he looked a little so.

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Too bad I'm married.

90
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,640
- Do you think so?

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,640
- I think that more was your imagination as well.

92
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,346
- No no no.

93
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:01,354
- He was craving or?

94
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:02,640
I think so.
 If he was not married.

95
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,640
- But vase was what you said.
 If he honks, then he will be single.

96
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
- Then he is single.

97
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,640
- You run up and get a small howling in the captain's cabin.

98
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,640
- Not the cab.

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,640
- No?
 Where do you get your howl?

100
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
- What is sewing?

101
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Pippa!
 No, I'm not going to pip with him!

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
- How nice it was to dance a little.

103
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
- Yes, it was nice.
 It was a real thing.

104
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
- You had a tutting, cructer.

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
- huh?

106
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
- You did this tutting, krruutsa.

107
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
You are such ... What do you say in Finland?

108
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
You are...

109
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

110
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
- Thank you.

111
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
- Okay, so ice cream first?

112
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,040
- We take an ice cream.
 Here are such cozy or do you see?
 Very nice.

113
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,520
- Mauri.

114
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,520
- Hi, we're holding on to mine and recording right now.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,320
- Okay, should I say a thing?

116
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,080
- Yes.

117
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,240
- Do you want a video idea?

118
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,840
- Yes.

119
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,840
- Come and work in an ICA store.

120
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
- Okay, Ica.

121
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
- Ica near the Enköping mountain.

122
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
- Okay, I'll think about it.

123
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Have an awesome time.
 Bye.

124
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,440
- I can't really say no to him.

125
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,440
I have to say yes to everything.

126
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,440
- This section is in paid collaboration with Volt.

127
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Ahaaa.

128
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Wolt is an app where you can order home food from restaurants near you.

129
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,440
The best thing about volts is that it frees up a lot of time for other fun in everyday life.

130
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,080
Let me demonstrate.

131
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,520
You open the app and then just choose and wreck what to eat.

132
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Hamburger...

133
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,560
And since I do not need to cook now, I get time for lots of other fun.

134
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,760
I can wash wash.

135
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,080
I can clean.

136
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,400
You have time to bed in bed.

137
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,240
You can check the story of the ring the triology.

138
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
You can go to hockey in Mora.

139
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,880
You can go a little helicopter.

140
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,480
You can be in Greece.

141
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,120
And now the food is here.

142
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,360
And I've had so much fun.

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,360
And here we have it, all the way to the door.

144
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,360
And that's pretty accurate this much better life gets with volts.

145
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,360
And with the code assignment, all new users get SEK 100 discount on Wolt.

146
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,360
The link is in the description.

147
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
- I can't really say no to him.

148
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I have to say yes to everything.

149
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
Work at ICA ...

150
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
- Call out!

151
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
- Excuse me!

152
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
What is the number to he who owns?

153
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
- 070

154
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
-070?

155
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
- 851

156
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
-851, but then we'll see you at ICA-Enköping then?

157
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
- Yes good bye!

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
- Then we drive the gang!

159
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
- Yes, come

160
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
- Go for it

161
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
- Yes.

162
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
- or?

163
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
- That's a great idea.

164
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
- Come on.

165
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
- Wow!

166
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
We will return to my trip with pirjo-

167
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
-For I will hang out a bit on Ica-Enköping-

168
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,302
-What may not be the most exciting thing to do in life.
 But if you have sat in the boat, you get it in port.

169
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,600
- What do you think then?

170
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,680
- I don't know, you can sing to yourself.
 If you like to sing.

171
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
- What do you sing then?

172
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:37,667
*Sings*

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,720
- Now it's time to try the cash register.
 I'll do that with you, Ella.

174
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,920
Ella has been prao here for two days, which is more than me.

175
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
So now she will show me how the checkout works.

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,560
Then just wait for our first customer.

177
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,680
Don't they trust us?
 -No I do not think.

178
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,880
- Then you say the prize that stands there.
 –168.

179
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,400
- Crowns, they say.
 - Far, kronor.

180
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,920
–And you say digital receipt there.
 - Digital receipt there, please.

181
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,600
- So have a nice weekend.
 -Have a nice weekend.

182
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,360
- Thanks for the help.
 SEK 169.

183
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,760
- Then you say you want the receipt.

184
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,240
- Now I forgot it.
 -Yes.

185
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,240
-San you say ... - nice evening.

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,920
- Nice weekend.

187
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,680
- Then you want the receipt.
 - Yes, I forgot.

188
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Ella, the hand on the heart, are you a little disappointed with me?

189
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,680
- Pytte, puddle, puddle, a little.

190
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,813
- Did you think I'd be a little better?

191
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:46,133
- A little better.

192
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,720
- How old are you really?

193
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,160
- I'm eleven?

194
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,640
- It's cool.

195
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
- And so you think there and there.
 Great!

196
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
- Nice weekend.

197
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,960
- and digital receipt.

198
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
- Digi ... huh?
 Digital receipt.

199
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
- Did she get a digital receipt?

200
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,720
- It says there.

201
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,160
- The little girl?
 Does she have a digital receipt now?

202
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,660
- Yes.

203
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
She got it now anyway.

204
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
- Yes but thank you in Ella for the lesson.

205
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,160
- You are welcome.

206
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
- You were an incredible teacher.

207
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
And an incredible person.

208
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Thanks.

209
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
What fun to meet you.

210
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,660
- Yes.

211
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
This by saying yes may not be so stupid anyway.

212
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
Otherwise, I would never have come to know the gang at ICA.

213
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,060
Then it was time to rand in tomorrow's challenge.

214
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
- I have a video idea.

215
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
You should meet my friend Niklas.

216
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,060
He is very nice and will have a gig in Färgelanda tomorrow.

217
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,340
We got in the car towards Färgelanda in Dalsland to meet this Niklas-

218
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,660
-As apparently, occasionally occurs at local associations.

219
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,220
- In here lives this Niklas.
 Should we see where he is.

220
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
Niklas Gårdelid.

221
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,220
Hello!

222
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
- Good day!

223
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,220
- Hey!

224
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,220
- Welcome!

225
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,220
- Today we will be able to hang out with you at a gig in Färgelanda.

226
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,220
- Färgelanda is called it.
 It is a small town up in Dalsland.

227
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,220
- We got this message yesterday and now we have to hang out with you.
 We are very grateful for that.

228
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,220
- Yes, it was great that you wanted to do it.

229
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
- Have you ordered a rider there at ...

230
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,100
- Just it's careful now.
 We get a choir and bread.
 I think it is good.

231
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,100
- It's not just Red M & M's.

232
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,140
- No, that's bad about it.

233
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,180
Think co -workers are going on?

234
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,260
- Is she who drives us there?

235
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,660
- Exactly.
 She will drive.
 I feel it is stupid if I do.

236
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,940
- It can be a little dangerous.

237
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,220
If I get to choose, I will choose that she is happy to drive.

238
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,620
- I have a spontaneous sense of it.

239
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,620
- I have the box down here.
 There is no AC in this car.

240
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,860
- It's no AC at all.
 It is bad with it now.

241
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,500
- It's not like this luxury tour life.

242
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,900
- No, it's not.
 You drive by car without ...

243
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,540
- AC to Färgelanda and gigs for a sausage ...

244
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,540
- You get a driver, absolutely.
 But it's funny.

245
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,740
- How many people will be there?

246
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,700
- Today it will probably be a pretty small audience.
 It's probably 25-30.

247
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,460
- Do they pay to get there?

248
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,380
- Yes, exactly they do.

249
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,980
- You are still an artist for whom you pay entry.
 It feels a little luxurious.

250
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,940
- Yes, so it is.
 Absolutely, yes, yes.

251
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,300
- How long have you been doing music?

252
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:37,300
- All my life really, but I started playing piano when I was two or three years old.

253
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,220
- Oh!
 It feels like you have absolute hearing.

254
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,860
- Yes it is true.

255
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,540
- huh?
 If I sing a tone, can you say which one it is?

256
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,766
- I think so.

257
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,476
*ton*

258
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,182
C sharp.

259
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,000
*ton*

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,522
F

261
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:51,660
- Mwawawaw

262
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,300
- It was a C major stacked, roughly.

263
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,300
- Mi.

264
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,148
- A bess.

265
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:57,900
- Wooo.

266
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,100
- A diss, I mean.

267
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,820
- Wullalule?

268
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,700
- From Bess to C.

269
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,380
- Muwhululu?

270
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,780
- Ass to ESS.

271
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,380
- No, what is it tones?

272
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,060
- Yes, when we talk, there are also tones.

273
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,910
- And this one?

274
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,620
Mowuluhulu.

275
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,860
- Gess is up to ace about.

276
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,020
- God, I'm so good.
 - Yes, I think.

277
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,066
- And now we are starting to approach Färgelanda.
 This is going to be fun.

278
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:27,066
- Yes it will be really fun.

279
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,260
- Then we are there.
 Can I help you?

280
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,033
- I will take it.

281
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,033
- Don't you lit him?

282
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,940
- This one then Niklas, Mohowolulo.

283
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,500
- F to C to D.

284
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,700
- Okay thanks.

285
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,020
- Here we are.

286
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,220
- Ajamensan.

287
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,460
- Sound we have, one two.

288
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,700
Yes, yes, yes.

289
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,500
- Then it is time to test the coffee range at the Cultural Association in Färgelanda.

290
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,700
- Yes it is.

291
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,700
- Incredibly exciting to taste.

292
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,740
Mm.

293
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,740
It was delicious.

294
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,140
- Yes, that was the point.

295
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,100
- Was it?

296
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,620
- I do what I can.

297
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,620
- OK, I understand.

298
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,140
- And is it something I'm good at that.

299
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,740
But that's not so much I'm good at.

300
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,060
I make a damn lot of stuff anyway.

301
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,060
- One thing you are good at, Janne.

302
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,060
- In other words?

303
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
- The mustache.

304
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
You've curled to them.

305
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,060
- Yes, but it will be ...

306
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,260
It will be Velcro.

307
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,260
- You have had big dreams.

308
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,260
- Yes, I usually have it.

309
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
- Yes, you usually have it.

310
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,260
- So that ... yes.

311
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Yes?
 So that...

312
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
- And then just start waiting for guests?

313
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
- Yes.

314
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,260
The...

315
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,260
We expect some to come.

316
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
- Yes we do.

317
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,359
- Hello, Hi, welcome!

318
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:06,579
- Thanks.

319
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:08,593
There was one and there was the other.

320
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:15,831
- Excuse me, does he try to plan?

321
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,914
Are you trying to schedule yourself?

322
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Caught in the act.

323
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,705
Now he is not so cocky anymore.

324
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,820
- Three minutes left to Gig.
 How does it feel?
 -It feels good.
 I am a bit nervous.

325
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,100
Then this humble guy-

326
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,620
- Sing on the small cultural association in Färgelanda.
 And as he sang.

327
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:54,900
- So when I think of life that I got to live-

328
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:03,900
-and when I dream of days that I have left-

329
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:13,900
-So all the clear is my truth that will carry me-

330
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
-I know that you...

331
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
- Incredibly good job!

332
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
- Thank you, what fun to hear.

333
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:26,900
- During the break after I heard you, I ran out and contacted a music studio in Trollhättan.

334
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,900
And then I think we'll release a song with you when this section is released.

335
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:36,900
- Yes okay, that sounds exciting.
 Yes okay, it would be fun.

336
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
- Here you have the cardan.

337
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Go in and listen to this song today.
 It is Niklas host.

338
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:53,820
- Hi, Mauri.
 It is time to release my otter that I have taken care of for a year.

339
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,100
You are welcome to Finland.

340
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,180
There it is!
 Finland.

341
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
And now we are here, in Finland.

342
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,220
And there lives Penilla and her otter.

343
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,420
I have never traveled so far for an otter.

344
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,620
Think if the otter opens.

345
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,300
They are dangerous.
 I hardly know what an otter looks like.

346
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,980
- Hello!

347
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,820
- Pernilla.

348
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,320
- Mauri

349
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:25,964
- Nice.

350
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:26,600
- Nice

351
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,180
You emailed me and said you would release an otter.

352
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,180
Now we stand here and will release an otter.
 How is it that?

353
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:40,700
- He was, about a year ago, very much.
 He had just opened his eyes.

354
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,100
He was chased by a sea eagle in the middle of the open sea.
 It was a Swedish family on a sailboat that saw this.

355
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,500
They dismissed the attack and waited for a mother to pick up her otter.

356
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,980
But there was never any mother.

357
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,380
They hoped him and called me.
 He didn't even have teeth.

358
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:04,980
In the beginning I cut centimeter -sized salmon pieces that he kind of scarred in himself.

359
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:07,862
Let's see.

360
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:09,945
- There is an otter.

361
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Check!

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,945
Hello!

363
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:14,980
You have not taught him-

364
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,980
-Table condition real?

365
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
- No.

366
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,980
He splashes fish juice on you.

367
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
Ouch.

368
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
- Your shoes will smell fish after this.

369
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
- No but otis.

370
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Oh!

371
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Otis!

372
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,260
How much do you love that little racker?

373
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,740
- With the whole heart and a little more.

374
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,420
It will be very heavy to let him go today.

375
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,620
- Why are you letting go of him?

376
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,300
The goal of wild rehabilitation is that the animal man rehabiliters-

377
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,980
-Always bring back to the wild.

378
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,380
- Now he will become an adult.
 - Yes, for my baby.

379
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,540
- You baby?
 I'm sorry.
 -I know!
 I can't cry now.

380
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,380
- He does not know that this is the last day you spend time with each other.

381
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,340
- I've told him.

382
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,660
- He doesn't understand that Pernilla.

383
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,580
This is your last day together.
 Is there anything we can do that makes him extra happy?

384
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,940
- I don't know why I've never tested it, but I've heard that otters like eggs.

385
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,640
–What do it like more?
 He'll get everything!

386
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,420
- Flow

387
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,440
Some gorm-cat food can.

388
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,700
- He should get a three course.

389
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,700
You fix tables, I fix food.
 See you here in a quarter.

390
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,980
- Now you should enjoy your last meal together in life.

391
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,127
- are you going to kill us?

392
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:42,420
- Yes

393
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,420
- Now we almost have to make a lady and the air with this fish.

394
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:56,420
- There they have their last minutes together because now it is time to head towards the lake and release this outdoor forever.

395
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:04,420
- Otis has been quite stressed during the car ride but very capable.
 He has nevertheless been relatively quiet.

396
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,420
You are very capable darling.
 You are really good.

397
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,420
This is my last seconds with him.

398
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,420
Now you should swim in the lake.
 You should swim in the lake.

399
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,420
There, there.

400
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
- Do you see what?

401
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
Yes but look!

402
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,420
- Do you swim honey?
 Are you swimming now?

403
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Otis, now you are just a small otter who doesn't understand what I say because you swim away.

404
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,420
But I want to say that anyway.

405
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,420
That I love you so much.

406
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,420
From the bottom of my heart.

407
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,420
And I will miss you.

408
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,420
So much.

409
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,420
And I will remember you.

410
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
For the rest of my life.

411
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
- Sorry what's going there?

412
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
- It's an ostrich.

413
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,420
- Why is there an ostrich there in the middle of everything here.

414
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,420
null

415
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:35,820
- We are back in Sweden.
 The last email I've received is from a woman from Töreboda in Västergötland-

416
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,300
Who wants me to come down and take a picture with her sister child.

417
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,740
Damn!

418
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,500
- We are now in Töreboda in Västergötland soon after four hours in the car.

419
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm here to take a picture with Marica's sister child.

420
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,500
It must be here.

421
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,220
God, what a strange thing.
 It's like a huge space.

422
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,260
- Is it Marica?
 - It's Marica!

423
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,657
- What is happening now?

424
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,657
- Now Håkan has been here and picked up the children in school.

425
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,300
- Why are they getting in that one?

426
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,903
-What is going on?

427
00:22:12,903 --> 00:22:14,700
- It's how it works here as well.

428
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,007
-I do not understand anything.
 Hello Hello.

429
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:19,980
- You get health.

430
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,060
Nice.
 Hello Hello.
 Mauri.

431
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,101
Hello Hello.

432
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:26,036
- Håkan

433
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:27,780
- Mauri

434
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,860
Hey.
 Hello everyone.

435
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,620
What is the idea here?

436
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,420
- The idea was that you should come here and take a picture with the children.

437
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,820
- Right.

438
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,500
You seem very uninterested.

439
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,380
- Perfect.

440
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,180
- Lovely, the gang!

441
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,180
What do we do now?

442
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
- What do you want to do?

443
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,460
- I do not know.
 I've been going here for a long time.

444
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,940
- There is a lot to do here.

445
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,740
- Can you just explain what this is?

446
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,140
- I usually say it's a small minitivoli.

447
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,460
We are like a single large family living here.

448
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,380
- As a collective type?

449
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,740
- We like life.
 You only live once.

450
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,060
- How many people live in this farm in total?

451
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
- It's type 12 people, I think.

452
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,060
- 12 people?

453
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,060
- 13 we are probably with him above the garage there is one too.

454
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
- Caravans, tractors.

455
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:30,060
- Bouncy castles.
 Here it will really be the runway for Håkan's flight then.

456
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
- Does Håkan have a flight?

457
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,060
What is this like?
 A lot.

458
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,060
- Bouncy castles.

459
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
- Is that a slide?

460
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,620
–Wa?
 - Jajemans.

461
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,044
- What are you doing here in the yard?

462
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:49,429
- We rent out bouncy castles, limousines,-

463
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:55,380
-party buses, cars, vehicles of all kinds.
 We have taxi-business, the ground contract,-

464
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,780
-Excavators' service, rental of residents.

465
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,980
We have from popcorn machines, slush machines, table chairs for big events.

466
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,500
Rodeo bulls, tivoli operations, tractors, cross maps.

467
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,060
We have snow removal, shoot some paintball.

468
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,140
We also have the mini golf course further down.

469
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,860
Then we have our 10-man bike here.

470
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,860
No, now it is no longer possible.

471
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,300
During the press, there is a Viking ship.

472
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,933
- Of course it does.

473
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,100
- Yes, of course I do.

474
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,720
- What is this Marica?

475
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,500
- An old Porsche.

476
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,481
- Is it a bathtub on the Porschen?

477
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,481
- It's a bathtub on the Porschen.

478
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,580
It fits great there.
 I went here in April and would visit.

479
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,020
Now it's September and I still haven't gone home.

480
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,030
- Is it true?

481
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,980
- No I love this place.

482
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,826
- You are stuck.

483
00:24:43,826 --> 00:24:44,700
- I've been stuck here.

484
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,380
- My friends say you really found home.

485
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,100
I work with criminal justice and know a little grip and stuff.

486
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,700
- Then try.

487
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,180
Oh!

488
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,340
- Turn the wrist a little so with.

489
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
- Ouch ouch ouch

490
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,000
- Where are we going now?

491
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,408
- Now we take a little trip to Töreboda.

492
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,020
To the big city.

493
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,458
- You look with a lot of suction in my eyes at my photographer?

494
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:24,500
- Is he single?

495
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,100
- The photographer?
 Yes.

496
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,060
You really look at my photographer all the time.

497
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,940
- Now Marica has started to pick up my photographer it feels like.

498
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,260
This is really a party bus.

499
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,088
- What should you have here?

500
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,340
- Here you should have a heel.

501
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:01,341
- Yes, my God, but it was nice this?

502
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:02,812
- Really.

503
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,120
It feels like there is something with you and my photographer in some way.

504
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,190
Yes, it might be a little irritating ...

505
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:11,647
- In?

506
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:13,101
- In the stomach.

507
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:15,036
- In the stomach?

508
00:26:15,036 --> 00:26:18,347
What do you say about him?

509
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:20,364
- Yes he is a little delicious.

510
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:21,474
- Is that so?

511
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:22,629
- Yes haha.

512
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,060
- Are you just going to go and take a walk in Töreboda, and do I remain?

513
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,060
- I can do that.
 If he wants to.

514
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
- Yes, yes, yes.

515
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
- Is it okey?

516
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
- Yes, it's great.

517
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,060
Nice to meet you, Marica.

518
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,060
- The same.
 Great fun that you came.

519
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,060
- Thanks for today.

520
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
- Thanks.
 Have a good one.

521
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,060
- The same.

522
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,060
That was fun.

523
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
Yes, we could kind of be something.

524
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Somewhere we leave Töreboda and continue with this section.

525
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,060
Thanks.
 Bye.

526
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:06,060
Now only the last challenge of the week remained, which would prove to be the toughest.

527
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,060
But first we will end my vacation in Åland with Pirjo.

528
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,843
- Now we are happy!

529
00:27:11,843 --> 00:27:13,060
- Yes we are fine.

530
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,801
- How good are you on proverbs?

531
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,025
- What is proverb?

532
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,060
- Short test of Swedish proverbs with pirjo.

533
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,060
- Can you this ... Everyone feels you feel monkey, but not ...

534
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,060
Have you heard it?

535
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,060
- Everyone knows who monkey is.
 Monkey does not feel ...

536
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:42,060
- There is this one ... When you are gone you want to go home a little.

537
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,140
- At home best, gone worst.

538
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,501
- It who laughs last ...

539
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:53,340
- Cry the least

540
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,060
- I've heard.
 The one who laughs last, cries the least.

541
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,100
Wait, the one who congratulates first, crying last.

542
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,260
No not...

543
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:14,905
The one who congratulates, congratulations first cries last.

544
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:24,656
- Now we have found it.

545
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:28,581
- Now we will ride their subway.

546
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
- No, it goes to the harbor too, huh?

547
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
- No!

548
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,340
No no no no!

549
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,340
No no no!

550
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,340
- Do you see these masts?
 What are their names?

551
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,340
- The masters, yes.

552
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,340
- It's very popular.
 It's a tourist.

553
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Old sailboat.

554
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,340
- It's just what they can show here in Åland.

555
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,340
Now you have seen it.
 Applaud!

556
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
Now we can go home.

557
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,340
- That is all?

558
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,298
- That is all.

559
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
- Now it's flat.

560
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Oh, how cute.

561
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:25,380
- Now it feels sweet.
 Not nice, but sweet.
 How would you spell nice?

562
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,660
- Sö t, sweet.

563
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,100
-  What do you say then?

564
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,420
I'm also shaky.
 I'm totally ...

565
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,100
Where have you been?
 I've been in the train.

566
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,060
- Do you know what we do?
 We're going to Tivoli!

567
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
I'm first in line!

568
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
Hi, it!

569
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,260
Taksktor!

570
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Now waves!

571
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,820
- That was fast.
 Should we change machine?

572
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,900
I can't run.

573
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,460
- You have so much fun.

574
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:20,420
Run everything you have.
 So I can walk at your pace.

575
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,980
- I run quickly.

576
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,380
- No, I walked at your pace.

577
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,540
- Did you do that?

578
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
- Check out.

579
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,460
Pirjo Pirjo.
 Excavators!

580
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,460
- No no.
 I get tamp.

581
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,327
- What do you get?

582
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:38,303
- Tamp!

583
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,980
I get tamp!

584
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,340
- Pirjo, this is where our trip ends together.
 Two days in Finland.
 Åland.

585
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,340
- Were you happy to be with me?

586
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,855
- I'm happy with you.

587
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:51,820
- I am also happy with you.

588
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,529
You're a wonderful guy.

589
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:54,620
- You're a wonderful girl.

590
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,620
- Ha!

591
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,660
Should we take a wrestling match too?

592
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,660
- I'm going to win.

593
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,660
- You do not.

594
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,660
I'll break your neck on you.

595
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,660
No!
 No on you!
 You have lost!

596
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,660
- I won?

597
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,660
- No!
 But this was a great trip.

598
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:21,660
There are a lot of aunts in Sweden, but the question is if I have not found my new favorite in Pirjo.

599
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,660
So lively, so funny and so much yourself all the way out at your fingertips.

600
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,660
Now only the last challenge.

601
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:37,660
When I sat there an early Sunday morning, I was not prepared for how tricky it would be.

602
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
- I can't ... Can I even do this?

603
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,660
If she only knew what consequences this has for me and for this program.

604
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
- And for her.

605
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
- And for her.

606
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,660
- Hello?

607
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
What the hell?

608
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,660
- Do you understand what you have put to me?

609
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,660
- Oh no!

610
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,660
I didn't think you would call.

611
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,248
But the vaphase.

612
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,620
- We decided to get married the Sunday.

613
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,320
I booked church and priest while Angelica, as she turned out to be hot,-

614
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,340
-Started preparing mentally at home in Östersund.

615
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,420
She walked with me, introduced me to my new in-laws-

616
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,420
-And told the great news to his grandmother.

617
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,220
- Do you know who Mauri is?

618
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,220
- Yes.

619
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,620
- Who is it then?

620
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,220
- The red -haired guy I've seen on TV.

621
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,220
- Do you think he's good looking?

622
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,220
- Yes then.

623
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,820
- Are you sure?

624
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
- He is good enough.

625
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
- He is good at war.

626
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820
- Yes.

627
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,020
- Yes, and now the day has come.
 This is really strange.

628
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:28,020
I have a girlfriend as well.
 It doesn't just feel good for any of us, I actually think.

629
00:33:30,329 --> 00:33:32,020
- Fyfan what an annoying.

630
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:40,020
- It's not that often you get married without ever having met your bride in life as well.

631
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Now she will come.

632
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,958
What have we done?

633
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,020
Hello!
 Nice.

634
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,000
- Angelica.

635
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
- Mauri, nice.

636
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And the viewers certainly think it's clear that we ...

637
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,020
It's just because we have to, so to speak.

638
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,020
But it feels very much for real.

639
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,960
- Yes very much.
 I have friends and family coming.

640
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,950
-Do you have it?

641
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:15,740
- Yes!

642
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,540
- God, then ...

643
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,170
- Have you regretted it now?

644
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,031
- No no no!

645
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,940
After all, it will be a lot of paperwork if we are to divorce again.

646
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,851
It will be so much mecca for us.

647
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,053
- So we're just going to hold together?

648
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,935
- I thought more ...

649
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:37,747
- I understand what you meant.

650
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,860
- You seem great.
 Angelica was there

651
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,460
You seem top.
 You seem to be a top girl.

652
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,035
- You, Mauri.

653
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:50,361
-Thanks.
 Thank you as hell.

654
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,887
-Here we go.

655
00:34:58,887 --> 00:34:59,804
- How to keep ...

656
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,700
- I just take in.

657
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,700
- And so we go.

658
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,220
- mm.

659
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:33,121
- Please sit down.

660
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,860
Before God, we have gathered for marriage between you, Mauri and Angelica.

661
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,960
To enter into marriage is to say yes to each other.

662
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,060
To the love as a gift and task.

663
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:54,200
Another gift in love and if love comes through the music.

664
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Please turn around.

665
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,440
- Thanks so much Oscar for that gift.

666
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,880
Now we are starting to approach the great moment when you finally have to say yes to each other.

667
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:12,320
Before God and in the presence of this congregation, I ask you Elin Angelica Olander.

668
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:22,720
Do you want to take Mauri Victor Leonardo Hermundsson to your husband and love him in need and desire?

669
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
- Yes!

670
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Before God!

671
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:36,720
And in this congregation's presence, I ask you, Mauri Victor Leonardo Hermundsson.

672
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Want to take Elin Angelica Olander to your wife and love her in need and desire?

673
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:56,720
And what happens here is hard to explain but it was like everything got a little too much and above all I already have a girlfriend.

674
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
- Yes ...

675
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
*Angelica Harlar*

676
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
- Was it a yes?

677
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
- Wouldn't you accept everything?

678
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,440
- I think you are absolutely wonderful and very funny and everything in every way.

679
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,160
But I may be thinking here but no longer.

680
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
This may be where it ends.

681
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Is it okey?

682
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
- You have been noble before.

683
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
- And then you are left at the altar ...

684
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:37,160
But would it be okay if I understand the right that we stay there and we eat.
 Wedding cake?

685
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,160
- But now I think then I put it down.
 Or is it standing?

686
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
- Then you put it down.

687
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
- Oh.

688
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
- What are you talking about Bengt Olof?

689
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
What did you say?

690
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,160
- This was a bit surprising what happened today.

691
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
I'm a little surprised.

692
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,160
- But you, I'm with that.

693
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,480
Then we ate cake and tried to melt my betrayal jointly.

694
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,360
But Angelica seemed to take it easy and pleasing enough she already has a boyfriend so it seems calm.

695
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:18,040
Bengt Olof, in turn, refused the wedding cake but instead ate his onion jam.

696
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,560
- Jet on onion is very good.

697
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,280
- Is it?

698
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,920
- Yes absolutely.

699
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,440
- Oh, now you sit and eat jam.

700
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,080
- Yes.

701
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,080
Jet on onion is always jam.

702
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Also on a September day.

703
