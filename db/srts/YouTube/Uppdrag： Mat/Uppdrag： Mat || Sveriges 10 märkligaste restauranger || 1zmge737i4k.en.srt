1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,771
Today I will visit the ten strangest restaurants in Sweden.

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:08,120
We start with number ten and then we work up until we reach number one.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,960
I can already say that that restaurant is at its very own level.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,920
But we start here in Varberg with place number ten.

5
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:22,558
Hehehe

6
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,200
This is a restaurant run by robots

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,698
Then pat the robot on the forehead to send it back

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,783
Then it pulls!

9
00:00:41,783 --> 00:00:44,360
It is so good.
 Bye!

10
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:48,872
And now I will order via these plates.

11
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:50,872
Fried chicken, order.

12
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:52,614
And now it comes!

13
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:53,956
I have received my food.

14
00:00:53,956 --> 00:00:55,433
And I've got my drink.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Bye!

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,440
But of course there is an ordinary, real person who is responsible for this.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,440
Hello!
 The man behind it!

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,560
- Tjena, serve, serve.
 Welcome to my restaurant.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,880
- You were one of the co -founders of the quiz fight and then sold it.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,200
It feels very much like a guy who gets a little too much money and just, what should I do?

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I start a robot restaurant!

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,600
- I must admit that is guilty that it is about what has been.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
- What do your customers say?

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,840
- Most people are satisfied.
 Especially children think it is fun with robots and stuff.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,000
In the beginning, there were a lot of robots that just drove into should N.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640
On one of the test evenings, they pulled a frontal crash at full speed.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,280
It slammed quite loudly and it spread a very strange atmosphere in here.

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,240
Like this, what the hell are we doing?
 What is this?

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,680
- Is it not strange that I had not heard of this restaurant before we went out?

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,560
- Well, I also think it a little.
 I had probably expected a little more noise and bong.

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,800
- And now you are sitting here with a robotic restaurant.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,640
- Now I'm sitting here with an empty robot restaurant.
 Just Mauri here.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,000
- I guess you still destroyed a lot of capital and stuff like this?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,814
- Ooouuuff !!
 Hahaha

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,400
In fact, I think this is the worst business of my life, purely financially.

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,880
-Is that it?
 - Yes, my God.

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,360
I will not be the break-ven here in a decade I think.

38
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,480
That's not why I did it.

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,800
- It was pure desire.
 But imagine what a boring Sweden would be if we had no such as you.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
I want to test this.
 And then you do it.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,800
I am passionate about having more guests.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
- Thanks.

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
The next time you are in the hooks go to wonderful Henrik and his robots.

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,800
However, we are going to a restaurant that is strange in a completely different way.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,800
It's time for the list number nine.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
A very common Thai restaurant.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,800
But according to about 30 different tips, they are likely to have Sweden's most angry owners.

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,800
I have sat on my hidden camera and will go in there and then we simply see what happens.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Hello!

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Maybe a Pad Thai?

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,300
No.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,320
According to the tips I have received, special orders are not appreciated here, so I gave it a try.

53
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Can I get other noodles?

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,560
No but I love that you are honest.
 I think it's fun.

55
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,880
No I don't want to argue.

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
We do...

57
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,920
It's a bit ... We're in the process of recording.

58
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,640
We have heard that you are sometimes a little annoyed at your customers.

59
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,957
What do you have to say to the camera?

60
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,700
Ahh ...

61
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,060
Ahh ...

62
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,280
Huh ehh no ...

63
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,796
You don't feel good about stress?

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,940
But can you send out customers before they get the food if they are too hard?

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,300
It happens?

66
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:45,786
- Better ..

67
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,614
- Go

68
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:47,340
- Ahh

69
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Hahaha.

70
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,380
Yes, fortunately, she was, like most people, really kind.

71
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,700
And honestly, we customers can actually be really hard sometimes.

72
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,559
Next restaurant, number eight on the list, is not so spectacular,

73
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,972
But on the other hand, there is a detail that I thought was so funny

74
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:17,041
That it was worth a few extra hours of travel to southern Norrland.

75
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:23,557
And this, my ladies and gentlemen, it's Hofors.
 A small village with about 5,000 inhabitants.

76
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,700
And here there are really two large restaurants.

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,540
And the first restaurant in the village is called Mekong.

78
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,700
But if you walk about 100 meters in this direction you will find ...

79
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Mekong 2!

80
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
I'm just...

81
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,700
They are only satisfied with Mekong 1 and Mekong 2.

82
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,700
I am so incredibly curious about how it could be this way.

83
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
I think we should find out now.

84
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,700
And invite Hofors to a little surprise.

85
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,700
But we start here at Mekong 1.

86
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,380
We have a bit that needs to be sorted out, I feel.

87
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,020
- How could you not come up with another name?

88
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,020
- I think it's Mekong.
 It's a good name, nice.

89
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,140
Before, I had Mekong in Sandviken.

90
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,660
- Was your restaurant in Sandviken also called Mekong before?

91
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,660
- Mekong!

92
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,660
- You have to find a new name for your restaurants!

93
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,460
Everything can't eat Mekong, wine tach.

94
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,460
Now, of course, it was time to test Hoforsrundan.

95
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,460
With a dish on Mekong 1 and then Mekong 2.

96
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,460
- Exciting!

97
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,460
- Thanks!

98
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,460
- A little fun that you have french fries on the buffet?

99
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,460
- Former price.
 !

100
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,460
- You are welcome!

101
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,460
- Are you getting rich in Mekong?
 Or?

102
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,460
- Slightly.
 It is okay.

103
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,460
- How rich do you get?

104
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:49,071
- Rich as rice.

105
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,109
- Rich as rice?

106
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,220
- Mekong 1 cleared.

107
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,220
- We go to Mekong 2.

108
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,220
- Mekong 2.

109
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,220
It's just over there.

110
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,220
- Yes, it's only ten minutes.

111
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
- Ten minutes?

112
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
How slow do you go there?

113
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,220
It's 100 meters there.

114
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,220
- Ten minutes it goes.
 Walking.

115
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
Not far.

116
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
- I would say a minute about.

117
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,220
- One minutes.
 It's a little quick.

118
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Quick!

119
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,220
- Mekong 2!

120
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,220
- Mekong 2!

121
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
- Mekong 2!

122
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,220
- Welcome!

123
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,220
- Welcome to Mekong 2!

124
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,220
On Mekong 2 we each ate Vietnamese egg pancake.

125
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,220
After that I went on to the small cafe in the village.

126
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,220
Because I had arranged a surprise for Hofors.

127
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,220
- Ever since I was told that Hofors has Mekong 1 and Mekong 2,-

128
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,220
-I have known that they must have a Mekong 3.

129
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:46,220
And now, my ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the opening of Mekong 3 in Hofors.

130
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,220
I called you the other day and asked if you can imagine you change your name.

131
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,220
- We obviously felt that we hook up on what we need more Mekong in Hofors.

132
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,220
- It is noticed that it is also gathering a lot of people.

133
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,220
Hofors is like tagged at this inauguration.

134
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,896
- Really

135
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,067
- Trubadur ready?

136
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:02,680
- Yes!

137
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,685
- Personnel ready?

138
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:04,320
- Yes!

139
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,840
- Candy rain ready!

140
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,220
Audience ready?

141
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,380
Yeah yeah!

142
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,020
- Welcome to this big day in Hofor's history!

143
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,660
Today you will be world -unique!

144
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,380
Then the speech was given by the municipality's chairman Thomas Isaksson.

145
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,940
All good things are three!

146
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,260
And then we paid tribute to the Mekong Creator and Mekongarvatan.

147
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,220
- I love that name Mekong.

148
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,220
Then we got celebrated visit from the woman who is known in the village to almost look like Marianne Mörk.

149
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:38,251
- You really are almost Marianne dark.

150
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:40,442
- Yes, I've heard it before.

151
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,053
- An applause to Hofors Marianne Mörk!

152
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,525
- Are you ready?

153
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:49,869
- Yeah yeah!

154
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:52,220
- Then it's time to cut the tape

155
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,220
To Mekong 3!

156
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,220
- Oh damn what a lot of people!

157
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,220
- It's a folk party, it's a carnival atmosphere.

158
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,220
So there are so many people inside Mekong 3 right now.

159
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,220
  Oh, think what I dreamed tonight.

160
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,220
  Mauri called they are going to play a splash

161
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,220
We already have Mekong 1 and 2

162
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,220
What is it he thinks we should go on?

163
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,220
Yes, Hofors had finally got his Mekong 3.

164
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,220
And now my ladies and gentlemen are starting to approach the top of the list.

165
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,220
And I can promise that it will only be more remarkable.

166
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,820
First briefly mean that we live in tough economic times and therefore it is more important-

167
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,140
-Ever ever to keep track of their money.

168
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,580
If one is not an overpaid bad Youtuber who gets paid collaborations with Anyfin

169
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,260
For me it is quiet on that front but if we take you for example.

170
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,820
What's your name?

171
00:09:58,851 --> 00:09:59,540
- David?

172
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,020
For you David, it is incredibly important to keep track of your finances.

173
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,500
We take David as an example so now we stand here at David's home.

174
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Awesome guy, kind to his girlfriend, good at round pingy, all that.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,500
But this TV, I happen to know, is purchased on installment.

176
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,000
Which is easily happened when buy now and pay then is so common.

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,500
Anyfin, they are on the consumers' side.

178
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
They do not want anyone to pay too much unnecessarily.

179
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,000
Therefore they can look at your finances and possibly provide an offer-

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
-As can lower your costs.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,500
Anyfin does not publish any new loans or suggest more loan-

182
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,000
-Outan they want to help you lower your loan-

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
-So that you can become debt free faster.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,240
So apply in the app today.

185
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
The link is in the description.

186
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,240
So, now I think you can get a better look at your finances.

187
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,080
Hoho!

188
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,560
- And now we are in Gothenburg, because here is Sweden's only restaurant-

189
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,560
-Out a single employee.

190
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,240
My ladies and gentlemen, a pizza machine!

191
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Yay!
 It's like no one here.
 You can knock.

192
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Hello!
 Then it is really just to order a pizza.

193
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Add.
 Confirm.

194
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Your pizza is cooked.
 Do you want a receipt?
 No.

195
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,240
It's like an ATM although it is like pizza that comes out instead of money.

196
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,240
Now it's this one.
 Look!
 It is delicious.

197
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Now I dare not really say anything else when the CEO is there staring at me.

198
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Yes, a card with a good visit, because we have to move on.

199
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,240
Around Sweden there are many strange mixtures of companies.

200
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,240
We have classics such as Börje's fish and asphalt, Kennet's kennel and kebab and Stenåsen's meat and weld.

201
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,240
In Ödeshög in Östergötland we find place 6, because here is just such a place.

202
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
- And then we stand here with ...

203
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
- Annelie.

204
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,240
- You have an expertise in two areas above all.

205
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
- delicacies and underwear.

206
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Yes, it is a bit odd.

207
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,240
- Here is your store and here you see the care itself in the store.

208
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
- Yes, the underwear.

209
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
It's a bit crazy.

210
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
- Yes, it's a little crazy.

211
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Okay, and what do they cost here?

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
- SEK 260.
 How good you will be now.

213
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,600
- You feel almost flirted when you buy clothes by Anneli.

214
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,000
I take these now and a lunch of the day.

215
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,720
- You can hang with me down.
 -Bowl.

216
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,240
- I know now that you can sell lingerie.
 The question is, can Annelie cook?

217
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,160
- Yes, it's not safe.
 -Not.

218
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
*Pling Plong*

219
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,960
- Now Annelie will sell on someone something.
 How fast you are, Annelie!
 She is so the sales suck.

220
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,120
- You have to hurry.

221
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,120
These are good and popular.

222
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,320
Yes, was it good so or should we have something more in here?

223
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,240
- And now she gets sold underwear, socks and potatoes what it seems.

224
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
- What should you have the potato?

225
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,240
You usually eat these?

226
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,880
Aha!

227
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
- But then we have to go and eat then?

228
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,200
- Yes, we go and eat.

229
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,440
- This was very nice.

230
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
- Yes, I agree.

231
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,800
Get here a little more often.

232
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,280
- Yes indeed.

233
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,480
We hope it tasted good and that you will enjoy your new underwear.

234
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,000
Speaking of strange mixtures, now we have gone in Helsingborg.

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,960
Here you have Humlan which is a mix of a life and a pub in the same.

236
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,400
Here we have...

237
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,840
Hey!

238
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,880
Here it is bar ...

239
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,560
And one meter there it is life.

240
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,080
- We are alone in Sweden with such a concept.

241
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,000
- But that mixture has never been heard.

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,920
- It doesn't exist.

243
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,120
- May I have a beer here?

244
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,160
- Jajamän, welcome.

245
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,660
- A beer.

246
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,620
- Jajamän, please.

247
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,820
- But it is still fascinating that he has mixed life and pub.

248
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,320
- mm.

249
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,940
- It's a genius that stands there.

250
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,040
- Then you don't pay any extra price either.
 Then you pay the same price as in the grocery store.

251
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,700
- But then I go there.
 Do you want to hang out to life?

252
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Like here is the bar.

253
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,200
- Yes.

254
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
- This is where the grocery store begins.

255
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,380
- The grocery store, yes.

256
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,680
- Here is this princess cake that is so good.

257
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,440
And my beer I stand waiting there.

258
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,940
- Okay.

259
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
- Right over there.

260
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,220
It's very close.

261
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
- What are you laughing at?

262
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
- I think it's a bit charming.

263
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
- Here

264
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Who should stop us?
 Who should stop us?

265
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
- None.

266
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
- What should they do about it?

267
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
We do our thing.

268
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,920
- I eat princess cake and drink beer at the same time.

269
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
- No.

270
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
- And no one can stop me.

271
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
- Jajamän, please, please!

272
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
- Do you want?
 Obvious.

273
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
- It will be perfect.

274
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
- You are welcome.

275
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Yes, think that you can have it so good on Wednesday.

276
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Oh, don't say!

277
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Yes, it simply had to be so.
 I stayed at Humlan and said goodbye to my photographer.

278
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Then I realized that we have lots of restaurants left, so I shaped shame with a photographer to Malmö, where we find the list five.

279
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,939
Usually, restaurants are owned by one or two people

280
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:36,224
But Restaurant collective It is owned and operated by 50 different people

281
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:39,195
As everyone should be combined and take turns running the tavern.

282
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
- Welcome to the gang!

283
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Hello Hello.
 Welcome.

284
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Hello.

285
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,920
- This is the gang that owns and runs the restaurant collective in Malmö.

286
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
And you are like the main responsible.

287
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,920
- Yes you could say that.
 I came up with this snappy idea.

288
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Everyone wants a restaurant and then we came in a way that you can ...

289
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,040
Instead of everyone opening each restaurant.
 So we open one together.

290
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,920
One thought was also that we would vote one a week haha

291
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,880
- And tonight you are five who will work then.

292
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,080
A pilot, a doctor, a music producer, an architect and a saxophilist.

293
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,520
You are the one who runs this pub tonight.
 Do you keep track of this?

294
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,600
- No.

295
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
- A little neighbor, a little neighbor.

296
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,320
- Here stands Thomas who is a pilot and you serve today.

297
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,120
- Yes.

298
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,800
- This is like a guy who doesn't really know what he is doing.

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,840
- Now comes food.

300
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,520
- Food in the door.

301
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,000
- I don't really know what I'm doing now.

302
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,680
So, but I don't know.

303
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
But I go out and ask who should have them here.

304
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,880
- So don't you do?

305
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,080
- No but...

306
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,600
Should you come along or?

307
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,100
- Yes.

308
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,600
- Yes.

309
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,600
- Okay, now we are with Patrik who has got some kitchen manager.

310
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,320
Yes, I drive a fish here.

311
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
- And you are a music producer in normal cases.

312
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,120
- No, it's totally crazy.

313
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,840
Then it should just be seen and seen so.

314
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,640
- No, I think it should ...

315
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,440
- Yes exactly.

316
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
What a lucky thing you are here!

317
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,740
- Yes.

318
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,480
- Then we'll just sprinkle on someone like this

319
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,080
And now the dish is ready.

320
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,840
Ready to be served.

321
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
- And I'll eat this one.

322
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,080
- Now the question is whether they are making good food too.

323
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,400
This is for real.

324
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,240
Great job.

325
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,780
Great.

326
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,280
Otherwise?

327
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,480
*Inaudible mumble*

328
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Sorry, can you take it again?
 I didn't really understand.

329
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,480
*Inaudible mumble*

330
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,480
- And the next place is here in Furulund in Skåne.

331
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,480
For here, a nudist café or naturist café is opened every Sunday.

332
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,480
And I have received an exclusive invitation through my newly -saved membership.

333
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:30,796
- Below then, the queue is underway to pay for the cafe.

334
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,954
Are you snuggling?

335
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:34,727
- Yes now we are snuggling!

336
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,613
- Hello Hello!

337
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:42,108
It is then Pia who is some kind of chairman of this initiative

338
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:44,940
It feels so exclusive to me to get in here

339
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,540
- Yes, it is for members of naturist associations mainly.

340
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:55,340
- What is it like to go to some kind of cafe completely naked?
 How will it be?

341
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,380
- Since you bathe and baster too, it feels pretty natural-

342
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,780
-. to keep being naked.

343
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,060
- Then it's time for you and me to go and like ...?

344
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,733
- Then we go and dress up.

345
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:06,804
- Yes we should go and undress?

346
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:07,380
- Yes

347
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,660
- Are you a little scared?

348
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,100
- Yes a little.
 Is it so wrong?

349
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Now everything goes off.

350
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,120
Hello!

351
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,720
- Let's go.

352
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
- If you take your fig and then you go in.

353
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,560
- We'll do that.

354
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,500
- Damn.

355
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,080
I get so shocked every time I see a naked person now.

356
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
- Yes, okay.

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,920
But the corner of the gang then I explain the evening's Sunday café opened!

358
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Coffee in charge today.
 Thanks.

359
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,400
When I'm on a cafe, I don't usually see so many genders.

360
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,080
- No, no, but it's a little denser here.

361
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
- Do you feel uncomfortable?

362
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,080
- Absolutely not, I feel super comfortable here.

363
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,560
- Here's not a prestige.
 You cannot see any class of society.

364
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,400
Everyone is good looking, everyone is beautiful.

365
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,000
- It's something beautiful about it.
 -Absolutely.
 Nudity is beautiful.

366
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,480
- So many nude pants in a row.
 -Yes!

367
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,480
It is also such a strange feeling when it is even a photographer.

368
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,360
Now I will film you.
 Waving if you are doing well.

369
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,000
You feel good.

370
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,920
-Bowl!
 - Skåll!

371
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Mm.

372
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Mm.

373
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
- Really nice.

374
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
- Really nice.

375
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,920
After seeing enough of Scanian sex for a lifetime, I went to Stockholm for place three.

376
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,920
The black club at Södermalm is powered by Ulf, which is blind.

377
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,920
And he offers a restaurant experience where you are forced to eat in compact darkness.

378
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,920
- You run Sweden's only dark restaurant.

379
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,440
- That's how it is.

380
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,520
A restaurant where you don't actually see anything.

381
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,120
The idea is that I take you into my world.

382
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,560
I want to pepper people.

383
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,600
Don't let anything as mild as a little blindness stand in the way for you to have a good life.

384
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,080
- The wonderful thing is that everyone who runs the restaurant is also blind.

385
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,880
Can't you come in the whole gang?

386
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
-Yes we take in the world's best staff.

387
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
- Here we have the whole gang.

388
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
Yes.

389
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
- Here is the gang.

390
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
- However, the chef is not blind.

391
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
- No.

392
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
- Johan he sees.

393
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
BUU!

394
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
BUU!

395
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
- Then we take one last applause and then we drive!

396
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
- Now we will be led here in the dark room.

397
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Here it is.

398
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,000
- Now I step into your world as well.

399
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,880
- Yes, now we're going to change.

400
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
- Help me!

401
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,613
- hold me just like that

402
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,331
There you have a chair.

403
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:09,491
So you should sit on it.

404
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:10,400
You keep the backrest there.

405
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,598
Does it feel good?

406
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:12,186
- now it feels good

407
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:12,880
- How nice

408
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,345
- But I don't see much.

409
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:16,880
- No, but it's planned indeed.

410
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
-You feel very ...

411
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,606
I feel a little stupid.

412
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,491
This is really so strange.

413
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:25,560
Shall we take a bowl?

414
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,835
1, 2, 3.

415
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:28,880
Bowl.

416
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,800
- No, we can't find each other.

417
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,300
- Where are you?

418
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:30,800
- Now then?

419
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,300
Bowl!

420
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,800
Bowl!

421
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,300
Bowl!

422
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,300
- Yes, you can take your fork and then you look at you.

423
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,800
- Checking?

424
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,300
- Yes or.

425
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
- How the hell did you think I would check?

426
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
- Check with the fork.

427
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
- It's so strange not to know how much the portion is left.

428
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,300
Now I think I'm done.

429
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,800
Only my cameraman can know if I'm done.

430
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
- When you think you're done, then you're done.

431
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,300
- Then I decide that I'm done now.

432
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,800
But I still understand a little what you mean by that ...

433
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,600
So, just having a conversation is almost more present in this way.

434
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,040
- Yes, but there is also a lot that expresses that it is very nice to sit if one is not looked at.

435
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,840
- Here you cannot be judged for anything other than the one you are.

436
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,340
- Yes.

437
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,760
- Ulf always ends the evenings here with a musical number.

438
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,440
Life makes sense

439
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,440
Before we move on, let's still be impressed by Ulf and his gang who crush so many prejudices about the blind.

440
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
For this restaurant is top notch.

441
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Realize that you are the best of you-

442
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,440
Now it's time for the list number two.
 Disgusting Food Museum in Malmö.

443
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,440
And here I want to warn of offensive content, because what I will eat here is really good.

444
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,440
- And then we stand here with Andreas who owns Disgusting Food Museum where you only serve disgusting food.

445
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,440
- Disgusting if you are not used to it because what we think is good it is we think is disgusting.

446
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,440
It is very cultural.
 We only bring things that people actually like.

447
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,440
- But how many of the guests here as well as you serve them?
 How often does it happen?

448
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,440
- We'll see, 297 times.
 We have a vomit counter over there.

449
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,440
- And now I'm going to eat several dishes here.

450
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
- Yes, we show up, absolutely.

451
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
- Yes, fun.

452
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
- Take a bit.

453
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
- It was totally okay.

454
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
- It sure is.

455
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
- It was crispy.
 It tastes a bit like a creamy chicken type.

456
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
- Should we reveal what it is?

457
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
This is what you have just eaten.

458
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
It's a small veal.

459
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
- What are you sitting and doing?

460
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
What are we doing here?

461
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,120
- Eat and drink well, right?

462
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Then we take the rest.

463
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,360
These bull penishes that you so well prepared earlier.

464
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,160
But we should have something to drink too, of course.

465
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,160
I think some mouse wine.

466
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,072
- These are 200 newborn hairless mice.

467
00:25:16,072 --> 00:25:17,840
- Uhh you joke?

468
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,610
- Not at all.

469
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,290
- So it is medicine for asthma.

470
00:25:20,493 --> 00:25:22,387
- So it's liquor and dead mice?

471
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,713
-Absolutely.
 This was a clear liquid when we put it in.

472
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:28,289
So that the color you see is the color of mice

473
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:32,225
- But it's not dangerous then?

474
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:33,499
- No, no, it's not dangerous.

475
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:34,376
- Are you sure about this?

476
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:35,651
- Yes I have been drinking it before and I have not died.

477
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,774
- Unfortunately, I was saying.

478
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:41,125
- Hahahaha

479
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,720
- When you feel the scent you feel that yes it is dead mice.

480
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,200
-Absolutely.
 That's a bit of the smell of ...

481
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
A little rotten meat.

482
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,800
- Your bastard!

483
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Bowl!

484
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:16,320
- It's strange that I want to neutralize away the taste with peniches from a bull.

485
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
It was kind of good.

486
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
- Yes, but right?

487
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
- It was kind of good.

488
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
- There is nothing wrong with that.

489
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,680
- No!
 Hahah

490
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:28,998
- This is what I would call Final Boss of drinks.

491
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,160
What does it smell like?

492
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
- Farm.

493
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,720
- Yes!
 This is Kourin.

494
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,760
- Is it pure urine from a cow?

495
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
- Absolutely pure urine.

496
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,240
- Ah but vaf ...

497
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
In which country do you drink this?

498
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,480
- This is drinking in India.

499
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,720
It is part of Ayurvedic medicine.

500
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,040
- Three.

501
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,480
Two.

502
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:48,918
One.

503
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
- It's just like ... it tastes Bond ...

504
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Not really my taste.

505
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,640
- I see it.

506
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,440
Then unfortunately you will rap some urine for the rest of the day.

507
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
We both will do that.

508
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
- Your fucking AS!

509
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,975
Should we thank you for today?

510
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,784
-No no no, we have one thing left.

511
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,440
- Get it then.

512
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Okay, this one you see here-

513
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,440
-It's the stomach on a goat guy.

514
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Then you cut out the whole stomach-

515
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
-and ties together the-

516
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
-And it leaves it.

517
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,662
- You know what?
 Maybe I can just thank me today.

518
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:47,280
What the hell are you going to do about it?

519
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Why am I sitting here with you?
 You are not the boss of me.

520
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,160
It's so fun that when I suddenly realize, I don't have to do this.

521
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,160
It's so damn nice.

522
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
I'm leaving now.

523
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,780
- Mauri ...?

524
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,280
- I'm not palleting

525
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,440
- Yes, you can.

526
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
- I'm not doing it.
 I can't cope this.

527
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,440
I drank that mouse.

528
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
- Yes yes, come.

529
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
- Mmm ... no.

530
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:16,641
Now you have seen almost everything, but there is still number one.

531
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:22,641
So now receive with cheers and Klang Sweden's strangest restaurant.

532
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,839
- Brilliant, thank you for today.

533
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,520
Now I'm going to Sweden's strangest restaurant.

534
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,440
So, number one.

535
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Super nice, hello.

536
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,440
- This looks like a very ordinary student corridor, but there is an unusual difference.

537
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,440
It is that behind one of these doors, a restaurant business has been conducted.

538
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
For over 20 years.

539
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
In a student corridor.

540
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
- How often do you see a customer go here?

541
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,440
- You feel the scent.
 And sometimes the door is open and down there.

542
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
- In here is the restaurant.

543
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,160
It is like in the midst of different student centers.

544
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,840
- Welcome to Flogsta Food Association!

545
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,480
- Thanks thanks!

546
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,760
Yes, here you have him, 72-year-old Staffan Alner,-

547
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,640
-As a few years ago, noticed when it came to light that he lived in a student corridor for over 40 years.

548
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,240
But there is thus more in this story,-

549
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,240
-For from that apartment he has also run a successful restaurant since the early 2000s.

550
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,482
- So you go in here.

551
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:35,360
- This is everything?

552
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,840
- Yes!
 All.

553
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,960
- Where is the kitchen itself?
 - Here for example.

554
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,120
Here and a little everywhere there are appliances.

555
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,880
- How many guests do you have here in one evening?

556
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,720
- Yes, then it can be from ten, twenty.

557
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,200
- So sometimes twenty people come one evening here?

558
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,080
- Yes kind of.

559
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,780
- Type?

560
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,099
- Yes of course.

561
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,980
- Obvious.

562
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:05,400
- Before Corona, there was often a bunch here and jaw and so a bunch was in the kitchen there waiting.

563
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,020
- Okay.

564
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,820
So you are like a popular restaurant in Uppsala?

565
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,900
- Because it is different from all other crap served here.

566
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,320
- What is this restaurant?
 If you describe it in ten seconds.

567
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,980
- It is a place that will change the souls' nasty food culture.

568
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,700
It should be the strongest food in all of fucking Sweden.

569
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,200
That's my business idea.

570
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
- You sound almost angry when you say so.

571
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
- I hate Swedish food.

572
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
- It's a huge anger.

573
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
- Then I came to school.

574
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Then it was discovered that the classmates for cat food streaming.

575
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
And I was shocked.

576
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,200
- You feel like one of the most unusual persons I've met.

577
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
- Thanks.

578
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,200
- You build up the excitement for your food.

579
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
- Yes of course.

580
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
- It is obvious.

581
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:59,993
- What is the right to get today?

582
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,200
- Tortilla.

583
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
- Staffan What do you do on the toilet?

584
00:31:04,002 --> 00:31:05,735
- Guacamole.

585
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,200
- It's a sentence you've never heard before.

586
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
What do you do on the toilet?

587
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Guacamole.

588
00:31:15,339 --> 00:31:20,850
- This one has in hand when you go out and ask customers how it tastes.

589
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
- Four minutes.

590
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,002
- huh?
 Is the timer connected?
 Aha ...

591
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:34,200
- Obvious.

592
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,200
- So, Bon Appétit Monsieur.

593
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
- Thanks thanks.

594
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,280
A little sour beer.

595
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
- Yes, that's the only thing that fits spiced food.

596
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
- What about chili and that?

597
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
- Taste!

598
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Mmm!

599
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
Oh!

600
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
- Is there any strength at all or?

601
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
- Yes, I want to mean that.

602
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
- Good.

603
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
- I get hiccups.

604
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,280
I get hiccups of strong food.

605
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,280
- I hope it is as far from Friday night as possible.

606
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
- So I have to say that this is delicious.

607
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,080
You are a talented cooking.

608
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
- Yes of course.

609
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,080
- albeit a very unusual cooking.

610
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
- It is important to go against the current.

611
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,080
- You can say that, if it has been your goal, then you have succeeded, Staffan.

612
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,080
- Yes.

613
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
- Should we bowl for it?

614
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
- Yes of course.

615
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Yes, going against the current may not be such a stupid idea, after all.

616
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,080
Do you want to run a robot restaurant in Varberg?
 Do it!

617
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Do you feel about baptizing both your Thai buffets to Mekong?
 Go for it!

618
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,740
Are you passionate about wearing underwear and restaurant in the same store?

619
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,340
No one will stop you.

620
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,360
And honestly, what are we really for land if there is not at least a 72-year-old Staffan-

621
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,540
-Or it cohesives Mexican food from his student center in Flogsta?

622
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,580
Should we go in or?
