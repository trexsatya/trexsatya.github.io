1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,680
But it should not be about snuff or coffee or anything else common,-

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,160
-Outan about Sweden's most remarkable addiction.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,320
We will do this as a top list.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,760
And number five we find in Sundbyberg.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,480
This section is also in paid cooperation with NordVPN.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,280
- And now we stand here with Alexander.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,680
You have a difficult addiction, you can say, right?

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
- Yes.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
- You seem pretty happy then.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,680
- Yes actually.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,240
- Would you be able to live without doing it?

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,120
- Absolutely not.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Every time I wake up in the morning I know that-

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,600
-That I will do this.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,600
Whether it will be an hour or fifteen hours.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,440
It depends on what the rest of the day looks like.

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,120
- I think it's time to tell you what it is.

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,680
What Alexander is dependent on is ...

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,400
Miniature golf!

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,280
It's mini golf!

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,120
You are addicted to!

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,920
- That's right.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Now maybe you think, can you really be addicted to mini golf?

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,920
The answer is absolutely yes.
 Just wait and see.

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
- How did your addiction develop?

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,920
- It was about seven years since I played mini golf with my grandmother and grandfather.

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,920
I thought it was great fun.
 So I went there the next day, and the day after again and the day after again.

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Then that kind of continued.

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
- How many days have you not played mini golf since that day?

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
- You can count on one hand.

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
- How many hours a day do you play on average?

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,920
- Up to 15 hours sometimes so maybe the average is 5-6.

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
- For seven years?

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
- Yes.

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,920
- It's a lot of mini golf.

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
- But it feels good.

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
It is not possible to live without mini golf.

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,920
I really feel every day when I wake up that I have to play mini golf.

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,920
If the mini golf had not existed now after seven years with this addiction, I would not have been able to live.

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
- It is.
 You love mini golf so much.

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
And I love you because you love mini golf.

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
And today we will have to hang out with you.

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
- Yes.

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,920
I guess what's on the menu.

45
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
- Mini golf.

46
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,880
And then we have some balls here then.

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,160
- How many mini golf balls do you have?

48
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,680
- It's up to a thousand.

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
- Oh damn.

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,180
Okay.

51
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,880
- There we have ...

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,380
- Oh!

53
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:00,880
- A part.

54
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,080
- Damn.

55
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,960
- So every ball here is unique as well.

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
It's not about the look though, but ...

57
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,360
- As with people.

58
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
- Yes exactly.

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,800
- There we have it.

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,440
Let's go!

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,120
- Great.

62
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,120
- You initiated a high five?

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,620
- Yes.

64
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,620
- It is usually always I am happy to have a guest like ...

65
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,120
- Now I feel that ...

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,040
Now its time.
 Miniature golf.

67
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Then we arrived in paradise.

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
It is locked and closed for the season but we step in.

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Yes, we come to hole one.

70
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Ah just, on hole four we should have a ball that does not bounce so much hot.

71
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,040
- Is it a ball in the stocking?

72
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,040
- Yes exactly, so that we stop inside the pants.

73
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
- Why?

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
- Because here it is a little warmer than in the ball bag.

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
- It's like some extra balls there now.

76
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
- Yes exactly, now it's really mini golf professionals.

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
- Thanks.

78
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Cool.

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
- No, we play mini golf.

80
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,040
- That is a nice blow.

81
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Unbelievable.

82
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
- Then there are 17 holes left.

83
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
- Yes haha, then we drive!

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
- We drive!

85
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Ohohohoho!

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Nice.

87
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
- Was it so fun?

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
- This is the best I know.

89
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Studs, bounce, and walk in the hole.

90
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
How close!

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
Do we run the next course?

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
- Let's go!

93
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,320
It's so neat.

94
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,320
- I thought we should take some mini golf - coffee?

95
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
- What is it?

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
- Toast and hot chocolate.

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,240
- Do you have with you?
 That's what you have in your bag.

98
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
- Yes exactly, my cooler bag.

99
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
- How cozy!

100
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
- I always have it with me.

101
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,360
- Are you the happiest when you sit exactly here?

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
- Yes.

103
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,160
- Five hours a day, year -round, for seven years ago.

104
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,360
- But is there anything that has been difficult at some point that made you find a security in the mini golf?

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
- When it started seven years ago, then I might not be very popular in school.

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
I wasn't the cool guy.

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,680
It was probably a reason why I started with this and held on to this.

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,400
Then it just continued.

109
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,520
- But somehow you found some kind of security in the mini golf.

110
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,440
And so it was simply developed into a pure addiction.

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
- Yes.

112
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,920
- For this, my life is.

113
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,640
- Yes, mini golf.

114
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,800
- This is what I live for.

115
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,840
- We will be up with the balls we have warmed.

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
- Oh, it's tickle a little here.

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
- Exactly.

118
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,440
I don't check.

119
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,680
- No, you have to check.
 It's not private.

120
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
- Good!

121
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
What a star in the middle!

122
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,480
- Is it like a snus who gets his first snuff in one day?

123
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
- It's probably a hundred times better than I think.

124
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
- Are you ever sad?

125
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,480
- Situations may well arise in life when you are sad.

126
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,480
But on the mini golf course it is never.
 It's like a paradise.

127
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,480
- You did not know that the mini golf course in Sundbyberg was paradise.

128
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
- For me, that's it.

129
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
- For you, this is paradise.

130
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,980
- Yes.

131
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,280
- My hands have blue of the cold and the rain.

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,780
And he just walks around and is happier than any other person can be all the time.

133
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,580
- Do you cope with two more holes?

134
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,080
- Easy.

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,980
- Yes, but we drive.

136
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,280
- I've started to get some your spark of life now I think.

137
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,280
No problem.
 I get another chance.

138
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
- Yes exactly.

139
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,580
- There you go.

140
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,780
- Nice.

141
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
- So then we have a track left.

142
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,780
- Yes, an exact same.

143
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,040
- No, but it doesn't matter that it is the same.
 It's just as fun for it as well.

144
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,920
- It does not matter.

145
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,420
- No no.

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,020
So yes!

147
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,840
- The last hole.

148
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,340
- Nice.

149
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,640
- How long should you stand here?

150
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,740
- Yes, it will be all evening.

151
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,020
- But ...

152
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,420
In other words...

153
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,740
I wonder if we are pulling.
 We have to work with something else.

154
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,260
So I can come back then.

155
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,760
- Easy.

156
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,060
- Yes.

157
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,320
Now it has been almost seven hours since we left Alexander.

158
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
On the mini golf course here.

159
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,720
Now let's see how he feels.

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Probably great.

161
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,080
Check, check, check out.

162
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
There he goes.

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Alone, in a headlamp.

164
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,520
In a pouring rain and plays mini golf.

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
So he is completely ...

166
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,560
He is absolutely incredible.

167
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Alexander!

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Your amazing person!

169
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,000
- Servant, Mauri!

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
- I have no words.

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,880
When you come here and you just stand here with your headlamp and have not given up.

172
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,680
- No, but it's fantastic fun this.
 That's my lifestyle.

173
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,080
- To stand here in the rain in Sundbyberg with a headlamp and drive mini golf.

174
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,080
- That's life.

175
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,440
- Does it take you now to leave in any way or do you feel ready?

176
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,960
- No, I will probably never feel completely clear.

177
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,200
But it's a day tomorrow with after all.

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Alexander also played mini golf the day after.

179
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,960
And the day after that and the day after that.

180
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,800
In a time when more and more is about success and money-

181
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,040
-Chusiak more people should be inspired by a guy-

182
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,440
-Which devotes all its time to what makes him happy.

183
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,480
However, we are moving on to the number four of the list.

184
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,800
Now it should be about perhaps the most common addiction that exists.

185
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,920
That is why we have a whole bunch with us.

186
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,160
You are all dependent on the same thing.

187
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
- Yes.

188
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
- Namely ...

189
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Sometimes the internet can feel a bit like this.

190
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Alert!
 Alert!

191
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,480
But NordVPN, with which this section is in paid collaboration, has a solution to it.

192
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Nordvpn is like a bodyguard for everything you do online.

193
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,480
They, as well as discourage all evil forces so you can feel calmer and safer on the internet.

194
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Let me tell me more.

195
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,480
With Threat Protection, NordvPN's damaged links identify and warn before clicking on them.

196
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Congratulations!
 You've won a phone.

197
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Wow!

198
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,480
- AP AP AP.
 You can't go in here.
 It is very dangerous for you.

199
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,480
And if you want to see series that are only available in other countries,-

200
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,480
-Then Nordvpn can move to a completely different country.

201
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Against the Baltic!

202
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Yes, a little more like this is life with NordvPN.

203
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Quiet, safe and wonderful.

204
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,360
Now you get an extra four months if you sign up on a two -year plan on the link in the description.

205
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,440
It is risk-free and you have a 30 days the money back guarantee.

206
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,920
An objective manner.
 Good offer.
 Thanks, Nordvpn.

207
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,480
- You are all dependent on the same thing.
 -Yes.

208
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,800
- Namely ...

209
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
-Nose spray!
 -Nose spray!

210
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
- God what a bad sound.
 Can we do it again?

211
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,640
- Namely ...

212
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,240
- Nose spray!

213
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
- Good gang!

214
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,440
When I asked for tips on unusual addictions, I was shocked at how many are actually completely stuck in nasal spray.

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,120
It's like a people's disease we never talk about.

216
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,240
So I chose to gather eight of the country's most nasal spray dependent people.

217
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,520
- You are a quiet, quite large minority in Sweden.

218
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,640
- Yes exactly.
 It is only now that we are starting to feel that it is not shameful anymore.

219
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,880
That is why we gather once a week.

220
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,160
And just talking.

221
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,520
It is so common that nowadays you can shout at a party if you end.

222
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,280
Does anyone have?
 And there is someone.

223
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,160
- It is so!

224
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,880
In any group, there is one that wears it.

225
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,360
- Everyone has like ...

226
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,080
Yes.

227
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,880
And you have three!

228
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,440
What do you usually drive, Mona?

229
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
- Nasonex.

230
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
- You're Nasonex girl.

231
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,000
- Yes.

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
- Nasonex girl we have here.

233
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,960
- You feel like one of those who run the heaviest on nasal spray.

234
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,000
- Yes, I drive pretty hard.

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
- Yes, you do.

236
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,520
- I've even tattooed Otrivin on the foot.

237
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,020
- huh?

238
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,300
Huh?

239
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,620
Oh!

240
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,320
He has an Otrivin tattoo!

241
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,040
What the hell!

242
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
- No, I love Otrivin.

243
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,120
- You know what?
 You notice that almost a little.

244
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,160
And I have actually prepared some nice mingle for us.

245
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,680
- Yes, incredible!

246
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,340
Are there canapés?

247
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,140
- No.

248
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
- No, okay.
 We still drive.
 We still drive.

249
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,460
No!

250
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
What?

251
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,460
- God, this will be like an AA meeting.

252
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,460
- And how sick you are who bring this to an AA meeting.

253
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,460
- Cheers!

254
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,380
Yes, Satan.
 Yes that is good.

255
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,460
Then I let our nasal sprays mingle a bit and have a nice moment together.

256
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,540
But what they didn't know was that I had an evil plan to put into work.

257
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,540
Oh!

258
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,300
- I fill this whole to the last picture when we just let it rain.

259
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,580
- I'm not going to submit mine ... I'm not going to leave my own.

260
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,060
- That's what I do.

261
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,540
- But God ... unless I get this back, Mauri ...-

262
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,760
- It is quiet!

263
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,200
- But what are you going to do with them?

264
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
- Should I put it down?

265
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,320
- Yes, it's not dangerous.

266
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,280
- So, I will look out.

267
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,760
Can anyone check if the door is locked?

268
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,000
But wait, now it became a picture here.

269
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,160
- Hello there, players.

270
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,600
The door out is locked and I have taken all your nasal spray.

271
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,260
- We have to break up the door.

272
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,020
- the one who can stay locked up in this room the farthest

273
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,260
- Wins nasal spray worth over SEK 3500.

274
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
- Oh!

275
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
- Good luck!

276
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,780
- I'm already craving Otrivin!

277
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,180
- Does anyone really feel they will go out right away?

278
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,780
This is the o-scent that ever happened to me.

279
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,580
On the other hand, 3500 bucks worth of nasal spray.

280
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,180
I think I will take this.

281
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,980
I shit in this shit.

282
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,180
Let me out!

283
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,380
But that is an abuse.

284
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,980
- Was it?

285
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,540
- Yes, I will sue you.

286
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,980
- Okay, Gunilla Persson.

287
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,700
- Yes Yes.

288
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,140
- You've got your nasal spray back.
 You've got a little goodie bag.

289
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,660
Thank you for meeting you.

290
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,460
- Yes, but thank you.

291
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,100
- It was really nice.

292
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
- It was really…

293
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,740
It really was ... MHM

294
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:34,380
The hours were slowly ticking forward, but one by one our heroes began to fall for the nasal rest.

295
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,340
Now we need…-

296
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,780
-Ah, now!

297
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,540
- Mauri, Mauri, Mauri.
 What should we do with you when we get out?

298
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,540
- So, how long are you prepared to stay in this room?

299
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,620
- No, I fight.
 I am considering re -booking the air ticket.

300
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,180
- Are you thinking about re -booking the air ticket?

301
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,380
- Yes.
 This will be personal now, Mauri, between you and me.

302
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,060
- Then just wait for these people to get out.

303
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,060
- I usually hear that I have a pretty lovely laugh by many.

304
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,780
This is not the first time.
 I'm not trying to get it, but it will come when it comes.

305
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,060
Are you hot in here?

306
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,060
- Sweden's best laughter you have.
 I die.

307
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,060
Robin's wonderful laughter just kept going.

308
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,060
And continued.
 And continued.

309
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,940
But it turned out to be a winning strategy.

310
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,180
- Do I both of you?
 -Yes.
 It was the laughter that ...

311
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,220
Everyone became pissed.
 This will be a struggle.

312
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
- When the two ... - two strong individuals.

313
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,180
- It will last for a long time.
 - Yes, definitely.

314
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:52,817
- It feels hard.
 I always have one on me so it's a little tough not to have one in my pocket.

315
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:55,817
- I'm really, really, really kissed.

316
00:14:55,817 --> 00:15:03,896
But I have a plan that I should try to persuade that we should go out together and take the win both.

317
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,500
I can imagine going out together.

318
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,300
Otherwise we can sit here all weekend.

319
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,900
- Okay then.

320
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,580
- Should we?

321
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,080
- Yes.

322
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,680
- Now are they going?

323
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,400
Now they go.

324
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,980
Now they come out!

325
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,980
Yes!

326
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,980
Oh!

327
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
Oh!

328
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
Hahaha!

329
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
Hahaha!

330
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Hahaha!

331
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,980
Hahaha!

332
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Bye!
 Bye!

333
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,980
And there somewhere, with a lot of nasal spray, we leave Alva and Robin for the number three of the list.

334
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
- And now we are here with Klara.

335
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,980
- Hello!

336
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,980
- What is fun to see you!

337
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,980
- The same!
 What are you on the mood?

338
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,980
- I'm so damn happy!

339
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,980
- How long have you had your addiction, ready?

340
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,980
- I would say from the age of 11, but it's probably longer.

341
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,980
But it's like constant.
 If I do not, then I can become a huge deck.

342
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,980
- And the clear is dependent on is ...

343
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Chewing gum!

344
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
- Is it good?

345
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
- Yes, it's great!

346
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Here we have Klara who since she was 11 years old had a chewing gum in her mouth every awake and sleeping second.

347
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:33,980
One and a half packages a day for 15 years means that during her life she consumed 180,000 chewing gums.

348
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,980
- When you were 11 you became addicted to chewing gums and have now had it in your mouth all the time.

349
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
- Damn what sick it is when you say that.

350
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
- It's absolutely incredible really.

351
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,791
- Now we sit here with Viggo.

352
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,140
- Well!

353
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,940
- Nice to get a hello from you.

354
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,180
What is it like to have a girl who is addicted to chewing gum?

355
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,060
- The worst is probably in sleep during the night.

356
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,980
I wake up with chewing gum myself on my face.

357
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,700
In bed it is like chewing gum everywhere.

358
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,620
But that's it.
 It's serious.
 It's not good at all.

359
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,620
When I notice the chewing packages ...

360
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,860
- May I take chewing gum.
 It starts to water.

361
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,030
- Wait how long have you been without chewing gum now?

362
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,084
- One minute.

363
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,340
It is watered in the mouth.

364
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,900
- Wait, wait, wait.

365
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,660
Could you help me Viggo?

366
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,580
- I dare not.

367
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,694
- I here more here.

368
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:31,740
No I have not.

369
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,500
- I just want to see what happens.

370
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:42,580
- It is good.
 She needs this.
 We need this.
 I need this.

371
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,860
- It will be so unpleasant.
 I already know how I start to lose my mood.

372
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,194
- This is very exciting for us.

373
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,900
But Viggo Do you chew chewing gum?

374
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,660
- No absolutely not.
 My flora in my mouth is probably good.

375
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,660
- I get it.

376
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,469
- Oom, they were good.

377
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:02,620
- God, what a nasty.

378
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,180
It feels like this is going to start your poop's need again.

379
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,780
May I say that?

380
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,980
- My stomach is not very good Mauri.

381
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,140
- Do you have to on the toilet?

382
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,312
- He has wanted to poop all morning, but he has thought that they will now.

383
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:19,740
So then I said it smells too much.

384
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,740
- He's staying right now?

385
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,500
- But you see that.

386
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,380
Honey, go to the toilet.

387
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,980
- Mauri I do for you.
 Or I don't.
 I don't know why I do it?

388
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,980
- But you, take off the mosquito.

389
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,980
- No, but the mosquitoes should be with us, now we drive.

390
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
- Hahaha, now we do this for real.

391
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,980
It's an exciting side track we got.

392
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,980
Short update then, now Klara has been without chewing gum for almost 15 minutes.

393
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,980
- Satan in hell how strong you are.

394
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
- greedy hands.

395
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
- Oh sorry.

396
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Oh, Mauri!

397
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Press away with your feet now.

398
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,660
-I do not want to.
 -Uh-oh!

399
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,980
-What do we do?

400
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:14,140
No, but ... Viggo!
 I say it!

401
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,340
Check out how happy he is!
 You are so easy!

402
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,740
-Hey!
 Hi Mauri!

403
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,620
-Nice!
 Hello!

404
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,282
- Now the moment has come.

405
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:27,648
- No!
 For real?

406
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:28,620
- Now you should get chewing gum.

407
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,860
Should we sit down at the table and do we serve you?

408
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,103
- Yes !!

409
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,740
- This is going to be so damn fun!

410
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,140
This is so damn good!

411
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,220
Life!

412
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,740
- If she had to choose between me or chewing gum, I go and think about almost daily.

413
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,180
- What would you choose?

414
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,580
- We don't have to talk about that.
 It feels so damn nasty.

415
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:11,980
I can say that I had chosen him, but in practice ...

416
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,860
- I have one last thing I would like to do with you.

417
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,740
It requires us to go away from here.

418
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,100
- Should we buy chewing gum?

419
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,980
- No Unfortunately not.
 It won't be so fun.

420
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,980
- Come, Clara.

421
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,683
- I should now tie your hands.

422
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:39,683
- Excuse me?

423
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,796
-Yes exactly.

424
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:43,660
- I'm really kidnapped.

425
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,911
- You have no idea what is in front of you right now?

426
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,130
- No.

427
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,660
- In gum would be reasonable.

428
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,660
- I will take off your blindfold.

429
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,660
- No!
 No!
 No!

430
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,660
It was the sickest, what have you done!

431
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,660
- Sit still!
 Hit!
 Hit!

432
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,660
Calm, calm, calm, calm, calm, calm!

433
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,660
- No!

434
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,660
- Here we have your little siblings your boyfriend.

435
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,660
Your family stands here, on one side.

436
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,660
On this page we have extreme amounts of chewing gum.

437
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,660
I just want to ask you to choose between your family or chewing gum.

438
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:40,660
I will not hurt them directly, but I think your family would like you to choose them in this situation.

439
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
Do you want to say something?

440
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,660
- Honey now you have your choice here in front of you.
 Choose us now.
 Look at us.

441
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,660
We need rescue.

442
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,660
- It's enough there.

443
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,660
- Check, stellas mine.

444
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,060
Stella, you become ...

445
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Do you get sorry if I don't choose you?

446
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,820
- You can ignore those chewing gums.

447
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
If you choose chewing gum ...

448
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,780
The family is more expensive than chewing gum?

449
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
- So now the question is ready.

450
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
What do you choose?

451
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,540
- It's tempting.

452
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,020
But I choose these.

453
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,020
I choose the family.

454
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
I chose you.

455
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Obviously I choose you.

456
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:43,020
Our big hero chose his little siblings and if you make such brave decisions, you are obviously rewarded with a lot of chewing gum.

457
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,020
For us, it now carries on to Gothenburg and the list number two.

458
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,900
- Now we are here with Vera.
 Have you ever heard of someone who has the same addiction as you?

459
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,900
- No I do not have it.
 I think I'm the worst.

460
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,660
- and the vera is addicted to is ...

461
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,660
... rinse aid.

462
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,140
- Yes.

463
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:13,500
Now it becomes more unexpected.
 Vera has a physical desire to smell of rinse aid.

464
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,940
Remember a hundred inhalations every day for many years.

465
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,700
- What are you addicted to?

466
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,340
- The scent.
 But it is not wrong if you lick a little too.
 It can also be good.

467
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,460
I haven't started drinking it yet, but it's just lick.

468
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,660
- I get a little ... - you can be.

469
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,460
- But it's good, of course.
 -Yes it is.

470
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
May I also smell?

471
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,340
- You really want it?
 - Yes, I want to smell.

472
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,580
Yes ... you just want to clinch.

473
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,340
- If it was completely harmless, how fast would it be for you to lower it?

474
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,180
- Great.
 I get so hungry when you say so.

475
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,940
- Do you know anyone else who has this addiction?

476
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,380
- Yes, my friend Cassandra, which I have included in this.

477
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,100
- Do you have a friend who has become addicted to you now?

478
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,620
- Yes, I have happened to make her addicted.
 Should we call her?

479
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,340
- Another rinse -dependent young woman.

480
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,420
- Can you be a little angry about Vera because she gave you this addiction?

481
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,140
- No!
 I'm so happy that she gave me that.
 It's a good scent that I can't describe.

482
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,260
You don't think about anything but just that scent.

483
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:34,940
- If I put on some song that you like and then we massage each other at the same time ...

484
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,500
Then you become so satisfied.
 And then just inhale.

485
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,700
- mm, so nice.

486
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,140
- Vidar, you are Vera's little brother.

487
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,860
How does it feel to have a sister who is addicted to rinse aid?

488
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,620
Good.
 In business if you follow along, you also usually smell.

489
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,241
- She usually open them.

490
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,326
- You have also started to smell?

491
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:00,452
- Eh yes, sometimes.

492
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,260
- If you want to become addicted to something when you get older, what would you like to become addicted to?

493
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,820
- Enough gasoline.

494
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,940
The smell of gasoline.

495
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,060
- I think that can be a little dangerous.

496
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,190
So I may not think you should.

497
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,380
- Okay.

498
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,340
Can I have a hand?
 Rinse aid.
 That might be enough.

499
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,340
Then we went to the grocery store to shop a little for tonight's movie.
 With the rinse aids.

500
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,020
- How many times have you been here and sniffed?
 - For many times.

501
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,500
- Get open?
 -We do not know.
 But we do it anyway.

502
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,780
- We are about to buy rinse

503
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,580
Now it was time to speed up.

504
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,500
But on the way out I got the idea that the girls would try to explain their addiction to other customers.

505
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,420
- This is the rinse agent.
 I wonder what you think about it.

506
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,220
- I can test.
 Yes, it smells like detergent.

507
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,740
- What do you like about rinse aid?
 - It's not my thing.

508
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,340
- You get a wonderful feeling in the brain and the body.

509
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,060
- No, I've never come there.

510
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,500
- You are Norwegian?

511
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,420
- Fan do you do here?
 - Yes, I've been here 40 years.

512
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,060
- Oh, damn!
 Welcome.

513
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,540
Do you feel something special in the body when you breathe it?

514
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,940
- You will be happy.
 - Surely you will be?

515
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,300
Now we have finally found some who also feel that way.

516
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,740
- But do you usually smell rinse aid?

517
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,540
- Yes!
 It's mine ... I usually do it when I'm at Dollarstore and stuff like that.

518
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,860
- huh!?

519
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,980
- But what are the odds that we meet you here ... but god!

520
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:42,300
What are you doing tonight?
 We will have a movie night and smell of rinse aid.

521
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,860
Do you want to ... it became a no from ...

522
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,620
It would have been fun if you could come by.

523
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
You are skeptical.

524
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Vidar We found two girls at ICA.

525
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:03,163
Okay, welcome at movie mud!

526
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,450
- Thanks so much.

527
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:10,203
- It is her father who calls who wonders where they are.

528
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:13,845
So they are on film mud with rinse aid theme.

529
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:16,565
You are so welcome, right?

530
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:18,005
- Yes, very welcome.

531
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:20,000
- So fun for you to meet each other.

532
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,492
- Yes, like it's meant.

533
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,521
- I'm getting a little strange.

534
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,966
- Vidar, I think you have smelled enough for tonight.

535
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,220
Vidar now you have to stop sniffing.
 Now we have to put it away.

536
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,180
Give back, Vidar.

537
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,020
Do you want your daughters to come home?
 We're pushing them home now.

538
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,100
Vidar, final words to the camera?

539
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,540
- Don't forget to sniff rinse aid.

540
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,300
Or do you know, however, do not sniff rinse aid.
 Instead, focus on the last person section.

541
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,580
This girl who will soon give a surprise that ends in tears.

542
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,780
- Now we stand here with Molly.
 Shall we tell you?

543
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,780
- Yes.
 Do you want to tell us?

544
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,580
- I can tell.
 I can tell the world.

545
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,700
Sun side!

546
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
- Yes!
 God, what a nice one!

547
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,780
Of all the dependencies, almost Molly almost fascinated me the most.

548
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,300
She has seen all eight seasons up to 500 times

549
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,460
- And has spent about 10,000 hours of their lives seeing the Sun side.

550
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,420
This corresponds to over four years of full -time work on a job.

551
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,540
- There are as many spa hours as the mick has.

552
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,700
- A small sunny garnish.
 It is absolutely incredible.

553
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,580
- There is no one in the world who has seen Solsidan more than you.
 - It can't be.

554
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,700
- Is it feeling that you need the sun side now?
 - Yes, it is often.

555
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,060
I would say it's a bit like sniffing.

556
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,660
- Should we go up and see some sunny side?

557
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,260
- Love to.

558
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,620
We'll do that.

559
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,420
- You're so hungry.

560
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,940
- This song I usually listen to.

561
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,460
On Spotify all the time.

562
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,380
- Is it true?

563
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,740
- I love that you think it's fun.

564
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,220
- Yes.

565
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,420
Wait, you have to see.

566
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,020
You have to see this.

567
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
We do not smoke in here.

568
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,020
But fuck!

569
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
Do you think so damn here I will?

570
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,220
I'm so nice.

571
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,220
I am so relaxed.

572
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,220
It's so damn well thought out everything in here.

573
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
And it is false too.

574
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
As soon as someone goes out, well then the others start to be.

575
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,620
Oh what the mouths go.

576
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,020
It is possible that the saliva sprays around here.

577
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,220
Anna, now I think ... Now it's me to talk here for a little while.

578
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,020
- You can really like the whole script.

579
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,220
Season 1 to 8.

580
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,060
- You might think that I have practiced the scenes like this, but that's only because I've seen it.

581
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,460
- So many times?
 It sits so deep in here.

582
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,780
-Where are we now?
 - We are the sun side.

583
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,660
- We are not in the sun side, we are the sun side.

584
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,820
This is where they recorded.
 Now let's take a while here and see everything.

585
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,820
You notice that you are a little ...

586
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,820
- I'm really fun.

587
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,820
- Why are you annoying?

588
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,820
- Because you recognize everything.

589
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
It feels very soft.

590
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,820
Here is the tennis court.

591
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
God, yes here it is.

592
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,820
- Now we will soon go into this famous walkway

593
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,820
- Is that it?

594
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,820
I even recognize the gravel sounds.

595
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,820
I just want to go here for all the time.

596
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,820
No, here is the house.

597
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
No, but God.

598
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
- I actually have a thing left.

599
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,820
Oh, do you imitate me?

600
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,220
I would like to call the producer for Solsidan.

601
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,740
- Ohh, I panic.

602
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,140
- You get like the annoyance of talking to the producer.

603
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,620
- I kind of want to move away from you because I get a little nervous.

604
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,860
- Hello!

605
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,060
- Hello!

606
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,580
- You have a little news for Molly.

607
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,380
- Yes.

608
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,940
- Okay, what's going to happen now?

609
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,860
- I don't know if you have heard that it will be further seasons.

610
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,700
- Yes, I have control over.
 I have seen that.

611
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
- No!

612
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Now I'm starting to cry.

613
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Now I'm starting to cry.
 Yes.

614
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,820
- You should get a small role in Solsidan we thought.

615
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,020
- God.

616
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,420
But we were not ready there so I cheated Molly that I was going to a meeting.

617
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,420
- Is it okay that we just slip away?

618
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
- Yes.
 God yes.

619
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,980
- Small home run.
 We should definitely not have a meeting.

620
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,940
We will go in here and pick up the large sunny side icon Henrik Dorsin, Ove Sundberg.

621
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,500
He will come and surprise Molly.

622
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,780
There we have him.

623
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,540
- Hello.

624
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,460
- Hello, Henrik.

625
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
- Mustache.

626
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,340
- Mustache?

627
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:09,940
Two?

628
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:13,740
- Yes it is.
 Then I know I'm right out if you have it.

629
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,300
We sat and looked at the sun side with her earlier.

630
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,900
- You did, yes.

631
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,980
- She knows all the replicas in all eight seasons.

632
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,940
- Oh, there are actually some sections I haven't seen.

633
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,860
- She has seen them every 400 times.

634
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,180
- It's completely senseless.
 What a human being.

635
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:38,100
I get a little worried that I can live up to her ...

636
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,980
She does not know that I will come.

637
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,580
- She doesn't have a rush.
 She thinks we're at a meeting.

638
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:50,300
- I'm not saying this for fun, but I'm a little worried about how she should react.

639
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,980
But it also does not feel like your dream situation that someone is starting to cry in front of you.

640
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
- I'm used.
 Many people start crying.

641
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,700
- Wherever you go to town.
 - Yes, they start crying.

642
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,460
I don't know why, but they cry and cry and cry.

643
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,580
Fortunately, I am a very good consolation.

644
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,700
What is it?

645
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,180
Was not very set up here, but ...

646
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,260
Are we there?

647
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,920
- Now we are there, Henrik.
 Now she will be surprised.

648
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
- Allright.
 Here we go.

649
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,160
- In here it is.

650
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,860
- Will she see me here now?

651
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,460
- I don't think so, because she sits a little further in.

652
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,640
- Is she unstable?

653
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,000
- No, she is doing the top.
 But it will be a lot for her, I think.

654
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,680
But we go in.

655
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
- We see.
 This will be fun.
 Experiment.

656
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:41,289
- Servant man!

657
00:33:42,209 --> 00:33:43,209
- No!

658
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,968
Now I start crying again!

659
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,729
I'm crying again!

660
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:50,768
- No!

661
00:33:50,768 --> 00:33:52,729
No, I'm crying again!

662
00:33:52,768 --> 00:33:53,768
- You should not cry.

663
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:54,808
- Yes.

664
00:33:54,808 --> 00:33:55,808
- Okay.

665
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:59,080
I hope it is out of joy and not of horror.

666
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
- What have you done?

667
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Yes I see it.

668
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
I just want to...

669
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
- It's fine.

670
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
- He must be patted.

671
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
- That is sick.

672
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
- Had it been easier for you?

673
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,600
If Henrik just stepped into a little more into the character Ove,

674
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
-and you talk to Ove.

675
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
- Did it have things simplified for you?

676
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
- I know, yes ...?

677
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Yes, yes.

678
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
- Yes, what fun.

679
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
Is that your cookies?

680
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,480
- We got them here.

681
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
- So it is...?

682
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,480
- It's ours, yes, exactly.

683
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,160
- If you are not going to have more, we can take it.

684
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Then we just gather here.

685
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
- Would you like to say hello with a hug?

686
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:54,920
- Yes.

687
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,280
- It's fine.

688
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,780
- Is it going well?

689
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,280
- It's going great.

690
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
- I say hello then.

691
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
- It was so sick.

692
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,620
- Yes.

693
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,400
- How nice you look.

694
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,680
- Yes, but the same.

695
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,600
- Thank you very much, Henrik.

696
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,100
- Yes.

697
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
- Do you think you can get a little bag just for this?

698
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
- Now he went back into character.

699
