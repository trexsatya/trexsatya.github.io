3
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:11,646
Great!

4
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:14,905
It's fantastic weather today!

5
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:17,936
A real winter!

6
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:21,323
It's snowing.

7
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:24,196
It's not cold.

8
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:26,887
It's so wonderful!

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:49,905
I want to tell you about Hu we throw our garbage - sort.

10
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:53,553
We live in a chain house.

11
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:06,000
We have two garbage cans.

12
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,050
A garbage can is for ...

13
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,816
What a nice snow!

14
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:31,431
We can look together.

15
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,166
coloured glass

16
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:38,671
food waste

17
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,308
Residual waste

18
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:48,526
newspapers and recycled paper

19
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:59,429
It is a lot of residual waste and food waste.

20
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:06,414
But not so much colored glass.

21
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,415
And no newspapers

22
00:02:09,124 --> 00:02:12,892
They are empty.

23
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,663
This is how it is:

24
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,021
This garbage can be emptied every two weeks.

25
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:27,275
Once every two weeks

26
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,245
Today we received a message.

27
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:36,952
We have an app on the phone.

28
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:43,655
We have received a message that we must exhibit garbage cans 1 for emptying.

29
00:02:52,147 --> 00:02:54,147
The emptying is tomorrow.

30
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:59,296
The garbage truck will come tomorrow and then they will empty the garbage can.

31
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:10,009
The garbage can be emptied by the garbage truck.

32
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:16,409
The garbage truck should empty the garbage can.

33
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:35,262
We look what is here.

34
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:41,644
Here it is plastic packaging.

35
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:50,618
paper packaging

36
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:58,165
unpainted glass, only bottles and jars

37
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,115

41
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:36,061
They should pick up the garbage.

42
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,250

43
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,571
