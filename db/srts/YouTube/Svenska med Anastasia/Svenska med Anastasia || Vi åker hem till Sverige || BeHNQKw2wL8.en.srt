1
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:04,128
Good morning!

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:07,535
It is half past six in the morning.

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:09,779
We are going home.

4
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:14,034
The suitcases are packed.

5
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:17,516
It's dark outside.

6
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:22,630
It's dark and cold outside.

7
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:30,069
We check out from the hotel.

8
00:00:32,843 --> 00:00:36,856
We go to the bus stop.

9
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:41,161
This is a bus stop.

10
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,863
We stand on the bus stop.

11
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,000
We are waiting for the bus.

12
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:53,124
We are going to take a bus to Barcelona.

13
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:57,273
... to the airport located in Barcelona.

14
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:02,631
The bus is coming.

15
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,645
We get on the bus.

16
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:18,911
We take a bus to the airport.

17
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:27,000
Now we're going to fly.

18
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,562
We will fly to Sweden.

19
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:35,690
It takes 4 hours to fly.

20
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:43,563
But we can use magic.

21
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:49,456
I can a magical frame.

22
00:01:58,116 --> 00:02:01,110
We want to come home now!

23
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:09,094
It does not work.
 One more time!

24
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:22,475
What have I said?!

25
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,359
We are home!

26
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,159
We are home now.

27
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:35,492
But of course I am kidding.

28
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,262
It does not work.

29
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:57,255
Then we have to fly as usual.

30
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,380
Come we check in.

31
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:16,133
What do we do on the flight?
 Write in comments!

32
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:25,870
The bus is coming.

33
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,614
We get on the bus.

34
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:34,912
We take a bus.

35
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:41,213
We flew for 4 hours.

36
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:45,315
We took a bus home.

37
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,134
Now we are at home.

38
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:51,135
It's evening.

39
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:54,541
It is at 16.00.
