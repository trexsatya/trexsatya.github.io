00:00:00,558 --> 00:00:02,558
Hello everyone!
 Hello!

2
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:06,313
How are you?
 Are you feeling good?

3
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:08,546
I feel good.

4
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:12,550
Do you know?
 I have received mail.

5
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,581
Come, we look together!

6
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:24,816
Here is my mailbox.

7
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:29,921
On the mailbox it says: No advertising!

8
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:37,761
I open the mailbox.

9
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:48,127
Look what a good thing!

10
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:02,710
This is an envelope.

11
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:07,038
We go and open.

12
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,612
It's a Christmas card!

13
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:28,814
Three spruces

14
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:39,441
It's from Szilvi, my colleague.

15
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:43,073
It stands Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

16
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,738
Have a really cozy and nice Christmas

17
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:04,662
And an exciting 2021!

18
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,776
Everything good wishes Szilvi!
