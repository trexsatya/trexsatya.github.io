1
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:04,883
Hey my friends!
 Good morning!

2
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:07,935
It's early in the morning.

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,093
It's half past seven.

4
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:16,222
It's Friday today.

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:21,622
Tomorrow it is Saturday.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:34,218
My children eat sweets on Saturdays.

7
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:39,908
Saturday candy

8
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,658
I'm on my way to work.

9
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:57,000
But first I will shop.

10
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:03,444
I'm going to buy candy.

11
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:07,494
Follow!

12
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:23,484
Open every day

13
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,083
candy

14
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,857
A lot of candy

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,810
Loose weight candy

16
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:19,180
Now I have to weigh candy.

17
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:38,461
Now I go to the checkout.

18
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:47,063
Continue!

19
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,201
I will pay by card.

20
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:13,497
a receipt

21
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:29,143
I shop on Friday morning, then there are not so many people.

22
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,457
There are not so many people in the store.

23
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:43,159
On Saturday and Sunday there are a lot of people in the store.

24
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:45,294
Everyone shops.

25
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:50,600
I try to shop on Friday for example,

26
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:58,140
Or on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday in the morning.

27
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:06,444
Or when it's lunchtime, then there are some people too.

28
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:11,460
I've received a receipt.

29
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,000
We read together.

30
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:16,151
I have to hurry to work.

31
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:19,663
The job starts at 8am.

32
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,668
That's almost 300 grams.

33
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:01,959
I have three children so it is enough.

34
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:10,542
My children eat sweets on Saturdays.

35
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:23,337
Dentists say that you should eat sweets max once a week.

36
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:26,418
not every day

37
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:35,162
Children in Sweden eat sweets on Saturdays.

38
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:01,531
Now I will go to work

39
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:05,124
And you may be moved straight to tomorrow.

40
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:11,217
They are eating breakfast.

41
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:23,652
It's Saturday Today.

42
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:29,720
The kids have eaten breakfast.

43
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,375
Now it's time for Saturday candy.

44
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,329
Hello children!
 Look!
