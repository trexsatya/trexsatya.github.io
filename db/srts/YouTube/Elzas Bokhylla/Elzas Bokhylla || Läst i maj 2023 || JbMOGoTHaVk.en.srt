00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,270
Hi, Elza here from Elza's bookshelf.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,270
It's time to summarize May month's reading.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,270
It's been a totally okay month.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:18,560
The best thing about this month has been that I have finished three series.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,560
I am not such a reader who has many series going on and has not finished them.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,590
For those of you who hang out here know that when I start a series, I would like it to ...

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,590
So I swallow them at once and I don't start a series.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,690
Or it happens, of course.

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,690
But I prefer to start a series that already has an end.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,690
So it's not like this, oh I've finished three series of such.

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,690
But it's fun to finish a series anyway.

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,690
And I have done three pieces.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,690
It's been a totally okay month.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,690
Many of these books I have to say, they have given me very good reading experiences for the moment.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,690
But in hindsight, I don't remember much of them.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,690
I don't remember much about them.

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,010
So you know.

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,010
But do you know what?
 We start, we start a couple of books.

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,010
Start with the one I liked at least and ends with the one I liked best.

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,040
The first books I want to talk about are actually three books.

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Because I think I merges them here in some way.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,040
And it is actually "dust off", a couple of books that I have had for any length of time.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,260
Very long.

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,260
And I have grazed these three books in a series.

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
It's 6-7-8, numbers 6-7-8.

26
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,260
And I have grazed them.

27
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,260
Now I don't really remember how they come.

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,550
But I think this is ...

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,550
Here is number 6.

30
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,840
In the company of Muntra Women by Alexandra McCall-Smith.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,840
And then I think happens and a pair of blue shoes.

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
And number 8 then it is the good husband on Zebra Drive.

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,840
This is Botswana's first women's detective agency.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,840
I think the series is called the Women's Detective Agency.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Botswana's first female detective.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,840
And MMA Ramotswe, I think she pronounces it.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
And she solves cases.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,840
This is a cozy deck deluxe.

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,940
And I think I've read some cozy books nowadays.

40
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,940
And I feel that now I'm up here with them.

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
I feel now.

42
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,940
For several reasons.

43
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,940
This series is really a cozy deck.

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,940
Where the cases must not take place so much.

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Without it, it is more about those who work with her.

46
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,940
And Ramotswe himself.

47
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,220
MMA Ramotswe himself.

48
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,220
So I know I liked them very well.

49
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,220
But I haven't thought about how babbbar they were.

50
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,220
And how little of her rocky is.

51
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,220
What I liked a lot about the first three books I read.

52
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
Was that she was so smart.

53
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
She thought in her own way.

54
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,220
She solved these cases that were very fascinating and interesting.

55
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,220
But here it does not come out at all.

56
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,260
I will not read on this series.

57
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,260
I am very measured on this series.

58
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,260
So I think I all gave them to 2.5.

59
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
3 Max.

60
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,260
So there.

61
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,260
We say 3.

62
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,260
Rounds up a bit.

63
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,540
Thanks but no thanks again then.

64
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,540
Now I feel that I do not want a cozy deck.

65
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,540
Another book I want to talk about is The It Girl by Ruth Ware.

66
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
I will not talk about this very much about this.

67
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,540
Because I'm about to make a reading logo about it.

68
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,540
Because this is one of these books I do in my reading series.

69
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Where I read all the books that are nominated in Goodreads Choice Award.

70
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,540
And select your own winner.

71
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,540
Or what I like about the winner.

72
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,640
If the right book won.

73
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
But here we have to come along.

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
This is also such a book.

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Very exciting for the moment.

76
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Mystery Thriller.

77
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Classic mystery thriller like that.

78
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,640
And I don't remember the names.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,640
I remember what it is about but not the names or something like that.

80
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,640
We can accompany two girls.

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,640
They become best friends in college.

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
One of them is rich and fancy.

83
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
And one is a bit like us the other.

84
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
They become best friends.

85
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,800
One day she is found murdered in her ...

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
In their room.

87
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,800
And ten years after or fifteen years after so ...

88
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,800
It is a man who is allowed to be convicted of this murder.

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,800
But ten years later, he may not be the one who did.

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Twist Turns.

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I liked the end.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I liked Twist-ish.

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
But the road there was long.

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm not going to talk so much about it more.

95
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,800
What I think comes in a reading logo very soon.

96
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Within the next few days.

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
I hope.

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Another book that was also good for the moment type.

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
But as I also kind of forgot.

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Are heart lines of wide Bennett.

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
I listened to it.

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Also such a book that is very good.

103
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
It's about two sisters.

104
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,960
Maybe twin sisters.

105
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,960
I don't know the names.

106
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,960
One can be taken .. It is in the United States.

107
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
African American family.

108
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Two sisters.

109
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
One is so bright that she can be taken too white.

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,960
While the other is a little darker.

111
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
They are very tight.

112
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
But something happens in their lives.

113
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
They are separated.

114
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,960
We must follow their lives.

115
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,750
It was a long starting distance.

116
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,750
It was long.

117
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,750
It was very tough.

118
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,750
Incredibly tough.

119
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,750
When I think back, I remember scenes from it.

120
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,750
They were totally okay.

121
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,750
It is good.

122
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
It is well written.

123
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,750
But it was like ...

124
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,360
I experienced it as extremely tough.

125
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Just so scattered.

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
I didn't know what it wanted to tell me.

127
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
I gave it a third.

128
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
A weak one.

129
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm glad I read it.

130
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
But give me a month and I don't remember so much of it.

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Unfortunately.

132
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,390
I've read this month.

133
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,390
One of the series I have read.

134
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,390
This month is Saga about the Ringen triology.

135
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,390
Last month I read the first book, Saga about the ring.

136
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:24,390
They are so good that I swallowed the rest of the other two in May.

137
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,550
The one I want to talk first about is number three.

138
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,550
I have it in this edition.

139
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,550
Really heavy.

140
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,550
All three books are here in.

141
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,550
This is so heavy.

142
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,308
It's kind of a thousand pages, 950 plus thus, I don't know

143
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:44,550
All three books are here anyway, with illustration.

144
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,864
I actually listened to them, I just have to show

145
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,524
Here we have an illustration.
 This one is really nice anyway

146
00:06:50,524 --> 00:06:55,088
Of the three, I liked at least the story of the king's return,

147
00:06:55,088 --> 00:07:00,700
The reason for this is that there is a lot of fight scenes.
 It is very politically a little bit.

148
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,581
Fight scenes I think you look at.
 But I don't like to read about them.

149
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:10,293
So it was a lot so I just yes, yes, okay, they fight, so okay, yes, yes.
 So that's why.

150
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:16,355
I gave it a third, a strong, strong third.

151
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:21,158
Of the three books, I think that the king's return is the weakest.

152
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:26,816
Then we have the world's world literature.
 And I really want to like it.
 But I don't.

153
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,550
Not as much as I had hoped and actually thought I would do.

154
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,550
I actually thought I would like it.

155
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:40,110
I'm talking about the shadow king by Maaza Mengiste.

156
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,110
Maybe, you pronounce it.

157
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,340
Fantastic edition, so fantastic cover.

158
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,750
We may accompany Hirut, maybe her name is.

159
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,750
I don't remember that much.

160
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,750
We are in Ethiopia.

161
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,750
It is in the 30s.

162
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,750
It's fascism.

163
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,750
Italy comes in.

164
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,680
And so we can accompany a bunch of female soldiers most often.

165
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Soldiers or those fighting against the Italians.

166
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
And this should be the focus on the female.

167
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,100
I think it was tough bit by bit.

168
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
The language is amazing.

169
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I can't complain about the language so much.

170
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
But I think I feel it is a little too thick.

171
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,100
So for the long step best.

172
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,100
This poetic painting language is very beautiful.

173
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,100
But it gets too much when the book is so long.

174
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Then I wished I got more female characters.

175
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,100
We may have three, four women who are portrayed.

176
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,100
I wanted to have more focus on these female characters.

177
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
And then you jump a little here and there.

178
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,220
And I have a hard time keeping up.

179
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,220
But on the other hand, I have learned an incredible amount of this story.

180
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,220
A story that I did not keep in mind at all.

181
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,220
And I started to read something else.

182
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:05,220
It gave me a craving for other historical novels.

183
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,220
Or historical books about this time for Ethiopia.

184
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,220
I gave it a strong third.

185
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Because it is still important.

186
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,220
It is still readable.

187
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,220
And most importantly, it taught me something.

188
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,220
But I wished it would be easier to read.

189
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,220
It was difficult to pick it up.

190
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,220
I couldn't motivate myself to pick it up.

191
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,220
Then we have another book that I am reading about.

192
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:43,630
It's The Night Shift by Alex Finlay.

193
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,630
Here we have another one like this in this reading logo.

194
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:52,630
As I go through all the Goodreads Choice Awards nominations for best mystery thriller.

195
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,790
So I'm not going to talk very much about it either.

196
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,790
I hope, as I said, the vlog will come up soon.

197
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,790
I have another book in the reading logo that I am reading.

198
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,790
As I want to include in it.

199
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,820
This is also like this mystery thriller classic.

200
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:23,460
In 1999, a guy comes and kills a couple of young people in a blockbuster business.

201
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,460
Then it happens the same thing in the same city but in another deal.

202
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,460
Then there is a blogger who sustains this and wants to know more.

203
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,460
I thought this one was better, quickly sharper better.

204
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Partly because it is much shorter and gives a rap in the language.

205
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,460
But also that it was a little smarter written.

206
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,460
The resolution is smarter.

207
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,460
It's a little faster, it's going fast.

208
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,460
It has some tough sequences.

209
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,500
I think what, who, what all the time.

210
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
But I should also be honest.

211
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Give me a few more months and I will forget this book.

212
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
It is fantastic at the moment.

213
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
For the moment it was fun.

214
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
It was quick to read it, I liked it.

215
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I gave it a strong third.

216
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
But I will also be honest, I will not remember it.

217
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,530
It's not mindblowing.

218
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,530
But I liked this one.

219
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,530
It was quick to read, it was fun.

220
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,530
It was a trip like that.

221
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,530
Lovely trip like that.

222
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,530
But mystery thriller simply.

223
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:37,820
Now I have to talk about a book that helped my TBR.

224
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,820
As all other books had to wait.

225
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
I jumped on the train at once.

226
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
I'll be honest.

227
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,820
This is a book that the whole world has been waiting for.

228
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,820
At least I waited extremely impatient was me.

229
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
But when I got it, I swallowed it pretty much.

230
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,980
But, there is a men.

231
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,260
I talked about Atlas.

232
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
What is it called?

233
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
The story of Pa Salt by Lucinda Riley.

234
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,260
And her son Harry Whittaker.

235
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Whittaker?
 Whittaker?

236
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Harry.

237
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,260
This is the last book in the seven sisters series.

238
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,260
This ends everything.

239
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
All questions receive answers.

240
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,300
All all the mystery is only served to you.

241
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
The answer to this great mystery.

242
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Who and what and how.

243
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
In this book.

244
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
It delivers absolutely.

245
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
It delivers absolutely.

246
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,330
At the same time, I'm a little disappointed.

247
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,330
Because it is still a brick.

248
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,900
Shall we see.

249
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Over 600 pages.

250
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,570
So it's very tall, it's a brick

251
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,570
Despite that, I feel and I feel that it is accelerated.

252
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,570
It goes so fast.

253
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,570
Such pink shimmer around this.

254
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,430
How hard times they go through.

255
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,430
Pa salt goes through.

256
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,430
You find out about his whole story.

257
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,430
How it turned out.

258
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,430
All what happened.

259
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,430
I have to say that I think it was just too cute cute.

260
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,430
It was very easy.

261
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,430
It went too fast.

262
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,430
None too deep.
 There was no depth.

263
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,620
I'm disappointed with it.

264
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,620
I almost wished it was ...

265
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,670
I don't know what I would have liked.

266
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,670
But I would have liked more depth.

267
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,670
I had wanted more depth.

268
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,670
Everything else is great.

269
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,670
It is still fantastic.

270
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,670
We get answers and good answers.

271
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,670
It is an incredibly good ending.

272
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,670
We get an end.
 It's really nice.

273
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,700
Adventure.

274
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
He travels all over the world.

275
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Descriptions.

276
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Environmental descriptions are fantastic.

277
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
This is still a readable book.

278
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
But I think the strength of this series

279
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
are the strong female portraits.

280
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Not on salt.

281
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
To think about it.

282
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
Is that what makes me not fall?

283
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
I gave it in third.

284
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
A strong one.

285
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,368
It is still readable.
 I think the whole series is fantastic.

286
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:13,700
Do you like historical novels with strong female characters

287
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
So this series is for you.

288
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Absolutely.

289
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,740
Me who has followed this about

290
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Expectations and hopes

291
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,740
and all that

292
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,740
Poor this book.

293
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,740
It had so much on its shoulders.

294
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,740
Of course, you can't fulfill everything.

295
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
But totally okay.

296
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Absolutely okay.

297
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
Fantastic ending.

298
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
We got an end.

299
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:42,341
Top three now.

300
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,524
In third place I wanted to talk about

301
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,550
Oh what is it called.

302
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,785
I just have to read inside.

303
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,090
Oh I have it in Swedish.

304
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,090
The peculiar event with the dog

305
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,411
by Mark Haddon.

306
00:14:55,411 --> 00:14:58,090
So this was a month's coincidence.

307
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,090
Random was that I would read this book

308
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,090
by Haddon and I have a reading logo

309
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,090
I link it down in the description

310
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,250
So that I should not talk so much about it.

311
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,250
But

312
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,660
I feel that I am stressing through

313
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,660
sorry.

314
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
This book was very good.

315
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660
It's about Christopher

316
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Which then has

317
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660
a diagnosis.

318
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,660
I guess some kind of

319
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,365
Autism spectrum.

320
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:26,660
One day

321
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Does he find the neighbor's dog murdered

322
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660
so he decides to him

323
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,660
Solve the murder.

324
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660
Who has killed the dog?

325
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
This starts with some sort of

326
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,660
We are inside his head.

327
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
Here one begins

328
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
a little of one

329
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660
mystery as he solves

330
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,700
leading him to

331
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
things within their own family

332
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,700
which is revolving to him.

333
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,700
I gave it a four I think.

334
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
Three and a half, three and seventy five maybe.

335
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm not going to talk so much more about it.

336
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
I link the reading logo

337
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
If you want to know more about my thoughts

338
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
So there is

339
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
The link down there in the description.

340
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
The journey I took through that book.

341
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
But I liked it

342
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Although I have some thoughts too.

343
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
And there we have

344
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
and just yes, sorry

345
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
This one is others

346
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
The series I finish

347
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
this month.

348
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
And

349
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
we go back to the story of the ring

350
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
so we have this one

351
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
and in second place

352
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
will the story of the two towers

353
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,730
And I think

354
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,730
It is fantastic.

355
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,730
God what trip it has been.

356
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,730
I think it's great fun.

357
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,730
It's just so one

358
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,730
Classic adventure

359
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,730
with the hobbits

360
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,730
With the sorcerers

361
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,730
with the king

362
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,730
With the world building

363
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,890
It is incredibly good.

364
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,890
Long books, they are big and thick

365
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,890
But very easy to read

366
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,370
and

367
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,370
less song than I remember

368
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,370
thought it would be

369
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,370
And positively, I think.

370
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,370
No but i think this was

371
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,370
very good, i think they are great

372
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,370
I gave it a four

373
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,370
And want to see

374
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,370
about the movies, it's been a long time since I saw the movies

375
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,370
Actually, so I want to see them.

376
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,370
This is great, much much better

377
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,370
than I thought it would be.

378
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,370
For I read the first book

379
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,370
When I went to high school, it took a while

380
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,370
To take me through it.
 I started

381
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,370
The second book, thought it was so tough and

382
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:35,889
But so about 20 years later I devour them.
 No but this was great

383
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,370
What adventure was exactly what I wanted.

384
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,370
I wanted an adventure, I wanted an epic

385
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,370
Saga and world building

386
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,370
and no this was great

387
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,978
Oh what a good thing this was.

388
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:47,370
And in the first place we have

389
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,370
The third series I finished this month

390
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,370
As good as the dead by Holly Jackson

391
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,370
and it's third and last

392
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,370
The book I.

393
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,370
A Good Girl's Guide to Murder

394
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,370
I am not going to tell you so much about what this is about

395
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,370
but there we can follow along

396
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,550
Pippa is her name?
 Beep

397
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,550
which will then resolve

398
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,550
First book

399
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,550
Her school project

400
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,550
is to solve a five years

401
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,550
Old case

402
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,550
that happens in her city and this

403
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,550
first book and what happens in the first

404
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,550
the book has consequences and drawn

405
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,550
out in two books and now this is the final

406
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,550
As good as the dead.

407
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,550
I know this is a water divider

408
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,550
either you like it or you don't like it

409
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,550
because it takes one

410
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,550
other turn than what one first

411
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,550
Believe, it takes a darker turn

412
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,550
And you who hang out here know that I

413
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,550
prefer dark, deep

414
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,550
Complicated books

415
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,550
and this one is deep, it's dark

416
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,550
and it is sickly complicated

417
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,550
It's like gray zones

418
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,550
Deluxe and I love it

419
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,550
God what good this series was

420
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,550
I know I call it a four

421
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,550
But wholeness as a series I want to

422
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,550
give a full point

423
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,550
Great ending

424
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,550
I am really pleased

425
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,840
and that is so exciting

426
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
no but then it was

427
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,840
great, which, that is enough

428
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
really the only book

429
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
as really like this in a long time

430
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
As I was

431
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,840
for it is so smartly done for things

432
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,640
and ting is connected together

433
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
yeah that's good, it's great

434
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
I don't know why but it feels like me

435
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
stressed through, I hope that

436
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
I haven't done it, tell me in

437
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,640
comment field if there is anything else

438
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
you want to hear from

439
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
my thoughts on these books I have read

440
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
I pray so much about excuses

441
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
I don't know why it was more stressed

442
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
I felt it might not be like that

443
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
But of course I am curious as always

444
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640

445
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,640
