00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Right today is a special day here at F 7 Såtenäs -

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,520
–This we have received Finnish F-18–

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,360
- Without the Finnish clarification crew.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,560
We came to Såtenäs to work with the F-18 plan as part of Aurora 23.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,360
We teach our Swedish colleagues how to work with F-18-hunting plan-

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,080
-And in turn we will learn how to work with the Gripen plan.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,320
It has been very good to work with the Finns.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,480
They have been very accommodating and pleasant.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,040
They have gone through how their airplane works.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,040
We have had to try different handles, -

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,040
—The tanking, secure robots, -

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,120
—The Airplane, lay a block, -

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,040
- Creating things we do on our machines.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,560
We speak different languages, but our countries are so similar that everything just flows on.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,280
It will be great fun to work more with the Finns.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,280
I think we learn from each other and -

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,600
- During Aurora 23, I think we can grow stronger together.
