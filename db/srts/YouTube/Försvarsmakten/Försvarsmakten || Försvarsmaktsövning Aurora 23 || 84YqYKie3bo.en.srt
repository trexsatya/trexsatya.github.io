00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,120
The Armed Forces defend Sweden-

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,840
-The country's interest, our freedom and our right to live as we choose ourselves.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,200
The world we live in, our immediate area, is more uncertain than in a long time.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,640
Therefore, the Riksdag has decided that our military ability should increase.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,320
If Sweden is subjected to an armed attack, the Armed Forces' war federation is mobilized

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,600
-To be able to ward off the attack.

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,880
Everyone must know their role, and what to do if we are attacked.

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,920
Therefore, we carry out Armed Forces exercise Aurora 23-

Together with other parts of society and together with international partners.

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,434
We increase our ability to lead our bandages on the ground, at sea, and in the air-

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,520
-S and our ability to collaborate with the civil defense.

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,880
