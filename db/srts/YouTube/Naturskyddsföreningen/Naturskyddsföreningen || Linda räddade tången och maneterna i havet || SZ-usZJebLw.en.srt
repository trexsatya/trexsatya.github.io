1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,635
Now we are at Stora AmundÃ¶n, a nature reserve that we have some surveillance on -

2
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:10,499
- To protect this important eel grass.

3
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:22,751
A few years ago I read in the Gothenburg Post about the Port of Gothenburg and the Swedish Maritime Administration wants-

4
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,796
- deepen and dredge in Gothenburg harbor.

5
00:00:25,796 --> 00:00:31,278
They wanted to dump toxic mud masses in the archipelago outside Vinga.

6
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,659
I went together with others from the locals out on the islands.

7
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:41,814
We wrote together a name gathering and I wrote a debate article about this.

8
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:44,630
I sent it to the Land and Environmental Court.

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:50,961
And in the end, they got a no no on these poisonous mud masses not being allowed to end up in the sea -

10
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:54,062
- Without it, it must be deposited on land and be taken care of.

11
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:59,923
It looks pretty clear and nice in the water.
 We have a nice seaweed.

12
00:01:00,287 --> 00:01:07,377
And that the burns have come back - and they look pretty thick and saturated and satisfied.

13
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:12,649
I think we should dive a little neighbor.
 We'll see what it really looks like down there.

14
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:23,691
Here we have then ... Such a nice seaweed that has also become overgrowed by these fine -tough algae.

15
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:27,166
This fluff.
 As you can see, it is completely covered.

16
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,555
When we get too much nutrition from, for example, wastewater flooded when it is a rainfall -

17
00:01:33,555 --> 00:01:36,262
- So it grows very quickly.

18
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:44,000
It can cover this nice pliers we have here.
 And the sun can't penetrate.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,352
It does not get the sunlight that this pliers needs to grow and do its important work such as catching COPD.

20
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:59,422
Below me here, the pliers are covered by this.
 It looks like a big fluffy rug.

21
00:01:59,422 --> 00:02:05,794
And so we don't want it.
 We want it to look ... like this!

22
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:09,706
I probably wanted people around - in the public - in the public -

23
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:16,642
- Would be noticed in the important environments that are underwater as well.
 That they are affected by what we do.

24
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:19,657
How we run a boat, how we build jetties.

25
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:25,663
For people to participate and protect this close to the underwater nature, which is also very important.

26
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:28,069
It's not just big whales and sharks that are important -

27
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:35,636
- Without we also need the pliers, jellyfish and eel grass to have a healthy marine environment.
