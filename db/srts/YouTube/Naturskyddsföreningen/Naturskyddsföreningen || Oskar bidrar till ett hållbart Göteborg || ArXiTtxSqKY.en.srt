Hi, my name is Oskar Tagesson.

2
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:08,414
Is ideally involved in the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation in Gothenburg in an interest group called the City Planning Group.

3
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:16,611
Today we have gone to Lindholmen in Gothenburg, which is located just north of the central town, by the river.

4
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:22,535
And today we were thinking of going around here and checking out a bit of exciting examples of sustainable urban development.

5
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:37,400
In the city planning group in Gothenburg, a large part of the work is about writing opinions on various detailed plans -

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,597
- But it can also be infrastructure projects or various strategy documents that the city develops.

7
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:50,320
It is a large part of our work - to write these opinions on consultation and during review and participate and think and think.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,028
And pay attention to the municipality and citizens within the municipality -

9
00:00:57,028 --> 00:01:04,077
- Seeing how this building plan affects the environment and the climate goals, for example in Gothenburg.

10
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:10,675
Lindholmen is an area that has been operations and industries before.

11
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:20,468
So where it has been a gap - where there may have been parking areas or arrangements - you have managed to densify with new buildings.

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:30,388
We see that with several houses here.
 That you have received residential buildings on parking areas.
 And it is a very good way to build.

13
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:37,539
You do not use new natural land, but you use the areas already in the city.

14
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:50,301
It is also an effective way to build in existing areas.
 Then there is already the infrastructure - roads, bike lanes, sidewalks, road and water, electricity and all such.

15
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:59,535
My dream and vision for the organization and the city planning group is that we will continue on that track -

16
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:06,929
- That we are involved and influence and have great credibility at the municipality.
 But also be able to get even further there -

17
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:16,836
- And really become a voice that politicians and officials listen to and act based on it.

18
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:22,082
Here we have existing houses that are not used today maybe.

19
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:23,898
To a certain extent - some are still used.

20
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:31,069
We have huge surfaces, asphalt areas that have been parking spaces or arrangements.

21
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:40,917
And it is land that is already the claims in a city.
 So instead of building a residential building a little further out -

22
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:48,677
- Where you may need to cut down a forest or where you need to remove agricultural land or pastures -

23
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:55,125
- So you can build here instead where the ground is already used in a way.

24
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,755
So it is in the basic principle one of the sustainable stuff.

25
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:09,206
We at the Nature Conservation Association in Gothenburg want to see a green and sustainable city where we live in harmony with nature.

26
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:18,199
Where you are close to green areas, where you are close to school, for service, for work.

27
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:27,629
Where it is easy to live sustainably - you can walk, you can cycle to the nearest place you are going.

28
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,776
