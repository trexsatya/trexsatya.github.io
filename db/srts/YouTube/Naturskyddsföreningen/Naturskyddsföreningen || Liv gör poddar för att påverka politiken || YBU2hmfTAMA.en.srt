1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,432
One of the key words we chose to highlight in this pod project - and also throughout the election -

2
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:09,861
- Is accountability.

3
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:16,715
Review politics so we can say: "But you said like this in this pod section. Why wasn't it?"

4
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:19,450
Or why have you changed or what it is now?

5
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:25,506
Hi Janet Ågren!
 Hello Anders...!
 Hi Lena ...!

6
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:31,727
When we started thinking about the election - sometime in 2019 -

7
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:37,248
- Then we thought about what we can contribute.
 How can we develop local democracy?

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:47,045
Then we saw that a problem that local media has is to ask question three, four and five when interviewing about environmental and climate issues.

9
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,259
They rarely know the follow -up questions.

10
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:55,120
Then we felt that there a pod can fit well and ask follow -up questions.

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:04,929
Because we feel that you can get away but quite a lot of ignorance.
 In many issues, but also climate and environmental issues.

12
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:12,827
So we think this is both a way to show citizens what the politicians are actually answering -

13
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:20,560
- But also to form the politicians.
 Because they have to read on and reflect on these issues.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,000
But to my great shock, we are approaching 400 listeners to these pod sections.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,840
I don't know what local political madmen are.
 But they listen.

16
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,171
On this top of the island you want to build quite a lot of housing.

17
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:47,460
It has many advantages, but at the same time it means cutting down quite a lot of urban forest.

18
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:51,645
And limits biodiversity.

19
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:01,859
The expansion has been paused because you have seen white -backed woodpecker there, but you want to get them to move from there.

20
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:11,646
We talk about such urban building issues in the pod.
 And quite so much also in the Nature Conservation Association Umeå.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,256
I hope and wish for circles that you do not release politics.

22
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:25,621
To actually influence politics locally.
 Because it is the politicians who make the decisions that affect the climate and the environment.

23
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:30,054
And they are the ones who have the resources to actually make any difference.
 If they sharpen.

24
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:36,635
So yes, we will continue.
 And the next step is that we will try to get interviews a year after the election.

25
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:40,181
Maybe with those who lead the municipality.

26
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:48,879
And ask: What have you done?
 How do you look at your work?
 Will you reach the climate and sustainability goals after that work?
