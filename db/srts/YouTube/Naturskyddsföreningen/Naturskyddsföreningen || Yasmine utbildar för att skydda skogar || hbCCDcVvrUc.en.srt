1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,889
I run a project where more people should get out into the forest and learn more about species, biodiversity -

2
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:09,661
- And what a real forest looks like.

3
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:25,887
I drive a lot of the joy of the forest, but can also feel very stressed and a great sadness that -

4
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:29,211
- Forests with hearing natural values are harvested at such a rapid pace.

5
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:37,629
Only now while we stand here, forests are harvested with high natural values, which have never been harvested before.

6
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:45,716
Where the authorities do not have resources at all to follow up on each harvesting case or to inventory.

7
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:53,311
So the risk if there are no non -profit forces that are committed to the forest is -

8
00:00:53,311 --> 00:01:02,138
- Loss of biodiversity, loss of natural forests, loss of forests with high natural values.

9
00:01:05,573 --> 00:01:09,404
Here we see that it is a spill crow that has been.

10
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:13,520
Typically like this at the base of a spruce.

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,144
It is a red listed species.

12
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:20,843
With this project, to get people's formation around forest -

13
00:01:20,843 --> 00:01:27,070
- And be out with other people in the forest who are committed and want to learn more.

14
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,519
It gives an incredible amount of energy and joy.

15
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:36,271
So for me it has become a way to make my commitment more sustainable.

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:48,758
I have several examples here in VÃ¤sterbotten where it is thanks to the commitment of individuals -

17
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:57,231
- That many forest areas remain.
 That they were excluded from harvesting and maybe even today is a reserve.

18
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:04,448
My dream is well ..

19
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:06,459
... another forestry.

20
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:18,358
Where we do not have this calving use, but where all forests with high natural values receive long -term protection.

21
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:22,440
And that we use the forest in a different way than we do today.

22
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,836
It is a possible dream.

23
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,244
Not an unreasonable utopia.
