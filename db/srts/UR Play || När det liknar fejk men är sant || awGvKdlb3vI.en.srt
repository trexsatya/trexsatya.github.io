1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,840
Have you seen this movie?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,640
A young, healthy and well -trained woman has got Corona and become Assjuk.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,000
It's scary.
 Corona is not dangerous if you are not old and sick.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,160
Someone has written that it is an old movie that warns of smoking.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,720
-You might have found a scam there.
 -Shey, fake?

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,960
-Many doubted the movie.
 -Is that fake or not?

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,400
Journalists Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the Viral reviewer.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,640
Today, they run the source criticism, Sweden's national team in source criticism.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, together with Edwin, they do Källkoll Corona.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,680
Before we look at the woman, we should have it clearly and clearly-

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
-At Corona, Covid-19, worst affects those who are older.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,040
It is the clear picture from everywhere.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,160
If you are over 40, you suffer worse.

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,840
But in the news feed, which comes from all over the world-

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,480
-We also hear about what stands out.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,160
This spoke the state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell Om-

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,680
-To a press conference.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,200
When one has a disease that in a short time affects a million human-

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,840
-The all diseases will have odd events.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,920
This brings us back to the woman on the movie.

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,160
This was a two-child mother from the UK who became inserted

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
-And then turned out to have covid-19.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm on intensive.
 I can't breathe without this one.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,840
She described it as having glass in her lungs.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,480
She became very scared and wanted to tell about it to her friends.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,120
This movie was then spread throughout the world.

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,760
Everyone was quite stressed by it.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,720
Then people began to comment.
 "This is fake."

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,520
"It's an old anti-smoking film."
 Maybe because she said like this:

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,880
You who smoke, put away the cigarettes.

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,520
You need your lungs.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,960
People said they had seen the movie before.

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,040
Some claimed that she was Justin Trudeau's wife.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,880
The Canadian Prime Minister?

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,240
Because of all the rumors, she decided to make a new movie.

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,240
Yes, I'm Corona-infected.
 I smoked a long time ago but not now anymore.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,280
Then she got to be in the morning TV.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,960
You look much healthier.

39
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,640
It's true.

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,560
This woman has felt abusive and she is now feeling better.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,280
It goes contrary to the larger picture, which is also true, af-

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,520
-That you don't get so sick at her age-

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
-If you do not belong to a risk group.

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,040
This is what stands out.
 It is the exception that confirms the rule.

45
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,720
It's much like this Facebook post.

46
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,480
A woman talks about her brother Olle, infectious physician at Huddinge Hospital.

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,680
Olle has told a long thing about how he views the Covid-19 disease.

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,600
If you were to look at this-

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,120
-and assess whether it is true or false, what would you say?

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,600
We have someone who is referring to a brother called olle-

51
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,880
-Whow is allegedly working at the Swedish Medicines Agency.

52
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,160
There are no links to any sources.

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,120
I would say it's fake.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,320
Mm.
 This is what is difficult, that is.

55
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,560
When we were going to check this, I searched the web at Olle.

56
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,840
He happens to have the same last name as his sister, so there we had a little turn-

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
-And he is a doctor at the Swedish Medicines Agency.

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,240
Then you start to get a grip on the situation.

59
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,960
I called the Swedish Medicines Agency and they said:

60
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,520
"Yes, he exists. He is this person. He has said this."

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,480
This is something they have posted on their info site.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,240
This is very similar to what is spread when it is fake.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,520
We spread this because it is relevant and urgent.
 It is important.

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,080
This is information we want to come to our surroundings at once.

65
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,320
Just so we do even when we spread rumors that are false, and chain letters.

66
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,760
We think everyone needs to know it now.

67
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,640
The thing with rumors is that they are sometimes true.

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,640
Otherwise, we would not have spread rumors.
 If we knew that all rumors are fake-

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,440
-Ad we had 3,000 years ago stopped spreading them.

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,640
But we continue, because there is, now and then, what is actually true.

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,480
We have gone through two examples here.

72
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,840
Should everything be like this?
 Should I have to examine everything in detail-

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,640
-And call the Swedish Medicines Agency?
 I want it to be easy to recognize.

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,160
I also get tired sometimes, but this is how it is.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,440
There is no magic wand that shows whether it is true or false.

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
But there is something that is almost as good.

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
Practical tips!

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,680
First and foremost, the most important thing is to question oneself.

79
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,000
We walk around and have opinions.
 We think things.

80
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,960
What we think colors how we look at the world.

81
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,200
This means that we accept information that corresponds to what we think-

82
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,720
-And close your eyes for things that go against what we think.

83
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,000
That is why it is important to start by questioning yourself.

84
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,040
Do I want this to be true just because I think it's true?

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,440
You can google things.
 You can google names, places, times-

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,800
-And check out what stands, and not just go to the links in the text.

87
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,680
Really hot it will-

88
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,600
-If you take the time not only to press the first search result.

89
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,720
When you are looking for a result at the top, but then more will come.

90
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,360
There is page two, page three, page four and page five.

91
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,840
If you click on any of them, things start to happen.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We like that.

93
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,160
I will question myself, search and look at more than one place.

94
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,080
He has taken this.
 We are done.
 Thanks.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,120
-Do you have coffee?
 -Yes.

96
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,320
