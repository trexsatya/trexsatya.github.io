1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06.840
Have you seen this movie?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,640
A young, healthy and well -trained woman has got Corona and become Assjuk.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,000
It's scary. Corona is not dangerous if you are not old and sick.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,160
Someone has written that it is an old movie that warns of smoking.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,720
-You might have found a scam there. -Shey, fake?

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,960
-Many doubted the movie. -Is that fake or not?

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,400
Journalists Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the Viral reviewer.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,640
Today, they run the source criticism, Sweden's national team in source criticism.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, together with Edwin, they do Källkoll Corona.

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,680
Before we look at the woman, we should have it clearly and clearly-

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57.840
-At Corona, Covid-19, worst affects those who are older.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02.040
It is the clear picture from everywhere.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,160
If you are over 40, you suffer worse.

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,840
But in the news feed, which comes from all over the world-

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,480
-We also hear about what stands out.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,160
This spoke the state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell Om-

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,680
-To a press conference.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,200
When one has a disease that in a short time affects a million human-

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,840
-The all diseases will have odd events.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,920
This brings us back to the woman on the movie.

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,160
This was a two-child mother from the UK who became inserted

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
-And then turned out to have covid-19.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm on intensive. I can't breathe without this one.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,840
She described it as having glass in her lungs.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,480
She became very scared and wanted to tell about it to her friends.

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00.120
This movie was then spread throughout the world.

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,760
Everyone was quite stressed by it.

28
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,720
Then people began to comment. "This is fake."

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,520
"It's an old anti-smoking film." Maybe because she said like this:

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,880
You who smoke, put away the cigarettes.

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,520
You need your lungs.
