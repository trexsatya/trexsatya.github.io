00:00:01,345 --> 00:00:02.345
Hello Hello

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:05.945
Here's a tip if you want

3
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:08.465
Understanding people better

4
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:11,395
where you live and get better contact

5
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:14,455
with people where you live

6
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:17,455
and it is simply that

7
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:20,405
Learn common names

8
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:23,525
In places where you live

9
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:26,775
and learn some abbreviations

10
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:28,585
And hose words

11
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:31,935
In places and things

12
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:34,175
and house and stuff where you live

13
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:39,145
It happens quite often

14
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:42,315
that I meet SFI students

15
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:45.065
that has lived in Gothenburg

16
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:46,225
Pretty long

17
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49.615
and still become unsure if i

18
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52.665
Says, for example, Avenyn or Götaplats

19
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,655
Or Nordstan

20
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:58,195
it is different but it happens and

21
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:01.195
When that happens, so I say the name of a

22
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:03,795
very ordinary large place

23
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:06.465
in Gothenburg as everyone

24
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:08,595
that are born in Gothenburg knows

25
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,705
If then the person does not know

26
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:14,575
Then it creates a distance

27
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:17,755
It creates a feeling that this one

28
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:20,635
the person is not interested in

29
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22.575
the place he or she lives on

30
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:26,625
while if the person knows it

31
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,715
so it creates a feeling that

32
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:32.565
by proximity, that yes, we both live in Gothenburg

33
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:35.065
and of course we know what

34
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:37.845
Different places in Gothenburg are called

35
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:40,195
so

36
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,905
My suggestion is that you, when

37
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:45,895
You've been ready for this movie

38
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:49,455
Take a few pages in a book

39
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:52,325
thus a writing book and

40
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:55.855
and write at the top there

41
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:59,185
places where I live or names

42
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00.795
In places where I live

43
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:04,585
and so start asking people a bit and gather on you

44
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:08.005
So think about a little, what's the name?

45
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,925
What's the name? And what calls

46
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,965
People who live here

47
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,575
that and that thing

48
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:19,675
so

49
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,765
yes, right, and then the other

50
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:27.515
then that ... it is also very common

51
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,695
that you in, when you live in a city you get

52
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:33,645
Also give short names and nicknames

53
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:36,465
to

54
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:39,735
to places, you want to talk fast and you want

55
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:43,165
one thinks everyone understands what one means

56
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,515
And that's why it can be difficult to understand if you listen then

57
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:49.555
On people, for example, from Gothenburg

58
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:52,475
and they talk and use abbreviations

59
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:54.505
or slang words for different things

60
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:58,255
and thus, if you

61
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:01,475
uses the same, or as well as talking in the same way

62
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:04.265
like those who come from

63
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:07.025
the place does, so you will again create more proximity

64
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:10,245
It creates a feeling of a contact

65
00:03:10,245 --> 00:03:13,465
It shows that you are interested

66
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:14,665
and have looked up

67
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,945
what ever

68
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,775
hands on that spot

69
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,360
How to talk and so on

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,640
it can be simple stuff like there are

71
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:28,885
Two hospitals in Gothenburg, it is called Östra Hospital

72
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:31,525
Eastern Hospital and Sahlgrenska Hospital

73
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,655
It is almost never someone who says that

74
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:37,695
without saying Östra and Sahlgrenska

75
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,155
so "where is ...

76
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,585
it and that person? ”

77
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:43,245
Yes he is lying on the east

78
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,765
And it can be hard to understand if you talk quickly

79
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:49,675
But that means' he lies on the eastern

80
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:50,675
The hospital '

81
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,955
Or "he works at Sahlgrenska"

82
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:57,345
Yes, what does that mean? Well, he works at Sahlgrenska Hospital

83
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:01.165
Sahlgrenska Hospital 'there may also be places

84
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02.485
so

85
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:05.785
I often call the library

86
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:06,785
for the bible

87
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:11,365
so that "I'll go to the bible" and borrow books and all

88
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:14,205
huh, what is the bible, yes the library

89
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:17,705
or if you buy beer or wine

90
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:20,565
so you normally go to either

91
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:23,425
The system or company

92
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,285
There are very few Swedes

93
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:29.515
that says: "I'll go to Systembolaget"

94
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:32,695
without saying the “system” or “company”

95
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:36.565
There are certainly a lot of different such examples

96
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:39.965
I think like this: cinemas or restaurants

97
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:41,645
Or cafes

98
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,035
squares, statues

99
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47.815
fountains, that is, there is a mass

100
00:04:47,815 --> 00:04:49.885
different things that may have

101
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:52,625
small names of their own as they

102
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,875
that comes from the site uses

103
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:59,335
My colleague who comes from Stockholm

104
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:02.915
said, for example

105
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:04,145
"Yeah, are you going to Stockan"

106
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:08.165
Log that is short for Stockholm then

107
00:05:08,885 --> 00:05:10,885
Yes, many such things

108
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,625
so

109
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15.905
simply check it up, ask

110
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:18,725
People around you, it is also a fun way

111
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:21.565
to get in touch with people because if you show interest

112
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:24.605
for that place people come from and live on

113
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:27,195
so they will be happy and it can be one

114
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:30,155
There may be a conversation that continues

115
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:31,775
Plus that

116
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,375
It is fun to be able to such things

117
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,495
I also think it can give a greater feeling of being at home

118
00:05:37,495 --> 00:05:40,805
in a place if one knows how

119
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:43,845
so to say, locals

120
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,300
talking about that place

121
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51.535
Yes, that's what I wanted to say here

122
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:54,075
Please write a comment about you what is it called

123
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:57,335
Learn something new, I can most

124
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00.985
Name of places in Gothenburg where I live

125
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,775
so it could be a bit of fun if you find some

126
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,495
funny nicknames or abbreviations

127
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08.535
from the place where you live

128
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:10,995
So you might be happy to write it in a comment

129
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:13,725
It would be fun to read

130
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,815
Have a good time so long so we'll see you again soon

131
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:18,845
Bye
