1
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:08,174
Testing One Two Three.

2
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:11,676
I have to test it.

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,411
It's actually a good question.

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15.046
The student yes ...

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,981
It's just driving.

6
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,684
My name is Tilda.

7
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:30,976
I plug in a civil engineer, industrial economics.

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,512
My name is Daniel.

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:37,376
I plug language, rhetoric and communicative leadership at Örebro University.

10
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,825
My name is Erika.

11
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:41.063
I am studying at Örebro University.

12
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:44,288
I plug in subject teachers in sports and history.

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
My name is Rojan.

14
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47.857
I am studying the law program at Örebro University.

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,108
Ever since I was a kid I have had a dream of becoming a defense lawyer.

16
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:52,233
And that was also why I chose

17
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,477
The finance program with a focus on law at the upper secondary school.

18
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,736
I have always thought that math is very funny,

19
00:00:56,736 --> 00:00:58,798
Which made me read nature in high school.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03.451
I studied community with a focus on behavioral science in high school.

21
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:07,584
Just because I felt that width was something that was useful to me.

22
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,144
In high school I joined the technology program.

23
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,349
The reason why I chose the technology program

24
00:01:12,349 --> 00:01:14,993
Was because I had a plan to become an engineer.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,528
That said, I sit here and plug the subject teacher program right now.

26
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,998
So it wasn't exactly an engineer.

27
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,934
After the student I had many interests,

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,384
But also no idea what I wanted to do in the future.

29
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:31,373
So it took me three years before I applied to the university.

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,586
After I took the student, I chose to take a year,

31
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:38,112
To work and travel and so on.

32
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39.840
But it ended with three years.

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,329
I needed three years to find what I wanted to do and what I wanted to search.

34
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,719
During these three years I did like so many others.

35
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51.089
I traveled through Australia and Asia

36
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,432
And also had to settle in Norway and work there for a while,

37
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
Before I applied to the university.

38
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00.058
Because I knew I wanted to keep up with law in the future,

39
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:03.648
But also that I thought that law was the most interesting in high school,

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,523
So I chose to apply to the university right after high school.

41
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:08.525
And once I came in, I thought that

42
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:11.305
It had just been worth continuing to study.

43
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,789
I also saw it as an advantage

44
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,816
that I would be done with the plug as soon as possible

45
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:16,960
If I started studying immediately after high school.

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,312
At the end of high school so I planned to go to the USA

47
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:21,312
And work as au pair.

48
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,055
But at the same time I was looking for some different education at the university

49
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:28,718
To really have a back up plan if the United States would not go through.

50
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,820
And it didn't either.

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,880
For starters, I applied to the police college.

52
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,258
But it wasn't quite as I had imagined.

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,160
So then I start to think about instead.

54
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,337
Then I thought some profession that would be to work with people,

55
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:46,234
And then the teaching profession was the first thing I came to think of.

56
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:50,170
And that is really the biggest reason why I am studying subject teachers today.

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,201
What I got stuck for in the program was mainly communication.

58
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:58,688
I have an interest in both talking and a great interest in writing.

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01.031
The engineering courses interested me a little extra

60
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:05.438
when they were very wide and had many opportunities after graduation.

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07.923
Industrial Economics I chose to

62
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:10,616
I didn't really have any special interest in technology,

63
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:12,612
Without wanted to learn a little about a lot,

64
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:15,468
Which is exactly what we do on our program.

65
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:18,389
In the future, I know I want to try

66
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:20,910
reach out to as many people as possible,

67
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,758
Whether it is through inspiration

68
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:25,458
or communication in either speech or text.

69
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,133
It may sound clumsy, but I want to make a difference in people's lives.

70
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,269
So that's why I would prefer to work in the judiciary,

71
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:33,403
For example, in criminal cases.

72
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
In the future, I would like to work abroad,

73
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,074
in Swedish schools around the world.

74
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:42,000
As a trait so I would like to aim to

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,834
be that teacher that one remembers

76
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:48,154
and the teacher who sees everyone, who listens to everyone,

77
00:03:48,154 --> 00:03:51,000
And that makes the students achieve their goals.

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
In the future I dream of getting a job

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57.057
at a company where I can grow and develop as an engineer,

80
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:58,928
and also be involved in developing

81
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,796
A technical solution that can change society.

82
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05.397
So the conclusion of this was to dare to search and dare to test

83
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:08,585
To see if you find an education that suits yourself.
