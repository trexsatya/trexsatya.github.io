1
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.280
Hello!

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.080
Well, so now the moving class goes again.

3
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.880
We were going to get away in a few hours, so I pack a little.

4
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.280
- We have a small farewell gift.
 -To me?

5
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.840
You look nice!
 Thanks!

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.400
- It's my old piss spot ... - it's a vase, a nice old vase.

7
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.240
-Is not it nice?
 - It's super nice ...

8
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.080
I'll fix the best place of honor for it!

9
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.120
Think of us when you see it.

10
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.440
We should not be long -winded - we just wanted to say hello then.

11
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.760
Hello then, Leif!

12
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.960
Oh!
 Bye.

13
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.240
Billy!
 Bye.
 But we hear, we have each other's phone numbers.

14
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.760
Yes.

15
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.200
Release now, Billy.
 It is enough.

16
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.880
- We will miss you, Elin.
 - I will miss you too.

17
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.440
-Drive carefully.
 -I will.

18
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.000
- Hi, Elin.
 -Bye.

19
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.560
"Entered property. Kronofogden."

20
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.080
What the hell ... - Move you!

21
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.520
- Kronofogden, that's Annika.
 - Leif from Sörbäcken here.

22
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.520
Someone has put a sign on our farm!

23
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.680
We have tried to get in touch with you for a very long time!

24
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.280
You have a debt of SEK 454,000, so now we make foreclosures of the property.

25
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.120
Unfortunately, if you do not pay as soon as possible, the house is not yours anymore.

26
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.080
Cursed!

27
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.240
Now they are going to take the kitchen off us.
 Come.
 - Cursed fucking parasite ...

28
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.040
If we sell the living room furniture and the kitchen table we have SEK 1,400.

29
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.520
But if we ... if we sell my clothes too, then?

30
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.800
No.
 You can't walk around naked.
 And we have consumed SMS loans.
 Damn!

31
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.720
If we sell all stuffed animals then maybe it goes.

32
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.440
- We will probably find something else.
 - But what should we do?

33
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.520
-What can I do for you?
 - We thought to hear a thing with you.

34
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.000
Mm.
 What, Leif?

35
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.040
Is it possible to get raised a-cash-

36
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.000
- Or maybe even get it in a lump sum?

37
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.600
Can you get it paid prematurely for six years?

38
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.440
- Then we promise we will fix a job.
 - No, it doesn't work that way.

39
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.400
No!
 It will never happen.

40
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.880
What is happening here, then?

41
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.400
He has hardly had any feeling from his chest and down since he was little.

42
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.520
Last fall, he got scabies in a wound on the leg -

43
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.680
- And became paralyzed.

44
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.800
We would need an insurance mantle of half a million approximately.

45
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.040
Paralyzed?

46
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.960
Oh, Satan!

47
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.120
He is not paralyzed.

48
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.640
You are open to five.
 It is only two o'clock!

49
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.440
Barring bastard ...

50
00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.520
What else can I do?
 I have checked banks, SMS loans and debt restructuring ...

51
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.800
- Is the coffee ready soon?
 -Yes.
 Where should we go now, then?

52
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.440
I do not know!
 Sometimes life takes unimaginable turns.
 We must live in the forest ...

53
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.720
It smells burnt.
 Turn off the plate!

54
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.360
-What have you brought?
 - I was inherited by old grandmother.

55
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.520
-In the forest?
 We can't give up ... - silent.

56
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.000
... and only three are in Europe.

57
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.480
It is a ming-vase from the Qing Dynasty.

58
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.080
What the hell!
 It's my piss spit.

59
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.000
Decor in underglaze blue and weapon for the family grill.

60
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:57.200
Fantastic fun to see something like this!
 You may be wondering what the value is.

61
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.240
At the right auction, it would go for between SEK 400,000 and SEK 500,000.

62
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.960
Oh my God!

63
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.480
Lord Satan!

64
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.200
Oh my God...

65
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.400
Jesus ... if you have heard my prayers - thank you!

66
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.720
God, Buddha, Muhammad ... everyone.

67
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.040
You've heard my prayers!
 My parents' home is saved.
 Thanks!

68
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.480
- But we have given it to Elin.
 -Damn.

69
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.840
Hi Elin.
 It's Leif.

70
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Have you left?
 How far?
 Two miles?
 Stay there.

71
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.640
We have to talk about a thing.
 Stop the car and we will.

72
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.840
Five minutes.
 Good.
 Hello.

73
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.200
Hell ... Half a million for a Piss Pot!

74
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.040
This is just a copy.

75
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.160
It is valuable, but an original is worth almost two million.

76
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.160
Hi Elin.

77
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.880
-What is it?
 - We gave you the wrong gift.

78
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.120
- The vase?
 -Just.
 So we'll take it back.

79
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:45.040
Leif, you can't give a gift to someone and then take it back!

80
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.120
- We have another.
 Where is the vase?
 -Are you nuts?
 It's my vase!

81
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.120
Get the vase here!
 Billy soon breaks down.

82
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.360
The vase was mom's, and then you should move.
 He can't handle it.

83
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.680
I get the vase here!
 He soon gets a nervous breakdown.

84
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.440
Yes...

85
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.640
- It's a nice fucking vase.
 -Gently!
 My God ... - here.

86
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.080
- Here is your new gift.
 - Take this one instead.

87
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.320
Here, Elin.

88
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.240
Sorry.
 We will miss you.

89
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.840
Oh, there were no bad stuff.

90
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.400
What details and what shine!
 Where have you found this?

91
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:55.480
- It has been under my bed ... —Sist!
 - It has gone for generations.

92
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.720
I think my dad turned ... or bought it in Borlänge.

93
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.160
Will there be any business?
 We thought about half a million.

94
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.000
500,000?

95
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.840
- We can go down to 450 ... - no, I'll take it for 500!

96
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.280
Do you?
 Yes, then we have done a deal.
 What fun to do business with you!

97
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.240
-Thanks.
 - Stand still, I get the money.

98
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.200
-What is this?
 - The whole our debt, every sausage.

99
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.320
Now you have to stop the witch hunt that you have conducted.

100
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.040
So bring out the paper on the kitchen.

101
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.040
Okay ... then you can write on here, then.

102
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:08.280
- Do you let us be late?
 - If you continue to be debt free, yes.

103
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.520
Good.

104
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:19.040
- So there, then.
 Then we can go home again.
 - You heard, the Crown Magistrate.
 Our home!

105
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.120
Our home.
 Right.

106
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.240
- We managed it, Billy.
 -Yes we did.
 We are the best!

107
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.280
An antique dealer in Sörbyn today made the biggest chop of his life.

108
00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:57.520
He has come across a ming-vase valued at SEK 2.1 million.

109
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.800
But what the hell!
 He cheated us on the pot devil!

110
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:13.480
Yes, he may have cheated us on the pot.
 But it's not time to be greedy.

111
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.840
We still have the house, and we have each other.
 That's the main thing.

112
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.120
You are right in that, the big brother.
 Our home - yours and mine.

113
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.160
What the hell is it smelling?
 It smells like gas!

114
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.360
Damn!

115
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.320
I forgot to turn off the gas stove.

116
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.920
What the hell ... Cursed!

117
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.960
Damn.
 Sorry...

118
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.520
- Curse, Billy!
 - Conduct, Leif!
 That was not the point.

119
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.880
