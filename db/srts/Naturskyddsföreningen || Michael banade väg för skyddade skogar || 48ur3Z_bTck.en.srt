00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Michael Nilsson and I am chairman here in the Nature Conservation Association in Härryda.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,264
I have been involved in these environmental issues for 35 years and it started in this area, actually.

3
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:24,372
I thought I just saw a streamer here.

4
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:30,000
For 10-15 years we have invented and documented natural values.

5
00:00:31,592 --> 00:00:40,000
And then we have had individual logging that has been discussed and one of them went up in the European Court of Justice-

6
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:45,294
- After it was appealed by the Nature Conservation Association and protect the forest.

7
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:51,430
There came the verdict a year and a half ago that not only affects this area -

8
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,408
- On how to handle the protected how to handle the protected species but also throughout Sweden.

9
00:00:55,408 --> 00:01:00,499
And other EU countries must also follow that judgment.

10
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:05,897
The judgment is called “protect the forest judgment” and now it is used by-

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,831
- Different authorities, courts and also different associations to ensure that species protection is followed.

12
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:21,391
With these issues that were in court processes and with authorities and so involved.

13
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:29,941
It was that we had a good documentation and that we presented it in a good way that made it possible to accept it.

14
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:36,453
It must not be too complicated either, but it must still be with good illustrations and maps -

15
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:40,930
- So that you can see these conflicts and what values are.

16
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,769
Visualize it in a good way so that it becomes clear what it is about.

17
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,283
It is not enough to have just a lot of species lists and such, but you have to somehow -

18
00:01:52,283 --> 00:02:00,431
- Clarify and then you can choose some species and show effects and such with that particular species.

19
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:03,480
Preferably with pictures and maps.

20
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:11,183
Then you can work with film and present it in a different way as well.

21
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:19,200
Hope and a goal with this work is in a way that you discontinue yourself.

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,732
And that society and the various activities -

23
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:33,304
- It themselves makes sure that in connection with various issues, nature is maintained to a sufficient extent.
