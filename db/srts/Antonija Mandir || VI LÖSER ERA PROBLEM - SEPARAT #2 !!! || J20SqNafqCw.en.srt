1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
He is fucking your mom, wtf

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.600
Uh-oh..

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.640
It is difficult.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.940
I'm mute, i am puff the first time in my life but i am puff

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.060
I feel like a little cock.

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.220
*Jack cough*

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.580
It smells...

8
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.100
Smells

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.600
Incredibly much sweat.

10
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.660
Wow.

11
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.940
I said what I've been in the laundry room.

12
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.140
Smell.

13
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.660
No

14
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.200
Listen we solved your problems separately last.

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.760
And it went so damn well, it was fun.

16
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.540
I actually thought so.

17
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.580
And on the video we came up with a suggestion that we would solve your problems with other Youtubers.

18
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.680
And now is the time

19
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.540
We are 5pcs today.

20
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.720
Right

21
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.220
Yes.

22
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.060
Who are we

23
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.200
It is me, Antonija, Anis, Jasse and Filip Motherfucking Dikmen.

24
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.760
And what is so fun for this time is that they are actually not where they have recorded this from home, from their offices or from their places.

25
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.160
I don't think that is fun, I wanted everyone to have been here and had the worst party.

26
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.540
*Rave music*

27
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.740
But we do not have time to party now we will record Youtube and make money.

28
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.060
We have developed 10 problems that we all respond to separately this will be swine fun to see.

29
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.480
What you think, what I think, what Filip thinks, what Jasse thinks, what Anis thinks.

30
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.660
Yeah you smell in my armpit, but seriously

31
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.400
It's incredible indeed.

32
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.020
I'll go and take a shower.

33
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.860
In over 3 years, I think this is Top10.

34
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.020
Is it true

35
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.520
Yes.

36
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.000
Have you run marathons this morning or

37
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.300
Yes I ran to the laundry room.

38
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.980
Okay, we're getting started

39
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.500
We start 5 youtubers, 10 problems now we run woho !!

40
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.460
Ouch

41
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.840
Okay so hello Antonija's channel.

42
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.660
*Stretches*

43
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.280
Hello on you all.

44
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.840
Hello my name is anis, I'm still baking from midsummer, I hope you are doing well.

45
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.240
The first problem we will solve now.

46
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.600
*Filip reads the problem*

47
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:13.220
*Jasse reads the problem*

48
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.820
*Jack reads the problem*

49
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.700
First, if they are naughty then drop them, throw them.

50
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.940
Secondly, how are you interested in 2 at the same time old man ...

51
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.020
Can you decide on one and after you have decided who you are interested in, throw him and his friend too.

52
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.440
First of all, I never think you should take shit from someone.

53
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.740
If you become uncomfortable about something that another person tells you, I think you should say away and put your foot down.

54
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.200
Although it can be hard, I definitely think you should do it.

55
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.820
You should always tell if you feel that you are being treated badly and if you see someone else who you think is badly treated then you should also say.

56
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.180
Throw them how can you be interested in someone who says: "No one likes you"?

57
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.240
You have to respect yourself and others have to respect yourself.

58
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.620
You may stop hanging out with these guys and finding friends who respect you for who you are and like you for who you are.

59
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.140
And that is not awkward to you.

60
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.960
And say as it is, say this way: "You treat me like this and I don't think it's okay, I'm sorry for it"

61
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.840
It's okay to dare to say.

62
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.320
If you still find it fun to hang out with these guys, I would tell them: "could you stop making such comments"

63
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.980
Otherwise, unfortunately I have to stop hanging out with you.

64
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.280
Oh what fun I am.

65
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.180
This can go to hell the sickest thing I read.

66
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.840
*Filip reads the problem*

67
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.560
WTF

68
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.680
WTF

69
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.100
Wtf!

70
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.400
*Filip again reads the problem*

71
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.140
WTF

72
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.480
*Filip continues to read the problem*

73
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.040
Is there more to read what is the problem?

74
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.600
*Reads the problem*

75
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.060
Firstly, your guy is with your mom.

76
00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.480
-—-—-

77
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.420
-—-—-

78
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.780
He sends private pictures to her.

79
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.660
-—-—-

80
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.620
"But I love him what should I do"

81
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.480
WTF

82
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.980
Ehhh ...

83
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.740
Either you let him and your mom flee the country and live the flea.

84
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.520
No, but really ask him to go to hell.

85
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.580
This is totally sick.

86
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.300
Your mom is even snapper like ... so ...

87
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.800
This situation is fucked.

88
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.320
Dump him fast as hell.

89
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:34.700
You my psychologist her name is Gunilla and I send her number to you so you can, your mom and your guy call her she is actually damn good.

90
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.720
So no, no, no, no.

91
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.740
Stop loving him, talk to your mom and say, “Mom what fuck are you doing”

92
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.940
You have to talk to both and then say that you don't think it's okay and say away.

93
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.100
This is so damn bad as it is the same snoop for two generations, I can't.

94
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.320
I'm so sorry i can't help you, someone else may take this one

95
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.720
Hello hello I give up someone else may take this one.

96
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.600
Seriously, Leave Him, ASAP

97
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.360
It is a difficult situation.

98
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.740
Very unusual situation.

99
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.100
You have to dump him

100
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.420
My God you have, like black, seen that he sends private pictures to her.

101
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.980
"But I love him" no he doesn't love you!

102
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.500
Brother.

103
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.800
Old man.

104
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.980
This is unfortunately ... I can't help you here.

105
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.200
This requires C.S.I.
 This requires Fucking Private Investigator.

106
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.180
Firstly, why is your mom lying with your guy

107
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.140
Excuse me to make you uncomfortable but what is it that is going on here

108
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.300
Secondly, your guy can go to hell.

109
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.100
Thirdly, I don't know, I'm mute, I'm a puff.

110
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.740
The first time in my life but I am a puff.

111
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.000
We go on I got fucking darkened by that assism what sick people there are sometimes out in the world.

112
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.380
*Jack reads the problem*

113
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.240
*Anis reads the problem*

114
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:14.080
Why are all the dating issues Antonija?
 Is that what the video is all about?
 ?
 Your followers obviously have dating problems.

115
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.520
I also think this is a hard choice for him because he gets you and the children in a package, you understand what I mean then

116
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.560
It may be a little harder for him to run a commitment because you have two kids.

117
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.840
It is more responsibility to take on and he may need the time to melt to dare to take that step, it is a pretty big step.

118
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.900
To become "pretending father" as well.

119
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.300
If you don't even know what you are waiting for, it gives you a strong indication that you should not wait anymore.

120
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.040
So I think that first and foremost you should sit down and talk to this guy.

121
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:55.840
"It's been 4 months and I don't have time to wait for you, my kids don't have time, it looks like I have time to wait for some tired guy who can't decide"

122
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.320
So it has been 4 months and you have dated and obviously he has an interest in you.

123
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.560
So I really think you should sit down and talk and say this: "Do you know what has been 4 months now you want or not?

124
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.900
I don't think you should end it if this good between you it would have been very boring.

125
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:18.620
It may be good to give him some time because just because you have children it will be a very large committee.

126
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.800
Becoming a part of it is like no little thing.

127
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:31.240
As I said, I think it takes a little more time to commit to someone who has children compared if it would not have it, especially if you do not have children yourself.

128
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.220
Because it becomes a completely different kind of responsibility.

129
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.900
So goodbye, Bybye, Arrivederci, Adios, Auf Wiedershen, goodbye.

130
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.100
Okay we move on.

131
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.980
*Anis reads the problem*

132
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:55.360
*Filip reads the problem*

133
00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:03.780
*Jack reads the problem*

134
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:11.640
*Antonija reads the problem*

135
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.400
It will never be better between you, so sorry.

136
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.460
I have been in this situation where I met a girl who had been unfaithful before and a little such stuff.

137
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:26.300
And it's hard and I'm not saying he's right because he doesn't have it but it's hard.

138
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.980
So that here I think you have to make an effort if you really want to be with him to build trust.

139
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:39.680
You don't really have that commitment, but it can be good if you really want to be with him so to speak.

140
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.060
If he is so controlling then it will not be better between you.

141
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.900
If he wants to check who you spend time with, what you do, one and the other.
 See you, goodbye, goodbye.

142
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.600
I'm not here to be a fucking robot that you fucking controls.

143
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.540
After all, you are not his property as it does not work this way.

144
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.960
This will be very busy for you if in is entering a relationship.

145
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.060
This will be going on for several years as I know, believe me, I know.

146
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:10.240
Leave him before it's too late, find a guy who can give you the love you deserve.
 Point End Mother -Herpacker.

147
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.520
This guy has problems.

148
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.900
He got way to many issues.

149
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.840
You got to let him go.

150
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.520
Being jealous is a very bad and ugly trait, I am also a very jealous person.

151
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.680
And I think it is extremely difficult to be a jealous person as well.

152
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:32.780
Because ... however, I do not know if I have ever been as jealous as you explain that your guy is.

153
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.400
But I have been in such a relationship myself.
 Guys who have a need for control will always have a need for control.

154
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:46.180
You can't change him, his view of life and relationship and women it is as it is so I'm sorry.

155
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.400
And kind of like this if you are with your friends often mess him up: "what do you" "we do this"

156
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.780
I remember when I had a girl and then I went on a tour a few years ago.

157
00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:03.940
I arrived at this city and then I wrote: "Hello I am now" "now I will have dinner, after I have cooked dinner so I will be soundcheck"

158
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.480
"Hello honey now I have sound checked, now I will gigga, I'll hear from an hour when it's done"

159
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:18.080
Not because she asked for it but because I would have liked her to have handled the situation if she had been touring among alcohol and girls and it is easy to go to hell.

160
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.960
If you want to check something fuck I know go and check such a Rubics Cube and play with it.

161
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.460
Bye see you.

162
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.540
Buy one for him.

163
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.660
Rubics Cube.

164
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.320
You know that: "CIK, CIK"

165
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.760
Let him check it.

166
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.840
Bye see you.

167
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.060
Farewell.

168
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.120
Okay, we're moving on.

169
00:10:34.120 --> 00:11:04.000
*Filip reads the problem*

170
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.540
"My dad is not a racist, but dad will probably see the guy's culture as a problem"

171
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.940
Which means he is a racist old man, do not try here.

172
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.900
*Filip continues to read the problem*

173
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.340
If I had been you I would have said to my dad: "Brother, dad brother."
 Dad says sorry.

174
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.080
"Daddy, my guy is a blatte, do something about it"

175
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.640
And then you will see what he does about it that is my tip.

176
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.400
I say this, this is one, I think this is a fairly common problem.

177
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.620
That you feel that you should live up to your parents' type standard and what they think is okay and so.

178
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.780
And I think that's fucked up because it's your life and if you feel your dad can't accept this guy then it's your dad's problem.

179
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.120
He should not decide who to live your life with.

180
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:56.120
I have a very hard time for people who have difficulty in cultures in general because I think cultures are the finest we have.

181
00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:06.920
And I definitely think you should talk to your dad that he doesn't ... So your dad shouldn't judge anyone for what someone has for a job or background.

182
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.720
Or what kind of culture or he has for religion.

183
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.380
Your dad should see the guy's qualities in that he wants you well.

184
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:20.380
I think that is extremely important and I think it's something you should talk to your dad about before you present this guy.

185
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.120
I think it can be very difficult with your dad but the only thing you can actually do is talk to your dad.

186
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.960
Introduce him, your dad gets to know your guy over time to see how amazing he is and that you love each other.

187
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.060
Your dad is a racist, we can start there.

188
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:39.240
I can't cope, your dad is a racist which is okay, it's not your fault that your dad is a racist.

189
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:49.480
But your dad is a racist if he sees your guy's culture as a problem or that the guy's culture would somehow limit the guy's opportunities for success.

190
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.260
Okay

191
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.620
Your father is a racist.

192
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.160
But

193
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.940
What you should do is say to your dad: "Dad, my guy is blatte, what should you do about it"

194
00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.480
And then we'll see what happens.

195
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.640
That's my tip, next.

196
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:07.060
*Anis reads the problem*

197
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.160
Wtf ...

198
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:15.500
*Filip reads the problem*

199
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.720
*Anis reads the problem*

200
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.780
It is very shady.

201
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.580
*Filip reads the problem*

202
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.340
How can he feel forced to life and death or?

203
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.440
If your guy is really not involved in any way.

204
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:42.000
So your guy should call the police because the guy's cousin shit in the guy.

205
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:51.120
The guy's cousin totally exploits your guy for his own profit on the expense of your own guy hence the call the police.

206
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.380
Aina, 112.

207
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.360
"Sho brother, fix my cousin"

208
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.060
This ... but god I'm so damn bad at this kind of thing, I'm the worst in money.

209
00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.900
I do not know..

210
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:06.040
How about talking to your guy's parents and with the cousin's parents and explaining the situation like this.

211
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.740
This guy has serious problems he sits and takes loans on the other's names.

212
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.760
You have to sit and talk to him for really otherwise you have to report him to the police I shit in whether it is a family or not, you do not do this.

213
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.200
You can't take out loans on anyone else.

214
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.660
So that person can't take loans later, your guy can't take a mortgage for example what the hell

215
00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.080
*Antonija reads the problem*

216
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.340
Damn what money problem it is, wtf

217
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:43.240
*Antonija continues to read the problem*

218
00:14:43.460 --> 00:15:03.120
*Anis reads the problem*

219
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:11.840
*Filip reads the problem*

220
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:19.320
Your friends find it hard that you don't have money and they want you to ask your parents for money for yourself

221
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:19.980
Okay.

222
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120
It makes more sense.

223
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:31.360
If your friends cannot support you because you are not financially stable because of your smoking then they are not close friends.

224
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:42.740
But if you know that you do not have money or that you spend the money on smoking then you can't join them everywhere and go out to all the restaurants and go here and there.

225
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.300
If you can't pay yourself, then you have to stand for it.

226
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.860
If you put your money on cigarettes and do not have money over and then do them wrong.

227
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.200
But if you know that you prioritize your cigarettes over something else which I understand, it can be difficult.

228
00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:02.900
Then you can't join them in everything possible either and then expect them to pay just because you have problems with your smoking.

229
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.780
So I remember when I lived in Dubai.

230
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.860
Then there was a person who was with us who had a pretty small buffer.

231
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.020
I have always said so here you have to move abroad so have at least SEK 50,000 to your name.

232
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.720
In addition to travel money and stuff.

233
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.440
Because it may be that things are going.

234
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.480
And he wanted to come out and we would do stuff but he could never afford.

235
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:30.900
And then I said this to him: "The brother, I think it's a shame you can't keep up but you don't have the money, stay home.

236
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.300
Don't show up, I have no idea.

237
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.900
Explain to them, I can't afford, I will not come, good luck, have so good, fat fun, ciao.

238
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.860
It's kind of that tip that I can give you because it was kind of what I took with the whole question.

239
00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:42.520
Ehm ...

240
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.240
Stop smoking and saving cash.

241
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.500
And save you on your beautiful lungs that you have because you have only a couple.

242
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.280
Or do you have two pairs

243
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.200
One pair, two lungs.

244
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.820
Save you on your beautiful lungs and your amazing money.

245
00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.360
I understand that it can be difficult with money in the teens, I think it is a great way of thinking you have.

246
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.280
Except for smoking there.
 You are not ashamed that you cannot afford.

247
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.640
You say that to them.

248
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.780
But you have to talk to your friends, because I don't think it's real friends if they can't understand a situation.

249
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.840
And ask you to ask for money from your parents.

250
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:23.940
Here is also the thing about turning on the steak.
 You can say to your friends "I had the giants followed and bathed on this bathhouse"

251
00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.960
"But I can't afford" and they may accept it.

252
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.460
If they can't accept it, they are probably no friends to have.

253
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:38.980
*Jasse reads the question*

254
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.280
Old man, then you just say we'll see you

255
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.940
Farewell, rubbish fits debris.

256
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.600
You should see this as a blessing from above.

257
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.600
Then God has shown .. brother, old man, brother

258
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.960
Sister, you are surrounded by junk.

259
00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.840
You are naive, you do not understand that the people in your area are pathetic.

260
00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.140
They are nasty so I'll give you a homework.

261
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:06.620
I'll show you that your closest people, your best friend and your guy .. is junk.

262
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.740
Let the debris find each other.

263
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.000
Fyfan what unnecessary friends.

264
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.960
So ush.

265
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.780
The tip up in this bitch and move on.

266
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.680
So you can skip this scrap heap by people.

267
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.680
And find better people later.

268
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.000
That's what this is all about.

269
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.060
Fyfan, both of them are very huge.

270
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.380
I really hope you find some other friends.

271
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.080
They were not your friends, definitely not.

272
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.140
She wasn't your friend, he wasn't your friend, he happened to you.

273
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.080
She happened in you, everyone happened in you.

274
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.000
Shit in them.

275
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.200
Throw them.

276
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.500
Have a good one.

277
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.660
No .. I understand that you are very sad ..

278
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.780
But there is no friend to have, there is no guy to have.

279
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.300
That gets along with your best friend.

280
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:59.960
*Jack reads the question*

281
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.720
*Anise continues to read*

282
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:19.560
*Antonija continues to read*

283
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.000
Excuse whose dad hangs at the pub with younger?

284
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.920
It's like my dad is going to hang on Spybar

285
00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.480
WTF

286
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:38.700
*Jasse continues to read*

287
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.320
My God which .. So damn what boring.

288
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.220
That you have had to go through these other things.

289
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.480
I am so sorry for what you have gone through.

290
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.200
I really understand that you are traumatized.

291
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.200
Of course .. and this really doesn't help.

292
00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.000
Fucking ... *******************

293
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.920
Number one, there is help to get for you, you have to talk to someone.

294
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.320
I don't know if you have done it, because I don't know your background.

295
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.880
Or this whole history.

296
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.920
You have to talk to a psychologist and process this.

297
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.200
And I understand, what you go through now with your friend's dad is totally sick and nothing anyone should go through.

298
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.220
I don't know how good friends you are or if she knows about your situation.

299
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.420
But if it is that you are good friends and she knows what you have been through ..

300
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.340
And you tell her what is happening at her home with her disgusting fucking dad ..

301
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.680
Then she should grasp.

302
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.220
She might suppress it because she thinks "my dad is not like that".

303
00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.420
Well your dad is a fucking disgust.

304
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.760
I get so annoyed, whose dad hangs on the tavern

305
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.460
With people who could be his children

306
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.640
It is very vast.

307
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.580
I do not know how far he has gone, but this can be reported to the police 100%.

308
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.460
Iom the situation you have been in when you were younger ..

309
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.500
With you being raped, I may think you should consider stopping spending time with her here ..

310
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.240
I had distanced from ...

311
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.520
I don't want to say that you should distance themselves from your friend because of.
 Such a thing ..

312
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.740
But for your own security, I might have done it.

313
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.180
If it is because of her you are close to this man.

314
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.180
So that he can't do something as disgusting that happened last.

315
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.580
Because this is already disgusting.
 It's not okay for him to paw at you unless you want it.

316
00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.920
And just there he has done something very disgusting.

317
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.700
I hadn't even wanted to know what could have happened if you were alone.

318
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.940
Do you understand what I mean

319
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:31.660
I had considered stopping spending time with this friend for a while anyway.

320
00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.840
To remove me from this man.

321
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.820
So her father.

322
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.980

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.740
Primarily.

331
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:14.260
That's probably the most important thing I can say right now .. keep the child.

332
00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.180
Do not think the idea of dropping the child, the child is here.

333
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.140
Congratulations to children, I can be your godfather.

334
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.140
I like you, you can have a shoutout from me kids.

335
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.360
I don't have much control over grants and stuff .. But parental allowance will not be enough ..

336
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.360
But there must be some other contributions you can get.

337
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.600
They are probably not on any mega sums.

338
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.580
There must be some other contributions that you should be able to apply for.

339
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.340
Hopefully in your situation.

340
00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.380
I really hope so.

341
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.880
Heres the story, first off .. You're gonna keep the kid.

342
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.460
Second, everything is gonna be fine.

343
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.360
We live in Sweden, everything is gonna be fine.

344
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.700
Number 3, You're Gonna Get Money.
 In Promise.

345
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.720
4th, he's gonna get a job.

346
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.780
5, Good Luck.

347
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.880
So, Antonija and Antonija's followers.
 That is all.

348
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.040
I hope you like my expertise.

349
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.540
Hope you liked my words.

350
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.960
Hope I was helpful even though I just scream.

351
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.360
Peace.

352
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.680
Corner.
 There are all questions actually.

353
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.680
For this little "solve problem video".

354
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.260
That said, I apologize if I was a little tired.

355
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.600
So, thank you for me.
 Kiss and hug

356
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.360
It was my answers.

357
00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.080
It was my answers, hope it helped someone.
 Thank you so much for being able to join.

358
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.020
Kiss and hug, bye

359
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.300
But come

360
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.820
But stop

361
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.900
That was not the point.

362
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.640
It was the 10 problems.

363
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.000
The camera is skits.

364
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.540
It was the 5 YouTubers who helped you this time.

365
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.560
I hope you feel you got the help you needed.

366
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.460
We gave the help we could provide.

367
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.460
Aa we did.

368
00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:00.280
I think we make one more like this with other Youtubers.
 So comment below which you want.

369
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.780
I will go out on Instagram Story with new problems.

370
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.140
If you have any problems, you are welcome to write them to me then.

371
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.900
And until then, there will be other videos.

372
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.440
See you, we hear, in your dreams.

373
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.280
I fucking went on Thai boxing.

374
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.300
Stick.
