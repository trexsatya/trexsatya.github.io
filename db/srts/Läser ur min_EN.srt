1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
Already after a couple of weeks, small green balls appeared -

2
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
where the rhubarb leaves stretched after the sun

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
Then came the drought.

4
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,768
The muddy soil that I touched around solidified to a hard crust

5
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,168
And burst into a grid pattern so my rhubarb jam looked like the pictures from a drying disaster in Africa.

6
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
 

7
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:43,264
The rhubarb cannot be able to get through.

8
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,056
But it made the weeds.

9
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,968
Admittedly, the quick root had to make an effort, but thistles and the horse hood seemed to be happy.

10
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
The lack of it

11
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,600
So they also have roots that go far down to the moisture in the underground.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,928
I chopped and cleared so much I got

13
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,000
but seemed to constantly get on afterwards

14
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,072
There was so much else I needed to do at the same time.

15
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,216
My hatching was filled with eggs and when the chickens started to grow they have to have somewhere to live

16
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,824
To make the old chicken house in order became a priority project

17
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,432
First I cleared out the old broken interior

18
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,808
The doors for chickens and fertilization were skewed and murky so I built new ones.

19
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,904
I rounded perch for them to be comfortable for the chickens.

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
I built a foreclosure with compost grates under the pins to easily take advantage of the fertilizer

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,424
and in order for the chickens not to go in and warm on the floor in the darkest corner

22
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
The plan was excellent.

23
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
I had spent a lot of time pondering how I want a sensible hen house that would work just as well

24
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
For me as for the chickens.

25
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,224
It was the reality that was the problem.

26
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,856
I want dense walls in the hen house because pulls are worse than cold for chickens

27
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:06,464
But when I started to put up slices on the walls, the screws did not attach.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
The old wood was rotten.

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,400
And when I started changing the old board wall, the rules behind were also rotten.

30
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
The sill was the route.

31
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,056
So I had to make a decision for how carefully I would be with the renovation.

32
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,896
Chicken house renovation is starting to grow uncontrolled.

33
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:31,296
To nail over the rotten wood would do all renovation to wasted work that must

34
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,368
Made about the day the barn began to sack together.

35
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,184
So I changed the sill and I changed rules.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,024
And the project I set aside for a week for just rolled on.

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,888
Every rotting plank I removed revealed more and more work.

38
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,728
Meanwhile, the weeds were flourished in my rhubarb cultivation.

39
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
The chickens were hatched and began to grow.

40
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:58,176
After a week, the chickens are no longer allowed because they dust.

41
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
It is a fact that perhaps only chicken owners know.

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Chicken birds - however nice they are - have the ability to create a dust layer that settles

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,952
Everywhere in the room they live in.

44
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
In addition, it starts to smell.

45
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
Even if you change litter every day.

46
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
The chicken house was far from clear but I gave myself some respite by letting them move out to the guest house.

47
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
After a week it was also tied by dust.

48
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,920
Pumah turned out to be violently fond of the chickens.

49
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,992
I had to hold her when we went in to them.

50
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,344
Otherwise, she jumped over the pallet collars that served as chicken houses.

51
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
Now she stood with the front legs on the edge instead and scouted for the little ones have the down balls that ran around down there.

52
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
The tail went like a propeller.

53
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,936
At first I told me that the piping aroused her mother's instinct

54
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
But after her first meeting with an escaped chicken, I had to accept that it was not the mother who

55
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
Woke up in her - without the predator.

56
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,016
The chicken move to the guest cottage was just a temporary solution.

57
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
So on the list of jobs that was in a hurry, I therefore had to add a new point: to create a temporary

58
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Accommodation for the chickens.

59
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:20,095
The renovation of the chicken house was stopped and instead I started rebuilding the old pigsty

60
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
to temporary chicken accommodation.

61
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:27,519
Now I ignore the rotting planks but just slammed slices on the walls.

62
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
Put nets over the old rat holes, compost grates over all other openings and a plastic mat on the floor.
