00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,376
Hello and welcome here

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:08,000
to the University of Borås

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,520
Here I sit, Malin Ögland together with Karin Nowe Hedvall

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,336
and we shall present some

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,176
First tentative results from our accompanying research

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,248
of the project digitally first with the user in focus

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,112
As in daily speech in the public library world, digitally is first called.

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,200
And this is very briefly an assignment that the Royal Library received from the government to -

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,864
And now I'm quoting directly from the Director of Culture - Directive -

10
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,776
That KB in 2018 to 2020 nationally coordinates and finances

11
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:50,176
an investment in regional library operations such as skills and development nodes

12
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,064
The investment in turn means that regional library operations coordinate an education

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,920
By the country's public librarians

14
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00.160
For a digital knowledge increase.

15
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06.304
And Karin and I have

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,936
Included in a research group earlier where we did a study

17
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Where we followed that project

18
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,032
2018 to 2019

19
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
That resulted in the study

20
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
Users first with the digital in focus.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
In this study identified at several gaps

22
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,832
As the gap between perceived local needs

23
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:34,720
Local demand and national assignment when it comes to support with the digital.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,144
We also saw that you already work with many digital elements but you work slightly less with

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,728
The task of raising citizens' digital skills.

26
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,384
These results were so interesting and important so wanted to keep looking at

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,456
Some of them and therefore we have continued with follow -up research

28
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57.504
Even during 2020.

29
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00.064
And this time we would love to

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
Understand a little more about this excitement that you mentioned

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07.440
Between local needs for digital skills development

32
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,840
And local expectations that the public librarian sees

33
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
That their users have.

34
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,472
And the tension between the national level

35
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,720
The national assignment at public libraries

36
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
And also wants to learn a little more about

37
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,640
Users and even local partners

38
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
at municipal level

39
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,280
and their expectations at the public library

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
When it comes to the digital.

41
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,640
This year we have posted it as three sub -studies.

42
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,072
The first where Malin as responsible looked at the regional coordinators

43
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,144
and how they can handle this gap that we saw

44
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,752
between what they perceived as the needs of the public library

45
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
and the demand for skills development

46
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,840
also within the framework of the national digital first project

47
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,480
And you have done an interview study, you will tell you more about it later.

48
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03.040
I have gone back to these

49
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07.400
The municipal libraries that we looked at in the first study.

50
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09.952
This time I have immersed myself a little more in

51
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,280
How their choice of business and activities

52
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
As for the digital

53
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
can be seen to interact with

54
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,000
How they are perceived in the local community

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
thus their role, their legitimacy

56
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
in its municipality.

57
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,640
I have done some interviews, workshops.

58
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,688
Jenny Lindberg, who is not here today

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
will do a study on

60
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
Citizens of these local communities

61
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
And she wonders what expectations

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,000
Do you really have at the public library.

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,536
And partly she will do structured interviews

64
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48.560
with residents, users

65
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,680
and also interview some local partners

66
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,480
in municipal administration.

67
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,104
Today we will report some preliminary results

68
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,160
From your study Malin and also from my part study.

69
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08.064
I have then interviewed

70
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,440
19 regional coordinators and even the national coordinator

71
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,815
for digital first and that I was interested in

72
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:26,920
is how the regional library business handles this gap

73
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
As we found in the previous study, we see that it is also reflected at regional level.

74
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:38,271
and what is it that coordinators perceive that their local library needs

75
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,320
And what is it that the local libraries expect to receive support from the regional level

76
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
and what is it as the national level

77
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:49,279
have expectations of what is going to happen.

78
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,600
And what I can see, among other things, is

79
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:59.007
How the regional coordinators are tamped with the scope of action they have

80
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02.040
and how complex it is

81
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,783
And that it is large, complex but limited by all different assignments and values

82
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12.063
that goes into each other.

83
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,183
And that they must constantly define their own professional objects

84
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
In order to

85
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,791
In collaboration with the local level

86
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
Find the common professional object

87
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,935
So what is it to be achieved here together

88
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
In this project.

89
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39.711
In digital first, they have been able to take the support of the national self -test that was made

90
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
The beginning of the project

91
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,831
And it looks a little different how you

92
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47.903
Has been able to use this.

93
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,767
An example from here

94
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
Empirin so one says that the tour was initially made to discuss the result

95
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00.959
from the self -assessment test

96
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
But

97
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05.311
Instead, it became an anchoring discussion around

98
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07.615
What does it really mean to be digitally competent.

99
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
Then there is also a dilemma in how itself

100
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
the assignment has been given, namely this that

101
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,975
that the regions should coordinate an education

102
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,327
for the country's public librarians, and it also records

103
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
In how you

104
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
Works with it.

105
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
It sounds rational and good but

106
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38.847
They bump a little on patrol because there is no existing infrastructure

107
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
Or collaboration model

108
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
For all regions nationally

109
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
because this...

110
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52.671
It is also not easy for regional coordinators to create it is national cooperation.

111
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,511
One can also say this is going

112
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00.607
against what is the regional libraries

113
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02.143
Strength, namely

114
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04.447
to seem

115
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05.471
Local

116
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
and also not be fully thought out but rather then bring in local library

117
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,943
When they create their projects

118
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
And work

119
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
in dialogue with them and then searching funds

120
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
and this project has then

121
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,231
added in a different way - here comes money and a mission straight down

122
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
And then you should do something.

123
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
We are not sure of whether this became

124
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36.703
better or worse or if it just got different

125
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:43,615
But the ones you can see is that at the start of the project, it was included in the plan to build

126
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45.663
a digital learning platform, the one called

127
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Digiteket

128
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,551
And now during the past all over the past year, then have

129
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
The digitet or learning platform

130
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,695
been filled with a variety of courses and lectures and articles

131
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04.607
Which has been created by these more regional coordinators but also by librarians locally

132
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08.447
and in collaboration and even some

133
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
Researcher articles have been added

134
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,847
and so on. And then you can say that

135
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
Actually so have then

136
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
This national

137
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
Coordinated

138
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
The training it

139
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,439
is now available as a result of this whole project at Digiteket

140
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
And

141
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
But

142
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
Where there is still there

143
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36.607
to

144
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,263
The local libraries can pick as well as to suit them according to their needs

145
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45.567
And the regional ones

146
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
The libraries can also as well as

147
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Recommend

148
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49.663
from.

149
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,783
And I think so as you see on the third quote here that

150
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,575
That is true.

151
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02.975
Then it is when we have been out in the library and showed the digitet and then maybe someone found a course where man

152
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05.791
Realize that - yes this was great this we need.

153
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12.191
It is really in the conversation with the library staff in smaller groups I would like to say when you can sit in peace and quiet

154
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,600
And they must tell you what they do and what needs they have, what you find I think.

155
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,335
I think that is very exciting and will

156
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
also good at

157
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,711
What was the starting point for my study then at the public library level to

158
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:31,360
Digiteket, that business, the activity, which eventually becomes the project

159
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
Or it becomes that governs. And in the same way I think that

160
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37.023
At the level of public library, at the local level.

161
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41.887
Then their choice of businesses, activities out toward users

162
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42.911
Become

163
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
that that became

164
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
digital support

165
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
Regardless of which ones

166
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
strategies or goals or

167
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
Governance documents you have

168
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,199
Who says what to do so it is still on the floor

169
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55.967
as

170
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
The projects will be.

171
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:07.231
I think that is important so we went out to these public libraries and asked what is it then you really do

172
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09.791
As you call the digital

173
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
to understand

174
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12.863
In which way you see

175
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
the role of its public library

176
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
In this whole digital

177
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
The digitization of society.

178
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,359
We already said that in 2019 we found a very rich selection

179
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
of activities like

180
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
Public library staff associate with

181
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
What they call the digital

182
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,855
and now as we followed this up again in 2020 through digital workshops

183
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,320
We notice that

184
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
the wealth it has

185
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41.535
increased, it has really got a push up again

186
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
And it is probably partly that you have embraced

187
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Digitally we understand

188
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,471
Also by digitalisation is something that governs in society

189
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
continuously

190
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52.031
one sees the needs

191
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,127
And the third is, of course, that we had a very special spring with pandemic.

192
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01.503
What you can see is that these public libraries we have talked to

193
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,111
that the essence of what you work with I call for support on site

194
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07.391
that is when

195
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,975
people who come into the library with their questions

196
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
regarding

197
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,351
the digital and it can be anything from needing help with printing

198
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
to want to download an app

199
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
to want to use

200
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Facebook

201
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
perhaps

202
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,359
any question that applies to the digital and then you try

203
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
Most often you try to help as much as possible

204
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
on site.

205
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
Another leg that is of course very

206
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,343
strongly as they talk a lot about are the digital resources

207
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
Man offers as a library

208
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
and it's e-books

209
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,920
It's e-journals, Press Reader

210
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,047
It's blogs, it's websites

211
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
all this

212
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
in the catalog.

213
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
And that can be said that

214
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,983
Several libraries tell them that they are increasing their range of, for example

215
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
E-books

216
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
so that one can borrow more

217
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
And better

218
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59.871
E-books nowadays

219
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01.663
and market them too

220
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,991
More and more and more and also see results in being used more.

221
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,903
A third leg that you always mention is that you see that the infrastructure and then I talk computers

222
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
printer

223
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
that there is Wi-Fi at the library

224
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
But also technology as a greenscreens

225
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
movie cameras

226
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
Makers Space

227
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
infrastructure

228
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
that you see that you provide it

229
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
for people who do not have

230
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,871
Access to them and they are seen as part of their mission and is very much used.

231
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39.551
Then there is some program operations that target this with this with digital skills straight off

232
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,080
courses in source criticism for example, as one has

233
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
arranged and arranged out against its users

234
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,119
And that kind of program business. You have usually also had it in place and you have needed it

235
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
change

236
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
with Corona now so it has moved out to

237
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
the digital world.

238
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,591
With Corona, you have also started to interact digitally more and more

239
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05.151
over social media for example

240
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
With recorded lectures, recorded book tips

241
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09.759
What it may be

242
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
and this will be this

243
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,640
A fifth way, a fifth category to work with.

244
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,071
Why is this important to know what to do? I'm thinking that

245
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,143
the important thing is to think what will it be of it all

246
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,495
Why do you do this way and what effects do you think it may have

247
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,147
for the users

248
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
in the end

249
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,663
and this is something that is usually called a little fancy for program theory

250
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,967
It is an accepted concept in evaluation research.

251
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,551
It is based on the assumption of that

252
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
When one is part of a project

253
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47.903
For example, as staff at public library

254
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
so you have a number of assumptions about

255
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,520
What the project might lead to

256
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,095
And so you have some activities that you organize

257
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,787
To make sure you end up there.

258
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,760
The effects they usually talk about being able to change an individual's

259
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,223
behavior in four ways just really, only four kinds of effects:

260
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
feelings

261
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,135
one can strive for people to feel more satisfied with something or that they have

262
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
better self -confidence for example

263
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
when it comes to the digital.

264
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,047
One can choose to have new sorts

265
00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:27,327
skills

266
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,911
Most often skills in basic digital technology,

267
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
Office documents.

268
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,311
But also, for example, reading promotion activities

269
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,280
that you want them to be able to read more

270
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,560
May be such an effect that one mentions that one wants to achieve with the digital

271
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
the activities.

272
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,855
One also talks about the third level, about wanting

273
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
that people should have new knowledge

274
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,207
And then, for example, most often

275
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57.535
Source criticism online that is such a knowledge that you strive for.

276
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04.191
And in the end and perhaps most basic is that you want people to change their

277
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
behavior

278
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
And here, for example, you talk about wanting to

279
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Start using the library

280
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Thus, new user groups

281
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
that changes it.

282
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
All these

283
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,015
the purposes, all of these desired effects mention

284
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,800
Public library staff

285
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,960
when they talk about why they work with all their

286
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,360
digital activities as a mix.

287
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
What one can then look at and think about

288
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,119
In every public library is that you can take a step back and review then this one

289
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,703
Mix of all these businesses you have and think

290
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,567
Where is this business? Where is this just this that we offer support on site

291
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
To those who come in?

292
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
Where does it lead? We want it to have effects

293
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,503
As one can look at these arrows on powerpoint

294
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:55,647
That people are more satisfied, that they have self -confidence when they take on this digital world

295
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
That they learn

296
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Basal technology

297
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01.535
And so you can think of even more that we want to go there.

298
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,863
And so you can look at we have enough of that kind

299
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07.935
Should we expand it, we will, as some tell about

300
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,287
out with this support in place to the place where people are actually

301
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,103
And so on and so you can look at all their businesses,

302
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
they recorded the book tips,

303
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,503
partners' integration business

304
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,599
Where you have this fun technology you buy, thinking what does it lead to?

305
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
Why do we want it to lead there and where

306
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,463
is there somewhere here we want

307
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,119
Change a little, screw a little on, take a little more off for us to have even better effect.

308
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,959
And that is what is program theory, that one looks back

309
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
on his own

310
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,799
We are in the process of analyzing this right now

311
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:50,431
We will also then I intend to look at which program theory you have at regional level then

312
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
which one has at national level,

313
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
How do they fit together?

314
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
But there we are not yet

315
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
We are in the middle of the project.

316
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:06.303
And there is also a third studies remaining then, Jenny's, but we thank you now and

317
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08.863
We will return with a report later this fall.

318
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Bye

319
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Bye
