Research, University of Halmstad Professor portrait

2
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:18,567
My research is very much about digitization and-

3
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:22,167
-The school's digitalisation but also teacher education digitization.

4
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:25,467
My name is Pernilla Nilsson and I am Professor I-

5
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:29.067
-The Didactics here at Halmstad University.

6
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:32,400
I have previously worked extensively with teacher education and-

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,433
-The Natural Science Teaching, even in the classrooms.

8
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:38,967
But in recent years, there has been increasingly focusing on that-

9
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:40,367
-Take on digitization.

10
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:44,033
What happens when teaching using digital tools-

11
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:47,967
-What manner is the teaching affected and in what way is affected-

12
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:51,533
-The students' learning or commitment to the subject.

13
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:55,233
It is especially fun that the University of Halmstad's first research program-

14
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:58,333
-Soping on learning in digital society.

15
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01.633
I have the privilege of being a research program manager for-

16
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03.867
-This program and together with colleagues-

17
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:07.167
-Detrap the research around this area.

18
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:12,000
Leads we shorten our research program and it is about-

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,100
-Bae from a critical perspective but also see what benefit digitization-

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,967
-Can do when working with different learning processes in society.

21
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:23,767
These different research areas are very interesting because to-

22
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:29.967
-We know that the government in 2017 came up with a strategy for to-

23
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:33,600
-The whole Swedish school system will be digitized.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,633
It will be a political question of working with digitalisation.

25
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:41,800
If one is thinking a little bit around the effects from the research

26
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,567
So I think it is important that the results we arrive in research-

27
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:49,733
-So need to be applied both in school and education.

28
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:53,767
If we notice that some methods we use in school-

29
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:57,600
-To example when we sometimes force on digital tools-

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,133
-Bae on students and teachers and then see that the effects on -

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,500
-learning as we expect perhaps not really fulfilled

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08.967
So we also need to reflect on why we use digital tools.

33
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:14,800
The result of the research is to be able to be implemented in society-

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,400
-And then in school and in higher education.

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,667
As a professor, you are a bit of an all -artist.

36
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:27,033
I supervise five doctoral students today which is an important part of the teaching-

37
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:31,167
-But it is also important that as a professor join and support other-

38
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,767
-And contributes to other people's career development.

39
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,800
What I have always tried to do as a professor is to create-

40
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:38.867
-conditions for others to grow.

41
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:44,367
The role of professor is both supportive but there is also a great deal-

42
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:49,900
-time expectations of us professors to be able to seek different forms of contribution-

43
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,333
-But also as in this case being able to lead research-

44
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,300
-and develop research at the university.

45
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00.400
There "learning in a digital society", that is, leads a good example-

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05.633
-To how we can collaborate within the framework of interesting common research issues-

47
00:03:05,633 --> 00:03:07.633
-and develop research together.

48
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,133
I think that is a very important role for a professor-

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,267
-To be able to participate in and lead such work.

50
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,833
Research where different perspectives meet
