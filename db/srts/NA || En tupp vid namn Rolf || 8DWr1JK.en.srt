2
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.640
Sorry!
 Excuse me, hope.

3
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.160
It does not matter.
 It was Gustavs.

4
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.840
- What is this for wine?
 -I do not know.
 Chateauneuf you pape.

5
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.280
Robban bought it in France.

6
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.960
- Gustav like more rustic flavors.
 - Yeah.
 Spanish country wine?

7
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.200
Swedish brandy.

8
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.800
When I got home Robban lay in the bathtub waiting.
 We had a lovely dinner.

9
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.960
Then we ended up in front of the fire.
 There we lay all night.
 Sleep nothing.

10
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.680
The last time I lay in front of a fire was when Gustav fired our tent.

11
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.480
He wanted to try a campsite.

12
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.360
We were under Mattsson's pear trees.
 He had to extinguish the garden hose.

13
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.000
How long have you been together?
 Do you get him as a neighbor?

14
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.440
No ... After four marriage I know that I feel best free.

15
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.280
I don't want a life where everything repeats.

16
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.680
I understand what you mean.
 Since Gustav took the morning tours, he is over.

17
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.640
- I know what gets up to him.
 - Gustav is incredibly conventional ...

18
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.920
You just blow gently in the ear.
 It is idiocy.

19
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.400
-What did you say?!
 - You blow in the ear.

20
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.880
- I start working in four hours.
 -Go to bed then.

21
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.920
Before you started working, it was I who provided us and created our home!

22
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.560
You can't succeed with everything.
 Take a glass of wine!

23
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.560
- What are you doing here in the middle of the night?
 - The clock is a quarter to nine.

24
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.280
- Then I have to go home.
 Robban is coming.
 - It's a shame.
 We probably have more wine.

25
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.120
-Go to sleep.
 I'll be coming soon.
 -Do not stress.
 Enjoy life!

26
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:42.040
We postmen have chosen it for something bigger!
 We go up before the sun.

27
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.760
We cycle miles after miles, so that people can reach each other.

28
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.240
Posten - We are where people are.

29
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.920
He goes on a charm course.
 Posten wants more service -oriented postmen.

30
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.520
- How to go for Gustav then?
 - He can become a flight attendant ...

31
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.080
- No, now I have to go.
 -Good night.
 Greeting Robban.

32
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.840
C. sounders laugh

33
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.640
But Robban!

34
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.160
Gustav ... Gustav.
 Wake up, you have to see this.

35
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.200
Be careful, I'm free!

36
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.560
- You have to look.
 - I had an open goal.

37
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.480
No, now they pulled down the blinds.
 You would have seen.

38
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:45.560
- I have to fall asleep.
 It says 2–2.
 - Gustav ... she had done so well.

39
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.880
Lighted candles in the living room and set in front of the fireplace.

40
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.440
They get on the right ...

41
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.120
- Are you not happy that Sara is in love?
 - She's not in love.
 She is sick.

42
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:13.080
No normal person thinks about sex more than once a month.

43
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:21.040
Don't you remember how we had it before you took those morning tours?

44
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:27.640
Wonderful ... you could lie down until twelve o'clock.

45
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.840
We devoted ourselves to each other!
 We don't have to have it this boring.

46
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.160
It should be boring.
 Otherwise, you don't know what it feels like to have fun.

47
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:50.160
I've been bored for 42 years.
 But soon it turns.

48
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.400
What fun I have.

49
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.400
- I try to talk seriously.
 -I also.

50
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.440
Do you think I want to get up at three every morning?

51
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:13.120
We could lie in bed all weekend and just care about each other.

52
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.400
You and I towards the whole world ...

53
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.320
Close the window, it pulls!

54
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.680
Why are you not at school?

55
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.680
- I have a sleeping morning.
 - I have math.

56
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:56.640
Why then do you stand and burn sandwiches?
 You don't get any school!

57
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:04.440
I don't slip!
 I know exactly what lessons I can ignore.

58
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:11.040
And what did Sara do tonight?
 I could not sleep.

59
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:17.480
- She laughed for three hours.
 - She was happy.

60
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:25.120
- Has she met a new guy again?
 - This time it's serious.

61
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.000
I've never seen her so happy.

62
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.600
Where is it that has happened, Sara?

63
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.200
It was too good to be true.
 And I who had done so well!

64
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.880
-Calm down.
 - Line, handkerchiefs ...

65
00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.760
I do not understand anything...

66
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:09.680
We had ... thanks.
 We had taken a hot tub and drank champagne.

67
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:17.560
Everything was magical and romantic ... I had even bought oysters.

68
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:24.880
- And so ... he says no!
 - We don't have oysters?

69
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:32.720
- He doesn't want to marry me!
 - Did you free him?

70
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:40.560
Yes.
 Silly, huh?
 Just laugh!
 I could not help myself.

71
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:48.520
I had planned everything.
 Bought rings and booked a weekend trip to Paris.

72
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.760
- You wouldn't get married anymore.
 -I lied!

73
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:04.720
I want it like you.
 Have family and children and a man who loves me -

74
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:12.640
- Laws the car, has a workshop in the basement and loves to fix with the house!

75
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.240
There is some shit with the garage door!

76
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.760
You have to tighten the hinges properly.

77
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.760
- Sara is here.
 - Wrap a glass of wine for me too.

78
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:36.360
-She's sad.
 It is over.
 - Don't we have a box parades?

79
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:44.280
I will die alone as an old young.
 It's not fair!

80
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:53.720
- Has Dad drawn a funny story?
 - This is only mature people!

81
00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:00.600
-What are you doing here then?
 - So there you are constantly!

82
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:07.320
You have fun all the time.
 It's a family happiness.

83
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:14.320
- There is always someone who stands up.
 - What is she talking about?

84
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.120
I've been doing this for ten years.

85
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.920
I want someone who wants to bet on me.

86
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:32.280
You wanted it like this?
 Free and free, no norms, no morality ...

87
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.400
Be able to travel ... no duties, no to support.

88
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.360
Freedom ... if you now appreciate that.

89
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.960
I want a man who didn't see me as a body.

90
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.760
- As just wanted to sleep next to me.
 - You can borrow Gustav.

91
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.760
- You don't know how good you are.
 -No...

92
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.040
Listen to Sara now!

93
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:15.000
- You have a man you can trust!
 - You have to tell you more later.
 I am late.

94
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.480
- Listen to Sara!
 - It will probably be math anyway.

95
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:29.320
Listen to Sara for once!
 This is important.

96
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.880
- Frequent ... - help me.

97
00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:41.160
You are a man ... you are kind and safe and reliable.

98
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.320
- Sara, you have a look for people.
 -What am I doing wrong?

99
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:55.160
Two things.
 Make sure the overall picture.
 Take it easy in the beginning.

100
00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:01.160
83 percent of all who have six first evening, separate within three months.

101
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.880
If you wait, you have a greater chance that it will be more than a year.

102
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.000
- How to know all this?
 - Aftonbladet's Sunday appendix.

103
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:20.280
If you wait for the fifth meeting you have a 67 percent more chance ...

104
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:31.440
"Well -kept young veterinarian with good economy and summer place" -

105
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:39.400
- "Looking for you as tired of the nightlife. You and me and all the animals."
 No...

106
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:47.680
"Sensitive, considerate man who values honesty and faithfulness" -

107
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:55.240
- "Looking for generous woman for cozy home evenings. I am your slave."

108
00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.320
What day!
 The entire computer system pied -

109
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.480
- And 6,000 were taken in a cash register.
 What do you do?

110
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:15.760
- Blends after a man to Sara.
 - Dad asked me to look for men at the bank.

111
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.760
Read the circled!

112
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.800
"You are beautiful, young and soft. Come and greet my ..."

113
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.800
-What is this?!
 - Modern poetry.

114
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:40.400
- Sara's future is secured.
 -What is this?!

115
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.400
Throw them.
 I've found him.
 Ragnar Lind.

116
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.400
-Who is it?
 - Tredes sorters at domestic.

117
00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:00.440
The world's most faithful.
 Have worked at the post for 12 years and never been sick!

118
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:08.160
- Has Sara bit to get your help?
 - We had a long conversation.

119
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.280
I don't think you really know her.

120
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:20.040
But as you see other things, small shades ...

121
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:25.240
That the chips are not properly grooved.

122
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:32.040
- Sara does not have a hard time meeting men.
 - She doesn't hit the right men!

123
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:39.240
This one is perfect!
 "Do you like uncomfortable guys in leather ..."

124
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:46.920
Ragnar is not like Sara's regular guys.
 He is shy and sensitive.

125
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.520
I've never seen him with a woman!

126
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.920
You have met him at Posten's Christmas party.

127
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.960
- He who let the children ride on his back.
 - The horse Truls?!

128
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:14.680
- And in Easter he was the rooster Rolf.
 - As we taped the beak again.

129
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:21.640
He comes here at seven.
 We just need to get Sara here.

130
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:27.120
- The hunt is over ... the slaughter can begin.

131
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:34.960
- And if Sara doesn't want to meet him?
 -She wants that.
 I know Sara.

132
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:52.600
-Let me go!
 -He is pleasant.
 - Here she is!

133
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.600
-Help me!
 - It's no coercion?

134
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.360
Love cannot be forced someone more.

135
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:09.720
You are right in everything you said, but we can take it easy!

136
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:15.720
Ragnar is certainly nothing to be afraid of.

137
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:23.360
At Easter, he was the rooster Rolf and played with the kids for six hours.

138
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:29.360
He is very in love with children.
 Kind and sensitive.

139
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:36.360
- Keeps most to himself.
 - like the laser man ...

140
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:44.760
- If he doesn't fit, you can just go.
 - If he passes, you can get what we do!

141
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:51.120
- Spring, Sara, Spring!
 - Sara, trust me.

142
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:58.240
Ragnar can be the right man in your life.
 You wanted to try something new.

143
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:05.440
But not like this!
 What should I say?
 What should I do?

144
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:13.240
Do you know what Björn Borg used to say when he was facing difficult decisions?

145
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:21.200
- Extremely but brilliant: "Don't think."
 - It's closer to him than Sara ...

146
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:29.000
- How does this look like?
 - yellow feathers and taped beak.

147
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:36.400
- Ragnar is a normal, nice guy.
 - In rooster costume ...

148
00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.160
I don't know if it feels right.

149
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.640
- Family life is probably nothing to me.
 - Not for me either, but here I am!

150
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.120
Now he comes!

151
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:57.560
- Own: It will go well!
 - It will go to hell.

152
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:04.840
I have a red skirt and chiffon ... I'm not at home eleven, then call the police!

153
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.480
Have fun!

154
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.400
- Is the marriage broker proud?
 -Actually.

155
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:21.600
And as a cream on the mash, I have a surprise to just you and me.

156
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.600
In the bed room.

157
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.720
Now you, the old man ...

158
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.720
Yes!
 10–2.
 Now I won again!
 We play again!

159
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:47.400
No.
 No idea.
 The game is not good.
 My players are dewating.

160
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.880
Canada didn't toss when I had them.

161
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.600
It's Russians.
 Canada has leaves on the sweater.

162
00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:04.440
- We can play again.
 - Switch with those childishness!

163
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:11.280
- I get revenge tomorrow morning ... —You should go the morning tour.

164
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.040
Ragnar Lind takes them for the rest of the month.

165
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.720
It's nice to be able to help people.

166
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.960
Sara hugged me yesterday.
 We sat for a long time talking.

167
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.640
- She listened to what I said.
 - What did you say then?

168
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.600
Secrets about men and women.

169
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.720
That they look different without pants?

170
00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:47.240
More complicated than that.
 But I promised it would stop between us.

171
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:55.040
I explained that you must not wear each other from the beginning.

172
00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.520
- We met only once a month.
 - You did the bump in Boden.

173
00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:06.720
I'm talking about the principle!
 You should not jump to bed the first night!

174
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.360
I have to check!

175
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.920
- They are!
 - Let them be.
 Come to bed.

176
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:28.440
Do he dare to follow her to the door?
 Yeah!

177
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:36.840
- What hell now?
 He goes in too!
 - It shows that they have had fun.

178
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.280
- She breaks our agreement!
 - She does what she feels right is right.

179
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.080
83 percent of all who ... Sara!

180
00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:05.120
- So he's still cursed?
 - He actually doesn't feel well.

181
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:11.520
Would I have let him in?
 He was crazy.

182
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.400
Stood there in pajamas and screamed about the purifying fire of hell ...

183
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.480
He thought you had an agreement.

184
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.040
Hello, Gustav.

185
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:38.880
- Don't drink directly from the package!
 - You can say hello to Sara.

186
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:45.680
Without you I would never have met Ragnar.

187
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.640
You have ruined him!

188
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:58.640
Now he is swinging around in fastened shirts and sings Julio Iglas.

189
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:05.920
- Talk with people without distinction!
 - Sara has made him live up.

190
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.400
We don't have time with that!

191
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:18.360
We need reliable people who don't just think about bodies ...

192
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:26.160
He doesn't want to be the rooster Rolf anymore - and that's your fault, Sara!

193
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:33.000
- You would get to know each other!
 - We did.

194
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:40.880
After an hour, it was as if we had known each other all our lives.

195
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:51.760
- No ... now I have to go.
 - Do you have everything?
 Passport, ticket, franc?

196
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:59.520
-Franc?
 Where are you going?
 - We take that trip to Paris.

197
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:06.480
You can't go!
 Ragnar will take my morning tours.

198
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:13.920
Ragnar should end on the post.
 He has discovered other values in life ...

199
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.480
Au Revoir!

200
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.400
Lie down now so you can cope tomorrow.

201
00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:28.440
Dad!
 There was a package to you outside.

202
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:36.240
"To my best friend Gustav - good luck! Ragnar."

203
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.360
Mom, guess who should be the rooster Rolf!

204
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.480
