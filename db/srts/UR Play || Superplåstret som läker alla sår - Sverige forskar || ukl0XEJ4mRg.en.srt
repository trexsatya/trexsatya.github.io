1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,360
What do you think if I say "forest"?

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,280
Maybe mosquitoes, tree huggers and abrasions.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,640
But what if the forest can also heal all wounds.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25.560
Many people suffer sometime from a difficult toxic wound.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,640
With our research we want, through material development-

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,520
-Cone heal these wounds that do not want to heal.

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,360
My name is Linn Berglund and I research with a focus on the patches of the future.

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,600
It is about nanoplars.

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,480
The raw material consists of wood fibers converted into nanocellulose.

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,360
A flexible material with several positive properties.

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,120
Benefits are that it is transparent.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,440
Then healthcare personnel can follow the healing without having to open up the bandage-

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,880
-Something that is often painful today.

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,240
It absorbs fluid.

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,520
Nanofibers love to bind to water and attract wound fluid.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,600
This means that the skin around is not loosened up and makes the wound larger.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
It's strong.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38.560
Therefore, the band does not need to be replaced because Daily wear.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,280
It is important in chronic wounds.

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,240
These properties interact to speed up healing-

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,960
-What reduces suffering and lower costs for health care.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01.840
A wound is classified as a difficult to heal if it does not heal in six weeks.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06.600
Hard-held wounds stand for many of the hospital inserts-

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,760
-To very large cost for society and the environment.

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,880
4 % of the healthcare budget goes to difficult wounds.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,280
It can be chronic wounds, wounds in elderly-

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,680
-Diabetes related wounds or burns.

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,760
The modern patch was invented in 1920 by American Earle Dickson.

29
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,680
It consists of a self -adhesive sheet with an absorbent cotton swab.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,520
It has not changed much in the last hundred years - until now.

31
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,720
We want to create the wound associations of the future to promote wound healing.

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,760
I try to tailor the process from wood raw material to nanomaterial-

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,000
-To enabling a variety of attractive properties.

34
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,960
Cellulose is the main part of the plant's cell walls.

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Nanocellulose consists of cellulose fibers in nano size.

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,480
Nano means "a billion part", so a nanometer is a billion -dollar.

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,320
As tiny spaghetti-

38
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,200
-with a diameter a thousand times less than a hair-

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,880
-The forms nanocellulose fibers strong networks.

40
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,080
We can use them for the development of the patches of the future.

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,160
Nanocellulose is mainly extracted from biomass from forest raw material

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,920
-But cellulose is nature's most common organic substance-

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00.680
-So it can be extracted from something else, such as residual products from the food industry.

44
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,320
It gets less food waste and better for the environment.

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08.240
We want to use nanopbidret-

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,160
-In combination with e.g. Antimicrobial peptides.

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,120
It may then act toward infection-

48
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,440
-The reduce antibiotic use and counteract antibiotic resistance.

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,680
A super patch from the forest.

50
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,080
