1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,974
The picture and associated text can be interpreted as saying that there is a "price" on the guys who are in the picture and that it should be spread further with that message.

2
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:23,719
In the phone among the images is a screenshot of a chat from what appears to be from the Signal program. The picture sent represents the majority of individuals from Ronna's side in the Södertälje conflict.

3
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:33,560
Among other things, the picture shows the rapper Nineb Youk, murdered Lourens, as well as Marcus, who is in custody in Portugal for a murder, and also in the picture is Yousef Saado.

4
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:49,873
24-year-old Yousef was just sentenced to seven years and ten months in prison for 17 cases of serious drug offenses during the period June to September 2022. Out of a total of 13 defendants in the tangle, 9 of them were acquitted.

5
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:57,413
That the guys in the picture clearly belong to Ronna's side shows that L2 has a part in the conflict in Södertälje.

6
00:00:57,413 --> 00:01:09,022
Another screenshot from the program shows how L2 wants help in "getting" the guys from Ronna. 26-year-old L2 is said to be connected to the Saltskog phalanx and is now charged with conspiracy to commit murder.

7
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:18,129
The person L2 is talking to is in the Foxtrot network, it is none other than the leader, Kurdish Fox, wanted Rawa Majid, the man is talking to.

8
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:29,071
In addition, according to the preliminary investigation protocol, the designated and accused shooter "Guldish" poses with an AK47a in the rapper Sticky's music video.

9
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:38,412
Lourens Issa, who was murdered when he was a designated leader of the Ronna falange, he has a younger brother who the police say was active in the conflict.

10
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:46,318
Lillebrodern has also recorded various songs and freestyles as a rapper.

11
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:58,828
Here he raps "Guldish on my neck and I don't talk no chain."

12
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,699
In other words, he implies that the designated torpedo "Guldish" is after him.

13
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:22,647
“Brother, the cultivator how do you get hold of him? He sends to h the kids from Ronna, the ones in the picture I sent. Don't you think he could fix them for money? They have sought help from everyone, no one except Syrians from Södertälje helps them and them from Västerås, namo stress liga.

14
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:45,098
And Maykil yokhanna's league the so-called may network. These are real Muslim haters. They tell people we bring Muslims into the city and try to make war on the Syrians. Brother asks you to check with the breeder, he could easily fix these chicks. Let's send them here to jannah and I promise both yours and the grower's business will go around everywhere in Södertälje via us my brother."

15
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:54,139
"Okay my brother will solve it now." Says the Kurdish fox.

16
00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:03,112
According to the police and the prosecution, L2 must have contacted the Kurdish fox and offered him a bribe to remove three leaders from the Ronna phalanx.

17
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:18,458
The prosecution is based on audio files that the police came across. According to prosecutors and police, he is heard talking to a person whose alias is linked to Rawa Majid, the so-called Kurdish fox, leader of the Foxtrot network.

18
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:32,469
According to the police, L2 offers SEK 300,000 per head. The targets discussed were the top leader of the Ronna phalanx, a 27-year-old man, Markus, who is now in custody in Portugal on suspicion of murder.

19
00:03:32,469 --> 00:03:41,977
Via voice identification, the prosecutor believes that it is the Kurdish fox and people connected to his network Foxtrot.

20
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:52,285
Now 13 men are charged with crimes in connection with the fact that in the middle of the conflict, when the conflict was at its most intense, a 41-year-old man was killed by mistake when he was mistaken for another person by the shooter.

21
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:57,122
Nothing in the investigation has shown that the victim should have had anything to do with the gang conflict.

22
00:03:57,122 --> 00:04:04,861
A little more than a year after the 41-year-old was shot dead in Ronna, 13 men suspected of involvement in the murder are now being charged.

23
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:14,736
It was just before seven in the evening on the first of October 2022 that the 41-year-old man was walking on the corner path in Ronna in Södertälje with a friend.

24
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:19,840
When they were at the Enhörnaleden/Robert Anbergs väg intersection, the killer appeared on an electric bike, stopped and shot the 41-year-old dead.

25
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:31,616
Now 13 men are charged, one of them, Guldish, for murder, two as accomplices or accomplices, and the others for gross protection of a criminal or failure to disclose murder.

26
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:46,094
The motive is believed to be revenge for a shooting that took place the day before when George Shaya was shot dead, the incident was part of the ongoing gang conflict between different phalanxes in Södertälje.

27
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:57,770
The prosecutor's theory is that the murder of the 41-year-old was a so-called misfire. The fatal shooting was the fourth shooting in Södertälje in a week.

28
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:08,679
The murder was carried out despite a very high police presence in the area as a result of previous shootings in Södertälje and is based on an infected conflict between two criminal groups in Södertälje.

29
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:23,857
After the murder of their friend the day before, presumably carried out by Ronna's side, the rival gang are vengeful and bloodthirsty. Despite the massive police presence in Södertälje at the moment, people go out and look for enemies.

30
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:38,302
the so-called Salt Forest phalanx has a specific target they are after this evening. T who is connected to the Ronna phalanx, T is similar in appearance to the victim and was in the vicinity of the murder scene but that the shooter got the wrong person.

31
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:53,414
Surveillance video shows that the intended target T and two other people were at the Ron-a school on Robert anbergs väg 24 in Södertälje between 19:28 and 19:40 in the evening.

32
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:07,826
The police were alerted at 19:41 to the district of Ronna in Södertälje after several people called in after hearing gunfire. The shooter leaves the crime scene on an electric bike in the direction of Lina in Södertälje.

33
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:14,331
On October 2, 20, 22, an unlocked garage on Keramikvägen in Lina in Södertälje is searched.

34
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:21,670
You will find an electric bike and a protective vest as well as a bag containing weapons, magazines and clothing.

35
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:30,910
The e-bike's frame number corresponds to an e-bike that was in an industrial premises in Södertälje on April 6, 2022.

36
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:38,650
The same premises where the rapper G1ocatore was arrested on April 6, 2022 within a day of his friend being murdered in Norsborg.

37
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:46,289
According to the preliminary investigation protocol, the rapper is related to people who have previously in any case been associated with the Saltskog phalanx.

38
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:57,732
On the day of the murder, October 1, several of the defendants and other gangs connected before, during and after the murder went to and from the premises on Keramikvägen.

39
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:15,713
Some people leave the premises by car while the shooting is taking place. L2 and Guldish are stopped in a car at 21:39 on the night of the murder, while Guldish's mobile phone shows that he is on his way to Tumba, Botkyrka municipality in the car where those who left the rope at the time of the murder are in. An attempt to give Guldish an alibi for the murder, among other

40
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:22,852
things according to the prosecutor.

41
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:33,527
The Glock 22 found in the premises is found to be the murder weapon. It has been used at least in two previous shootings in Södertälje.

42
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:50,007
First a shooting at Rösberga Förskolecenter in Södertälje in December 2013. And also in September 2014 when five bullet holes were found in a building and 14 empty shell casings were found at Robert Anbergs väg in Ronna, Södertälje when people on a moped were shooting.

43
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:58,713
Both murdered G and "Guldish" are linked to a serious weapons crime on July 27, 2022 in Lina.

44
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:20,297
At the scene, where the police went due to a call about a shooting, cartridge casings and bullets were found, that the cartridge casings were fired from the murder weapon found in the garage on Keramikvägen and that the cartridges were rehearsed/handled in said weapon, and that DNA from Guldish was detected on a water bottle and a beverage can and DNA from George was detected on a cigarette butt.

45
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:32,874
Autopsy records regarding the victim show that he suffered 19 gunshot wounds as a result of the bullet and that he died as a result of extensive damage to the skull and brain.

46
00:08:36,877 --> 00:08:44,917
Of which one of the shots that hit the face was judged to be at least a close-range shot, an execution, fired in the Glock pistol found on October 2.

47
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:54,825
As well as the majority noted gunshot wounds in the arms, back and chest. No visible injuries were noted on the lower body.

48
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:59,795
The shooter fled according to several witnesses who also photographed him on an electric bicycle in the direction of Lina.

49
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:10,304
The previously mentioned garage on the ceramic road is located there and it takes about 2 minutes and 52 seconds to get from the murder scene to the garage on an electric bike.

50
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:25,516
The NFC makes a statement that a total of 78 igniter particles were detected on the electric bike found in the garage, on the left and right handle of the electric bike, and that 50 of these are of the same type as detected in scraping samples from cartridge cases from the murder scene.

51
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:34,156
Several of the now indicted young men are tied to various things, police and prosecutors link to the murder with DNA matches.

52
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:41,462
Among other things, masking, transportation and other accessories that were allegedly used for the murder.

53
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:55,940
Guldish or Tawhid Sozan, as his real name is, is charged with attempted murder, aggravated unlawful threats, causing danger to another, aggravated weapons offense and murder of the 41-year-old.

54
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:03,979
Due to the fact that his actual age at the time of the murder is disputed, we do not know what sentence scale will be applicable if he is convicted of these crimes.

55
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:14,955
Franki, 26 years old, is charged with aggravated assault on another occasion as well as murder or aiding and abetting murder or aggravated protection of a criminal.

Both of them are said to have taken care of a golden mobile phone before the shooting and then before, during and after the crime, brought the phone in a car from Södertälje to, among other places, Alby and Tumba then returned the phone the next day.

59
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:51,684
The measures have been aimed at preventing it being discovered that Guldish committed the crime and/or that he is held liable.

60
