1
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:06.746
Oh, sh't there are a lot of people who want more mysterious videos!

2
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:09.321
So I thought we were awakening that segment again!

3
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,792
But how can you have missed this?

4
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:42,496
The United States released lots of secretly stamped UFO movies, they have released a UFO report and lots of other things.

5
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,339
Is aliens for real?

6
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:58.231
It is probably a question many have asked, but as you brush away in the lack of evidence.

7
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00.266
But gets a year ago came the shock.

8
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:06,387
USA's headquarters Pentagon admitted that they had a secret UFO program to investigate close contact.

9
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:09.784
It has been funded by money hidden in the budget

10
00:01:09,784 --> 00:01:15,000
There are very many people who are surprised that they have gone out with this public.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,104
When you already said in 2012 that you closed all UFO operations.

12
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:26,053
And based on the closure on the fact that there was not enough evidence to be able to motivate more money into the project.

13
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:31,648
The project but now instead this business under C.I.A. and

14
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Jonas No.

15
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,768
Do you get with pretty smart for purely theoretically, they do yes

16
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
She has dismissed the business in 2012 with divided the group and infects and paint them under new instances on

17
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Flag

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,592
Strange the whole situation is that one has total waiting

19
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
In question

20
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58.016
Previously have always rejected that resources have been put down on UFON UFO observations have me

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03.904
May we see a completely different page

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,976
But I wonder where the turn came

23
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
Next time the US recognizes UFO

24
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
Where are real

25
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,056
In Delphi

26
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
Fine

27
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Real the Last Airbender

28
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Other

29
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
Switch to Historical US government go out and confirm

30
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,976
A video there

31
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
Is genuine

32
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,912
They say it's totally sick

33
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
Not called but out of which

34
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
I want

35
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
How does a cat sound

36
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
The defense

37
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07.904
The technology is moving forward so more is filming even they

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Sweet

39
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
It will be very exciting to see what they get on film

40
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
On May 20, Hangar Ship was a USS Nimitz and Prince

41
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
Very important training assignment just sent up the combat pilot

42
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,080
The air

43
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
Something very much

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
Strange on its radar identified object

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
10 minutes of flying

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,624
David work

47
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,232
Now we'll finally get to see the pictures Davidsjort

48
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01.408
Unfortunately, David dropped objects

49
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02.688
But luckily

50
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
Operator on the swish ship

51
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05.760
These pictures

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,863
David describes this item

53
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,935
Called sometimes resemble the form of tablet

54
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:30,591
Booked a new approximately 12 m

55
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
Adult can change direction at any time

56
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39.807
Put in 34 seconds in KungsÃ¶r

57
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
100 meters

58
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,391
Candy and likely is that we never

59
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45.951
Any technology

60
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01.567
Who is Alice

61
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719

64
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Eniro

65
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:33,567
What are you just seen

66
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
But their reaction

67
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44.063
US military combat pilots they don't even know what they experienced almost

68
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
Unreal event

69
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,207
About it or not I don't know but that's something

70
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54.303
As I really like to know what it is for

71
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,143
Watch as they talk about how unreal this

72
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Is

73
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,799
The technology compares to one we possess they possess in their plan mixed

74
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Canary

75
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Where is Hugo

76
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
How does a cartoon look

77
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Are you

78
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Other military films

79
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
Pentagon confirms is

80
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
It was carbon dark night at

81
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36.031
California

82
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37.567
USA

83
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38.847
Set Ship

84
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
Find an unknown item in the sky

85
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47.807
I have absolutely no idea what that might be

86
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
But if you have it write a comment now

87
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
All of a sudden from nowhere

88
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58.303
Only down into the water and

89
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Disappear

90
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04.959
This video is recorded in July 2019 by the American

91
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06.751
ISS

92
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Sea

93
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09.311
San Diego

94
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,135
It was not exactly less question marks after here as you understand

95
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Without

96
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,231
The US Minister in Congress was not

97
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,559
Am happy about sitting in the dark and not knowing anything

98
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Starting price

99
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
The Military personnel pronounces with

100
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Former president

101
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,591
Now we want answers from the security service and this mentioned

102
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:49,759
The thing Doris hard to meander as an authority

103
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,623
The security service had to report every case then

104
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,207
Since 2004

105
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00.511
Normal people

106
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09.983
Curious

107
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Of course

108
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
Fixed that the report

109
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
2004 to 2020

110
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
The first story big gate is

111
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
They do not have enough high quality reporting or material which makes it difficult

112
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Conclusions in the report

113
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
The reason for these should be that does not have enough good reporting systems but they best implement the controller

114
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
System for two years

115
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,799
18 cases in 21 different reports

116
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,919
So describes the same movement pattern as we got to see Davids

117
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52.991
There is no explanation

118
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
Not in the normal way that one can expect an object to move it to go to the wind

119
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03.231
I can explain 18

120
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06.303
Similar events with Sven Reports

121
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
She also writes that they do not find anything to indicate that this would be another nation's has received a new

122
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
China Russia Under You Could It Be Being Without They Can't Find They WOULD BE

123
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
Has control technology

124
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Turn it off

125
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
The information

126
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
144 cases

127
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37.023
How many did they really resolve

128
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Battle Fallen

129
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
Is proven is a balloon that drops the air very large balloon to the only case
