1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
It is always important to be source -critical

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,960
And reflect on the information we receive.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,040
But it is extra important now,

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,480
When many are worried and when the whole world talks about one and the same thing.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,880
During Coronatids, we get new information all the time.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,400
Everything from news articles to what an influencer thinks we should do.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,880
We are also reached by news from other countries,

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,160
rumors and speculation from friends

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,288
And advertising that is packed as news or a solution.

10
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:32,960
But how should we know what is true and necessary for us to know? \ H

11
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:36,160
It is important to be source critical!

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,960
Always think about who is the sender

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,840
And why the sender wants to share the information.

14
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,440
If the sender at the same time wants to sell something,

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,640
Get more followers or make you change your mind

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,320
Is it good to be critical.

17
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:55,160
Think about what the sender uses for sources.

18
00:00:55,501 --> 00:01:00,120
If it is unclear, you should be critical of the information and check it carefully

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,160
Then the purpose can be propaganda or advertising.

20
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,632
Is it a primary source?

21
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,957
Or tells your buddy something for you

22
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:11,600
As the friend's neighbor's parent's cousin has been involved?

23
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:13,520
Then it is a secondary source

24
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:17,240
The risk is then that the information will change along the way.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,760
Much like in the whisper.

26
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:22,280
Do you hear anything that sounds strange or too good to be true.

27
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,491
Double check the information!

28
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:26,400
It's easy for rumors to spread!

29
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,320
Understand your digital footprints.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,120
Algorithms on the internet ensure that everything you meet on the internet

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,800
is adapted to suit you.

32
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:37,760
Depending on what you usually take part in

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,080
Form your feed to give you more of the same content.

34
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,240
Sometimes they can of course be smooth.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,400
But it is important to keep in mind that you are fed by such things that an algorithm calculated that you want,

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,640
not all information available

37
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:55,800
Because it is good that you are actively looking for information that you trust

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,600
For example, with authorities.

39
00:01:58,089 --> 00:02:01,480
Here are tips on websites and sources you can trust.

40
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:05,520
Stay up to date through news broadcasts and press conferences!
