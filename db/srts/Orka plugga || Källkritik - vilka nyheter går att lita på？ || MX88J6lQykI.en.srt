1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,840
Source evaluation and analyzing the 
information we get is always important-

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,120
-especially at a time like this, 
when many people are worried-

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,440
-and the entire world is talking 
about the same thing.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,880
We're receiving a constant flow 
of information about the coronavirus-

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,360
-ranging from news articles 
to some influencer's views on what to do.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,960
We also absorb news from abroad, 
rumors and speculations from friends-

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,120
-and advertising, 
disguised as news or a solution.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,600
But how do we determine 
what is true, essential information?

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Source evaluation is important. Always 
consider the author of the information-

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,480
-and why they want to share it.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,800
If the info is linked to someone trying 
to sell something, get more followers-

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,080
-or get you to change your mind, 
be critical of the information.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,360
Find out what sources the author used.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,040
If it's unclear, be critical of the information 
and research it thoroughly.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,600
The purpose behind the info 
may be propaganda or advertising.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,040
Did you get info from a primary source?

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,800
Or from a friend who heard it from their 
friend's neighbor's parent's cousin?

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,760
That's called a secondary source.

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,200
The info is likely to have changed along 
the way, like in the game "telephone."

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,760
If what you learn sounds strange 
or too good to be true-

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,920
-double-check the information. 
Rumors can spread very easily.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,480
Be aware of your digital footprint.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,480
Algorithms online ensure that everything 
you see is tailored specifically to you.

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,080
What you normally view is used to shape 
your feed to give you more of the same.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,680
That can be helpful sometimes, 
but don't forget-

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,680
-that you are only being served info 
that the algorithm thinks you want-

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,480
-and not all the available information.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,680
That's why you should actively search 
for information you trust-

29
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,040
-from the authorities, for instance.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,760
These are examples of reliable websites.

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,720
Make sure to stay informed by watching 
the news and press conferences.
