1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,520
Joe and Sonia, thank you so much for interviewing you.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,560
Would you be able to tell you about the day when I guess your lives changed forever?

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,800
That morning was a fantastic beautiful brilliant day.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,520
The only reason I remember it was that September 10 had lousy weather.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,520
September 11 is his birthday, so I woke up and thought this will be perfect.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,540
I went to Manhattan to arrange for a little surprise to him-

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,800
And they started evacuating the building I was in.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,560
They did not tell why.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,200
When I got out he called and said, "Listen carefully to me-

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,940
-We are under attack, this is a war.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,280
Take the next bus, stay away from the train-

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,620
-And promise me that you don't stop. ”

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,980
But it was broken and at the same time I saw fighter aircraft.

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,640
Because I was an emergency medical technician in New York-

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,000
-So I thought this was not an exercise, because we have never practiced fighter aircraft.

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,380
I wondered where my husband called me from, because he knew too much information.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,340
But I had to stay focused and when I got home my daughter sat on the floor.

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,480
She was very surprised to see me because she saw everything that happened on TV.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,520
She thought dad was dead because she knew he was there-

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,860
-And she thought when I didn't get home that I went there too.

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,020
But she did not understand that telephone communication did not work, so none of us could call her.

22
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,920
When I held her, she said:

23
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,220
"Dad hugged me harder and he kissed me a little more, why?".

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,500
I didn't know what to say, but the phone rang which was very worrying-

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,420
-For that telephone network had been turned off.

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,940
So when we picked up the phone it was my husband and now he sounded different.

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,420
Now he says: "Everything is gone, it's gone".

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,820
"I can't see my feet. I can't see anything, it's gone."

29
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,420
I didn't connect what he meant.
 He constantly said it was dark, but it was still daylight out.

30
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,680
But he said he would call me at 10am and that he would be near towers 7.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,340
So we hung up and my friend from Tennessee called me.

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,080
I said, "No, don't talk anymore".

33
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,220
"Here's the phone number I want you to call so you can tell the family that we are okay. Joe is near tower 7".

34
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,680
She became quiet and I asked why she was.

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,400
Then she told me that Torn 7 had just collapsed.

36
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,340
I don't remember having put on, I don't remember anything.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,500
I just remembered that my daughter said it was evil.

38
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,120
"That we could talk to dad and that God then removes him".

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,420
For some reason I became very logical and grabbed her and said:

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,940
"You have to understand that there are thousands of people who will never get the last call. We got it."

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,879
"Dad said he would call us at 10am and we will wait until 10 o'clock".

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,700
But Dad never called, so in the morning we thought he was dead.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh my God!
 Oh my God!

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,400
"We have these pictures that no one can ever forget."

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,000
The World Trade Center in New York is burning.

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,320
A few minutes before three this afternoon, two planes drove into the two scratches in the middle of central New York.

47
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,200
I was there before the second tower raged.

48
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,740
It was crazy, people ran.

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,380
We led them to Brooklyn Bridge.

50
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,439
People came out with dust everywhere and I had to make a call from a satellite phone.

51
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,040
I could call her and explained to her what happened-

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,079
-And at the same time I continued to do my job and I forgot what I said.

53
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,919
I forgot I would call her at 10am.

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,540
When I got home I was covered with dust.

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,460
I had fallen in the brilliance and hurt myself.

56
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:44,140
But if I had gone to the hospital, you must not go back.
 You may not participate.

57
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,100
So I kept it quiet about it.

58
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,580
I told her because she was an emergency care.

59
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
I said "Sew me please".

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,580
I cried and she saw it.

61
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,580
Then I just said "you need to sew this so I can go back".

62
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,440
Later I find out that two of my friends had died in the second tower.

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,400
They were police officers.

64
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,620
It was difficult to accept that this was the largest crime scene we ever during my lifetime.

65
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,660
I had been a police officer for almost 30 years.

66
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:29,199
He didn't talk about four days when he got home.

67
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,400
He would just take a shower and sat in the living room.

68
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,840
He looked at the clock until it was time to go back.

69
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,380
We couldn't understand it, but what we needed as a family was that Dad hugged us.

70
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,480
To tell us it was okay and he didn't.

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,240
The fourth day when he got home he had a note that he looked at-

72
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,160
-And I took it and could read names I recognized.

73
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
I asked what it was and he replied that they were gone.

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,460
I said "removed from service?." No, they are gone ".

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,160
They were killed and then he said, "I don't understand how they died and I lived".

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,320
I did not know what to say to him because patients I tried to help have sometimes died.

77
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,480
When it has died, I have always wondered what I did wrong.

78
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,320
I have never thought that they might have been too sick, so I understood what he felt.

79
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,400
But despite that, we became a broken family, we just couldn't talk about September 11.

80
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,880
It was too difficult and we could not accept that this happened in our own country, in our city.

81
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,280
We just couldn't accept it and we lived for about seven years.

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,480
The emotions remain, you feel it.

83
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,280
She has the dreams, I have the dreams.

84
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,240
No, they are not dreams.
 They are nightmares.

85
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
In the middle of the night I see her get up.

86
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,400
She will help a firefighter among the trash.

87
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,600
You know, something like that and it's hard.

88
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,700
We are fighting!

89
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,080
We are fighting against and we continue.

90
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,440
How long did it take until you went back to Ground Zero?

91
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,760
So after the attacks when you worked there.

92
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,840
About 10 years.

93
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,520
It was, about ten years.

94
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,400
How did it feel to be there after ten years?

95
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,920
First I could see what they did about the construction of the place.

96
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:45,760
But I could feel there with the dust clouds and people who cried and screamed.

97
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,360
That's all.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,200
Wherever I went, I knew what was there before.

99
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,720
So it's a reminder.

100
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,560
With the trauma you have?

101
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
It is difficult.

102
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,960
Advice from the medical part of the World Trade Center is offered.

103
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,680
So they give us help.

104
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,199
They give us an understanding of what everyone else goes through.

105
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,199
I'm not alone, others experience the same thing I know.

106
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,240
This disappointment, I don't call it hatred.

107
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,560
The disappointment at those who came and did this.

108
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:52,980
I wasn't the only one who thought that way.

109
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,920
You also have diseases because of this, right?

110
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
We didn't know we were sick.

111
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,200
We thought everything that happened had to do with working too hard or getting older.

112
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,160
We both have stomach problems that, due to the acid, actually come up.

113
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,360
It will eventually cause suffrageal cancer, there is no way out of that.

114
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,200
He has more problems than I do.

115
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,000
We both have problems with our breathing.
 He sleeps with a machine.

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He takes medication every morning.

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,780
He has around 20 bottles of pills that he stopped taking for a while when it was so depressing.

118
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,520
So I bought a cabinet cabinet and put it in the bathroom and said:

119
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,720
"You don't have to see the pills. Just get up in the morning and take them so you don't have to see them."

120
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
Then ended with me doing the same.

121
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,640
It is difficult for us to accept that we are sick.

122
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,840
No, we do not want to accept it but every time the doctor gives us a new diagnosis we know how it will end.

123
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,960
We know how it will end, we have lost friends.

124
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,720
We tell each other that until that day comes, until the doctor says there is nothing else you can do-

125
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,120
-So we live, because we have to.

126
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,080
But losing friends is the hardest and we have lost more friends-

127
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,520
-Af after 9/11 due to 9/11 than we did 9/11 due to illnesses.

128
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,120
Due to illnesses?

129
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,000
Due to illnesses and they are horrible diseases.

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
People continue to die too, right?

131
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Yes.

132
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,760
We have had over 180 cancers and Congress only wants to accept 56 of these.

133
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,280
So I mean, there are people who die and do not get medical care because the congress said no.

134
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,320
It does not consider it to be an acceptable illness.

135
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,760
So how many more people have to die before the congress realize that we die?

136
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,800
We die, I don't know where we will be in ten years.

137
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,320
I don't know if you will come back in ten years and interview us, we may be gone.

138
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:16,140
It is a tough pill to swallow because we will soon have a grandchild.

139
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,420
Tomorrow, right?

140
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,780
Tomorrow we have a granddaughter in Texas.

141
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,700
It is not fair to them that they lose their grandparents.

142
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,360
But it is also important to us that they are told that they lost their grandparents because of something we did.

143
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,880
We want them to have that inheritance men-

144
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,440
-But also understand that they need to do good things in this world as well.

145
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,600
That is the assignment for us.
 We must continue to tell the world to keep doing good things.

146
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,820
You will go through a tragedy in your life and it will change you.

147
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,640
You have to let that change be positive.

148
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:58,300
You can't let this change give you hatred, because that's the only option.

149
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,460
Anger and hatred, I don't want to live that way.

150
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,500
Today as you say when you hear about terrorist attacks or shootings and similar things happening.

151
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,080
Are you still afraid when you hear something?

152
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,380
Because of that day ..

153
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,200
New York City is a fantastic city where you can go anywhere by taking the train, so I've always traveled.

154
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,520
Some fantastic female volunteers here found out that I couldn't take the train anymore.

155
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,740
They took me on a train, I panicked and was very upset but they talked to me in the meantime.

156
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,120
However, I have not been on a train since.

157
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:44,520
Because I did it with them and there was some comfort.
 I thought I couldn't do it.

158
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,400
What did they tell me well?
 You can do it, you did it with us.

159
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,880
So now you don't have to worry about ever doing it again, don't worry about it!

160
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,980
It is a society where you are in a club that you did not want to be a member of.

161
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,360
We are undoubtedly involuntary members of this September 11 club.

162
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,080
But had it not been for the tribute center I would not have met the people I did.

163
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,880
These are the ones who helped me to heal and it was they who helped him heal.

164
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,820
We have become a family and it is thanks to the tribute center.

165
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,620
Why would we like to tell our story?
 Surely no one wants to hear.

166
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,320
But people continue to come and as long as they continue to do so, we are willing to talk.

167
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,620
Simply because they stole the votes for almost 3000 people but they did not stole ours.

168
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,080
That's how we fight that terrorism, we're still talking.

169
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,399
If you include all people from Pentagon.

170
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:44,540
Oh, yes!
 Pentagon, Shanksville.
 We have met them, we have gone to their memory moments.

171
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,900
We don't like the reason for how we met them, but we are very proud to have them in our life-

172
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,920
-for it had not been for what we all went through, we would not have met the most wonderful people.

173
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,620
We have traveled all the way to Gander in Newfoundland just to say thanks to the city.

174
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:14,460
A city in Canada that received 38 aircraft with over 7,000 people that day.

175
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,900
Their population knew exactly what they would do and I've always said-

176
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,300
-That they showed the best side of humanity when we saw the worst.

177
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,120
It is the kindness of so many strangers after 9/11.

178
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,300
In our own city I could not walk a block without someone offering me a hamburger or a sandwich-

179
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,580
-or a bottle of water and so it was!

180
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,740
These are those days, all year after 9/11 that we hold up at-

181
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,880
-For we saw kindness and humanity when it was best.

182
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,440
After these 24 hours where we struggled to fight the hatred and get people out.

183
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,520
We tried to help people out if there were any survivors left.

184
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,180
We live with it, could anyone have done something to save these people?

185
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:07,880
18 years later we know that people had to die because of exactly where the aircraft drove in.

186
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,020
But so many of us wonder what we may have done differently.

187
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,220
It's hard not to, but when we hear from a knife cut or a shooting.

188
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:25,720
To Ecampel the latest shootings in Pearl Harbor, the one in the grocery store and in Florida.

189
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,340
We thought "wait, no?".

190
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,180
This happened three four days in a row and we just sat down.

191
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,620
We didn't go anywhere.
 We sat down and tried to breathe and tried to go through it.

192
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:45,960
We talk on the phone with our friends who ask if we are okay which we are not.
 How do we solve this?

193
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,180
Then he gets quiet and I don't want to talk.

194
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,380
Then after four or five days I say: "No, we can't continue like this".

195
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,520
We have to come back, we have to come back.

196
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,380
Every terrorist attack, shooting and knife-cutting is a reason for us to continue to fight-

197
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,780
-And make our community stronger, but it's tough.

198
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:12,400
The first few days we relived 9/11 and we have to find a way to get through it.

199
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,420
We are not the only ones, there are thousands in the same situation.

200
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,740
In addition to all this, seven people who worked after the attacks of 9/11-related diseases died.

201
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,320
When all these things were going on, we would lose people because of the terrorist attack.

202
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,360
Because of the poisons they breathed in.

203
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:37,020
So now we see all horrible things that happen in the other side of town and then our friends die.

204
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,700
It was a tough two weeks for us.

205
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:49,060
But, but we're here, that's the only way we can think of.
 We are here, we survived.

206
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:21,040
Many have used the terrorist attack to split human

207
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,000
-and spreading hatred for political reasons.

208
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,580
What do you think about it?

209
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,840
Politics has no one to do with September 11.

210
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:38,060
I do not care.
 That day it didn't matter what your religion was.
 It didn't matter what your faith was.

211
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,260
It didn't matter what skin color you had.

212
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,860
That day was all a hero, they saved someone else and they didn't say ::

213
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,720
"Are you Catholic? Are you Jewish? Are you a Protestant?"

214
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,580
No, that day we were all just humans and that's how it should continue.

215
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,380
When it comes to politics.
 Politicians who want to help us can come.

216
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,140
If they will not help us then do not criticize us, do not talk to us about it.

217
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:06,240
Some come to us to ask about conspiracy theories.

218
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,180
We look at them and say I'm not a conspiracy theory.
 It happened!
 I'm here!

219
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,880
I'm here to tell you it happened and I was there.
 He can tell because he saw it.

220
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,140
What conspiracy theories?
 Oh, the government did.
 If our government did, I don't want to hear.

221
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,140
No, I'm worried about the affected families and that's what the world needs to care about.

222
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,140
Conspiracy theories belong where they belong, the one who started it, keep it.
 We say to children:

223
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,180
"Want to learn more? Get where the stories are. Lift your head off the computer and stop thinking:

224
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,920
"They said this and they said the other".

225
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,880
Go there where the stories are.
 Go to the people who lived and experienced it.

226
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,799
Go to the truth!
 Conspiracy theories?
 We live it!

227
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,080
This is not a theory, it is not a conspiracy.

228
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,620
What was a conspiracy was that 19 men believed in a man's hatred.

229
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,340
They came here and thought it was honorable to kill themselves.

230
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,820
They believed in the theory from the hated man, we don't even like to say his name.

231
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,800
It was a conspiracy, he told them to hate us and they decided they would kill us.

232
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,980
Do you want to talk about a conspiracy?
 It was a conspiracy!

233
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,600
Anyone who continues to shoot people because they are Jews or because they are Mexicans.

234
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:30,160
Those who continue to treat them poorly because someone told them that they are criminals, it is a conspiracy theory!

235
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,520
Read on.
 Attention.
 Make your own research.
 Educate yourself!

236
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,920
Don't believe what someone says just to tell us to the children.

237
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,300
Common sense.

238
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,140
If you want to know the truth, go where the truth is.

239
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't believe in anything that someone tells me just because they told me it.

240
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,960
I want to investigate and think for myself!

241
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,140
The 18 men who did this did not think through it themselves.

242
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,260
They believed in what a man said to them:

243
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,040
"We have to kill Americans, we have to hurt them"

244
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,900
"Let's influence their finances, let's influence their military, let's influence their government" and that's what they did-

245
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,120
-and the murdered people because of this.

246
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,320
I have no time for conspiracy theories, not at all!

247
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,760
No, it's not on the map!

248
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,460
This is also a reason why I want to make this video so your votes are heard.

249
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,380
Politics has nothing to do with it, it is a human issue.

250
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,760
It is the human factor.

251
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,180
So I guess this is your message or why do you want to do this interview?

252
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:44,640
I hope that children will see this and understand that you start to start thinking yourself early.

253
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,120
If someone tells you to bully someone and you do it-

254
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,160
-trot that the person has not done anything to you.
 Just because someone tells you to do it.

255
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,480
The terrorists thought in the same way.

256
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
"Oh, this man told us what Americans did, that and the other-

257
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,500
-So we'll believe it. "

258
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,720
Think for yourself, be your own person.

259
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,840
My most important message to children is:

260
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,020
“You are our future so you need to find a way to make society stronger-

261
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,000
-So if hate comes there it is already strong

262
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,320
Your society will fight against it and then everyone knows: "See what they were doing".

263
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,940
That's what I brought with me after September 12 when we heard about what they were doing in Gander, Newfoundland.

264
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,780
They were as scared as we, they accepted 38 aircraft.

265
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,600
What if a terrorist was aboard one of these?
 They opened their doors.

266
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,660
No matter how nice we were here in New York, I would never open my door to anyone and say to them:

267
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,860
"Here, take a shower. I'll be back in a while"

268
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,340
You just don't do it here, but so did people in Gander.

269
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,160
They did it.

270
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
So they showed us that it can be done.

271
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,300
Friendliness and humanity.
 That's it, humanity!

272
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,660
For me, it's always about our young people.

273
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,480
Learn, hear the stories of those who were there who tell us how it happened and why.

274
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
They don't say you should hate anyone.

275
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,460
They say you should be your very best, be the change you want to see in this world.

276
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,460
It is my message whether you are young or old.

277
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:19,920
There are some people who still carry feelings of hatred and we understand them.

278
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,640
But we try to meet them and say:

279
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,320
"When you wear anger, just let them win. Do you want them to win?"

280
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,180
Please be the best thing you can be.

281
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:40,680
Be as good a person as possible and if we can get this message we will.

282
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,380
That is why we are here, we are all people, we are all the same.

283
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,560
But we have differences that are what makes us unique.

284
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,480
When I hear from someone who tells me:

285
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,140
"Oh, this is how we celebrate it in our country".

286
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
"It is fantastic!

287
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
We care and learn more about it.

288
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,140
"Wow, it's amazing! We might take it after that!"

289
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,840
Now that we are grandparents, we want them to bring this with them.

290
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,740
It is the best way to teach your children by learning about other people.

291
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,660
You are never too old to learn, never too old to learn.

292
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,160
It is you!

293
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,260
I want to thank you for this interview.

294
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,500
I want to thank you so much for this.

295
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,640
You are our voice.
 That's it, you're our voice.

296
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,220
We are the voice for those living in this and you are our voice to spread the message.

297
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:35,380
I am very grateful to meet you, it has been very interesting to listen to your stories.

298
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,679
I know it's very tough and hard-

299
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,340
-And I know you were also worried about doing this interview.

300
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,520
Yes.

301
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,560
You really send a message that I hope those who see this take care of.

302
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,860
Thanks!

303
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,120
Defend the right for humanity!

304
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
All cultures.

305
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,540
All cultures.

306
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,580
Thanks so much, thank you!

307
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,320
Thank you for coming!

308
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,820
Now let's help you put everything back.

309
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:01,880
Does it feel good?

310
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,500
Yes!

311
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,460
Good!
