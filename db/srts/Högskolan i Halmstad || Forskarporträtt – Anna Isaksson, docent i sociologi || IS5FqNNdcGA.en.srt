00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:16,213
My name is Anna Isaksson and I am an associate professor of sociology at the Academy of Health and Welfare.

2
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:23,055
- A main track in my research is about something called norm -critical design.

3
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:26,889
And how to use norm -critical design -

4
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:31,853
–Can make visible invisible norms, habitual performances -

5
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:34,818
- And things that we take for granted in our everyday lives.

6
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,728
Norms that consciously or unconsciously can result in discrimination -

7
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:42,520
- And exclusion of different groups.

8
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:50,429
Together with a research group, we have together developed a method and approach.

9
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,558
-And it is first that we do a survey you can say -

10
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,213
- Above what it looks like within an organization.

11
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:04,256
For example, what norms prevent the development of equality and diversity in a workplace.

12
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:09,830
–And when we then compile and analyze what we have obtained through the mapping -

13
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,853
- So we not only present these research results -

14
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:16,928
- In the form of a scientific publication or report.

15
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:23,204
- The extent we translate these results into so -called norm -critical design concepts.

16
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:28,078
It is simply physical things that illustrate and visualize -

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,750
- The norms that we have seen as obstructs in the first step.

18
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,921
And this can be a bit provocative and that is the idea.

19
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,152
Because we want to visualize problems and obstacles -

20
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,349
- And so that the organization can jointly discuss "okay, this is what it looks like".

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,664
So the next step is about being norm creative and being more solution -oriented.

22
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:57,053
This also creates room for change and innovation.

23
00:01:57,053 --> 00:02:01,088
- For example within the fire defense that we have worked a lot with -

24
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:06,720
- There we have focused on norms in, for example, physical environment -

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,958
- which contributes to exclusion and discrimination.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,566
Then we produced a norm -critical design concept that we called the "recovery room".

27
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:21,134
How would the physical environment, for example, dressing rooms -

28
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:26,677
- Known is arranged in a different way to promote inclusion and participation.

29
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:31,352
Based on this norm -critical design concept, we worked together -

30
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:38,208
–With the current fire defense and also an architectural firm ahead -

31
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,237
- This norm -creative solution that we call "social building norm" -

32
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:48,598
–A which focuses on the social aspects and why it and why it is important to elucidate -

33
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:50,799
- In connection with rebuilding and new construction.

34
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,090
- There are a lot of studies that have pointed out that organizations like to - want -

35
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,493
“But it is difficult to work with their gender equality and diversity work.

36
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:05,864
And you have long -liked -

37
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:10,518
- Scientifically proven and concrete methods for this work.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,531
And there has been something that I together with the research group I worked a lot with -

39
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,555
- Has sought to contribute.

40
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,370
To really develop methods that are perceived as meaningful -

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,142
- And which is actually a tool in the concrete change work.

42
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,602
- Many have lifted that you see a great value in working with -

43
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:40,642
- To visualize research results also in physical things.

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,849
And that is because theories -

45
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,864
–S, for example, concerns gender, equality, equality and diversity -

46
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:55,040
- In many ways, it is perceived as abstract and difficult to put into practical action.

47
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:57,304
Why I think it's important to conduct research -

48
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:01,395
- It is to actually contribute to change in the surrounding community

49
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:08,005
- In addition to the research I conduct, I also work part of my service -

50
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:12,099
- At Leap for Life, which is an innovation center.

51
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:17,120
Leap for Life has a great focus on information -driven care.

52
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,040
–And I have had the opportunity for several years to participate in Project -

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,471
–In elderly care, for example -

54
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,357
- Where I have been able to study and follow up on the introduction of digital technical solutions.

55
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,881
Another important part of my work day is teaching.

56
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,230
–When I find very exciting and developing -

57
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,011
–And where you as a researcher are also given the opportunity to take part in -

58
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,571
- Students' wise recording

59
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:55,167
There I also think that questions related to -

60
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:01,664
- Genus, equality and diversity are incredibly important for students to take part in.

61
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,469
Many of our students step into a working life -

62
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:09,503
- As in several ways, unequal.

63
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,966
And then I think it is important that we as a higher education institution prepare them -

64
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,549
- To be able to meet this.
