1
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:01.736
What you done?

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,595
After all, it was just tearing everything up.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05.385
I see it, but you would just fix a little neighbor.

4
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:08.616
Yes, it was probably the desire if you say.

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,699
But no.

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,256
Hello Hello!

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17.536
Hello Hello!

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,516
Do you hear we were at Öland this summer.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,375
Yes, very nice.

10
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:23,572
Check out Pers Sarolea where you had built.

11
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:25,530
You had some small fixes on yours.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,610
Yes, it wasn't really like this I had imagined.

13
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:34,159
The fun here is that we would use this motorcycle as a reference

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,015
Before we went to Öland, so one would understand

15
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:37,395
What it was.

16
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,444
It was not intended that this should be a project.

17
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:41.811
No, but it was.

18
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:43,465
Yes, you see that it is still a motorcycle.

19
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45.305
But it is a little bit picked.

20
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,436
After all, you had removed the lamp last.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,076
Yes, I don't know.

22
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,550
Probably they have built this mound for them to have it as a pedistal

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,736
And just have something to look at because everything was resolved.

24
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:57.819
Every screw, nut.

25
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,229
I mean the connection and everything raged and.

26
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05.566
Yes then i did not get the charge up and then i have been doing

27
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,650
And tried to get hold of a generator.

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,496
But this is this, a Miller generator.

29
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,760
Fairly common generator in England at BSA and Royal Enfield,

30
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,699
But they always had their switches in the engine block.

31
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:28,209
But Sarolea has her switch for the ignition then in the generator.

32
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:33,166
So that generator is pretty rare because it's just sarolea

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,905
that uses it.

34
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,886
So the only generator I could find.
