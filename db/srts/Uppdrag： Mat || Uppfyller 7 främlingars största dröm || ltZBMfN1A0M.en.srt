1
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:04.452
OH J *** LAR!

2
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:14,218
It will be a small journey through Sweden where we surprise people with cars, computers, education and lots of other things.

3
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:17,218
The section is sponsored by Volvo on Demand.

4
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,486
- Welcome to a really snowy Umeå.

5
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:22,000
Now we're going to surprise a guy named Mattis

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Who loves Fortnite.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Servant Mattis!

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
- Hi Mauri!

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
- Hello!

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
- What are you doing here in my house?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
- Yes, what do I do here in your house?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We have some stuff going on for you today.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And there is a neighbor.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hello!

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,438
- Where are you going?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Should you cut yourself?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Can you see the hairstyle now?

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,200
Can we meet you then when we pull and see how it became?

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,680
- Sure you get.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,520
- Do you have any idea why we are here?

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,240
- Yes, then ...

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
No, maybe something to do with weightlifting?

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
- What are your biggest passions in life?

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
- I play a lot.

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,240
Fortnite is the best I know.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,320
- What, you should become a professional?

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,600
- Yes, but that would have been the dream.

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,720
Sit and stream and work with.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,880
So just play. It would have been absolutely fantastic.

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,080
- But what stops you then?

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25.560
- Yes, my computer has not been completely gallant.

32
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,840
- Why don't you buy a new one?

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,960
Like, come on.

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,760
Okay, now it's two hours earlier.

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,880
We stand here with Matti's best friend.

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,120
We have to fix some stuff for him today.

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,080
- Yes. - I was so happy that you heard from it.

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Because you have no super computer yourself, but you want to give him a good computer.

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,960
A real brother is what you are.

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,560
- Last Sunday night, then it was a tournament.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,560
But then in the middle of the tournament, his computer crashed.

42
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
So then we could not continue.

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,800
- And now we will immediately go to the Elgiganten and fix a really bold gaming computer.

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02.800
And he has no idea.

45
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,320
- No.

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,400
- He doesn't have a rush.

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
- It feels unreal.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't know if I dream.

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,480
- Let's go!

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,040
- It's like you just start nosy on the most expensive computer in the department.

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,400
What else do you want then?

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
Now that you're in such a greedy mood.

53
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,040
- A mouse, keyboard, screen, chair.

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,040
- Chair? A chair?

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
- Yes, but that's good.

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,040
- It feels like you're in heaven.

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,040
- It will be fun to see his reaction.

58
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,040
- Okay, now we're at Mattis. I thought you are hiding.

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Then I run up, lurking him away for a walk.

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,040
And then you go up, install the entire computer so that everything is ready.

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,720
And then we come back and so Mattis just gets to enjoy.

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
- Yes, that sounds good.

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
- Okay, good.

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Okay, welcome to a really snowy Umeå.

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,720
Now we should surprise a guy named Mattis who loves Fortnite.

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,520
- Do you have any idea why we are here?

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,320
- Okay, now they're gone so now I'm standing up and building the computer together.

68
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,492
We would like to order two kebab plates.

69
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:18,185
Certainly?

70
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:27,170
- Hi Yes?

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,600
- Do you have any idea what we have too little plan today?

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,920
- When you said we would wrestle, I was scared.

73
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,360
- But you have to guess what to do. What would you guess?

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,600
- Should I have a gym?

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
- Get a gym?

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,320
- Okay, now you went too far up. It was very high.

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,640
Should we train together? No, should I have a gym?

78
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,160
- No, but I don't really know.

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00.320
- No, you'll see.

80
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
- I will see.

81
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,480
- Okay, now I think we should go up in your apartment.

82
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
- Yes.

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
-I have a little thing.

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09.760
-In my apartment?

85
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
- Yes, you will see.

86
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,000
- Now you really wonder what it is going on.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,160
- Yes, but that's ... I recognize.

88
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,960
He doesn't know what it is.

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,280
- Elias heard from me a few weeks ago.

90
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,520
So he's been here all the time.

91
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,960
And filled and built.

92
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
What do you feel?

93
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,200
- Pirr.

94
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
- Then I think you are welcome.

95
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:35,884
- Oh J ** Vlar!

96
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:42,122
- Here you have a real competition computer.

97
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:44,505
- Oh chill!

98
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,480
It's a real gaming chair.

99
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Damn!

100
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,199
For 30,000?

101
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:51,969
- We were at the elegant today and bought everything.

102
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,520
31,000 it cost it.

103
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,313
- Yes it is totally ...

104
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,390
Yes it is crazy.

105
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:59,351
- Thanks so much Elias, I love you.

106
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
- You have to repay this in some way. Not in money, but ...

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,680
- You can get a lot of hugs. 31,000 hugs you can get.

108
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08.920
- 31,000 hugs!

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
- We take another.

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,800
- Now the question is how it went for the neighbor who would cut. I think I lived here.

111
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,040
Well, of course it was good!

112
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,760
It was great! You almost halved the length, huh?

113
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,400
- Yes, yes, yes.

114
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,880
- How satisfied are you with the frill?

115
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,080
- Super!

116
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,920
- You're super happy?

117
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,400
- Yes!

118
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,200
- It was fun!

119
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,120
Nice to meet you.

120
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,040
- The same!

121
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
- Now we move on.

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,520
- The next surprise is about a young man named Albin.

123
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,000
Who loves Youtube stars Jocke and Jonna.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
More than anything else in life.

125
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,000
Today he will meet them.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,760
And he has no idea.

127
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,520
There he comes.

128
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,240
Servant, Albin!

129
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,600
Here you have him.

130
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,600
21-year-old Albin from Växjö, who actually has its own Youtube channel.

131
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,880
- Does it feel annoying, Albin?

132
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58.560
- No.

133
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,400
- Not?

134
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,760
- No.

135
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00.320
- Nothing at all?

136
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,680
- No.

137
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,000
- Do you like surprises?

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02.600
- Yes.

139
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,080
- You do it?

140
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,720
- Yes.

141
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,680
- In that case, this will be a day in your taste, Albin.

142
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,840
Since this is going to be a day completely in your taste, it may be that I knew you like chocolate balls.

143
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,160
- Yes.

144
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
- So I actually made an order yesterday ...

145
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
- You are welcome.

146
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
- There are still many chocolate balls, Albin.

147
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32.560
- I will not be able to cope with everyone.

148
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34.560
- Cheers for you to have the world's best day today.

149
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,040
- Yes.

150
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
- Does it feel nervous when there are lots of cameras and stuff like this?

151
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,000
- No.

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,320
- It's like you've just been expecting your whole life to have these cameras on you.

153
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
- Yes, it will be visible on Youtube.

154
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,080
- This will definitely appear on Youtube.

155
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
- I will launch that.

156
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
- Will you lay the video?

157
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
- Yes.

158
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
- King.

159
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Thanks.

160
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,440
- Which youtubers do you like the most?

161
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,040
The Lundell family.

162
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,880
- How much more than me do you like them?

163
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
- A lot.

164
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00.880
- So, if I'm here, where is Jocke and Jonna.

165
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02.320
- So.

166
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
- Up there?

167
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,280
- It's a bit up to.

168
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,680
I have a bit left.

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08.880
I think we should go away.

170
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,160
And then you should simply see what your surprise is.

171
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,360
- That's a good idea.

172
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,800
- Do you feel tagged?

173
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
- I'm peppered.

174
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,240
- You're peppered?

175
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,480
- Yes.

176
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,400
- Let's go.

177
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
- Should we pull.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,920
- Now I have to put on an blindfold so you don't really know what's going on.

179
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,440
- Okay.

180
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,800
- Are you okay or?

181
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,320
- Yes.

182
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
- So.

183
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
- Should we hug?

184
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,120
- Should we hug?

185
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
I was just kidding.

186
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,280
- You don't want to hug?

187
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,960
- Yes.

188
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,486
- Do you want it, okay.

189
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Now we run blindfold.

190
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
- Hey there.

191
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,720
- Hello on yourself. Are you pumped?

192
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
- Yes.

193
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,720
- Do you have any idea what is going to happen?

194
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
- No.

195
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
- Are you nervous?

196
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
- No not yet.

197
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,720
- If you had been nervous, would you dare admit that you were nervous?

198
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
- No.

199
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,040
What is this? I think it's a bridge.

200
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,720
- A bridge? You could stand right here if it's okay?

201
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,040
And just wait for a minute.

202
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,880
Okay, are you ready for a little surprise?

203
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,520
Now you are starting to get nervous. It's nothing dangerous.

204
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,680
- I'm not nervous.

205
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,280
- Do you promise it?

206
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
One two...

207
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,120
- In this video there is paid collaboration with Volvo on Demand-

208
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,120
-What is a service where you book a car.

209
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,280
Often you do not need a car, but sometimes you really need a car.

210
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
Then Volvo on Demand is perfect.

211
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,680
As a regular car stands still 95 % of the time-

212
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,200
-the is needed a lot of parking spaces.

213
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,240
But if you share by car as you do with Volvo on Demand-

214
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,280
-The replaces the need for parking spaces.

215
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00.560
Therefore, I have decided that this will be a park instead.

216
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08.560
- We would only collaborate with Volvo on Demand, but now Mauricio wants to demolish all parking spaces.

217
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,560
- It's absolutely fantastic! You download the app, register with BankID and pick up a car whenever you want.

218
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17.560
No one needs to put their own stupid car in a parking lot again.

219
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:24.560
- Yes, but he has a point in what he says. Volvo on Demand is super smooth, but Mauri has started to derail.

220
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,560
- Women there, swings there, bushes there, trees here.

221
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36.560
- Mauricio, what are you doing? We have to move on to the next recording.

222
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41.560
You know that you don't even need a car key. The phone is even key.

223
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51.560
So if you also need a car sometimes download the app and use the discount code in the description.

224
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54.560
You too! Thanks Volvo Demand!

225
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,320
- Now you are getting nervous. It's nothing dangerous.

226
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02.400
- I'm not nervous.

227
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
- Do you promise it?

228
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,920
- One two Three.

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
- Hello.

230
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,526
- You can hug them.

231
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:14,360
- Do you get a hug? Is it okey?

232
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,840
- It's funny.

233
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,040
- It is fun. Now they stand here.

234
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,540
- Yes.

235
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,640
- You can hug them again if you want.

236
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,400
- Yes, I want that.

237
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,680
- We thought you could record a Youtube video with Jocke and Jonna today.

238
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,840
Isn't that good news anyway?

239
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,340
- Yes.

240
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,200
- Do you want to come in and look around a bit?

241
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,700
- Yes.

242
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
- I guess you probably recognize you then.

243
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,400
- But are you going to go in now? What do you want to do?

244
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,080
- Check everywhere.

245
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
- Then we look everywhere.

246
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
- But what are you eager to do now?

247
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,600
- Challenge.

248
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
- Shall we do a challenge?

249
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,300
Let's go.

250
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
- Now it slams!

251
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,425
- should I be with or should I ...

252
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05.800
Should I hide behind the chair?

253
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07.800
It feels on the verge of degrading.

254
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09.800
I should be honest with saying.

255
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
But I'm not Jocke and Jonna so ...

256
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,480
- Hello everyone and welcome to the world's best Albin's Youtube channel!

257
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,260
- Hello Hello!

258
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,440
- Then they recorded a clip for his channel while I patiently had to sit and wait behind Albin's chair.

259
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,740
- Can Mauri get up there behind the chair?

260
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,240
- Yes.

261
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,123
- Hello!

262
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,200
- Now you were kidding!

263
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,960
Okay.

264
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
How did it feel to record with Jocke and Jonna?

265
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,080
- It feels good.

266
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,800
- It makes it.

267
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes. Bye!

268
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,060
- Bye!

269
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,500
- Do you want to give them one last hug?

270
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,020
- Take care of you now.

271
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,260
- Okay, Albin. How did that feel like that?

272
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,660
- Best in life.

273
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,140
- Best day in life?

274
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,640
- Yes.

275
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,420
- Have you had the best day in life today?

276
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,920
- Yes.

277
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,420
- Why was it such a good day?

278
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,500
- because I could meet Jocke and Jonna

279
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,850
- And the next surprise, it takes place here in Linköping on exactly that retirement home.

280
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,639
Hello!

281
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,911
Is it Brit?

282
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
- It's Britt.

283
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,299
- Hello grandma.

284
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,490
- Hello, the mother.

285
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:17,529
- Hello.

286
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
- It will be a surprise.

287
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,490
- Should it now be a surprise?

288
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,490
- It will be a surprise.

289
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,490
- Oops.

290
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,490
- You, grandchildren, why did you hear from us?

291
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:31,153
Yes, but the thing was that Grandma has always had a relationship with Sami and joke above all.

292
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,100
And joke above all.

293
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,900
Since she is demented, music is such an important part of her life.

294
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,100
Because she remembers everything when she hears joke and music.

295
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,900
So then it has always been like this that it has been very fun for us.

296
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,900
But I think it's also fun for her to experience it.

297
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,900
One last time before she is no longer there.

298
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
But remember these two?

299
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
- Well, yeah.

300
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
- Yes, it's your grandchildren.

301
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,900
- grandchildren, yes yes grandchildren.

302
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00.207
- It is tedious.

303
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,660
She has been a very ... a grandmother who has been very close to me.

304
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06.660
When you went there it was often like this, you had to read books.

305
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,420
So every time it was Christmas then you only got books as a gift.

306
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,660
And so we always went for a walk.

307
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,900
So it's like this, there are a lot of personal memories.

308
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Because you have always grown up with her and so she has forgotten everything.

309
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,780
But yes...

310
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,740
That's what it is.

311
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,740
I like it very much, that's why I arranged this surprise.

312
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,300
- And then we know how much you like about music.

313
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,580
- Yes music I like yes.

314
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,420
- How present is she now?

315
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,700
- Not so much, unfortunately.

316
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,060
- Is it music and joke and stuff that is easiest to reach into her?

317
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,851
- We'll do that now.

318
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,620
- So fun!

319
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,500
- Here now at the elderly home in Linköping we have Maxida Märak.

320
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,620
One of Sweden's absolute best jokes. You have traveled from Jokkmokk to surprise Brit.

321
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,660
- I was told that Stig had wanted this to Brit, to his grandmother.

322
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,020
- I myself have had many around me older who have also suffered from dementia.

323
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,660
Although she is now in a completely different world-

324
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,780
- So it is still a world that for her is very active.

325
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Getting a part of it and maybe gilding it a little is huge for me.

326
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,940
This will be Brit's joke.

327
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,940
- Now comes the surprise.

328
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
- Hello!

329
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,745
- My name is Maxida Märak

330
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
It is incredible to be here.

331
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,940
- Do you remember joke?

332
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
- Well.

333
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,940
Yes, I knew that somewhere here.

334
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,940
In my head.

335
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,340
- Thanks so much.

336
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,860
- Thanks Brit yourself.

337
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
- Thanks.

338
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
Have a good one.

339
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
Thanks.

340
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,260
- Being able to hear Brit's joke is big.

341
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
And even for me I think.

342
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,660
It is noticeable that she listened and that she was in it.

343
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,660
And that it went into her.

344
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,860
- I'm very happy for my grandmother's sake.

345
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,020
Especially that this could happen before she is no longer there.

346
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,020
- Now we have to say hello for today.

347
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,020
Well.

348
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,940
The next surprise takes place in Kungälv outside Gothenburg.

349
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,580
Here has been a Phakwan Thai Taste, which is run by 47-year-old Rungnapa for two years.

350
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,980
Her biggest dream was all her life to run her own restaurant.

351
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,620
But after a fire six months ago, she lost many of her guests.

352
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,020
And even though the room is rebuilt, the restaurant is now on the ruin of the ruin.

353
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,380
Therefore, her daughter Rosita wondered if we could help the mother get more guests.

354
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,900
- Why did you feel that your mom deserves this a little extra?

355
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,580
- So she has not had time off for several years.

356
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:50,940
She has struggled for a long time with her financial situation and with us.

357
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,860
And she hasn't had it easy.

358
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,940
- How is it as a daughter to see her mother in this situation?

359
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,020
Ehm ...

360
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,220
Very poor. Ugh I will start crying.

361
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
I can't describe the feeling.

362
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,420
But we have no time to lose so we went down to central Kungälv to stage a small three-stage rocket-

363
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,420
-Hopefully can kick start the restaurant again.

364
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,420
- Now we are down in Kungälv, at your mother's restaurant.

365
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,020
I thought I would bring some extra guests.

366
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,020
What do you say?

367
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,820
It is still good for the day cash register.

368
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,020
We must hike on a joint, I think. It will be very long.

369
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,020
What a fucking bunch it was.

370
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,940
Here it is. Here it is.

371
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,660
We brought some extra guests today.

372
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,580
We have about 300 people, who we thought would visit yours in a restaurant.

373
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,140
Have you ever had so many guests?

374
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,140
- Never.

375
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
- Let's go!

376
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,820
For now, the lunch rush comes from hell.

377
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,100
- I'm sorry! We work as fast as we can!

378
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,060
- Is it stressful?

379
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
- Yes.

380
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,580
- How did it taste?

381
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,580
- Delicious!

382
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,060
- No, but it was just good in general.

383
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,420
- It tasted delicious!

384
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,020
- So, ten out of ten.

385
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,660
- How much does this restaurant mean to you?

386
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,700
- How much would it mean to you if this restaurant began to flourish again-

387
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,500
-and you got a lot of new customers?

388
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,220
- Do you want to tell them that they are welcome here?

389
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,580
I can not!

390
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,380
- Oh, you hide here behind me.

391
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,140
And now it was time for step two in our three -stage rocket.

392
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,620
- Kungälv and Gothenburg will be told about this restaurant.

393
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,740
Hang up, hang up. Will you hang these up?

394
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06.060
Uh-oh! Thank you, you're welcome.

395
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,740
Bye!

396
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,580
Hang up, hang up.

397
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,940
- Should we pull it on Poseidon? - At Poseidon?

398
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,020
If you take a photo and send it to me later.

399
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,142
- Now it's time for step three.

400
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:25,020
Welcome to JLC and Matkoma!

401
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,380
- Now I want you to help me put this map, this restaurant on the map.

402
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,380
- This map at the restaurant?

403
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,380
- Yes, I could have cut it off too.

404
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
I do not know.

405
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,380
Okay my gentlemen, you reach out to millions of people.

406
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
May you now think this is good.

407
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
- In Kungshamn then there was a Thai.

408
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
Then I ate this.

409
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,380
- A little anecdotes you offer. What a generosity.

410
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,380
1, 2, 3.

411
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,380
- This one was delicious.

412
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,380
- Very good.

413
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,380
- What are you saying?

414
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,380
- Thai food really tastes.

415
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,380
- What is the tone?

416
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
- What?

417
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,380
No, but it was good.

418
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,380
Unbelievable!

419
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
I thought it was good!?

420
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:32,420
Now there, after all, the question, can you with credibility post on your social media that this tastes good?

421
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,860
Yes!

422
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,900
1, 2, 3!

423
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,900
- We would just pull and then we met this man.

424
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Can you tell us that you found out that you were going here today?

425
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,900
- I looked at Instagram. We hurried here with the moped.

426
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,900
- And with that we leave Gothenburg. We have more surprises we will give people.

427
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
- Okay.

428
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,740
We have three surprises left to give.

429
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,100
Next takes place in Stockholm, where we start by receiving Emma-

430
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,220
-As has come by train from Nyköping.

431
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,380
- Hi, Mauri. Nice.

432
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,660
We will surprise your mother today.

433
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,263
So into hell.

434
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:19,220
- So in hell we'll do it!

435
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,980
- She's in a hotel waiting.

436
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,140
I have to understand a little who she is first.

437
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,460
- My mother has worked as a telephony technician all her life.

438
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,420
Monday to Friday eight to anywhere in the evening.

439
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,420
When the holiday is over, the anxiety begins to come.

440
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,460
She has been planning for this for many years.

441
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,220
- She talked about wanting to become a florist?

442
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,540
- Absolutely. She has always had this picture of herself.

443
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,220
That she is not worth anything in any way.

444
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,620
It has always held her back.

445
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,900
She kind of don't think she is worthy of love.

446
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,460
And it's damn tough to see with her.

447
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,900
- What is happening to her when she is allowed to be with flowers-

448
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
-And make wreaths and everything like that.

449
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,180
- But she just becomes a lovely person.

450
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,180
She really lights up.

451
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,780
It's like all these years we've seen her were so unhappy.

452
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07.660
That it just disappears.

453
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,020
And that is what is a mother for real.

454
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:16,500
- And today we will give her a whole education to florist.

455
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,740
She is going to be florist.

456
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
- It's so damn sick.

457
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,100
Yes.

458
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,180
I can not...

459
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,140
I have not been able to put eyeliner in three days.

460
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,940
Because I have been this very shaky.

461
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,540
I am nervous and think it is so damn cool that she should get this.

462
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,940
Then we go well and meet your mom.

463
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,380
- How hard if she looks through the box.

464
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,740
- Mom, where are you? Hi mom.

465
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,098
- You daughters told how much you love flowers.

466
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,699
- Yes, flowers make me happy.

467
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:46,925
- Why do flowers make you so happy then?

468
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,420
- I do not know.

469
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,860
But before we gave the surprise ourselves, Malin attracted the folk high school where the education takes place.

470
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,540
With the lid that she should be able to create her own bouquet with a teacher.

471
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,940
Hello? Hello Hello.

472
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,900
- Today Malin will only have an outlet for everything she loves.

473
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,220
- It smells good already.

474
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,580
- It's like a new person standing here. This smile of being in this environment.

475
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,820
- You like to do flowers? -It's the best I know.

476
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,460
Actually, I would like to work as a florist.

477
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
- What are we going to do here?

478
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,460
- You should try to bind an abdominal.

479
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,460
- Every flower also has a face.

480
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
- A face?

481
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
- Now it looks at me.

482
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,460
- Now it looks at me.

483
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,460
- The flowers usually talk to each other in the bouquets.

484
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,460
- The carnations have their language.

485
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,900
It should look like they are almost dancing at Ballerina years.

486
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,780
All flowers are like individuals.

487
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,740
- Are you like a female Ernst?

488
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,700
- Can you and I take a short break where we go out and then you describe nature to me?

489
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,820
- You just look at all the trees. They just stand and are safe.

490
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,300
- Did they possibly wake up over us? -Yes I think so.

491
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,620
There you have the eye and then you have your mouth.

492
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,620
- This one is so central in some way I think, so it should be more in the middle.

493
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,620
It's cool I think.

494
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,620
- How proud I am of you.

495
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,620
- History! I feel the wings of history.

496
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,620
All the people who have gone here.

497
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,620
- On this ground?

498
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,620
- Yes, have been here.

499
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,620
- Do you know them?

500
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,620
- No, I don't know them that way.

501
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
- Ernst had known them, I realize.

502
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,780
You are almost female Ernst.

503
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,300
- Yes almost.

504
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,036
- It is starting to get very nice here.

505
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:53,767
- No!

506
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:54,380
- Do not you think?

507
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,120
- No, I think it is starting to look really good.

508
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,800
- no I have to start over

509
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,740
- It feels like you have high demands on yourself Malin.

510
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,380
- It was a pretty good analysis.

511
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07.851
- Check out! You are very stupid.

512
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:09,780
Does she have a natural talent?

513
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,420
- Yeah. But I really think things have gone so well.

514
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,500
- But we were not really satisfied here.

515
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:23,420
We thought that you should also get a whole education for florist here at the interior design academy.

516
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,460
- No, you are kidding?

517
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,500
- You should become a florist, Malin.

518
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,340
- No, you are joking?

519
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,620
- No, it's not a joke.

520
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,700
- Then was...

521
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,020
Yes, what fun.

522
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,020
Yes thank you very much.

523
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,300
What strange, can you hug you?

524
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,900
You have told me many times. To do it just.

525
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:59,300
- Yes. I feel that your life is too short to keep up with what you don't want.

526
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
- Yes, just right.

527
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,180
- You just sacrificed everything for us all our lives.

528
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,660
You are so worth here, so I just want you to do it now.

529
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,580
You must stop thinking that you are not there.

530
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,028
- The old man ...

531
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:20,208
- I love you. I'm proud of you. Me too.

532
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,370
- I love you, most of all.

533
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,943
We like you too. You ended up a bit on the edge here.

534
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:34,567
And hopefully Malin walks on towards a whole new life.

535
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:38,095
So our journey continues in another direction, namely north.

536
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,940
- Welcome my ladies and gentlemen until an early morning in Skellefteå-

537
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,340
-There our next surprise will be played out.

538
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,340
In here lives a girl who wants to surprise her friend.

539
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,220
- Okay, true. Why did you hear from us?

540
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,220
- I saw your story.

541
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,420
The first thing that came to my head was Indra.

542
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,740
I wanted to do something for her-

543
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,220
-In that she had a little difficulty.

544
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,220
So her dad recently went away.

545
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,180
It has not been so fun lately.

546
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,900
Then I want to raise her mood. It is difficult what to do.

547
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,620
- What should we do to raise her mood?

548
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,180
- Give her a sea of yarn.

549
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,740
- We received so much mail. People wanted travel.

550
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,620
You just, could we get some yarn?

551
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,300
Then I felt that here had to go. She who wants yarn for her friend.

552
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,660
Why should we give all this yarn to Indra?

553
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,300
- She crochet and crochet and crochet.

554
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,420
I heard all the time that her fingers hurt.

555
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,780
Before Indra's dad died, she began to crochet on a blanket to him-

556
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,980
- If he would survive.

557
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,940
She never had it clear before he died.

558
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,500
- So she never got to give the blanket?

559
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,420
-How horrible. -Yes.

560
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,900
- But God, I feel that Indra deserves all this yarn.

561
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,980
She should have this yarn.

562
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,340
- Here lives Indra. Are you nervous?

563
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07.697
- Giant!

564
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,020
Hello indra!

565
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,620
- We have a little thing for you.

566
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,900
-How are you? -Good.

567
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,540
- It's good? -Yes.

568
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,060
- Sanna told us about a great passion you have in life.

569
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,049
- We have fixed some yarn.

570
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:31,049
-Oh my God!

571
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,460
Oh my God!

572
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
Thanks so much.

573
00:28:54,414 --> 00:29:00,260
It's so nice to get something that means so much.

574
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,660
It's totally sick.

575
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07.660
- When you see all that, do I have to suggest a classic party of yarnwar?

576
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,425
I left this wonderful duo and continued to our last destination Luleå.

577
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:39,580
Here Samuel was waiting for me, who wanted to give his dad a working car over the summer. So the father can do what he loves the most.

578
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,100
To go and meet their children who moved far from home.

579
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,100
- Why does your dad need a car over the summer?

580
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,780
- It is mainly to be able to go around Sweden and visit us children.

581
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,780
- But is he such a father who wants to meet his children a lot?

582
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57.020
- Mm, he often calls and talks and misses us.

583
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,900
- Now we will give your dad a summer where he gets to meet his children as much as he wants.

584
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,740
- Yes exactly.

585
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,260
- My plan is for us to pick up the car he will be going this summer.

586
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,540
And then we pick him up at work with that car.

587
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,540
Without knowing it is his new car this summer.

588
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,220
To fuck him a little in the head.

589
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,940
- It sounds nice.

590
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,300
- Good.

591
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,780
- I'm looking for a Patrik.

592
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,580
- Is he just about to go home?

593
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,340
Are we missing him?

594
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,780
- Yes.

595
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,820
- Tjena Patrik.

596
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,500
- Hello!

597
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,260
- Hello!

598
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,740
- We wonder if we could lend you for an hour now.

599
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,060
- Yes then.

600
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,460
- Is it ok if you drive?

601
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,180
- Yes then.

602
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,860
- Do you have driving license?

603
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,860
- Yes Yes.

604
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,860
A little like this shocked that you show up.

605
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,860
- You take the bus to work, right?

606
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,860
- Yes, it gets a little cheaper.

607
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
- What else do you like. do then?

608
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,860
- I am very interested in sports.

609
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,860
It is very chatting in the chat group Spring when it is hockey.

610
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
You are in different places but you still have that in common.

611
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
- How much do you hang out with your children?

612
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,340
- Now it is difficult when they do not live in the city.

613
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,840
- You would have liked to meet them more often?

614
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
- Yes, you always want that.

615
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09.840
They must have their lives.

616
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,360
- You can stay sometimes?

617
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,800
- Yes exactly.

618
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,800
- Are you starting to get annoying? What kind of crap I boiled together?

619
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,800
- Yes, a little curious.

620
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,300
- Now we are approaching.

621
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,800
A little Patrik surprise.

622
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,800
- Yes, you are here too.

623
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
I'm a little nervous about what you've found.

624
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,840
What should we go in or what is it as ...

625
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
I don't know what is ...

626
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,880
- No, it's hard for you to take lead here.

627
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
That's a bit of my responsibility actually.

628
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,400
- I leave it to you.

629
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
- I almost suggest ...

630
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Blindfold.

631
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,040
Okay...

632
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
- I'm getting nervous when you ...

633
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,920
A little laughing here next door.

634
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
- Okay.

635
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,520
I would like to give you a little gift.

636
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,340
- Okay.

637
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,340
- That should just be your whole this summer.

638
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,640
Namely...

639
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
This!

640
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:07.940
- Oh!

641
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09.920
- What do you say about that?

642
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,440
A little gift from me and Volvo on Demand!

643
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,640
- Yes, what should I say?

644
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I'm speechless.

645
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
It is superb!

646
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,920
It's worth so much.

647
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Incredibly much.

648
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
Thank you very much. Thanks.

649
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,920
- As a small extra-lights, you should also get 5,000 bucks in fuel.

650
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Just so you can go.

651
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,920
- Thanks so much, I say. It is absolutely incredible.

652
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,920
This I will remember incredibly long.

653
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,920
- Yes, you were going to say for the rest of your life, but you regretted the road and it was incredibly long.

654
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55.560
Now you have your new car. I still want to be involved when you inaugurate it.

655
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,680
Where should we go? What can we think of?

656
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
- Coffee.

657
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59.920
- Coffee?

658
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00.920
- Now the summer begins.

659
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02.440
- Now the summer begins!

660
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,400
Then Patrik and I went into the summer with his new car which we arranged together with Volvo on Demand.

661
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:18,080
And over a banana pastry, I was able to see that my tough job like Sweden tournament surprise clown was over for this time.

662
