1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.080
How to finance your growth.


2
00:00:03.247 --> 00:00:07.527
We'll now discuss financing
and different alternatives.


3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.600
If your business doesn't finance itself,


4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.440
or if you want to grow quicker than
possible with your own turnover,


5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.520
you may need to find other ways
of financing your growth.


6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.280
There's often a combination
of different financing forms.


7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.640
We at Almi are experts at
putting together this finance puzzle.


8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.760
We'll now look into loans,
development funds


9
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.800
and owner's capital and their
advantages and disadvantages.


10
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.120
Let's start with loans.


11
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.600
Here is a selection
of the banks and lenders


12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.800
on the market today.


13
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.200
Depending on what kind
of company form you choose,


14
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.040
the amounts of money
that you can borrow could vary.


15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.520
Almi has
a market supplementing role


16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.800
and lends out money in conjunction
with a bank or another lender.


17
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.560
You could also borrow money
for your day-to-day operations,


18
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.080
to offset fluctuations
in your company's cashflow


19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.360
or to feel safer.


20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.120
There are different alternatives
when your company


21
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640
needs to increase liquidity,


22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.480
for instance to deal with expenses
before you yourself have been paid.


23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.360
The advantage with a loan is that
you keep control of the company,


24
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.360
but the company
needs a stable revenue


25
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.080
in order to pay interest
and installments.


26
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.560
The other alternative is looking
into development funds.


27
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.560
The competition for these funds
is often big,


28
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.680
so whe recommend
that you talk to your Almi advisor


29
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.440
to see the options available for you.


30
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.920
There are regional business supports,
grants from Tillväxtverket


31
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.720
and Vinnova,
verification funds from Almi


32
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.480
and EU-grants, to name a few.


33
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.840
What you can apply for varies,


34
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.240
so you need to monitor
the different organizations.


35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.600
The advantage
with development funds


36
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.720
is that you don't need
to pay them back.


37
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.680
But this type of financing
is often micromanaged


38
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.520
and earmarked for certain work,
processes and cooperations.


39
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.160
So, you need to know
if a development fund


40
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.240
really helps your business and is in
keeping with what you want to do.


41
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.240
In certain cases, you might
be required to do cofinancing


42
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.600
or to make some own efforts
in order to apply for these funds.


43
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.640
The last financing alternative
we'll go through is owner's capital.


44
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.160
Owner's capital means that you
as an owner invest money


45
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.720
or that you take in joint owners
in the company.


46
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.680
Here, you also talk about
private venture capital,


47
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.440
which you can find among angel
investors, private-equity firms, etc.


48
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.080
The kinds of businesses that most
often qualify for owner's capital


49
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.880
are those with
a scalable business model


50
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.640
with international potential.
The advantage with owner's capital


51
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.920
is that the company
gets extra competency.


52
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.880
Competency and capital
all rolled into one person.


53
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.720
If you choose to go down this path,
you must be willing


54
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.640
to let go of some control
and let somebody else decide


55
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.000
the direction for the company.


56
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.800
Here are some alternatives when it
comes to owner's and venture capital.


57
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.920
It could be everything
from family and friends


58
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.880
to angel investors and
larger private-equity firms.


59
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.280
We're not quite done
with owner's capital yet,


60
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.720
we'll highlight some issues
that are important to consider


61
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.960
when bringing in new owners.


62
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.200
First and foremost,
choose new owners carefully.


63
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.320
It's not only a question of capital,


64
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.000
a new owner
will be your future partner.


65
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.440
You need to find a good combination
between competency and capital


66
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.520
that will help the business,


67
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.360
and you need to agree
on the goal with your ownership.


68
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.440
The next issue is valuation.


69
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.040
There are different ways
of valuating your company,


70
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.320
and it's a good idea
to bring in a financial advisor.


71
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.680
You need to find a value
for the company


72
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.920
that matches your and the
new owner's view of the company.


73
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.680
Think about your company's assets.


74
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.280
Are there assets aside from
the financial ones, like patents?


75
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.560
When negotiating with a new owner,


76
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.040
you need to motivate
and describe the company assets


77
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.400
used in your valuation.


78
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.800
The last issue is structure.


79
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.200
Structure is especially important
if you're several owners


80
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.560
so you can work towards
the same goal.


81
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.320
In a limited company,
there are some formalities


82
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.000
that make your common work easier.


83
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.600
Like company statutes and rules
of procedure for the board and CEO.


84
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.480
Phrase the statutes together,


85
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.840
so it is clear what the owners
want the company to work towards,


86
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and also the rules of procedure
for the board and CEO


87
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.360
to make sure that the board
works towards the owners' goals.


88
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.200
In the in-depth section you can find a
link to Fredrik Sjövall from HemCheck


89
00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.776
and how they view external capital.


90
00:05:08.404 --> 00:05:11.334
As an entrepreneur
it's easy to feel alone.


91
00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:14.191
You need help
when the company is growing.


92
00:05:14.504 --> 00:05:16.215
A coach or a mentor,
and later on a board


93
00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:23.263
could be a good way to bring in
external skills to the company.


94
00:05:23.832 --> 00:05:27.783
Having an external sounding board
can help you with many questions


95
00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.754
that you may have.


96
00:05:29.778 --> 00:05:31.730
When looking for external skills,


97
00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:34.531
you need to find people
who complement you


98
00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:37.701
and the people in the company.


99
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.087
It's easy to choose someone
who thinks like yourself.


100
00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:45.736
A board member, and advisory board,


101
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.100
a coach or a mentor doesn't have
to be a long-term commitment.


102
00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:54.531
For each phase in a business,
different skills are needed.


103
00:05:54.555 --> 00:05:57.411
You need to identify
the skills and networks


104
00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:02.042
that can help the company
in its current phase.


105
00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:06.819
A mentor works as a sounding board


106
00:06:06.843 --> 00:06:10.558
who can guide you forward
to make it easier for your company


107
00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:13.181
to develop and grow.


108
00:06:13.484 --> 00:06:18.091
A board member is personally
responsible for managing companies.


109
00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:21.730
Of course, there are other actors
and organizations


110
00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:26.518
that can help,
such as consultants, accounting


111
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:30.100
and auditing advisors,
and different public actors.


112
00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:33.370
Now it's time for you
to keep on working on your own.


113
00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:36.250
We've talked
about wanting and daring.


114
00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:41.011
Make a decision. Where do you want
your company to be in 3-5 years?


115
00:06:41.147 --> 00:06:42.947
Let your passion guide you.


116
00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:47.232
Set up clear and SMART goals
on how to get there.


117
00:06:47.441 --> 00:06:51.841
Keep your focus and build simple
systems and routines from the start.


118
00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:55.403
That'll give you a basis
for expanding your business.


119
00:06:55.473 --> 00:07:00.073
Make your staff involved and
motivated in the company's growth.


120
00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:02.485
Bring in experts on financing.


121
00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:04.832
There are different kinds of financing


122
00:07:04.904 --> 00:07:07.704
depending on what phase you are in


123
00:07:07.751 --> 00:07:10.681
and sometimes it can be difficult
to find the right one.


124
00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:14.330
Thank you for joining us.


125
00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:17.345
We hope to have given you
some inspiration and some new ideas


126
00:07:17.404 --> 00:07:19.604
on how to take the next step.


127
00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:23.196
One way could be to look
at our other lectures


128
00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:26.250
which you can find on the webpage.
Good luck!
