1
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.520
How did it go when you were excluded?

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.080
Then I went in there.
 And then there is a library ...

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.400
Straight to the left it is a library.

4
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.520
Inside, I sat and talked to the elder brothers.

5
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.680
You are 19 years old, and there are two men?

6
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.200
-Three.
 -Three men?

7
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.360
<b> <c.Cyan> This is the story </b> <b> <c.Cyan> about all the children who have been injured - </b>

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.640
<b> <c.Cyan> –A of the religion </b> <b> <c.Cyan> their parents chose for them. </b>

9
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.760
<b> <c.Cyan> those kids are everywhere. </b>

10
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.720
<b> <c.Cyan> They are raised in various religious </b> <b> <c.Cyan> context and they are many. </b>

11
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.640
<b> <c.Cyan> All children who grow up </b> <b> <c.Cyan> In Religious Home not bad - </b>

12
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.800
<b> <c.Cyan> - But now it is about </b> <b> <c.Cyan> about those who did. </b>

13
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.520
<b> <c.Cyan> Now we'll listen to them. </b>

14
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.040
<b> <c.Cyan> Very many of the people we talk to, </b> <b> <c.Cyan> regardless of community - </b>

15
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.240
<b> <c.Cyan> –Can tell about the threat of losing </b> <b> <c.Cyan> all about sin is too great. </b>

16
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.440
<b> <c.Cyan> When David, raised in Pentecost-</b> <b> <c.Cyan> movement, came out as gay-</b>

17
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.160
<b> <c.Cyan> - he was afraid </b> <b> <c.Cyan> to lose his family. </b>

18
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.240
I was afraid to end up in hell.
 I knew I was different.

19
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.120
When I was going out ... I came out for my mom when I was 14.

20
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.080
... I was very scared of not being accepted -

21
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.680
- And get "lectures" in this, and it would be talked about and changed.

22
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.040
I was afraid that she and Dad would break contact with me.

23
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.320
The fear of a child, not to have their parents, their fixed point ...

24
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.600
That it would be taken from one was very busy.

25
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.160
<b> <c.Cyan> But even if the fear was there </b> <b> <c.Cyan> during childhood - </b>

26
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.680
<b> <c.Cyan> - did not pay David his parents </b> <b> <c.Cyan> when he came out. </b>

27
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.720
<b> <c.Cyan> For many of the children I speak with </b> <b> <c.Cyan> gets worse. </b>

28
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.080
<b> <c.Cyan> when challenging </b> <b> <c.Cyan> the religious system - </b>

29
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.000
<b> <c.Cyan> - risers to lose </b> <b> <c.Cyan> their families and closest. </b>

30
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.240
<b> <c.Cyan> Leija, who during the teens understood </b> <b> <c.Cyan> that she was bisexual - </b>

31
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.520
<b> <c.Cyan> —in saw that she had to break </b> <b> <c.Cyan> with her religion. </b>

32
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.000
<b> <c.Cyan> This meant she lost everything, </b> <b> <c.Cyan> was subjected to threat - </b>

33
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.520
<b> <c.Cyan> –And now lives with protected identity </b> <b> <c.Cyan> without contact with his family. </b>

34
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.520
Both of my parents are very religious and active in the mosque.

35
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.680
For them it would be disaster -

36
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.200
- If it came out that I go against certain cornerstones in religion.

37
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.000
One of the most dangerous things available is when women in a Muslim context-

38
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.520
- Determines to leave Islam.
 It can be followed by threats and violence.

39
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.320
This is something I have received help and support with escaping.

40
00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.920
When you think about your parents' decision to raise you Muslim-

41
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.080
- How to look at it today?

42
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.800
I am obviously against my parents raising me Muslim.

43
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.280
I wished it was a more open upbringing.

44
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.320
It is very, that they are Muslims.

45
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.040
But in a democratic, secular society-

46
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.640
- So I think ...

47
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.560
... they could have given me the best conditions -

48
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.800
- To make your own decisions.

49
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.800
This Muslim upbringing that I received -

50
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.640
- had no room for unconditional love.
 All love was conditional.

51
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.760
As long as I was a good Muslim I deserved their love -

52
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.000
–What made everything so much more scary -

53
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.080
- When you went against your family and religion.

54
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.800
When I left Islam, I had to do it in the hidden -

55
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.560
- And reflect on every decision I made.

56
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.800
<b> <c.Cyan> In conversations with the young, it is </b> <b> <c.Cyan> a group that is particularly afraid of - </b>

57
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.560
<b> <c.Cyan> - To be excluded and lose </b> <b> <c.Cyan> Contact with their parents: </b>

58
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.400
<b> <c.Cyan> Those who have been children </b> <b> <c.Cyan> within Jehovah's Witnesses. </b>

59
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.520
<b> <c.Cyan> Like Jonnah </b> <b> <c.Cyan> they have grown up with the knowledge - </b>

60
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.920
<b> <c.Cyan> - that they lose their family </b> <b> <c.Cyan> if they leave religion. </b>

61
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.160
<b> <c.Cyan> For Jonnah </b> <b> <c.Cyan> the exclusion became a fact - </b>

62
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.720
<b> <c.Cyan> - When she began a relationship </b> <b> <c.Cyan> with a guy without getting married. </b>

63
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.800
<b> <c.Cyan> The family was then allowed to come </b> <b> <c.Cyan> to resign. </b>

64
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.920
Then they came home to me on Monday -

65
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.240
- And then it was my mom, my dad and my brother.

66
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.560
Dad didn't say very much, he was very quiet and calm.

67
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.480
Defense mechanism, I think.
 My brother didn't say anything either.

68
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.880
But then Dad said before they would go:

69
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.640
"You understand what this means?"
 - "Yes, I understand what that means."

70
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.320
- And you have no contact?
 -No, we do not have that.

71
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.040
It's a shame, actually.

72
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.640
An early morning it rings on the door and there is dad and mom - stands

73
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:14.200
- With a lactose -free princess cake and a pack of deep red roses.

74
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.280
Then I knew immediately that they would say hello then.

75
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.640
I cook coffee.
 We sit down.

76
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.920
I understand that they will go and never come back again.

77
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.000
So of course I get really sad and cry in my mother's arms.

78
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.840
"I'm not an evil man, mom."

79
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.480
She pats me on the head and says:

80
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.440
"I know you are not, but this is how it will be."

81
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.800
That's what is so awful.
 They are my parents -

82
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.400
- But most of all they are Jehovah's Witnesses.

83
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.360
I think they are in control of me more than they show.

84
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.200
They may check social media.

85
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:08.360
They have probably seen that I live with Oskar and have tattoos.

86
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.960
They probably think I live very dangerous.

87
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.400
- Are they worried about you, do you think?
 - Yes, I definitely think so.

88
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.600
Their picture is ... it is so complex to explain.

89
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.880
Now I am "out in the world" as they say -

90
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:35.280
- And is under Satan's grip in their opinion.

91
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.280
Mm.

92
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.080
It is such a strange feeling to explain.

93
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.320
<b> <c.Cyan> In Jehovah's Witnesses </b> <b> <c.Cyan> Information material is described - </b>

94
00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.200
<b> <c.Cyan> - how a person who is excluded </b> <b> <c.Cyan> should be treated.
 There stands: </b>

95
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.080
<b> <c.Cyan> In the case of one who does not remain </b> <b> <c.Cyan> in Christ's doctrine, we read: </b>

96
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.520
I know they miss me.

97
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.200
The first period was my parents who heard.

98
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:05.480
Me: "Obviously we're going to become a family again."
 So I replied quickly.

99
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.360
But every time I met them, I saw their gaze on me.

100
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:18.280
It is this look that looks at an immoral person.

101
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.360
And it's so damn offensive.

102
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.760
<b> <c.Cyan> Most young people we are talking to </b> <b> <c.Cyan> have left Jehovah's Witnesses. </b>

103
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.840
<b> <c.Cyan> The ones we come into contact with that yet </b> <b> <c.Cyan> have not left, dare not participate. </b>

104
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.960
<b> <c.Cyan> They are afraid of being revealed </b> <b> <c.Cyan> and thus excluded. </b>

105
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.840
<b> <c.Cyan> But then we get in touch with a girl </b> <b> <c.Cyan> who absolutely want to join. </b>

106
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.880
<b> <c.Cyan> She must be anonymous, but wants </b> <b> <c.Cyan> her story to reach the outside world. </b>

107
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.560
<b> <c.Cyan> We call her Selma.
 She </b> <b> <c.Cyan> is still an active witness - </b>

108
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.560
<b> <c.Cyan> –And only 15 years. </b>

109
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.000
My parents are divorced, so I live every other week.

110
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.920
My mother is a witness.

111
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:18.040
At her home, there are meetings, worship services and Bible reading.

112
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.880
At home with dad ... he is not with, and not his wife either-

113
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.320
- So there is nothing spiritual.

114
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.920
What is it like to move between two worlds?

115
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.840
That every other week is a witness and every two weeks not be?

116
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.560
It is probably quite strenuous for my mental health.

117
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.800
I have some anxiety: "Imagine if someone comes on me."

118
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.600
"Mom gets angry if she learns that I'm not at the meetings."

119
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:59.720
Now that we talk, you have to hide your identity.
 Why is it important?

120
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.240
If you leave, you are considered evil and that you are on Satan's side.

121
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:12.000
Then you are not good socializing and become completely frozen.

122
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.800
I wish I was not part of this religion -

123
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:24.560
- It's pretty ... It's a pretty big weight.
 /Crying in the voice/

124
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.480
It is tedious?

125
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.360
- But every two weeks you don't have to.
 -Yes.

126
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:43.680
Are you sorry for losing everyone in the congregation who is close to you?

127
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.160
Mm.

128
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.720
-It is difficult.
 - mm.

129
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:56.160
What do you think about in this religion ...

130
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.400
... end up in what you've ended up in?

131
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.880
That you can be excluded if you do not do as they say.

132
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.800
It is not at all fair.
 It is well illegal as well -

133
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.360
- To completely close out a person and remove everything from it?

134
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.480
It's pretty awful.

135
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.000
There are those who are stuck in exclusion for several years.

136
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.560
There are those who have killed themselves because they have been so lonely.

137
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:37.560
When your dad was excluded, did you become afraid of what would happen to him?

138
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.320
I probably didn't really know what was happening.
 I was pretty young.

139
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.480
I only knew that exclusion was a bad thing.

140
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.280
But it had never happened in our congregation.

141
00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:01.240
But it made me be ashamed of my last name and that ... /cries /

142
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:07.800
They made me feel bad because ... my dad was my dad and stuff.

143
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:17.760
I was ashamed of a witness walked past me while Dad stood next to me.

144
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:29.280
I was ashamed of my dad.
 That's something I regret very much.

145
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.200
If we again take Jehovah's Witnesses as an example ...

146
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.680
If you choose another religion -

147
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.480
- Another faith or to express yourself as an atheist etc ...

148
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.000
Firstly, you grow up with the idea that God will kill you on his doomsday -

149
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.720
- If you do not live up to the ideal.

150
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.960
And it is a death threat, it is violence.

151
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:20.680
It is mental violence that the children get with them from their upbringing.

152
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.800
In addition, they are threatened with -

153
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.600
– To lose contact with his family, friends and relatives -

154
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.560
- What is a social suicide.

155
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:43.400
It is clear that a child wants to be his parents of the team.

156
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.960
If the child feels that God will have to death it ...

157
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.960
The post -traumatic stress that comes with it prevents the child.

158
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.560
No man is free with a gun against his head.

159
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.760
<b> <c.Cyan> Today Vera-Linn is a socio-economist </b> <b> <c.Cyan> and expert on the situation for children-</b>

160
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.640
<b> <c.Cyan> - which grows up </b> <b> <c.Cyan> in dogmatic, religious environments. </b>

161
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.880
<b> <c.Cyan> But she has her own story. </b>

162
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.600
<b> <c.Cyan> and when we get to know each other a little </b> <b> <c.Cyan> better, that's one thing she wants to show. </b>

163
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.040
I've been smashed all week.

164
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.440
As soon as I have thought about this, I have thought: "This is not happening."

165
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:38.040
Even on the train here I thought, "It's not really."

166
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.520
- Does it feel okay?
 Do you want?
 -Yes absolutely.

167
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:48.960
It will feel good afterwards.
 It will feel "empowing".

168
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.520
But right now it feels a bit heavy.

169
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.920
Should you tell us about the car ride then?

170
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.960
One day when I drove home from work -

171
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.280
- So I did not drive home, but just kept driving.

172
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.200
I came out on this road and stopped at a nature reserve.

173
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.080
I didn't know why.

174
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:23.400
But then I realized that I was there to take my life.

175
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.000
Shit, here it is.
 Shit, here it is!

176
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.800
Damn, what sick.
 Now I recognize myself.
 This is where I parked.

177
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.800
<b> <c.Cyan> Vera-Linn himself grew up </b> <b> <c.Cyan> within Jehovah's Witnesses. </b>

178
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:46.240
<b> <c.Cyan> But there is an occasion, </b> <b> <c.Cyan> a place where everything changed. </b>

179
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:52.880
<b> <c.Cyan> It has been ten years since then, and </b> <b> <c.Cyan> she has never been back before. </b>

180
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.160
I was sitting in the car -

181
00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.240
- And just looked straight out.
 I just looked and ...

182
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.000
So I opened the glove compartment -

183
00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.400
- Put out the razor blades and thought, "Now I'm driving."

184
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.640
I have the scars on my arm, which I have tattooed over.

185
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.920
It's ten years ago, just over.

186
00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.680
You are still a member of Jehovah's Witnesses.

187
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:28.680
And you are baptized, so you know you can't leave.

188
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.560
What would have been the consequences if you had left?

189
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.960
Every now and then it would have been terrible.

190
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.680
I had nothing else at that point.

191
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:48.160
It would have been like going out in nothing.

192
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:57.800
When you are here and all this happens, what do you want away from?

193
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.480
I wasn't there.

194
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.560
I think it was.
 I felt, "I don't exist."

195
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.960
The person I am does not exist.
 I don't live, I'm dead.

196
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.360
If I'm already dead, why not go all the way?

197
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:26.360
Although I never thought the thought clean, I already knew it.

198
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.840
- What did you know?
 - That this was not for me.

199
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.600
Somewhere within me I knew it wasn't true -

200
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.920
- But I didn't dare to think so.

201
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.440
And when you realize that this is not just a pain in itself -

202
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:51.200
- Out, in addition, it is a very high mountain you have to climb ...

203
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.920
What does the mountain look like?

204
00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:02.720
You have to make a new life, new friends and a new meaning with your life.

205
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.360
You have to start over with all existential issues.

206
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.720
You are like an infant, you start again.

207
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:18.760
And all post -traumatic stress.
 You feel that you are not feeling so good.

208
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:25.000
And in that situation will it be easier for you to take your life?

209
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.880
That is what is so difficult to explain.
 At the moment I was just empty.

210
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:35.200
It didn't feel easier, it didn't feel harder, it felt nothing.

211
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.680
Nothing was for real.

212
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.400
Nothing felt like I was me, because I couldn't exist.

213
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:50.560
It was just a shell.
 And what does a shell matter?

214
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.920
What happened next?

215
00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:02.160
I sat looking out and thought, "Is there any reason?"

216
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.120
I thought and thought and thought, but didn't come up with anything.
 "No."

217
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.920
But then I came up with a reason - my siblings.

218
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.200
They were quite small then.
 I felt:

219
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.520
"If I do this, they will be trauma-tetted. They have not done anything."

220
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:29.200
For everyone else, I felt "whatever", but I couldn't do that to them.

221
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.240
But you first cut yourself.
 But you couldn't complete it?

222
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.600
No, because I understood what it would have for them.

223
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.880
What did you do?

224
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:52.200
It was a disappointment.
 I had thought of everything except them.

225
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.000
Then it was just to go into town and Sahlgrenska.

226
00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.480
So it was with it.

227
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.320
- Do you meet your siblings today?
 -Yes absolutely.

228
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.720
<b> <c.Cyan> Vera-Linn did not take her life </b> <b> <c.Cyan> when she was here ten years ago. </b>

229
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.080
<b> <c.Cyan> Instead, she climbed that mountain - </b>

230
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:24.600
<b> <c.Cyan> - left life as Jehovah's Witness </b> <b> <c.Cyan> and acquired a whole new life. </b>

231
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.040
How did it go when you were excluded?

232
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:49.280
Then I went in there.
 Then there is a library ...

233
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.280
Straight to the left it is a library.

234
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.360
Inside, I sat and talked to the elder brothers.

235
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.440
You are 19 years old, and there are two men?

236
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.720
Three.

237
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.800
Now in retrospect it is tough.
 Every now and then it wasn't.

238
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.240
It was tough, but you didn't think about it then as you think about it now.

239
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.320
There are many times I have sinned -

240
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.560
- And then I have confessed it several times and sat there with them.

241
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:31.200
So it was nothing strange.
 It is not until now afterwards that I ...

242
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.880
Although I was 19 years-

243
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:40.080
- So maybe it would have been a woman with at least.

244
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.400
What do you usually confess when you go to the elder brothers?

245
00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.640
It depends on who you are and what you have done.

246
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.280
For me it was often -

247
00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:00.760
- I might have been too intimate with a guy.

248
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:09.120
And that I had smoked, I once told the elder brothers.

249
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.120
But mainly that I had been intimate.

250
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:20.520
So you sit as a young girl talking about sex with older men?

251
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.720
- What are you thinking about it today?
 - Not to reduce it ...

252
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.840
... but for them it is so normal.
 It is their truth to do it.

253
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.160
But it should not go so.

254
00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:38.880
But they don't understand it.
 So I almost feel sorry for them.

255
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:45.120
How has it affected you to have been involved in these things?

256
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:51.840
Yes ... shame, I would say.
 Absolute shame.

257
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.600
Too often, it was also men that I have known all my life.

258
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.480
Not all, but some of them have seen me grow up.

259
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.920
You sit there and have the tail between your legs for being ashamed.

260
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.600
Not just for their sin, but also because it is someone you know well -

261
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.720
- And so you should tell you about this.
 And afterwards when one has confessed -

262
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:24.200
- And then goes to a meeting at the Kingdom Hall ...

263
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:30.880
You walk past each other, and I remember the feeling: "They know everything about me."

264
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.600
So shame.

265
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.880
What do you think when you see this?

266
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.240
Exclusion is a very painful experience.

267
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.080
I'm a little divided in my view of it.

268
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.240
It is a terribly difficult period for the individual.

269
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.200
You do not know what is true, what values to live by -

270
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.920
–And you don't have the positive from the congregation or family:

271
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.160
Social support, community and so on.

272
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.200
But in the long term you get more an opportunity -

273
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.520
- To shape your life as you want.

274
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.240
It can be long -term comfort for those who end up in that situation.

275
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.520
It's so fascinating -

276
00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:32.880
—That you value the collective, the religious congregation, higher-

277
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.840
- Every one values your own children or your partner.

278
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.600
It is in line with that reputation is so central to us as Art-

279
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.960
–At we even are prepared to give up a child -

280
00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.040
- To maintain the rumor in the collective.

281
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:59.440
It is of course a terrible experience for the child -

282
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.040
–Ee knowing that you are away priority -

283
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.560
- That the parents have chosen the religious community over one's self.

284
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.240
What would you like to say to your children -

285
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:28.080
- That has grown up within Jehovah's Witnesses because you were a witness?

286
00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:34.120
My love is neither less nor more than when I was a witness.

287
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.440
My mommy love has always been the same.

288
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.840
I hope they have a good life.
 But I also apologize.

289
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.120
- In what community did the children grow up?
 - In Pentecostal church.

290
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.720
It felt good.
 It was fun that they wanted to get involved.

291
00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:00.760
It is a good place to be, safe, with loving people.

292
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.360
