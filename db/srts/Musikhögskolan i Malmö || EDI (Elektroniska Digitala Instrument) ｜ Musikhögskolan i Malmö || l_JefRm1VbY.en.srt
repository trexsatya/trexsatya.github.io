1
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:31,894
It was so fun to hear you play! Thanks!

2
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:35,723
Now we have an EDI session on the music college's website. Yes.

3
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,700
The question is, many ask the question, what is Edi?

4
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,700
So I think we want to long it directly to the camera here.

5
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,700
Edi is then electronic digital instruments

6
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,103
And Berkley in Boston was the first to use it.

7
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:53,700
Before we talked here at the Music College about the computer as the main instrument

8
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,700
and we were many who thought it is a bit unfortunate

9
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Because the picture is that someone sits at a keyboard only.

10
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,700
But edi summarizes, one would not be able to say

11
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,700
that these are these three components, computer and software

12
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,062
Then there is the computer and everything we connect to it. YES!

13
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,700
What kind of software do you have?

14
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,700
I have used Ableton live as software

15
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,700
and then as midi controllers to control

16
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,700
What I have in Ableton so I have an Ableton Push 2,

17
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,700
A Novation Launchpad and a Midi cavity.

18
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,700
But then you also play on your Procussion Pad here?

19
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Yes exactly. And I do not control that no midi information with

20
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,700
but then i use the sounds found in the rampade

21
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Just as I use the sounds of a base.

22
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,700
And all the micks have you connected to your computer?

23
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,700
Yes exactly. I have a sound card that I have connected all the instruments into the computer.

24
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,700
When I look at Youtube and check people who are doing live looping

25
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Then it is not so common for it to say this is edi

26
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
And the concept is quite new.

27
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,700
But if I understand it correctly you have in your degree project

28
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Written about EDI.

29
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
Rumor has it that there are high schools

30
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
who have students who have edi as the main instrument

31
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
And have you discovered that too?

32
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Yes exactly. In our study we have asked informants in the immediate area

33
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,700
About the Music School at the upper secondary level.

34
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,700
This is certainly a difficult question to answer.

35
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,700
But you have been doing this entire semester.

36
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,700
Do you have any conclusions, something that you have come up with at work?

37
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Yes, but an interesting conclusion I think was

38
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,700
that all our informants thought edi made it easier

39
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,700
to authentic play some genres.

40
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,700
But it was not tied to those genre, but you could play many different ones.

41
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,700
So a very genre -wide instrument.

42
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Yes, but that's my view.

43
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,849
After all, we have had quite a few years Edi at the School of Music

44
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:16,998
And it was a student here who had EDI as the main instrument on the cultural school educational education

45
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:20,764
As I had in subject methodology and then I was an administrator in practice.

46
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:22,785
That's my experience too.

47
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:26,769
There were a lot of genres that can be played and very much creative.

48
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,700
That I am very fond of here when I see you music

49
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,700
is that you have so much acoustic along with digital.

50
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,700
It's something I want the future educators

51
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,700
who attend training here and have edi as the main instrument

52
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Must be the acoustic along with the digital.

53
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
And maybe as much dynamic as possible.

54
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm not so fond of Step Programming

55
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,296
where you just press; It should be that battle and so the second sixteenth on the third in the pace so

56
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:56,700
Without it, it should preferably be played as you do.

57
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
There is groovy and there is dynamic.

58
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
I am very, very happy we got to hear your session

59
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,700
And proud that it is on the website.

60
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Thanks! And now you graduate.

61
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Good luck with everything happens!

62
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Thanks!

63
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
Thanks so much! Thanks for us!
