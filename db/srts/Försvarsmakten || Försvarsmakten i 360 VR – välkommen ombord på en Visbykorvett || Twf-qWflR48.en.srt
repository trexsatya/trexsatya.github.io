00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:18,618
Welcome aboard a Visby Corvette. Up here from the dock is run the ship.

2
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,091
An officer navigates the ship and gives orders to a seaman about what course the vessel should hold.

3
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:33,397
In addition, there are lookouts that with binoculars look for things that are around the ship that can be dangerous.

4
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:37,257
The ship's manager is also often found here.

5
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,795
All of these work as a team and help to perform the ship for sure

6
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:46,686
-Os if it's sunshine, night or fog.

7
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:09,000
In the combat management center, information from Radar, Sonar and other sensors is presented.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,180
It is thus from here the battle is led.

9
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:17,290
The radar can see aircraft, robots and other vessels.

10
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,081
The sonar shows what is below the water surface, such as mines or submarines.

11
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:27,453
The telecommunications staff can also discover other things that broadcast radar.

12
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:33,693
Like all other work on board, it is a teamwork where everyone is helped.

13
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05.758
On board you live mostly in two- or four-man cabins.

14
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:11,664
When the ship is at sea, half the crew normally works while the other half rests.

15
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:17,770
Man works in six-hour guards, six hours of work followed by six hours-

16
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,409
-When you should eat, exercise, sleep, clean or do something else.

17
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:59.845
On weapons tires there are the sea -target robots. The ship may have up to eight robots on board at the same time.

18
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:08,254
Robot 15 is targeted, with a range of over 100 kilometers and is used against other vessels.

19
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,326
A RIB boat can also be found here, which in this case replaces four of the robots.

20
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:23,502
This can be used for the transport of staff or to save people from the water.

21
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:55,223
Here in the fair we eat and this is also where we watch TV or relax.

22
00:03:55,601 --> 00:04:01,373
When the ship is at sea, you eat every six hours divided into two different guards.

23
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06.411
The fairs also serve as a health care place at sea.

24
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,806
On board are two chefs who cook for the around 40 people in the crew.

25
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:50,289
At sea, they cook breakfast, lunch, dinner and night procurement.

26
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:28,227
In the engine room there are both diesel machines, if you want to run up to 15 knots-

27
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,432
-And gas turbines when you want to drive faster, just over 30 knots.

28
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:39.938
The vessel is powered by water heater that is quieter than ordinary propellers.

29
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:46,893
There are also generators that manufacture electricity, boilers that make hot water-

30
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:54,420
-And aggregate that manufactures drinking water from salt water and many other technical equipment.
