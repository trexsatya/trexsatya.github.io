1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03.040
Life at sea becomes very family friendly.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,480
You sit and work day in and day out.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09.840
You walk in a certain slopes.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,440
And all of a sudden there will be a submarine hunting situation

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,400
Where you have to switch really well.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,040
It drives me. It makes me want to act.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,920
It requires direct decisions of me as guard manager.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,880
Decisions that can have major consequences.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,400
I wouldn't want to be an officer in another country.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,480
I do this because I believe in

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,880
The democracy we have here.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,520
One can lie in the binge and reflect on

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,240
That this guard we did something for Sweden.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45.840
My name is Helena and I work as a second on HMS Ven.
