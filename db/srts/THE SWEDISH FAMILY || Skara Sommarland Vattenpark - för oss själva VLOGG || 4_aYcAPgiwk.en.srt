1
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:02,771
- It looks absolutely awful.
- Yes, it looks awful.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,939
It's like a toilet!

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,628
Hey, hey!

4
00:00:20,755 --> 00:00:25,693
We are standing outside
Skara Sommarland!

5
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,647
Yep!

6
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:31,866
- The time is 7:30 - in the evening.
- Yeah.

7
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,002
- The park is closed.
- Everyone has gone home.

8
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:40,007
We will get to have
the water park to ourselves!

9
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,637
Let's go!

10
00:00:42,423 --> 00:00:45,388
- Welcome!
- Thank you!

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,920
Look at all the bubbles!
So many bubbles!

12
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,606
Oh... look.

13
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:03,283
Laura, look at this!
You love soap bubbles!

14
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,082
Oh, she's trying to eat them.

15
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:12,789
That's not a very good idea, you stick with the rice cake.
But you can chase them.

16
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:29,757
Karl is with us. He's the park manager,
and he will be helping us tonight.

17
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:30,391
Yes.

18
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,695
I almost said "today", but it's "tonight".
It's so funny.

19
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,565
We have been here once before.
Do you remember when?

20
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:39,166
- Scary Sommarland.
- Scary Sommarland.

21
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:42,403
- Exactly. Then it was cold.
- Then it was cold.

22
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:45,072
- We have never been to the water land.
- No.

23
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:48,108
- Or do you say "water park"?
- Both names are fine.

24
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,721
Both names are fine.
We haven't been there. This will be so much fun!

25
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,813
Yes, it will be.

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,087
- We are overly excited about this.
- Yes.

27
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,300
Oh, wow.

28
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:09,433
- Here it is!
- Oh, wow! Oh, wow! Oh, wow!

29
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,335
- I mean, how nice with the evening sun?
- This is going to be great!

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,519
- Now it's time to switch cameras. Let's go!
- Let's go!

31
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:36,357
Alma, Harry, and I will start with Racer.
Here you go, a...

32
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:39,729
- A girl with a sweet tooth.
- Yeah!

33
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,829
Good. See you soon!

34
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:47,709
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,908
- Ready?
- Yes.

36
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,641
Ready, set, go!

37
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:09,022
Now I will ride Vortex.

38
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,192
It's kind of like a toilet.

39
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,178
Okay, here's the entrance.

40
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,643
Oh my God!

41
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,352
Jesus Christ!

42
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,444
Oh, wow!

43
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,369
Sorry, Laura!

44
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Oh, my!

45
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,301
It's fun!

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,227
Laura is eating some baby food... and making a mess.
Good thing she's wearing swimwear.

47
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,535
Harry is eating ice cream.
Isn't it a little cold?

48
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:45,877
Yeah.

49
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:49,340
- But good.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,051
Alma and Axel are riding Cobra.

51
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,415
Okay. Ready?

52
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:06,990
- Oh, the water is so cold. I wasn't prepared for that.
- Some are warm and some are cold.

53
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:09,009
- Okay!
- Let's go!

54
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,307
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

55
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:19,355
This is perfectly fine.

56
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:43,518
Oh, darn!

57
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:48,348
Cobra is the best one.
Want to ride it with me, mommy?

58
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,055
- I'd love to! Daddy looks a little...
- I was not ready for that.

59
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,728
I flew the drone over it and thought:
"That one looks scary."

60
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:03,197
Then, when I rode it, I didn't think it was the same one.
And I rode with my back first, like...

61
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,444
...and just disappeared.
It was so scary.

62
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,091
Oh, Laura!

63
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:17,344
Hi!
It's so good that you're eating, sweetie!

64
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:21,932
Oh... but that's good.
That's good.

65
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:26,620
One-year-olds,
they need to eat with their whole body.

66
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,623
- It's great today.
- Yes.

67
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:33,391
- In those clothes, I mean.
- Yes. It's perfect.

68
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:39,199
We have washed Laura.
She looks sunburnt, almost.

69
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,094
- Yeah!
- From the baby food.

70
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:49,736
Alma and Harry went to a pool to just splash around,
and we are on our way to...

71
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,246
- What's it called?
- Big Drop.

72
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:57,684
Oh, God.
The family has managed to talk me into...

73
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:01,454
No one else wants to ride it,
but we definitely want someone to ride it.

74
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,650
- It looks absolutely awful.
- Yes, it looks awful.

75
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,960
Here it is.

76
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,698
Axel is going to drop straight down
through the floor up there...

77
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:17,470
...go down this slide,
and through this hole.

78
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:24,011
It looks crazy, because it's open.
It's not, like, a capsule.

79
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,142
Oh, my...

80
00:07:52,284 --> 00:07:56,276
Oh, God.
Yes, I'm ready. Oh, my...

81
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,441
- How was it?
- Oh, God...

82
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,002
That was so unpleasant.

83
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:29,175
There was just so much water... everywhere.
I swallowed so much water.

84
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,765
But it's so quick. Two seconds!

85
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,483
- Only two seconds?
- Yes! They told me. A two-second ride.

86
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,066
- Oh, God.
- 60 km/h (37 mph).

87
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:43,857
It's the drop, when the trapdoor opens,
that's when you're, like...

88
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,828
- Yeah, you whizzed by us.
- Yeah.

89
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,798
- Here, you take Laura.
- Yes. Hi, sweetie.

90
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:56,756
She didn't understand what happened.
Daddy just flew by, screaming.

91
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:00,488
- She got a little worried, maybe.
- Yes, I think so.

92
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:04,344
And now daddy has a funny hairstyle.

93
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:20,065
- What are you two doing?
- We are playing!

94
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:31,350
- We'll take Laura to the Lagoon area. Do you guys want to come?
- Yes!

95
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:36,165
- It's up there. It's for the younger kids.
- Yes!

96
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,525
Oh! Look!

97
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:55,862
Was it scary?
Oh, she got a little scared.

98
00:09:55,929 --> 00:10:00,266
- A little scary.
- But it was pretty fun.

99
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,138
One more time.
Shall we ride it again?

100
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:10,937
- And those two, terrorists.
- Yeah. They can't refrain from terrorizing each other.

101
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,746
- They're in such a play mode.
- Are they?

102
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:19,329
- Oh, yes!
- Of course. Who isn't, in a place like this?

103
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:30,824
Are you okay?
This one was a little more fun.

104
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,109
This is "ForsfÃ¤rden".

105
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:35,000
Yabba dabba doo!

106
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:51,946
Look out!

107
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,615
- Was it fun?
- Yes!

108
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,034
Yabba dabba doo!

109
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,142
That was so much-

110
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,509
- Fun!
- ...fun!

111
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,680
- In unison! It was a blast.
- It really was.

112
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:32,164
- Look how beautiful... No, you can't see the light. 
- We can see the light.

113
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:39,286
It's pink and orange over there.
It's 10:30 in the evening, and we have energy.

114
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,127
Yes. Laura, too.

115
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:46,866
So, I thought I'd wing a Question of the Day
because we haven't prepared any. And that is...

116
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,935
"How do you guys prepare
to film a video like this?"

117
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:56,643
Because this is very late for our kids, especially for Laura.
So, how have we been preparing today?

118
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:01,514
We... Harry and I took a nap.

119
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,350
- They slept for...
- In the morning.

120
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:05,785
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

121
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,853
- 2 minutes.
- 2 hours.

122
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,092
- What?!
- 2 hours?

123
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:14,394
- Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
- God, I thought it was, like, 30 minutes.

124
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:21,001
No. And Laura slept for 2 hours in the morning,
and 1.5 hours quite late in the afternoon.

125
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,071
- So, we rest up...
- And we ate well.

126
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:31,311
- Exactly. We eat well.
- A great lunch. It's like when you get ready for a race.

127
00:13:31,496 --> 00:13:39,252
And we charge all the camera batteries, pack all the bags...
It's a whole process.

128
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,357
Mm. To be able to have as much fun as possible,
and film as well as possible.

129
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:49,529
What do you think of Skara Sommarland's water park?
0-5 points.

130
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,464
- 4.
- 4.

131
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,968
4.

132
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:57,511
- A strong 4, for this water park as well!
- Yes.

133
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:03,176
- I also think it was very good. Better than I thought it'd be.
- Yes. And the water was warm.

134
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:09,015
- So you didn't think it would be good?
- No, I didn't think it would be that good.

135
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,045
- But it was!
- Yes, it was!

136
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:16,622
Thank you for watching this video!

137
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:21,916
- Please leave a thumbs up, or down.
- Mostly thumbs up!

138
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:26,565
Comment, ask questions, and take care.
See you again soon!

139
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,368
Bye-bye!
