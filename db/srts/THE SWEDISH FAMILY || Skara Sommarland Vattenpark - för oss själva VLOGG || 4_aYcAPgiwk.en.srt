00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:02,771

 - Yes, it looks terrible.

Hello Hello!

We are outside Skara Summerland!

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,647
- Yeah!
 - Woho!

8
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:31,866
- It is half past eight - in the evening.
 - Yes.

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,002
- The park is closed.
 - Everyone has gone home.

10
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:40,007
- We should have the water land for ourselves!
 - Yeah!

11
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,637
- Come on, now we drive!
 - Yes!

12
00:00:42,423 --> 00:00:45,388
- Welcome in.
 - Thanks!

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,920
(Harry) What many bubbles!
 So many bubbles!

14
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,606
(Alma) Oh, look.

15
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:03,936
(Joanna) Laura, you have seen, huh!
 You love soap bubbles!

16
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,082
Oh, she is trying to eat them.

17
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:12,789
It's not such a good idea.
 Stick to the rice cake, you.
 But you can chase them.

18
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,095
- (Laura laughs) - (others laugh)

19
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:29,757
We have Karl with us.
 He is a park manager and will help us tonight.

20
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:30,391
Yes.

21
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,695
I was saying "today", but it's "tonight".
 It is so funny.

22
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,565
We have been here once before.
 Do you remember when?

23
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:39,166
- Scary Summerland.
 - Scary Summerland.

24
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:42,403
- Exactly.
 Then it was cold!
 - Then it was cold.

25
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:45,072
- We have never been to the water park.
 - No.

26
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:48,108
- Or do you say the "water park"?
 - The water park or the water land, which.

27
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,721
Whichever.
 We have not been there.
 This is going to be great fun.

28
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,980
Yes, it will be fun.

29
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,087

Wiiie-Hiiie!
 It's funny!

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,227
(Joanna) Laura eats some baby food ... and slab.
 Pretty good, in swimwear.

54
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,535
Harry eats ice cream.
 Isn't that a little cold?

55
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:45,877
Yes.

56
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:49,340
- But good.
 - Yes.

57
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,051
Alma and Axel go Cobra.

58
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:58,415
(Axel) okay.
 Are you ready?

59
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:05,791
- (shoulder) Oh, how cold the water was.
 I was not prepared for that.
 - No, some are warm and some are cold.

 Okay!

Oh, Fy F ...!

66
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:48,348
Cobra is the best.
 Do you want to drive it with me, mom?

67
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,055
- Yes please!
 Dad looks a little ... - I wasn't prepared for that.

68
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,728
I flew the drone over it and thought, "The one looks scary."

69
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:03,197
Then, when I went, I didn't think it was.
 And then I sat backwards and just ... (aaah!)

70
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,961
... and just disappeared.
 It was so scary, then.

71
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,091
Oh, Laura!

72
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:17,344
Hello!
 What good that you eat, your friend!

73
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:21,932
Oh ... but that's good.
 It is good.

74
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:26,620
So here it is with one -year -olds, they have to eat with the whole body.

75
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,623
- It's great, today.
 - Yes.

76
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:33,391
- So, in those clothes.
 - Yes.
 That's perfect.

77
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:39,199
We have washed by Laura, and she looks like tanned.

78
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,094
- Yes!
 - of baby food.

79
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:49,530
Alma and Harry went to a pool over here for just swimming, and we're on their way to ...

80
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:52,246
- What is it called?
 - Big Drop.

81
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:57,684
Yes, my God.
 The family has managed to persuade me ...

82
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:01,454
None of us want to do it, but we definitely want someone to do it.

83
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,650
- It looks absolutely terrible.
 - Yes, it looks terrible.

84
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,960
Here it is.

85
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,698
Axel will let go straight down through the floor up there ...

86
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:17,470
... and go down here, down through this hole.

87
00:07:18,445 --> 00:07:24,011

"How do you prepare for such a recording?"

 So, how have we prepared today?

No.
 And Laura slept 2 hours in the morning and 1.5 hours quite late in the afternoon.

 And we ate well.

 We eat well.
 - A great lunch.
 Important to upload, as before a race.
