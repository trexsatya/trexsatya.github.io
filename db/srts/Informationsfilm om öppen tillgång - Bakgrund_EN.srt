1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,200
The first scientific journal was published in 1665.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,800
Before that, research results spread mostly through personal communication-

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,520
-and handwritten material.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,400
To disseminate research results through scientific journals-

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
-Haves come to become an important part of the scientific system-

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,240
-And over the years, tens of thousands of scientific journals have been started.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,080
Until digitalisation needed publishers and printing companies-

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,440
-For everything for packaging and dissemination of the magazines.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,280
Researchers' need to spread and quality assure their results-

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,400
-eventually come to become a market.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,400
In the 1960s, large stock marketed publishers began to buy up less-

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,520
-And the market has increasingly become an oligopoly dominated by a few publishers.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,440
At the end of the 1990s, digitization began.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
Scientific publications are now mainly e-resources-

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,640
â€” As the reader has access to by being enrolled or employed-

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,840
-In a higher education institution that subscribes to these magazines.

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,600
The dominant system for publishing and available research-

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,600
-Is researchers send in their articles to publisher-

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,000
-As responsible for editing and publication in scientific journals.

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,920
Usually the publishers do not pay out any financial compensation-

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,680
-To either the article authors or the researchers who are responsible-

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,360
-For the scientific review, so -called peer review.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,600
The publishers have then sold access to the magazines-

24
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,560
-To libraries and higher education institutions through subscriptions.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,800
At the same time as the market has evolved into an oligopol-

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,080
-And the publication has been digitized, prices for subscriptions have increased.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,200
The profit margin can in some cases be as high as 40 %.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,120
This development has led to many universities no longer being adopted-

29
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,840
-To pay the high subscription fees.

30
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,080
The consequence of this is that researchers in different parts of the world-

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,040
-Not gain access to the information that they need-

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,000
-And that knowledge does not reach out into society.

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,480
It is with this background that the need for a new system-

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,680
-For publishing research results has emerged.
