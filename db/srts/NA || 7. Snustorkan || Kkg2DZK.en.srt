1
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.400
-Yeah, then we were lice panka again.
 -A-cash is coming soon.

2
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560
You only celebrate years once a year.

3
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.400
-Should it be fun, then?
 -What do you think?

4
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.280
-Have you bought something for me?
 -Do not try.

5
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.240
-How many packages will I get?
 -But dream, Leif Öhman.

6
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.400
I can get a clue, so I have something to hope for?

7
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.560
You have to wait like everyone else.
 You get the packages tomorrow when you turn years.

8
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.840
-WAVA and wait.
 I want now.
 -It I shit well.

9
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.840
Satan!
 I forgot to buy snuff.

10
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
Damn!

11
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.280
Emergency.

12
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.440
-What do you do with the savings money?
 -Needless mode ... Must buy snuff.

13
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
Is the log you bought in Wednesday ending?

14
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.080
Yes maybe.
 I get stressed for the birthday and sniff more.

15
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.480
I get to go down to the kiosk, Billy.

16
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.360
-NA, Leffe!
 -Hey.
 The situation?

17
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.560
Good!
 Friday and everything.
 Then you have to go home and snap a cold.
 What do you want?

18
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.480
-Ad a lice.
 -I am sad, it's over.

19
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.960
The whole shit is over, the whole Sörbyn.

20
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.120
The delivery did not come, so the closest place is Luleå.

21
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.120
-Do you have portion snus or anything, then?
 -The joint, I have nothing.

22
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.840
-See ya.
 Greeting Dad.
 -I do it.

23
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.200
The snuff is over in the whole damn municipality.
 We get to go to Luleå.

24
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.440
Luleå?
 But what the hell, it's 40 miles!

25
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.000
We have no choice right now.
 Abstinence begins to crawl on.

26
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.160
How the hell should we get down there without money and gasoline?

27
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.720
-Then maybe you can fix gasoline.
 -How?

28
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.360
My God ... I am celebrating years tomorrow and you just ask stupid things.

29
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.520
Use the skull!
 How the hell do we usually do?

30
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.800
-Yes Yes.
 -Thanks!
 Set up now, so we can go.

31
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.360
Fuck!

32
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.600
But what Satan in hell ...!

33
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.920
Damn!

34
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.120
Uh, damn!

35
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.520
-Hello!
 Servant, Tony.
 -What the hell do you want, Leif?

36
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.920
I ... thought to check if you happen to have a snuff.

37
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.840
No.
 And I still hadn't invited.

38
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.760
Listen, Tony, I've been thinking about a lot of things.

39
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.440
Yes that...

40
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.960
What kind of parabol do you have?
 How many channels do you have in the subscription?

41
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.120
Surely you are in control of?

42
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.320
You see the cord from my antenna to you.
 You have turned the signal.

43
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.120
So you have thought of that?
 Then we sorted it out.

44
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.880
-Where is there anything more?
 -No, just that.

45
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.440
-nice ... -Ha a good life!

46
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.800
Fy Satan, it was close to the eye.
 Now we go to Luleå!

47
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.960
-Abstinens!
 The heart barely manages to beat.
 -Breathe.
 You will soon get your snuff.

48
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.680
So it is when you start with this kind of poison.
 Like having a demon in the ass.

49
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.040
The c. sound engine chop

50
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.040
But what the hell?

51
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.120
What in he ...

52
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.320
-Come on now.
 No no no!
 Satan!
 -Damn...

53
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.520
Surely it was gasoline you hose?
 Blow on me!

54
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.200
-Gud damn!
 You hose diesel!
 -But chill down.

55
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.160
Well, chilla?
 Then I can fold the seat at the bottom and lie down to die.

56
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.360
That we have a snuff lack can we shit in. Do you have a piña colada you can borrow?

57
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.520
God, how nice I have it now!

58
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.240
-Yes Yes.
 Sorry, okay?
 -Curse!
 What are we going to do now?

59
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.480
They may have gasoline.
 We can go and ask.

60
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.000
Wait here, you.

61
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.400
C. sound shot

62
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.400
-Stay!
 -What the hell...?

63
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.600
But what the hell?

64
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.600
Jump in the car!
 Jump in, fast!

65
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.440
-Hurry hurry!
 -Stand, for hell!

66
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.680
Damn!

67
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.640
-What are you doing?!
 -Cok if the boy hid snuff in the car!

68
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.480
-You can't steal a car!
 -Check if he hid snuff!

69
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.600
My God, boy ... insanity it is.

70
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.440
Woooh!
 So yes.
 We have to put on a coal, so we can get to the kiosk.

71
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.640
-No ... open the door.
 -I just closed.

72
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.440
Please, come on.
 Open, please.

73
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.720
Oh thank you!
 Oh thank you!

74
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.600
-Do you buy a lot?
 -No, just a box of snuff.

75
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.720
Unfortunately, but it's over.

76
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.480
Are you kidding?
 You are pulling my leg!

77
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.480
You drive with me, Karljävel!
 You're lying!
 The whole community is against me.

78
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.000
-Do you also hold on?
 -Quiet...

79
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
-It's life and death!
 -I can't do anything.

80
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:49.200
-Aaahh!
 Stop it!
 -Hearru, Leif, take it easy.

81
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.840
I sold the last box to him who goes there.

82
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.320
But what the hell ... Leif, it's neighboring!

83
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.400
-I can't cope ... -Yes, we drive after.

84
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.920
-I can go myself!
 -Quiet.
 No, stop it.

85
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.320
Have it.

86
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.480
Unwind.
 He went to Sörbäcken.

87
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:21.000
Sure as hell it was the neighbor.
 Cursed fancies.
 I'll call him!

88
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.400
Of course he has blocked me.
 Perfect...!

89
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:37.160
Fy damn, I don't recognize the body.
 The organs are starting to beat.
 Go now!

90
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.000
Stay!
 Stay!

91
00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.720
-What the hell do you want?
 Away!
 -I have called the police.

92
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.480
-Check.
 -Who fuck is that?

93
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.080
-No fuck I know.
 -It's my epa.

94
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.920
-I have called the police.
 -We shit in that.

95
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.880
-Shoo!
 Away, boy!
 -No has broken the engine.

96
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.120
I don't have time with this.

97
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.000
Hell.

98
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.560
Tony?
 Tony?

99
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.880
Tony?

100
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.320
-Tone!
 -Hell...!

101
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.480
Take it easy!
 Calm down, breathe.
 Sorry, I explain.

102
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.320
Do it!
 I want to hear an explanation.

103
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.440
The snuff is over in the whole damn Norrbotten, and you bought the last box.

104
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.600
I am being rotten.
 Snuff deficiency ...

105
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.200
-Can, put off!
 Quiet!
 -In fucking idiot.

106
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.920
I sneaked in, because I know where the key is.
 You get SEK 200 for the snuff box.

107
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.520
-I can call the police.
 -2,000 bucks.

108
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:38.160
You get 2,000 when I get the unemployment insurance fund.
 I really need the snuff, Tony.

109
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.680
Do you know what we do?
 Here's how we do.

110
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.960
-2,000 bucks and the team.
 -Wo?
 No...

111
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.840
-Yes.
 -Okay.

112
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.320
-I will build a chicken farm there.
 -No, that's ...

113
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:03.240
-Do you want your snuff box or not?
 -Yes, yes.
 Taken.
 Wow, what a deal.

114
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.640
-Fy fuck, please.
 -The team is mine.

115
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.400
-Yes.
 -Okay?

116
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.000
As soon as you get it, you stick.
 So.
 Stick!
 Stick, I said.

117
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.160
Thank you God!

118
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.520
No no!

119
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.640
Faaan!
 No!

120
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.920
-What happened?
 Didn't you get it?
 -Nicotin -free snuff ...

121
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.080
I'm going to die.
 Nicotine -free snuff!
 It's over...

122
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.520
-It was he who took epan.
 -Leif Öhman, come here!

123
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.960
Never.
 No!

124
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.720
Let me go!
 No!
 No!

125
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.600
Write my will, Billy!
 You get everything!
 Write!

126
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.480
Wait!
 Wait!

127
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:28.240
You should not give gifts in advance, but this is an exception.

128
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:36.120
Actually, you are turning years tomorrow, but ... open.

129
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.200
You have to wait for that one.

130
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.720
God damn, Billy Öhman!

131
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.880
