1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06.440
Time to look ahead. We go through ideas for 2024 and talk autoliv-

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09.960
-Together with one of EFN's most popular guests.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,000
With me in the studio I have no less than Anders "roll" Rudolfsson. - Welcome.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,120
You are one of those who have been here most-

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,520
-And also very early in stock exchange's history.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,680
How will you remember EFN that is now suffering to its end?

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37.440
I am grateful that I have been able to participate in so many sections.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
It has been incredibly professional.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,800
All program managers have been good, read and it has always been just as nice.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54.040
A memory that has etched itself firm-

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,240
-We one summer when we drove different themes.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,400
I was there when we drove the 80s.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:09,520
We had to borrow clothes and ran a section on what it looked like in the summer of 1987-

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,080
-fore the crash. It remains for a long time. Great fun.

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,320
The clip is probably left in some archive. We'll see if we can dig it.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,440
-Yes, it's worth seeing. -Yes indeed.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,320
When they were recorded was about when I started here.

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,440
So I ran straight into a recording so I would talk to Charlotte.

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,000
It was probably the recording from the tulip crash. Where did I end up, I wondered.

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45.560
-Ny at work ... -Very funny episodes.

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:52,120
We will look a little at 2023, but mainly look into 2024.

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,800
You who are so close to the market, how has 2023 been?

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02.840
Very challenging. One knew that some interest rate hikes would come-

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05.880
-It was obvious. It started, but still-

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,200
-Where the first weeks in January pretty well. The courses were up.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,640
Then came the first interest rate hikes. And then they came in kind.

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,920
At each Fed and Riksbank meeting came increases. It surprised the market-

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,160
-It went so fast. Then we got a banking crisis suddenly.

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,000
Also in the spring when a number of regional banks in the United States went down.

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,080
The interest rate had run away and they had not been able to handle the deposit rate.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,440
Suddenly there was no capital left. One must write down their long bonds-

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,320
-And then no equity remained. To recover from it took a moment-

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,800
-And Fed handled it pretty quickly. Then AI suddenly appeared like a big thing.

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03.080
At least I was very surprised that it got so big so fast.

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08.440
From having spoken a little about it, to it being commercialized so fast-

36
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,120
-To so many and suddenly the biggest "innovation" then became the mobile phone-

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,280
-or Microsoft was invented.

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22.560
And then another hefty set came in October-

39
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,840
-and another war. I sum it all up with: Very challenging.

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,080
And what you also bring is that the "performance" and rise we had-

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,120
-As come from large companies. In the majority of all companies, not only in the US and Sweden-

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,960
-Outan throughout the world, the small companies do not have performed at all.

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,880
Rather, it has been minus in most places.

44
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,320
It leads into something you might test in 2024: Small companies.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00.920
Our picture shows that they are very pressed-

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04.080
-and that they followed the interest rate pretty well.

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:12,880
Yes. The left image shows the real interest rate in the United States, "10-Year Tips Rate".

48
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,120
It is inverted.

49
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,640
At the top is minus 1.5, ie minus 1.5 % tip interest.

50
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,480
At the bottom right of the table it was recently down to plus 2.5 %.

51
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,800
Obviously, "Small Cap" is very sensitive to how the real interest rate develops.

52
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38.560
So the correlation is very strong.

53
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45.560
Now we have seen the interest rate peak.

54
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,520
We can assume that. And one is already starting to praise a number of reductions-

55
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,840
-In the US and Europe in 2024.

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,920
And that's why we see the meter hook at the bottom.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06.600
The question is whether it should be up further or not. If we shift focus to the right image-

58
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,120
-Is it how the valuation has been over time in Small Cap and Big Cap.

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:20,640
This applies to Nordic shares. As we see, the P/e number does not differ much over time-

60
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,440
-Between large and small companies, forward-looking p/e ratios.

61
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,560
But the big companies have gone through this year without affecting the P/E century-

62
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,760
-But the little ones have seen a huge setting.

63
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,640
And we think the real interest rate will not come down anymore, but rather will back-

64
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,480
-And gets a little lower, the P/E figure should also be able to be picked up.

65
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,600
Then we see that there could be some p/e number's higher valuation on Small Cap.

66
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57.960
Interesting. Small Cap was almost down to the Coronabotten in valuation.

67
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,200
Yes, the corrections were very strong.

68
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07.640
Given what we have seen with so many quick interest rate hikes-

69
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,720
-Features many companies may be challenges for their business models. Many people need new money.

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,080
If you look into 2024, I think Small Cap will be very good.

71
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,040
It doesn't have to mean that all companies are going well, you have to be a little "picky".

72
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,120
"Stockpicker's Year" again next year. I think so.

73
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,680
But there are reasons to continue to be careful about which shares you pick in.

74
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,000
Could it be liquidity and flow driven?

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,880
Gets the funds outflows ... it feels more in small companies-

76
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,760
-When a fund steps out of 50 million-

77
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,640
-An when it happens in H&M, there is just a little ripple.

78
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,200
A strong point, it is absolutely so.

79
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,200
The outflows have been substantial from many small cap funds.

80
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,360
The further down the list you get in the "Market Cap", the lower the liquidity.

81
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,520
And then you also get large rashes on the courses.

82
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,080
And there is still a risk of buying shares in which there is not so much liquidity.

83
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,600
An advantage as a small private saver-

84
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,480
-That you can get into illicated shares in a different way.

85
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,120
-Yes, but you should also do the homework. -Yes, liquidity can die if you want to sell.

86
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,040
-Then the door is closed. -Yes.

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,400
We move on to individual shares. You have a list of the company-

88
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,360
-which expected to have good profit growth at ebit level 2024-

89
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,760
-and is a good distance from their "highs".

90
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,720
They are sorted by how far from their highs they are.

91
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:53,960
Just. You can find a lot of companies that are far from their previous highest levels-

92
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,760
-But the idea was to also show which ones could have a substantial profit growth in 2024.

93
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:07,160
Here are all kinds of companies. From cyclically to the right stable.

94
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:15,480
Companies within Medtech, building -related, many different types of companies.

95
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,120
Finding relevance between if you believe that EBIT growth will come in 2024-

96
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,040
-And the P/E figure is reasonable, it is important. You should also look at historical p/e ratios.

97
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,400
But the difference is very large, from Sectra who is traded continued-

98
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,000
-To 67 times p/e next year, down to Netel, which is traded to 3-4 times.

99
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,520
Here is the question what kind of risk you want to take, to believe in the estimates that exists ...

100
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,160
See it as a list where you can get ideas.

101
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,440
You can have different views. I myself have some strong perceptions.

102
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,000
We do not have surveillance on all corporate

103
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05.560
-But quite stable business models are in all companies in principle.

104
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:13,040
One or two bad quarters can be enough to go down so much.

105
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,920
Starting to look from this list-

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,960
-And sets up an index of all those companies, you should be able to get a good performance 2024.

107
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,200
Loomis you have talked about here before. See-digit p/e ratio for 2024.

108
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,200
Securitas is whispered that Christer Gardell may have bought. We'll see.

109
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,880
A reputation in town. Interesting.

110
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:47,280
Many stable companies are here that should reasonably be able to ha-

111
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,360
-Both 2024 and 2025 as a good year. Then the question-

112
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,120
-How serious a possible recession will be in 2024.

113
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Here, the same company is ranked according to how they have performed this year.

114
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07.640
At the far right we see "Total Return", including dividends.

115
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,040
If you want to give any advice, it may be interesting to start with those who have gone the worst this year.

116
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,000
Start by watching if they will be able to deliver something in line with the ebit growth-

117
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,960
-Or which the market is priceing to today? And what is the potential from today's level?

118
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,520
There are also different types of companies here.

119
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Everything with construction has been right plague-related-

120
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
-But building facts is an international company, for example.

121
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,000
Netel has been exposed in different ways.

122
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,960
The Q1 report was quite turbulent and led to the CEO having to go.

123
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,480
It has left its mark in that course.

124
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,360
Then we have Coor that I also talked about before. They have a stable business.

125
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,720
Similarly there: The market did not like the Q3 report at all.

126
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,320
They start a cost program. We'll see how fast they can come back.

127
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,960
But as I said, here it is up to everyone to try to find ...

128
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,440
You can have a preference for certain types of companies.

129
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,160
Fun. Here they have a candy bag to look in for next year.

130
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,640
-A Christmas gift. -Yes, that's fine. It came with the plot.

131
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,000
We go ahead and cave in a specific company: Autoliv.

132
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,040
Yes, it's a little bigger. One of the companies we think seems interesting for next year.

133
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44.560
In 2022 and as many as 2023 ABB has been a major net buyer of own stock-

134
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,920
-So called repurchases, "buybacks".

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,680
They continue with it, but not at the same level as before.

136
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,080
The company that now takes over the baton as a large repurchaser of its own stocks-

137
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,360
-As autoliv. We will soon get a graph on it.

138
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,760
It was for a three-year period during pandemin-

139
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,280
-When no cars were delivered at all.

140
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,160
There is a pent -up need for new cars.

141
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,480
Although there would be some good years-

142
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,120
-To you barely return to the historical trend.

143
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,040
Underlying is an organic growth for autoliv to take care of.

144
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,600
They have a very large market share.

145
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,280
Over 50 % on airbags in the world.

146
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,280
All new car models coming out-

147
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,240
-As you with and deliver on. At least every other car.

148
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,920
There is proper underlying growth.

149
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,080
This in combination with starting a repurchase program.

150
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,160
It is $ 1.5 billion to be repurchased-

151
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,920
-Forf for next year.

152
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,160
Here we talk about 10-12 % of the company being repurchased.

153
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,120
How often do you see that so much should be repurchased in a short time?

154
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,960
It is very rare, I would say.

155
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,960
One can have a repurchase program of 10 % of the stock market

156
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,800
-But it is often difficult to get hold of.

157
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,560
In this case, it is combined with killing the share.

158
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,320
It will be a very big kick.

159
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,920
Because you remove 15 %...

160
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,040
I don't remember all percentages. They have come a long way.

161
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,840
As you remove these shares, EPS also increases: en-

162
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39.560
-"Earnings per share", with the same number of shares as you remove.

163
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,880
We get profit growth that will be 10-15 % better from the repurchase.

164
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,600
The next table shows what the valuation looks like.

165
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,160
We have proper growth both on ebit-

166
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,000
-And profit per share that is over 30 %.

167
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09.400
If you look a little further down at P/E you end up under 10 times.

168
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,800
If you look at history, it has been almost double in valuation.

169
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:23,320
There is a buyer in the share throughout 2024.

170
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:31,400
It is not noticeable when you start with the repurchases.

171
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,480
As you saw in the table, it has been quite a bit for so far.

172
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,840
The big lift will come next year.

173
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41.560
Finally, there is a graph on the share.

174
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,160
It is very close to all time high.

175
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,680
It is only a matter of time before breaking through their old levels.

176
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,840
When you put new highs you see new highs again.

177
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,760
This is a share that you can buy and own in the next year-

178
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,160
-And both receive dividends and a good price reaction.

179
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,840
A terribly strong trend since the bottom 2022.

180
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,080
It has really followed this channel.

181
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,080
If you pull a line from the bottom 2022 and all the way up-

182
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,800
-To there is a trend channel that is interesting to look at.

183
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
It is really clear.

184
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,360
In the latest report, I saw that they were good at getting through price increases.

185
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:39,280
I think too ... Here's the fact that the market is a bit worried-

186
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,440
-That you will not get your margin.

187
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,640
They have guided that they will raise the margin a bit next year.

188
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,120
It will be a question at each quarterly report next year.

189
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,960
If you get through this and fall through the bottom ...

190
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,640
We shall see. It is up to the company to deliver.

191
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,520
I and we think they succeed.

192
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,480
Having such a large part of the market is usually a sign on-

193
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,200
-That the market is unable to do without the product.

194
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,760
Then it should be possible to get the margin a bit.

195
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,880
One can hope. But the automotive industry is stent.

196
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,120
Those who deliver to the car industry do not have margins at all ...

197
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Autoliv is now a 10-12 percent margin.

198
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27.560
If we look at Atlas Copco, Sandvik or Alfa Laval, it is double.

199
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,080
Being a subcontractor to the automotive industry is very challenging.

200
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,360
You should have respect for that. But airbags must have everyone.

201
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,520
Maybe you spend a little more money on it.

202
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,320
Mutter as a nut, but airbag you want to ...

203
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,080
That said, it is ... it will be exciting to see.

204
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,320
This is the first time you anyway ...

205
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,360
Given the underlying growth found on new models-

206
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02.560
-As is on the way, this feels very good.

207
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,760
Very fun. Thank you for that case and for coming here.

208
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,240
-Thank you for this time. -It's been very nice.

209
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,480
Thanks to you who have looked.

210
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,240
It was all in today's section.

211
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,640
We have some sections left, so hang with us all the way into the tile.

212
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,640
Take care. Bye!
