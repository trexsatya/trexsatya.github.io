00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,240
Jeeesus!

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,880
Now you got something on camera.
Did you see where i put it?

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
Hahaha!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,340
MotorNerd

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,040
Episode 59
One million KM (620.000 miles)

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,660
-Hey!
Hi.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,460
-Douglas.
Viktor.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,400
-How are you?
I'm fine.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,580
-You have something odd to show me, right?

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,600
Well, it's just a regular Subaru.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,400
-A regular Subaru?

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,580
-What is this?
It's a Subaru Outback from 1999.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,080
-Okey..

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,620
With a 2.5 liter petrol engine.

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,520
-It's look a bit rough.
Well, it's an old car.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,500
-What's special about it?

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,980
It has run more then 1 million km. (620.000 miles)

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,260
-WHAT!?
That's right.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,280
-ONE million km!?
Yepp.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,780
It's like new again.

21
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,720
The odometer starts over.

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,260
-For real, is the milage 1 million km?

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,180
Yes, and it has also been hit by a moose. (Elk)

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,460
-And crashed with a moose!

25
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,300
- I would just about to ask what is special
with this car and now i got the answer.

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,060
- I can see, the moose impact has to be here.

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,760
Exactly, the front and head slipped over
the bonnet and then on the roof.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,300
The moose bent the roof here.

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,260
I'll tried to bended back again to
make the best of the situation.

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,000
I also changed the windshield.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,120
-A new windshield and fixing the roof, 
was that the only problem?

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,740
Well, then the moose spun around and slid off the roof.

33
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,040
And hit the side of the car.

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,260
Both windows were broken.

35
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,920
And destroyed the C-pillar.

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,740
-How did you manage the accident?
Not a scratch.

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,615
Not even shattered glass hit me.

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,960
-Why do you buy a car with a mileage higher than 1 million km?

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
It's fun.

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,500
The mileage was not 1 million km when I bought it.

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,680
It had only run 940.000 km 
(580.000 miles) when I bought it.

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,660
Yes, ONLY 940.000 km...

43
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,300
Well, only...

44
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,820
It would been fun to drive it to 1 million km.

45
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,860
-How is it to own a really high mileage car?
What have gone wrong?

46
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,520
Well, I'll had to change the gearbox.

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,580
It run 980.000 km (600.000 miles)
until the gearbox died.

48
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,520
Besides that, it hasn't been much.
I have not changed the brakes on it yet.

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,260
I have only changed brake pads and 
regular oil service every 10.000 km.

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,940
-What was the mileage after the first owner?

51
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,160
He drove 940.000 km.

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,260
-How many years did he own it?
He owned it for 6 years..

53
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,560
-He must have lived in the car.
Yes, hahaha!

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,920
He imported caravans and commuted between Sweden and Germany.

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,345
-What's the yearly mileage?

56
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:03,900
150,000 km a year, I think. (90.000 miles)
No, he manage to drive 150,666 km every year...

57
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,600
Hahaha!

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,740
As you said he has proberly lived in the car.

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,560
-What's the status on the paint?

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,960
The clear coat is struggling.

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,940
-Rust?
It's a bit everywhere.

62
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,920
-It looks okay since it a very high mileage car.

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,760
The paint on the bonnet is a bit faded,
it have been repainted a couple of times.

64
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,580
We can have a look a another odd thing.

65
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,420
The fuel cap, it has been refueled quite a few times.

66
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,740
Every time you pull out the handle
then it drops petrol here.

67
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,040
The petrol eats up the paint so it gets like this.

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,340
Now you can store things down here.
-It's not a sheet metal left.

69
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,700
Overall, if you count on inflation, we have calculated...

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,240
...that the fuel cost for this car is 
about 1.5 million Swedish kroner. (135.000 EURO)

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,380
-Hahaha, for real? 
Yepp.

72
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,540
With this car there has been a lot of 
petrol flowed through the fuel hose.

73
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,840
-Here it says, 1 million km. (620.000 miles)

74
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,040
The previous owner reverse until he could feel 
the coupling head to know where the caravan was.

75
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,900
-Did he reverse until he hit the coupling head?
Yepp, and the he pulled on the caravan.

76
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,540
-This is also a bit innovative.
Especially, when it's mounted straight on.

77
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,700
It's simple.
-Yes, beautiful design...

78
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,180
-How does it look on the inside?
It's in good condition.

79
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,060
Rear seat is like new.

80
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,980
Have nobody used it?
No, almost none.

81
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,060
The previous owner has used the car himself.

82
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,940
And I haven't used the rear seat at all.

83
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,820
The interior are spotless.

84
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,380
The steering wheel have seen better days.
It is falling apart.

85
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,220
The driver was probably left-handed.

86
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,980
-The previous owner does not seem to have had 
any passenger either since the seat looks new.

87
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,800
Exactly, it is probably me who used the seat the most.

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,820
Here it says 999,999.
Yes, the odometer didn't turn back to 0.

89
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,660
I have driven another 10.000 km but 
now I had to count it manually on the trip meter.

90
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,960
Each time it has exceeded 10.000 km
then I have written a note on a piece of paper.

91
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,500
-Is there any documentation?

92
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,420
The glove box barely close since it's so full.

93
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,580
Here is a lot of paper work.
It's almost all MOT records.

94
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,540
All receipts and all maintenance that is done with the car.

95
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,460
The past few years the MOT inspection 
have gone well and it only have been minor problems.

96
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,000
However, the latest MOT inspection did not go so well.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,820
Rusty thresholds which is too
close to load-bearing construction.

98
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,880
Headlights are in bad conditions.

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,160
A lamp that was loose, fog lights that were broken.

100
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,980
Parking brake didn't work properly. 
Both springs in the front suspension is broken.

101
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,180
-What future plans do you have?

102
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,060
I'll donate the car to a friend
who have crashed his car.

103
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,340
He drives more or less around the world.
He has done so the latest 1.5 year.

104
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,580
Now this car becomes a good candidate to travel with instead.

105
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,220
Anyway, the car will be difficult to sell, hahaha!

106
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,640
It would be difficult to explain the mileage in an ad.

107
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,640
-Is it time to hand it over?
Yes it is.

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,580
The car will move to Holland.

109
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,640
-What must be done before you donate the car.
Replaced the timing belt and change a brake pipe.

110
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,900
After that he gets it.

111
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,260
I thought I saw him here somewhere..

112
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,500
-What a lovely project!
Yes.

113
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,300
We stand and are freezing to death.

114
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,360
It's January and he walks around with a hoodie.

115
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,180
-Let's see if it starts?

116
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,500
-It is Saturday so it may be a little tired.

117
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
No problem!

118
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,180
Next stop is Japan.

119
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,980
-How does it feel?
Sad but still very good at the same time.

120
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,020
It will be a crazy journey.
Something I never had time to do.

121
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,760
-A great story gets even better.

122
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,080
Yes that's true.
Now we will wait and see how it goes...

123
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,160
Motornörd = Engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

124
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,000
A playlist with all episodes with
English subtitles are created.

125
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,680
More episodes will be translated to 
English in the near future.

126
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,400
Thanks for watching!
