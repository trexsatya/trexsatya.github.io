00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,120
A medical abortion means that the abortion is done with medicines.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,240
It is important that you are sure of your decision because the first tablet can make

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,760
The fact that you start bleeding and in some cases can cause you to get miscarriage.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,280
First you have to come to a reception where you are examined and receive advice.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,160
Then you get a tablet that starts the abortion.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,880
You swallow the tablet with water and then you have to go home.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,520
You can get a little bleeding after you take the tablet.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,080
The next round of tablets you can take home or at the reception.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,720
You and the healthcare staff agree on this at your first visit.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,440
Insert the tablets into the vagina.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,640
You need to lie still for at least 15 minutes after you have brought up the tablets.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,960
You can feel bad and get a fever and chill, it is common and nothing is dangerous.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,720
You start bleeding two to four hours after taking the tablets,

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,920
But sometimes it can take longer.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Take the last tablets after three hours.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,800
You take the tablets whether you have started to bleed or not.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,720
Insert the tablets into the vagina.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,880
The tablets give you contractions in the uterus.

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,280
It feels like heavy men's cramps but how evil it varies,

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,720
And it can also vary how much you bleed, depending on how long you have been pregnant.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,760
The longer you have been pregnant, the more you bleed.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,240
You should have received painkillers from the reception that you can take if you need.

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,160
If you have not started bleeding after two days, contact the reception.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,920
After the abortion it is common to bleed for one to two weeks

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,280
But how long and how much you bleed varies.

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,880
If you are early in pregnancy, you will bring a pregnancy test home.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,760
The pregnancy test you do three to four weeks after the abortion.

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,160
You do the test to make sure you are not pregnant anymore.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,200
It is important that you start with contraceptives immediately after the abortion, if you are going to have sex.
