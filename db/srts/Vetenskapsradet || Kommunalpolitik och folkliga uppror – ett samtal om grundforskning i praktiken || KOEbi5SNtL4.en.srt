Hi Sten, it’s the Swedish Research Council.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,300
We’d like to come inside and chat a bit about your research.

[Local politics]

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,040
The interesting thing about local politics

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,340
is that it’s about people making 
their local authority their own.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,060
Where you start figuring out:

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,580
“OK, what shall we do about our society?”

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,980
We can’t wait for the government to do things

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,560
or for aid agencies to give us things.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,200
We must solve these problems.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,320
And that’s an important part.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,820
[Sten Hagberg does research into local politics]

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:59,040
In this way, I find it interesting to see how politics becomes real for everyday people.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,160
That is: healthcare, other care and schools. 
What we often talk about in Swedish election debates.

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,300
On the whole, it’s the same type of 
basic needs that citizens have

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,780
that are brought up in local politics.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,000
[But if politics isn’t delivering?]

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,800
There’s a long tradition of 
rising up against power.

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,160
When power goes too far.

21
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,380
In Burkina Faso in 2014,

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:31,500
the president wanted to manipulate the constitution 
and stay in power for life, more or less.

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,680
And then, the first ones to rise up and 
really take over, were the women.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,140
A group of between five and ten thousand women

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,460
went out demonstrating with spatulas and brooms.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,660
The “spatula uprising” or “la Marche des Spatules” 
it was called.

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,160
They went out, shouting “Dégage Blaise! Dégage!"

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,880
Or “Remove from power! Go away!”

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,580
And that’s what is so interesting.

30
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,560
That in this power, you often talk 
about the “angry young men”.

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,460
You often talk about these violent risings.

32
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,460
But in actual fact, we are seeing women’s ability to organise themselves – and of course also men

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,100
organising – in the determined organisational work.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,620
That is a key that we often ignore.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,520
[Are popular risings part of democracy?]

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
Popular risings are part of democratisation processes.

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,700
Or can be, we should perhaps say.

38
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,060
Therefore they also become a means; that when people 
see that they cannot have influence in any other way.

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,440
So it is very positive when people mobilise themselves.

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,520
In Burkina, as from this mobilisation, they have always avoided violence,

41
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,600
avoided attacking people

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,140
and those in power in this way.

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,800
And that is very important.

44
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,840
That means it’s civil disobedience. They are peaceful demonstrations.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,900
So they are definitely part of the democratic process.

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,920
[What is needed for local politics to be successful?]

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,020
One factor is very important with the local processes in Burkina Faso and other countries.

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,480
That is that people organise themselves.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,200
They organise themselves in civil society and in organisations, in political parties, and in various ways.

50
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,660
That is, they organise themselves to create change.

51
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,340
These organisations, they don’t primarily follow religious or ethnic lines.

52
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,520
Instead, they are organised around an issue, a problem.

53
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,800
And this might be a development organisation in the 
municipality, or something.

54
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:53,340
This is an important process, because you are not creating a “them” and an “us” in this type of organisation.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,160
And this, in turn, leads to something of a paradox.

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,120
Those rather dry-as-dust municipal council meetings that I think most of us associate with,

57
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,940
those sub-committees and boards and whatever that we think of when we hear the words

58
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,620
“local politics”. They are, after all, the very core of democracy.

59
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,880
This is where we create the opportunities to live together. They are where the decisions are made

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,880
that can lead to us improving our society.
