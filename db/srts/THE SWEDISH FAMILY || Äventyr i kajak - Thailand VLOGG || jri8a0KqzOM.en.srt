1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,740
We are going on an adventure!

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,280
- Yes!
- Yes!

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,880
I sounded so dorky...

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,140
Yes.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,240
- She is a little dorky...
- Yes.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,620
- ...but very, very good!
- I'm so lame.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,100
We have taken a two hour taxi ride from our hotel.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,660
Yes! And now we're taking a boat to Phang Nga Bay.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,280
Turn it around so they can see.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,980
We are waiting for them to call on us.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,640
Oh! Pink! They're calling on us right now.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,500
- That's great!
- Alma and Harry!

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,700
- But I want to buy a water...
- We'll get it on the way back!

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,400
They dropped us off to wait at this store.
We got these pink stickers.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,820
And now we're going on a boat
with others that also got these pink stickers.

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,140
We are a group of maybe 30 people
from different hotels.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,920
- None of them are Swedes.
- No.

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,920
At least not what we've noticed so far.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,400
- Mom, my suit is dry now.
- That's so nice!

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,360
Alma's swimming costume was still wet this morning.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,160
It's really hot.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,640
- Bye, bye!
- Hello!

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,980
No, thank you.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,300
Morning! Welcome.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,880
We are taking a bus to the boat.

27
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,060
- Are you excited?
- Yes, a bit!

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,740
We are going on a boat ride.
They are driving far out on this pier.

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Walk carefully.

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,340
Great!

31
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,400
- That is the boat we are taking.
- It looks so nice!

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,320
Daddy, look at all the...

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Yes, yes. Thank you!

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,200
Welcome, welcome!

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,920
- Morning! Welcome! Hello!
- Thank you. Good morning!

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,300
- Good morning!
- Hello!

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
- How many are you? Four people.
- Yes.

38
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,960
- Boy or girl? Girl?
- Boy.

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,440
Boy. Hello, boy!

40
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,900
- Boy with long hair.
- Yes, yes!

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
Well done, Harry!

42
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,580
This is so typically us.

43
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,980
We are going on a big excursion two days into our trip,
when we are still jetlagged.

44
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,220
We had a really strange night. Alma couldn't sleep,
so us three stayed up until like 3:30 AM.

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,220
Yes.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
The bus picked us up at 9 AM.
We were up at 7 AM.

47
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,020
But we are still excited!

48
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,700
- We are looking forward to seeing the Thai archipelago.
- Yes, we are not only going to be on this boat!

49
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,900
We are going kayaking.

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,940
Into caves.

51
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,200
- Do you want something to drink, sir?
- Yes, please.

52
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,120
Coca-Cola or Sprite?

53
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,200
Sprite, thank you.

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,560
Alma, one shouldn't point.

55
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,720
Say "thank you"?

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
(in Thai)
"Thank you".

57
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,520
(in Thai)
Thank you!

58
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,020
Yeah!

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,680
- And you, some drink?
- I'm fine, thank you.

60
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,280
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,060
- We have arrived at our first destination.
- Yes!

62
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,100
- It's an island called...
- Panak Island.

63
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,340
- We are taking a kayak to a beach and go for a swim.
- Yes.

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,720
It will be really nice, because as soon as we are not going fast and the wind stops blowing, it gets really hot!

65
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,400
Yes.

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,200
Oh shit, the island is so long!

67
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,580
- Hey you, should you be speaking like that?
- Well... crap means poop, and poop isn't a swear word!

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,660
I think it's a swear word. What do you think?

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,900
You can vote on it! Should Alma pay a fine?

70
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,300
That's what we do in our family.
If you swear you need to pay 1 SEK (0.1 USD).

71
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,980
- Answer Yes or No.
- Alma, give 1 SEK to me.

72
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,120
- I would prefer that you answer No.
- I'm taking 1 SEK from you now!

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,380
Let's go!

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
There is a cave up there! Should we check it out?

75
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,460
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay!

76
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
A small, small cave.

77
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,500
You could live here.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,100
- You could live in it...
- Mhm!

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,280
- ...but you wouldn't be able to close it.
- No.

80
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,600
It's not a cave that has a huge rock
in front of the opening.

81
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,400
No.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
Are you hungry?

83
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,460
- Yes!
- Yes!

84
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,160
It's time for lunch. Look, show them...
It looks delicious!

85
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,260
Come here, Alma and Harry.

86
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
- ...baby corn.
- Okay.

87
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,300
What are you two up to, being all cozy!

88
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,940
Harry wanted to share my towel.

89
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,140
- Do you like it?
- Mhm!

90
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,580
We are now by the James Bond island.

91
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,480
On this island they shot some of the scenes for the
James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun.

92
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,460
It's a big deal here in Thailand. Our...

93
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,020
Our guide has been going on and on about it, and...

94
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,160
He has been dancing around with guns and stuff!

95
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,920
Yes.

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,320
Anyway... This is what it looks like!

97
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,880
We have arrived at an island,
and we are getting in the canoes again.

98
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,240
You can ride the canoe into a cave.
I'm not sure if you can see...

99
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,340
- There are a lot of tourists here.
- Yes, there are.

100
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
- These are popular destinations for excursions.
- Yes.

101
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,060
Okay one, two, three. Sit down.

102
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,520
Thank you!

103
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,940
- Harry?
- Yes?

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
A guy is paddling for us!

105
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,140
I know.

106
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,920
- Where are you from?
- Sweden!

107
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,160
- What's your name?
- My name is Joanna, and this is Harry.

108
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
- My name is Tche.
- Tche.

109
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,840
- His name is Tche, Harry. Can you say that?
- Tche.

110
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,300
Hey, hey!

111
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,160
Hey!

112
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,200
We're getting spoiled!

113
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,980
This is very nice!

114
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,560
We are about to head into a cave called Bat Cave.
It has bats inside!

115
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,640
It will be dark in there...

116
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,660
Exciting!

117
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,880
- Will we be able to see the bats?
- I don't know.

118
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,060
- Can we see the bats?
- Yeah...

119
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,720
- Yeah.
- What?

120
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,200
Maybe.

121
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,480
- Lie down.
- Aha!

122
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,180
Harry, we need to lie down.

123
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,560
- Why?
- Because it's so narrow over there.

124
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,640
Okay, this feels...

125
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,020
Interesting.

126
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,640
How is it for you?

127
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,840
Interesting.

128
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,760
You have to lie down the entire time, Harry!

129
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,840
In here it smells like...

130
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,620
Fart.

131
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,960
It's so dark!

132
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,720
If you look up at the ceiling right now,
it's filled with bats.

133
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,500
I can't see anything?

134
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Look where the lights shine.

135
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,440
Very many.

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,440
- Can we sit up now?
- No! Not yet.

137
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,540
Now?

138
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,740
Okay...

139
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,880
Now.

140
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,440
I saw a bunch of bats.

141
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,060
- The bats were all over.
- It was crazy!

142
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,740
It was pitch black...

143
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,680
...and it smelled like farts.

144
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,440
Yes. I think they have pooped in the ocean.

145
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,200
Do you think the smell was from the bats poop?

146
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,760
Alma, Alma!

147
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,160
- Alma, did you see the bats?
- Yep.

148
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,880
I was a little scared. I thought that the bats
would wake up and start to fly around.

149
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,940
They were awake!

150
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,640
- No, they were sleeping.
- Don't scare me...

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,100
- What a day!
- What an amazing day!

152
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,940
- That was an amazing ending, Harry!
- Yes, it was so much fun to dance for a bit.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
Your dancing was so good, Harry!
Your flossing was amazing.

154
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:32,160
While Harry is eating his pineapple, I came to think of
a Question of the Day that is very fitting right now...

155
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,880
Melba Jansson asks:

156
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,440
"If you were a pineapple, who would you let eat you?"

157
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,140
- Nobody.
- Nobody, okay.

158
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,440
Someone who is kind could eat me.

159
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,100
A Prime Minister, or a king,
or someone who has influence...

160
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,000
...who then chooses to do something good.

161
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,280
Alma ran off with her friend.

162
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,560
We are going back to our hotel now,
and then we will just...pass out.

163
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,600
It's like 6 PM now?

164
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,780
In the next vlog we will show you our hotel,
and its water park!

165
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,740
That's right!

166
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,060
Thank you for watching this video!

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
...thumbs up, or down!

168
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,700
See you next time!

169
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,700
Bye, bye!
