00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,740
We're going on an adventure!

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,280
- Yes!
 - Yes!

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,880
What a stupid I sounded ...

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,140
Yes.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,240
- She's a bit goofy ... - Yes.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,620
- ... but very, very good!
 - I'm so ridiculous.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,100
We have taken a taxi, for two hours, from our hotel.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,660
Yeah!
 And now we go out to the Phang Nga Gulf and ... go some boat.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,280
Turn around, so they see.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,980
Right now we are waiting for them to call us up.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,640
Well!
 Pink!
 (pink) They call us up now.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,500
- Yes, what good!
 - Alma and Harry!

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,700
- But I want to buy a water ... - We'll take it on the way back!

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,400
They let go of us at a small shop, where we would like to wait.
 We got these pink stickers.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,820
And yes ... now we will go a boat with others who have got pink stickers.

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,600
- We are a bunch on, what can it be ... maybe 30 people.
 - Yes.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,360
From different hotels.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,920
- There are actually no Swedes.
 - No.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,920
... what we have noticed so far.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,400
- Mom, my suit has dried.
 - How nice!

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,360
Alma's swimming costume was a little wet this morning.

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,160
It is very hot.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,660
(in English) Hello then!

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,580
(in English) Hello!

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,980
(in English) No, please.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,300
(in English) Good morning!
 Welcome!

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,880
A small bus ride to the boat.

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,060
- Are you peppered?
 - Yes a little!

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,740
We're going to jump on a boat.
 Now we are far out on a pier.

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,900
Now you can go carefully.

32
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,340
Good!

33
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,400
- We will go this boat.
 - Oh, what a nice!

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,320
Dad, check out everyone ...

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
(in English) Yes.
 Thanks!

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,680
(English speech throughout the stage)

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,200
Welcome, welcome!

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,920
- Good morning!
 Welcome!
 Hello!
 - Thanks.
 Good morning!

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,300
- Good morning!
 - Hello!

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
- How many are you?
 Four people.
 - Yes.

41
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,960
- boy or girl?
 Girl?
 - Boy.

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,440
Boy.
 Hello, boy!

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,900
- Boy with long hair.
 - Yes Yes!

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
Good job, Harry!

45
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,580
This is really typically us.

46
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,980
We embark on a big excursion two days onto the trip, when we are still jet lagged.

47
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,220
We had a really strange night.
 Alma couldn't sleep, and we three were up to half past four.

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,220
Yes.

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
Nine we were picked up with the bus.
 We were up at seven.

50
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,020
But it will be very exciting anyway!

51
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,700
- Fun to see the Thai island world.
 - Yes, we should not just ride this big boat!

52
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,900
We are going to paddle kayak.

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,940
Into caves.

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,560
(in English) Do you want something to drink, sir?

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,340
(in English) Yes, please.

56
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,120
(in English) Coca-Cola or Sprite?

57
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,200
(in English) Sprite, please.

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,560
Alma, you must not point.

59
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,720
(in English) say please?

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
(in Thai) "Thanks".

61
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,520
(in Thai) Thanks!

62
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,020
Yeah!

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,520
(in English) and you, a little drink?

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,680
(in English) Thanks, that's good.

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,400
(in English) No thanks, that's good.

66
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,060
- We arrive at our first stop.
 - Yes!

67
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,100
- An island called ... - Panak Island.

68
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,340
- We will take a kayak into a beach and swim a little.
 - Yes.

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,880
It will be great, because as soon as we stop moving forward with the boat ...

70
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,720
... as soon as it stops fan, it gets very hot!

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,400
Yes.

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,200
The island is crap!

73
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,580
- HÃ¶rrudu, you say so?
 - Yes but ... shit means poop, and poop is not a swear word!

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,660
I think it's a swear word.
 What do you think?

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,900
You can vote!
 Should Alma get a fine?

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,300
That's how it is in our family.
 If you swear, you have to pay 1 kroner.

77
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,980
- Answer Yes or No.
 - Alma.
 Give 1 crown to me.

78
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,320
- Reply no no, answer no, no ... - now I'll take a crown of you!

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,380
Here we go!

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Up there there is a cave!
 Should we go check out?

81
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,460
- Yes, yes, yes.
 - Okay!

82
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
A small, small cave.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,500
Here you could live.

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,100
- You could live in it ... - mm!

85
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,280
- ... but you can't close around.
 - No.

86
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,440
- There is no such cave with a large stone in the way.
 - No.

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
Are you hungry?

88
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,460
- Yes!
 - Yes!

89
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,160
Now it's lunch.
 Check out, show ... it looks really mug!

90
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,260
Come, Alma and Harry.

91
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,540
(in English) ... carrot, corn cob.

92
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,420
Okay.

93
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,300
What do you do for something cozy?

94
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,940
Harry wanted to share a towel with me.

95
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,140
- Is it good?
 - MHM!

96
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,580
We are at the James Bond Island.

97
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,480
On this island, some scenes were recorded for the James Bond movie The Man With The Golden Gun.

98
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,460
It's a big deal here in Thailand.
 Our...

99
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:59,120
Our guide has been talking about this very much, and danced around with guns and stuff!

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,920
Yes.

101
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,320
But, yes ... so it looks, anyway!

102
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,880
We arrive at an island, and we will jump in the canoes again.

103
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,240
Then you can go canoe into a cave.
 I don't know if you look there ...

104
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,340
- There are a lot of tourists here.
 - Yes it is.

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
- These are popular excursion destinations.
 - Yes.

106
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,060
(in English) Okay one, two, three.
 Sit down.

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,520
(in English please!

108
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,940
- Harry?
 - Yes?

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
It's a guy who paddles for us now!

110
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,140
I know.

111
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,020
(in English) Excuse me, where are you from?

112
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,260
(in English) Sweden!

113
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,640
(in English) What's your name?

114
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,160
(in English) My name is Joanna, and this is Harry.

115
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,240
(in English) My name is Tche.

116
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,200
Tche.

117
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,840
- His name is Tche, Harry.
 Can you say it?
 - Tche.

118
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,300
Hello Hello!

119
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,160
Hello!

120
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,700
- So, how spoiled is this not?
 - This is very nice!

121
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,560
We are going into a cave now called Bat Cave.
 There are bats!

122
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,760
So it will be dark now ...

123
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,660
Exciting!

124
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,880
- Will you see the bats?
 - I do not know.

125
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,780
(in English) Can we see the bats?

126
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,060
(in English) Yes ...

127
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,940
(in English) okay.

128
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,940
What?

129
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,200
Perhaps.

130
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,840
(in English) lie down.

131
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,460
Well!
 Harry, we have to lie down now.

132
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,860
- Why?
 - Because it's so crowded there.

133
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,640
Okay, this feels ...

134
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,020
Interesting.

135
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,640
How does it feel to you?

136
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,840
Interesting.

137
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,760
You have to lie down all the time, Harry!

138
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,840
In here it smells ...

139
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,620
Fart.

140
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,960
Oh, how dark it is!

141
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,720
If you look up in the ceiling now it is full of bats.

142
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,500
I do not see anything?

143
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Check out where the lights are.

144
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,440
(in English) Very many.

145
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,440
- Can you sit up now?
 - No!
 Not yet.

146
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,540
Now?

147
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,740
(in English) okay ...

148
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,880
Now.

149
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,440
I saw lots of bats.

150
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,060
- It was full of bats.
 - It was completely crazy!

151
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,740
It was cold ...

152
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,680
... and it smelled of a bargain.

153
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,440
Yes.
 I think they have pooped in the sea.

154
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,420
Do you think it was the bat bay that smelled?

155
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,760
Alma, Alma!

156
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,160
- Alma, did you see the bats?
 - Yep.

157
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,880
I was a little scared.
 I thought the bats would wake up and fly around.

158
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,940
They were awake!

159
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,640
- No, they slept.
 - Don't scare me ...

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,100
- What day!
 - What a fantastic day!

161
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,940
- Fantastic ending I think, Harry!
 - Yes, it was so fun to dance a little.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,320
And what you danced well, Harry!
 You flossed fantastic there in the background.

163
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:32,160
Now that Harry eats pineapple, we will take a question of today, which I came up with ... fits very well.

164
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,880
Melba Jansson wonders:

165
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,440
"If you were a pineapple, who would be allowed to eat you then?"

166
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,120
- None.
 - No one, okay.

167
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,480
Some kind man would be allowed to eat me.

168
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,100
A prime minister, or a king, or someone who has influence ...

169
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,160
... and which then chooses to do something good.

170
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,280
Alma disappeared with her friend.

171
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,560
When we come ashore we will go to our hotel, and just ... cover.

172
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,600
I don't know ... Clock is kind of sex now?

173
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,780
In the next vlog we will show our hotel, and the water land that is there!
