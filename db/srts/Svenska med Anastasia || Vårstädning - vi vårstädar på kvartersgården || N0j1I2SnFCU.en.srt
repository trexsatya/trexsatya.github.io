00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:03,141
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:07,000
Spring is here!

3
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:13,115
It's time to clean.

4
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:17,264
You can clean spring, inside.

5
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:21,625
You can clean out.

6
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:27,993
We will clean the yard today.

7
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:31,937
at the neighborhood yard

8
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:35,289
all together

9
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:42,089
All neighbors on our street should clean.

10
00:00:42,888 --> 00:00:44,888
Come along!

11
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:51,705
This is our neighborhood farm.

12
00:00:56,553 --> 00:01:00,302
to do outdoors

13
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,943
to do indoors

14
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:11,463
We clean weeds.

15
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:23,830
The children also want to help.

16
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:27,099
The children help.

17
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:34,045
We pick rubbish.

18
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,132
We clean and clean.

19
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:09,000
I rake on the gravel plane.

20
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:14,830
I pick old leaves.

21
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:22,336
We cut the grass.

22
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:29,923
She cuts the grass.

23
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,179
She likes to help.

24
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:39,936
She has a bucket.

25
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:49,343
She throws the grass in the container.

26
00:02:56,797 --> 00:03:00,099
He has a saw.

27
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:03,464
He saws.

28
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:11,908
What is he doing?

29
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,320
They cut branches.

30
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:34,738
After work we grill.

31
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:38,554
We grill.

32
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:45,472
Now everything is fixed and clear.

33
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:49,164
It is fixed and clear in the yard.

34
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:52,865
Look how nice it has become!

35
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:58,689
Thanks for watching!

36
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:01,735
See you in the next movie!

37
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,158
Bye!
