Hi, my name is Lina Lundgren and I am project manager I-

2
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:22,000
-Heart failure readmission prediction harp-

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,467
-A project within the University's focus area Health Innovation.

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,133
In this project, we work with information -driven care.

5
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:32,133
That is a way to contribute to solutions that can help-

6
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:35,033
-Health care in its transformation.

7
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:38,000
Join us and I'll tell you more.

8
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:46,600
Heart failure affects about two percent of Sweden's population.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,567
Many patients are in hospitals several times for a short period of time.

10
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,433
In order for healthcare personnel to be able to take the right decision-

11
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:57,033
-How they take in a large amount of information.

12
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:01,767
With the help of AI tools, historical information can be compiled-

13
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:04,867
-And contribute to a risk assessment.

14
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,840
In the Harp project we investigate in the project team how we can develop-

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,520
-A such AI tool, how its output should be presented to user-

16
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:19,300
-And how it should be implemented to function in daily healthcare activities.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,100
The project is part of CAISR Health and is implemented together-

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,600
-With Cambio and Region Halland.
