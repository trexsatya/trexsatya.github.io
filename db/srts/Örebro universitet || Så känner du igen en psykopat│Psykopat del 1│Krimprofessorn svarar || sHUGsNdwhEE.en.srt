1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01.560
When you committed this murder.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02.940
How did you feel afterwards?

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04.940
Have you felt any debt and regret after that?

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,940
Have you cried after that?

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08.940
Have you cried in your life at all?

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,740
This is the series about crime.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,960
Where we seriously talk about crime.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,700
It is important that we give nuanced images of crime.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,380
Instead of what happens in your information flows every day.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,140
My name is Henrik Andershed and I am a professor of criminology

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,460
And psychology at Örebro University.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,580
I have been researching crimes for more than 20 years now.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,260
And I educate the criminologists of the future here at Örebro University.

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,220
This section will be about psychopathy.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52.940
And especially about the questions:

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,940
Who really is a psychopath?

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,360
How can we measure it?

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,360
How common is it?

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00.360
Is it in both men and women?

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,760
Is it really that your manager is a psychopath?

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,340
Psychopathy is a personality disorder.

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,120
A personality taken to its extreme.

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,260
When measuring and wanting to diagnose psychopathy

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,580
So you usually divide it into three, sometimes four, dimensions.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,160
The first dimension is the interpersonal.

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,440
The interpersonal.

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,520
Lying, manipulating, is grandiose and bloated.

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,440
To the narcissistic direction in relation to other people.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,760
The second is the emotional dimension.

30
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,020
Lack of empathy. Superficial emotional life.

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,020
Don't get nuanced sad.

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
If you get angry you get very angry.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,400
The lifesty dimension is about being very impulsive.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,440
Sensation seekers, voltage -seeking and irresponsible.

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02.040
In some definitions, you also take a fourth dimension.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,180
And that's actual crime.

37
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Youth crime and adult crime.

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,100
This means that if you use the four dimensions

39
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,560
So it means that you have to be a criminal to be a psychopath.

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
But there the sentences go apart a little.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,800
Some believe that you can be a psychopath without being a criminal.

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,060
Probably it is that a person who behaves cold

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,580
For example, the company manager who kicked lots of people.

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,280
That we observe a single psychopathic trait.

45
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,280
Or that we think this person fails in empathic ability.

46
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52.560
It is not necessarily psychopathy.

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,800
It can be psychopathy because part of psychopathy is empathy.

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06.840
But it is not possible to conclude that a person is a psychopath due to lack of empathy.

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:16,440
I think, especially in the media, you can be a little quick to diagnose psychopathy.

50
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
A little depending on how to measure psychopathy

51
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,660
So it is probably so that a qualified guess

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:31,120
Based on research is that 1-2 percent in the population has psychopathy.

53
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,400
When we go into a prison population and check people prosecuted for a crime

54
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,640
Then the figure, often in research, is a variation, somewhere between 15-30 percent.

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,420
There we see a difference with 1-2 percent outside the walls

56
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,100
And inside the walls we see a figure between 15-30 percent.

57
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,520
It says something about psychopathic personality.

58
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08.940
It is clearly over -represented among people who are prosecuted for crime.

59
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,300
One question that has been a scientist for a long time is:

60
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,840
Is psychopathy too in women?

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,860
The research that exists has focused a lot on men.

62
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:30,020
But over the past ten years, research on female psychopaths has intensified.

63
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
Should we look for the same thing in women?

64
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:45,900
When we measure the same things in women, we see that there is absolutely women as well.

65
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,940
But it is not as common.

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,320
We think there is about a woman of ten men

67
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,980
Among people who have psychopathy.

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05.320
Many people probably think that psychopaths are a fairly homogeneous group.

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,260
That is: if you have psychopathy, you look the same.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,820
However, there is a fairly large variety it seems.

71
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,540
Not everyone has as much lack of empathy or is equally impulsive.

72
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Not all parts probably do not cause a causal background.

73
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,440
Thus, the reason why psychopathy is developed also differs.

74
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:43,900
They have been talked about for quite a few years about two types of psychopaths.

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,740
It is called primary psychopathy and secondary psychopathy.

76
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,720
There are also other divisions in research.

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,600
But primary and secondary is starting to get more and more support in research.

78
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,460
Both groups have psychopathy.

79
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,140
But it depends on various reasons why they developed psychopathy.

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,900
The primary psychopath is the more classical psychopath we think of.

81
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,460
Very controlled, manipulative, exploitation.

82
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,660
Will often commit a lot of crime.

83
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,660
But not always.

84
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,300
It is a person who has both inheritance and the environment behind him.

85
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,680
One can imagine that such a person can develop psychopathy

86
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,440
Without growing up in a very exposed home environment.

87
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,280
About the secondary psychopath you think a little differently.

88
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,200
It is a more explosive and unstable group.

89
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,040
Not as controlled.

90
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,680
Probably co -morbidity with other mental illnesses.

91
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
A little more is the primary.

92
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,440
Here one thinks that the primary causal background is probably

93
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,720
socially conditioned than both inheritance and the environment and for the primary group.

94
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,360
Here we see that people have often been exposed early in the home.

95
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Or otherwise.

96
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,260
And have been grew up under fairly difficult and insecure conditions.

97
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,700
Then it is quite important to understand that the group of psychopaths is quite heterogeneous.

98
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,920
Because it affects how we want to treat them.

99
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,860
Probably we must treat primary and secondary psychopaths in different ways.

100
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,720
Measuring psychopathy is a pretty difficult thing.

101
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,760
These are people who actually lie and manipulate

102
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,820
And who may not be interested in revealing their problems to you.

103
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,120
So of course you have thought about how can do the best way.

104
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,540
For example, the question is not asked to a suspected psychopath:

105
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00.960
Do you think you are a warm -hearted person?

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05.600
It is a pretty naive question that probably all people answer yes.

107
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07.600
Although it may not be so.

108
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,600
What you try to do is interview the person and people in the surroundings.

109
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,540
And asks more concrete questions:

110
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,380
Has something serious happened in your life?

111
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,620
How did you feel?

112
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
When you committed this murder?

113
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,760
How did you feel afterwards?

114
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Have you felt any debt and regret after that?

115
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
Have you cried after that?

116
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Have you cried in your life at all?

117
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,240
What are you crying over?

118
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,140
Are there signs of impulsivity in human life?

119
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
We try to ask these concrete questions.

120
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,040
If you sit in jail and say you love your children.

121
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,580
Have you applied for a visitor's right for the children?

122
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Do you have any cone power at all with the children?

123
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
When you say you love your children.

124
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,680
So you try to access it more indirectly.

125
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,740
What is there in the behavior that indicates that empathy is intact?

126
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05.560
What is it in the behavior that says that you have self -control and are not very impulsive.

127
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,780
Or need for change or very sensational seeking.

128
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
You are constantly moving, etc.

129
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,080
So you try to measure it that way to the extent that you can.

130
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,380
When we have a person at an institution, we can read the act.

131
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,380
And there we can have quite a lot of information about crime history.

132
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,680
So then we read into the act and then we do an interview.

133
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,120
Because then we know things about the person and can compare with the act.

134
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,700
There is a well -known checklist called Psychopathicheck list, PCL.

135
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,780
It is used on institutionalized groups, such as forensic psychiatry and criminal justice.

136
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,420
Then when you want to measure among the normal population, it becomes a little trixier.

137
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
Because then you have no act you can compare with.

138
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
Then you have to ask the people to answer a questionnaire.

139
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00.440
In, for example, in the YPI instrument that is for young people

140
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,820
To see how early you can see psychopathy develop.

141
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Then you ask questions about psychopathic traits

142
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,220
As if they were strong abilities.

143
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,360
I have the ability not to feel guilt and regret when I have done something that is not good.

144
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,180
For that, we see that people who have psychopathic laying can agree.

145
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,900
While other people think it is quite strange to express as an ability.

146
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,120
There are a number of different instruments for measuring psychopathy

147
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
which is also based on slightly different definitions.

148
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Which can be perceived as a little messy.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:44,600
Depending on purpose and where you are somewhere, you may need to use different types of instruments.

150
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,760
Yes, is your partner psychopath really?

151
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
How likely is that?

152
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,900
If we only look at the statistics, we believe that 1-2 percent are psychopaths.

153
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,220
Probably the person can show traits that are psychopathic.

154
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,420
Maybe fails in empathy, but not grandiose, lying or impulsive.

155
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,100
However, if the person is impulsive, needs change, deficiencies in empathy and superficial emotional life.

156
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
And is lying and manipulative.

157
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,680
Now we are starting to see a psychopathic syndrome.

158
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,980
And we should probably suspect psychopathy if you see those personality traits.

159
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,580
And it has major negative consequences.

160
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,240
You violate rules, are violent and threatening.

161
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,080
Commits some form of financial crime or whatever it may be.

162
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,500
Now, of course, the suspicion is increased.

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,400
Because this can be about a person with psychopathy.

164
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,980
I have made psychopathicheck list assessments in the Prison and Probation Service.

165
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55.560
There I have met quite a few people who have reached criteria for psychopathy.

166
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00.320
In the beginning you are struck by the fact that these people actually exist.

167
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Not just in the media and in Hollywood.

168
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
For example, when I interviewed a person.

169
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,080
And I know that person did not leave elementary school.

170
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,000
I know that by seeing the act and talking to staff.

171
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,640
Now I ask the person about educational background.

172
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,480
And the person says with the greatest self -confidence

173
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,960
that you have a degree in law.

174
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,980
I think it was from Uppsala University.

175
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,920
But the person didn't have that.

176
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
And I'm starting to confront.

177
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,740
And the technology is to wait for the confrontation until the end of the interview.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,180
When I start to be satisfied with the information collection.

179
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,400
But the person does not become very broken when I confront.

180
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,100
Without maintaining it and eventually becomes a little annoyed.

181
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
What is it that you do not understand?

182
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,020
I have that degree.

183
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,600
There is no indication that the person has such a degree.

184
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,720
It strikes how individuals can be so cheeky, lying and manipulative.

185
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,440
They have trained on this all their lives.

186
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,580
It has been effective for their entire lives.

187
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,000
We ordinary fellow human beings do not expect people to do this to others.

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,480
And those with this layout notice that it is very efficient to get to this way.

189
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
If I lie, I get what I want.

190
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,260
Then maybe I never have to meet that person again.

191
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,740
It becomes a functional and effective way to get ahead.

192
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
Which is not so good.

193
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,180
Thank you for being with us today.

194
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44.560
Like if you think what we do is good.

195
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Feel free to comment.

196
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,220
And don't forget to subscribe, of course.

197
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,380
I have been researching crimes for more than 20 years now.

198
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,500
And I educate the criminologists of the future here at Örebro University.

199
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01.060
I also train professional police officers and officials

200
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,940
Out in the municipalities that have the task of creating security and security in your particular municipality.

201
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,280
I think it's important for all citizens to meet a more nuanced picture

202
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,280
Otherwise, we may be unnecessary to suffer from crime.

203
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,700
We may lose confidence in the legal system.

204
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,960
Due to the distorted reporting of crime.

205
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,680
Have you thought that you have a role in preventing crime?

206
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,220
You can have a role. I can have a role.

207
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32.560
It is not just the police who have that role.

208
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,860
Together we can create a safer society.

209
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,620
This series is about it.
