00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,168
Hey!
 My name is Björn Runow.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,240
I am a trained civil engineer in industrial economics and-

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,360
-Just now I read an education called "Complementary Educational Education".

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,600
And it is an education for those who have read a lot-

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,736
-In any subject at the university and then want to start working before school.

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,552
Within, for example, high school or high school.

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,400
And in my case then it's math.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,000
I am from Södertälje, I am 27 years old and I like to hold on-

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,480
-Mathematics and teaching.

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,069
And in this talk, the idea is that I first and foremost will-

11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,520
-Satting on some activities that I have done during my time at college,

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,240
Who has made me realize that it is as a mathematics teacher just I want to work.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,568
And then I'll tell you about some examples from min-

14
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,384
-The study time, in which I used math for loose,

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,400
In my opinion, pretty cool problems.

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,160
Then I will also tell you about a few different tracks at the college,

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,552
which one as a mathematics enthusiast can read.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Okay.

19
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,112
We start here with-

20
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
-Some activities I've done.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,600
I started at college after taking a four -year break

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,320
And the first thing I was struck by it was that I really was-

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,160
-Is imposed on how good and talented math teachers there were here.

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,400
MAI, the Mathematical Department at Linköping University,

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,800
They are really awesome!

26
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,152
At the beginning of my education, I felt that I was stimulated in terms of mathematics.

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,992
However, I have always liked to keep up with math help and-

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,064
-After a while I found an association called Mattehjelpen.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
And it is a student association where purpose is-

30
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,396
-To helping students to manage math better.

31
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:36,256
And it was done mainly by arranging math cabins once a week,

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:40,400
And by holding rehearsal lectures for Mattetentor.

33
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,829
And this was something I involved in,

34
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:44,192
And I thought it was great fun.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,675
And something that I have always wrestled with-

36
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:49,568
-In time I have been doing math teaching-

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
-This is that I want to make things as effective as possible.

38
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,299
While between high school and college-

39
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,760
-W so I kept up with a part with private education.

40
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
And I always thought it was a bit ineffective.

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,987
Two hours of my invested time became two hours of help for someone else-

42
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:05,696
-So there was no scalability on the whole.

43
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,935
Through my commitment to math hero-

44
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:11,560
-I now got help to help lots more.
 And I thought that was fucking fun.

45
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,912
Then, after reading about a year at the college-

46
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,264
So, however, I decided that I want to do that is even more effective.

47
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
I was inspired by Khan Academy, for example-

48
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,760
And decided that: I will create a Youtube channel.

49
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,360
So I locked myself in my corridor room one summer,

50
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:31,800
And then I produced material for grade 7 up to mathematics 4.

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,000
And then at the end of the summer I published it here-

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,160
-On a channel called Mattebjörn.

53
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,428
This was received well and I thought it was great fun to hold on-

54
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,280
-So since then I've just continued with it.

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,400
And today I now have the most mat that you go through-

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,440
-From grade 7 up to linear algebra at university level.

57
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
And there, including-

58
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,640
-So a playlist for the college test mat.

59
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:56,360
Like you who are looking at this may benefit from.

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,314
Right now this channel has about 7000 subscribers,

61
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:01,263
And soon one and a half million views.

62
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:04,000
And my plan is to continue expanding the content of this-

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,280
-So that in the future I cover most of what you can read in math.

64
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,800
But, why should you read mathematics then?

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,600
Something I have turned off during my time at the civil engineering program-

66
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,656
-where I have studied a variety of areas,

67
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,472
It is how incredible math is actually used.

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
For example, I have studied economy,

69
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,324
And we have learned how to financially analyze different business-

70
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:28,128
And its potential.

71
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,960
I studied mechanics to understand how forces affect our physical world.

72
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,840
I have studied statistics to understand how to predict future events,

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
And how to count on chance.

74
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,956
I have studied optimization to get a better understanding of how man-

75
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,680
-Can make things as effective as possible.

76
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,956
I have also looked at game theory to see how one can foresee-

77
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:52,960
-What different actors will make given different conditions.

78
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,000
And since then I have also learned a great deal about control technology-

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,280
-which in many and much is about trying to get things self-driving-

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
-or autonomous.

81
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
And that said, what I think is so awesome with math-

82
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
-This is that it is the language used to describe-

83
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
-All these different applications.

84
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,880
Something that I also think is awesome it is that no matter where one is in the world-

85
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:15,232
-So this language in principle looks the same.

86
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,520
And if you have learned the math for mechanics here in Sweden-

87
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,800
-So you can apply it when you are away in Brazil or in China-

88
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,911
-or wherever you are.

89
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,760
In addition, if you also connect that you also use a little programming-

90
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,161
-In combination with math-

91
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:30,335
-Then I can also do a lot of cool stuff.

92
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,200
And I was going to tell you now about a couple of different examples-

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,943
-To stuff that I have done during my study time-

94
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
-What at least I think are a bit small.

95
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
So.

96
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,280
The first thing.

97
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,200
It has to do with our bachelor's project,

98
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,000
As I did on the I-line, or the industrial economy line.

99
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,840
And I did it in system technology and the assignment was to-

100
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,680
-Take a radio controlled car and turn it into a self -driving highway robot.

101
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,200
And then we would equip it with sensors and make it be able to-

102
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,826
-Take exits.

103
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:01,567
Run on paces.

104
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
Able to go an optimized route.

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,175
It could keep the distance to a vehicle present.

106
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,600
Such things that one should typically be able to do on a highway.

107
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,000
And here you can see an example of how it went then.

108
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,400
So now the car will take an exit here.

109
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,800
And this is our self -carved course that we have built.

110
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Now it will drive on the highway again.

111
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
And then it will take a lap.

112
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,800
And then when it comes to this black line it will now stop.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And this was the first time we succeeded in this,

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
And it was damn fun.

115
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,680
But, how did this work then?

116
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,855
Well, this robot was equipped with a camera that constantly looked-

117
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
-Rakt down the road in front of him.

118
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,720
And if we for the moment ignore these blue lines-

119
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,040
-The we see exactly what the robot constantly analyzed in the picture.

120
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,800
Based on the picture that the robot sees here we use the edge detection-

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,215
-What can be seen as a mix of mathematics and programming.

122
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,760
And then you get the picture in the upper left, this black and white.

123
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,437
Based on it so we can then use-

124
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:09,680
-The time a little more math and image processing,

125
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,360
To get the picture you see at the bottom left-

126
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,520
-As found interesting lines in the black and white image.

127
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,120
Then, based on that picture with red lines-

128
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,360
-So we can get a kind of average route on the lines-

129
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,880
-As the left in the original image and lines that go right in the original image.

130
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,680
And with all of them we can figure out these two angles-

131
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,000
-When of using some trigonometry.

132
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,360
And what is the key here is that if the car is directed straight

133
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,440
-So V1 and V2 will be the same size, or about the same size.

134
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,520
And would be such that the car is directed oblique-

135
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,400
-Then one of them will be much bigger.

136
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,160
So by then regulating our control rash outside-

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,120
-What the difference is between v1 and v2,

138
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,560
So we can ensure that the car is always heading straight ahead.

139
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,400
I thought this with math and image processing was very fun-

140
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
-So I decided to take a master within it.

141
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,720
And i was just going to tell you a little shortly over-

142
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,799
-This I did in my degree project as well.

143
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,600
As you can see the introduction here.

144
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,000
It had to do with point detection.

145
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,503
So finding interesting points in pictures.

146
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
And what you see here, it's a picture of an EU pallet.

147
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,040
And here you can imagine, for example, an autonomous forklift-

148
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,120
-You want to go away and pick it up.

149
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,791
And then it must know what points it should aim with its forks.

150
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,520
And it had then been-

151
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,320
-The two points.

152
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,920
And the key here, or what one wants to then-

153
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,440
-This is to create a model that automatically based on the contents of the image-

154
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,320
-Can find and dot out what points you want to find.

155
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
What I was going to talk in a little more detail about here now,

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,271
It is an application from the food industry.

157
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,080
When they are going to package festis cartons for example-

158
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,927
-The they have to put the straw out in the right place on the carton.

159
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,680
And if you don't, so the straw ends up outside,

160
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,600
Then there is a risk that the latter in the process will fall off.

161
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,041
And here it is also interesting to detect points-

162
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:12,840
-To that it is a cost-effective way to determine om-

163
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,847
-The tube is in the right place or not.

164
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
Because we can only find these start-, bend and final points,

165
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,040
And compare their position with the points that mark the corners of the carton.

166
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,520
Because they are relatively easy to develop.

167
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
And-

168
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,760
-How does this work then and how is it linked to mathematics?

169
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Yes.

170
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
What I used here, it was a so -called deep neural network.

171
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,935
And I then processed a color image in mass, lots of different layers-

172
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,360
-To finally release what you see here.

173
00:08:43,365 --> 00:08:45,160
One, what one might call,

174
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,383
attention map, which indicates where it is likely-

175
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,120
-That there is a point of interest.

176
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,000
And it is then like a white area.

177
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,000
And in this case, the picture is,

178
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,720
This color image we are looking at,

179
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,367
It is a picture from a mall with lots of people in itself.

180
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,695
These little white areas in the black image-

181
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,320
-There are indications of where these people's heads are.

182
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,960
That was what was of interest.

183
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,679
And a little short just about how this actually went then.

184
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,800
Here you see three relatively simple examples when the straw is placed either-

185
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,823
In the middle of the carton.

186
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
A little skewed outside.

187
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,760
Or where we have a slightly different variant of the straw-

188
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,960
-Or it may not be clear.

189
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
And then you see in the pictures under-

190
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,640
-time cross, as the model then has dotted out to-

191
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,880
-Here I believe that the start, bend and endpoints exist.

192
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,071
And in this case, we can see that the model is actually performing quite well.

193
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,455
But even though it has passed some simple examples-

194
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,679
-So it is always interesting to look at a little more difficult.

195
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
And-

196
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
-You can see this here.

197
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
Up to the left you see a straw that is skewed format,

198
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,815
and at the top right you see a straw that has the wrong orientation-

199
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:54,600
-Against what it really should have.

200
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
And we see here that the model is struggling to prick out-

201
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
-The right number of points to detect.

202
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,320
And also where these points should detect.

203
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,480
You see it in the form of the red crosses.

204
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Finally then.

205
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,520
What different tracks are there-

206
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,200
-If you are interested in reading mathematics at college?

207
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,935
Well, you can of course read as a civil or college engineer.

208
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,007
And then it is more theoretical math if you read a civil engineer.

209
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
Then of course you can also read to mathematicians.

210
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,408
Then you read a lot of math.

211
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:27,600
And I can also recommend reading a mix of mathematics and programming.

212
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,039
Because then you will surely be very sought after in the labor market.

213
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
And then you can also read to mathematics teachers.

214
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
For example for high school,

215
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,600
or for high school.

216
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,640
Then I also just want to mention this track that I am currently on.

217
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,583
This KPU, or supplementary educational education.

218
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
If it is so that you have read civil or college engineer-

219
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,239
-or that you have read to mathematicians, so you can complement your education-

220
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,760
-So that you get the right to teach within the school.

221
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,821
And I am currently reading KPU at Liu.

222
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,927
And so far, my experience of education-

223
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,960
-That it is really good and valuable.

224
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,840
Clearly above expectation actually.

225
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,905
Okay, then you've been told a bit of-

226
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,680
-What you can do at university when you plug mathematics,

227
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,000
And what opportunities exist if you plug mathematics.

228
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,360
Good luck with your future study choice!
