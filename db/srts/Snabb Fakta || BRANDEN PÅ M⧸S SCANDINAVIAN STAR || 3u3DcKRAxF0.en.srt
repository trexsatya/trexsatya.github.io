1
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:19,750
It is 21:45 in the evening, Friday, April 6, 1990.

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:30,050
The ship "M/S Scandinavian Star" had just begun its journey from Oslo in Norway to Fredrikshamn in Denmark.

3
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:37,883
On board were 383 passengers and 99 crew members.

4
00:00:37,883 --> 00:00:44,483
Before we move on, we need to go through some short information about the ship.

5
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:51,450
The ship was built in 1971 in the city of Nantes in France.

6
00:00:51,450 --> 00:01:01,266
From the beginning, the ship was called M/S Massalia and was a combination of a passenger ship and a ferry for cars and railway cars.

7
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:16,500
The ship was about 141 meters long and about 21.9 meters wide. In total, the ship was able to take on board 1152 passengers, of which 100 in the crew.

8
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,416
The ship has changed its name and owner several times since she was built.

9
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:32,100
In March 1990, she was bought by Vognmandsuten and put in traffic between Oslo in Norway and Fredrikshamn in Denmark.

10
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,816
Okay, again until Friday, April 6, 1990.

11
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:50,550
The ship left the port of Oslo at 21:45 local time - 2 hours and a quarter delayed.

12
00:01:50,550 --> 00:02:01.666
The journey would have started already at 19:30, but work on boarding passenger cars and trucks took longer than expected.

13
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:14,683
The journey to Fredrikshamn goes painlessly at first until it was between 01: 45-02: 00 on the night of April 7.

14
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:27,100
The ship was now out on open water in a part of the North Sea called Skagerack and most of the passengers were sleeping.

15
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:37,616
On deck 4, some passengers are suddenly awakened from their sleep when they hear a crackling sound out in the corridor.

16
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:49,216
A few doors away is a pile of bedding on the floor that burns. Fortunately, they manage to extinguish the fire together with the crew.

17
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:57.066
One of the crew members went up to the command bridge and announced the first mate who at that time had the guard.

18
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:07.766
He in turn went and announced to the captain of what had happened and told the captain that "someone is playing Pyroman".

19
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:17,100
After captain Hugo Larsen was announced, the first mate was sent down to the fire site to check.

20
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:28,783
It was made sure to be properly extinguished and cleaned up. After that, the first mate called the captain on the bridge again and announced that everything was under control.

21
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:44,100
But it all didn't end there. Sometime just after 02:00, one more fire arose on deck 3 outside a cabin in a corridor on the starboard side.

22
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:57,316
This was near the stairs leading up to tires 4 and 5. Within a few minutes, the fire had spread so much that the entire corridor was in flames

23
00:03:57,316 --> 00:04:05.066
And thick smoke looked up the stairwell and began to fill the corridors on tires 4 and 5.

24
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:15,350
There were alarms from a number of different fire alarms in the corridors on decks 4 and 5 when the passengers there had discovered the fire.

25
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:31,200
When the captain learned about this it was around 02:15 and when the first mate entered the bridge he received orders from the captain to send out the signal "fire alarm" all over the ship.

26
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:41,116
The captain triggered the self -closure of the fire doors in the areas where the fire alarm buttons had been pressed by the passengers.

27
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:51,883
But since no button had been pressed in where the fire started on the starboard side by deck 3, the fire doors were left open there.

28
00:04:51,883 --> 00:05:05.033
The walls and ceiling on deck 3 were covered with plastic laminate and when it burned there it created a smoke that contained high levels of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide

29
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:14,033
And after only 10 minutes, the corridors had reached a deadly concentration of the two gases.

30
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:28,366
At 02:24 they now turned off the ship's propulsion and then started the fire pumps but the fire was already out of control.

31
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:42,583
Captain Hugo Larsen sent out an emergency signal to Tjøme Radio in Norway, announcing the fire on board and that the passengers and crew would now start moving towards the lifeboats.

32
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:51,533
On board, there is currently total panic among passengers. Many are struggling through the smoke -filled corridors.

33
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:59.883
Some people have already died of the toxic smoke and passengers may step over them in order to reach.

34
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:16,316
Here, even more problems began to arise. According to the Accident Investigation Board's report, there was no superior leadership that made sure that things went right from the fact that the fire was discovered until the ship was abandoned.

35
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:28,400
The entire evacuation and mood of the lifeboats were panicked according to witnesses and were mostly managed by the passengers themselves.

36
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:48,433
At 02:25 Denmark ferry “M/S Stena Saga” which was nearby going to Scandinavian Star, which was now 11 nautical miles west of the Weather Islands.

37
00:06:48,433 --> 00:07:02.916
02:27 The Sea Rescue Center at Gothenburg Radio in Onsala has heard the conversations from Scandinavian Star and offers help with Swedish helicopters and vessels. It is accepted.

38
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:17,366
Between 02:36 and 03:10, the Sea Rescue Center sent out three helicopters and 12 different Swedish coast guard, pilot and sea rescue boats.

39
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:26,100
Norway sent out 3 helicopters, as well as coastguard vessels and engine torpedo boats and also a rescue cruiser.

40
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,800
Denmark sent out two helicopters.

41
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:39.816
At 02:50, Stena Saga is in front of Scandinavian Star.

42
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:53,916
After that, M/S Dana Regina arrives at the site and the aforementioned vessels. Now the vessels began to take on survivors from Scandinavian Star's lifeboats.

43
00:07:53,916 --> 00:08:05,750
At 03:28 Captain Hugo Larsen announces that he is currently sitting in a lifeboat on his way to Stena Saga and that all passengers and crew

44
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:13,000
is in the lifeboats and that no person is left on board Scandinavian Star.

45
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,700
But unfortunately, that information was not true. There were still people left on board.

46
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:30,350
03:38 Fire personnel with professional smoke divers are sent from the fire brigade in Gothenburg to Scandinavian Star.

47
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:41,433
It takes a while before they arrive and while this is ongoing, staff from several different connecting rescue services are sent to the site.

48
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:55.266
05:30 the first smoke divers are celebrated at Scandinavian Star via helicopter and almost at once are discovered 5 pieces

49
00:08:55,266 --> 00:09:01,783
Survivors aboard the burning ship that was rescued immediately.

50
00:09:01,783 --> 00:09:10,183
When the firefighters then enter the ship, it was like stepping into a burning nightmare.

51
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:18,216
There were dead bodies everywhere ... both adults and children.

52
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:23,000
A view that no human should have to experience.

53
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,433
Unfortunately, there were no more survivors left on the ship.

54
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:36,050
It is believed that more people could have been saved if the smoke diver effort had come 2 hours earlier to the scene.

55
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:44,533
159 people lost their lives that night.

56
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:59.833
The investigations conducted afterwards by the forensic authorities show they probably died quickly.

57
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:13,766
It was a combination of a number of causes, partly the fire itself but also of high carbon dioxide content as well as the toxic smoke containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide.

58
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:24,750
It is estimated that the passengers who made their way out into the corridors had not been able to get to any exit before collapsing on the floor.

59
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,166
Most of the dead, which were 99 people, remained in their cabins.

60
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:38,683
About 50 people were found in the corridors and most were in aft on deck 5.

61
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:48,233
323 people were rescued from Scandinavian Star that night and only about 30 were injured.

62
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:55,666
Most had mild smoke poisoning or other lighter injuries such as splits and bruises.

63
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:05,683
Some were taken ashore via helicopter and others were brought with the vessels to Lysekil, Sandefjord, Fredriksstad and Fredrikshamn.

64
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:18,083
11.55 During the day, Scandinavian Star was towed to Lysekil and is 21:17 in the evening.

65
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:29,516
The day after April 8 at 16:30, the fire is finally extinguished and the dead can start to be lifted ashore.

66
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:42,816
Since the majority of passengers were from Norway, the dead bodies were transported in large white cooling cars with police cards to the Forensic Institute in Oslo.

67
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:54,233
Two questions quickly appear in the head. Who built the fires and why did everything go ... so wrong?

68
00:11:54,233 --> 00:12:00,733
Sadly, it has not been possible to determine who or who built the fires on the ship.

69
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:11,950
After the disaster, an official fire investigation was conducted and there it was concluded that the most likely perpetrator was a passenger on board

70
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,216
named Erik Mørk Andersen, 37 years.

71
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:27,150
He was previously convicted of murder. However, he himself died in the flames after the second fire so you couldn't be sure it was he.

72
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:39,466
An interesting investigation from 2006 by two fire engineers at Lund University of Technology concluded that there were not only two fires on board ..

73
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:45,933
Without six and that all fires were constructed.

74
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:59,600
This also shows that it was probably not Erik Mørk Andersen because several fires were built after his death. If he was, he was not alone in any case.

75
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:08,100
The person or persons must have had a good knowledge of the ship and access to a number of locked spaces.

76
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,966
Another theory is that it is an insurance fraud.

77
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:22,716
An American company named Sea Escape had bought the ship one week before the fire for $ 10.3 million

78
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:29,766
And the same day as the purchase, they assured the ship for $ 24 million.

79
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:43,100
According to this theory, the company Sea Escape can thus be the cause of the fire and got some of the crew to set fire to the ship and later get the insurance money.

80
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:52,133
Why did everything go so wrong then? How could the fire on board get such a disastrous outcome?

81
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:57,250
According to the Accident Investigation Board's report, this was due to several things.

82
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:06.016
Partly that when the captain of the command bridge is notified of the fire, the alarm within the ship is incomplete.

83
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:10,400
No proper attempt at all extinguish the fires was carried out…

84
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:17,466
It was even so that the fire manager on board did not know that it was his task.

85
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:27,716
There were seven smoke diver equipment on board, but no one was used to extinguish the fire or to save any passengers.

86
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:32,200
3 of them were used in the evacuation of the ship.

87
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:40,966
And that smoke divers should have been called to the Scandinavian Star in connection with the emergency signal being sent out.

88
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:51,200
It is believed, as I said, that many more people could have been saved if smoke divers had been called earlier.

89
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:09.266
You still do not know who or who built the fires at Scandinavian Star that night that killed 159 people.

90
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:20,250
The fact that such a disaster is and perhaps remains unresolved is a great sadness for those affected, but also their relatives.

91
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:29,483
For all the people who survived the disaster at Scandinavian Star, that night has become a memory ..

92
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:33,266
that burned stuck .. forever.
