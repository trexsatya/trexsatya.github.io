1
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.680
Now let's talk more about sex and intimacy.

2
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.280
When we went through the needs map, we talked about the Viet.

3
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.120
We mentioned that there are two important parts of the Viet

4
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.160
And this is mainly about the physical part.

5
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.560
It is an area where you notice that if problems arise in the couple relationship ...

6
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.840
We notice that many we meet come here with problems.

7
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.840
... it is often this area that can suffer from it.

8
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.800
Those problems can basically be about something else

9
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.760
But it is quite common for it to affect the intimacy area.

10
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.040
Therefore, this is an important area to talk about, especially for toddler parents.

11
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.520
We can have different expectations of sex.
 When, where, how often and so on.

12
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.920
And what is becoming important somewhere is that we should be able to talk about it

13
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.840
Because we cannot do that, we have a tendency to feel rejected or pressed.

14
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.320
In these positions it is very difficult to stretch out your hand and talk.

15
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.920
So we can't talk about it, seek help, come to us, because we know it affects.

16
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.480
But we should still talk a little about how to think about different things.

17
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.760
One end that is good to start in is that you often have different desires in different periods.

18
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.760
I would probably say it's so all over the life cycle

19
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.120
when living in a couple relationship and having a family.

20
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.400
On the one hand, there is often a big difference in how easily you have contact with your desire

21
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.040
And it can also go up and down for periods.

22
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.720
It will go up and down, and it is very unusual for us to meet couples

23
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.800
Which has exactly the same desire at the same time for extended periods.

24
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.680
It will look different.

25
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.080
And there is such a critical stage here, I think.

26
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.920
You may say against me if you disagree

27
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.600
But I think that when you have this transition from going from love-

28
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.720
To more lasting love, these are different things.

29
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.920
In love, you usually mention, where there is really only one we.

30
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
There is only one we and I do not even have any needs of my own.

31
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.480
I don't need to eat or sleep, I'm almost high.

32
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.520
Just.
 -And we also spice up.

33
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.960
I try to be my best self.
 Happy, nice, smells good and everything.

34
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.000
So I'm not really myself to a hundred percent either.

35
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.240
But then you come to that stage then hopefully ...

36
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.120
Most often.
 -... turns into a lasting love.

37
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.760
From this by spiceing up

38
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.320
To be able to sit in cozy pants and not care for being chosen.

39
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
You are confident that you have been chosen.
 -Just.

40
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.360
This is when you can think that these differences are starting to appear more.

41
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.520
Because you often have much more sex during love, that's the usual.

42
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.720
But in the love relationship there are other things that become important.

43
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.480
Again, I start thinking about my own needs.
 Now I touched the mic ...

44
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.520
And you start to think a little about wanting to do other things.

45
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.800
What is the important message here, talking about having different desires in different periods

46
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.200
It is: Do not use love as a norm.

47
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.920
If one uses love as a norm and is no longer there but in love relationship

48
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.400
So you will think that you are not good in your sex life.

49
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.680
The entrance and driving force for sex must always be desire.

50
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.560
And this is a bit important, because we can force ourselves when it comes to other areas.

51
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.920
I can clean even though I don't think it is needed.

52
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.320
I can make a little extra in protest with the vacuum cleaner or so.

53
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.120
But when it comes to sex, the driving force must always be desire.

54
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.520
And then the question is: what raises and lowers my desire

55
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.800
It is generally a little bad at talking about

56
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.800
But also to have been thinking about.

57
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.960
And if I haven't thought about what raises and lowers my desire

58
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.680
Then it is extremely difficult for my partner to know.

59
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.680
There are a few different factors when it comes to desire.

60
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.600
For example, we know that alcohol can be a factor

61
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.720
Which may first raise my desire, but above a certain limit it may lower my desire.

62
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:40.200
And maybe especially if it is your alcohol intake, it can lower my desire.

63
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.960
It can be a bit important to think about.

64
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:51.880
And stress is an important factor in terms of lust or fun -raising.

65
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.720
It's not that strange really, because stress is programmed in us

66
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.880
Then very long back to be triggered by danger.

67
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.240
Our bodies and brains have not changed much, despite the outside world.

68
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.920
It means that a long time ago, when stress meant danger

69
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.040
and I went on the savannah and there came a saber-toothed tiger-

70
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.120
So I would be very strong or fast.
 It was "Fight-or-Flight".
 Now giants.

71
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.800
I would not think: "Hm, I want to lie a little, maybe"

72
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.320
It was not on the map.
 -No.

73
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.120
And stress works the same for us today, it's lust.

74
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.440
Then you may have to think about: What do I do to hang out of the stress

75
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.280
What do I need to have the conditions to put the stress aside

76
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.520
Because it is usually lust -lowering.
 Then can sex ...

77
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:59.280
And now we should probably mention that sex does not have to be intercourse, it can be so much more.

78
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.080
Sex can actually be very stress reducing

79
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.960
thus sex liberates us from stress-

80
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.120
But at the entrance to the desire, sex can put it a little for us.

81
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.120
Yes, and the important thing there is that there is nothing you can just choose.

82
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.960
As another job.
 -You can't press and off.

83
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.040
But I need to think about what it is that can raise my desire.

84
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.320
Then we usually make a parable with traffic lights.

85
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.000
It may sound tricky, but we think we have green, yellow and red light.

86
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.040
If both have green light no weirdness, it's just driving.

87
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.240
If both have red light?
 -No weirdness, not drive.

88
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.200
It won't be driving.

89
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.520
But about one of us has green and the other yellow.
 Or maybe both have yellow.

90
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.200
Yellow can go in both directions.

91
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.520
It can turn green i can find my desire

92
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.600
Or it can stay on red, I can't find my desire.

93
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.480
It is important to keep track of it.
 -Yes.

94
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.720
Because you still have to be prepared for

95
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.520
that if it is a bit in yellow position for both, or for one of us-

96
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:29.920
Then there is always a risk, if you are not aware, that what you mentioned arises.

97
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.280
You feel rejected if you take the initiative and the other pressed.

98
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.520
But we have control over it and yet choose to try

99
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.840
So hopefully it will not be such a big thing if it does not succeed.

100
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.520
No, and I think it's important, just as you say now

101
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.920
That if I'm on green and you on yellow, I need to scan myself a little.

102
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.640
If we have a cozy moment and try to work on finding your desire

103
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.600
What it is now, and it just doesn't appear-

104
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.920
Can I still feel that we have had a cozy moment and it is totally okay.

105
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.640
But if I have had a tough day at work or have struggled with some child

106
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.920
Then maybe I, if we can't find your desire, feel dismissed.

107
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.720
Then it is better not to be at that time.

108
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.160
Now that we've talked so much about lust

109
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.600
it may be important to re -connect to the needs map.

110
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.800
For desire, there is not in all areas.

111
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.080
No, it's interesting.

112
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.960
There is in the self, because I can actually have sex with myself.

113
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.960
It is in the Viet, of course.
 We have assumed that.

114
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.600
But it is not in family.
 -Why?

115
00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:02.880
Well, there we need to come back to this with having slightly different roles.

116
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.680
In the Viet you are love partners, where it becomes a natural connection.

117
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.920
There, intimacy can be and thrive.

118
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.240
But in family, the roles are that we are parents.

119
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:24.320
That association or contact with desire does not appear when you are a family.

120
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:32.760
We often see that there can be a crash, not least when the kids are so small

121
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:38.920
That someone is parental worker and the other works outside the home.

122
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.680
It may be a little easier for the person who is not parenting

123
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.800
To have had a I-time to find the entrance to the desire in the couple relationship.

124
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.600
But anyone who is parental is in their parenting role.

125
00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:00.360
Yes, and this is very important.
 One may actually consciously have to think about

126
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:06.000
that I need to get out of the parenting role through my self-

127
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.680
before I can go into the love relationship.

128
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.880
So I may need some time for myself to land more in my self.

129
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:20.320
It can be about taking a bath, going for a walk or watching something a bit.

130
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.600
I have to land in my self first, because I am in the parenting role I should not have sex.

131
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.240
Because that's what you said.
 -Yes exactly.

132
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:35.080
A very common situation when we talk to couples about these themes are

133
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:44.320
that we say both are home-

134
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.320
and we say that you have just succeeded in the nasty child-

135
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.720
And then maybe someone gets this contact.
 Now you have the opportunity.

136
00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:02.320
But this can often be a yellow position for the parental working.

137
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.320
The child has just fallen asleep

138
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:15.720
But the parent who at the time in life has taken on responsibility for this-

139
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:23.160
Has like that parental antenna turned on and is in parenthood.

140
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.640
Therefore, it can be so difficult that it is just "pang" to be turned off.
 It's not that easy.

141
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:36.520
No, and also that it may be quickly turned on if you hear a little whine.

142
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.040
It is very important to think about.

143
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.840
Then we will talk about having a few different entrances to sex.

144
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.080
For some, six is six, that is, that is when we are closest.

145
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.640
But some other of us may need to have closeness before we have sex.

146
00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.560
Here it is not uncommon for couples to be different.
 One is no more right or wrong

147
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.520
But we need to know how we work-

148
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.320
For the goal is the same, the goal is for us to be close to each other.

149
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.640
But if we have just struggled and you are one that thinks sex is closeness

150
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.600
I need closeness before sex, and you take an initiative, so I can think:

151
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.840
"What is wrong with you" if I am one who needs closeness before sex.

152
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.560
Then it is important to remember: "He wants us to be close."

153
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.480
But we have different ways to go there.

154
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.040
Now I think about what we have talked about in previous clips again.

155
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.400
Should we take that example of timeout?

156
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.520
We say we have had a conflict

157
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:53.160
And so we say I've "time-out" it.
 Or "appred" it.

158
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.880
And so we say that for me it is still easier to think:

159
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.840
"Sex still leads to closeness."
 -And Sams.

160
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.040
Then it may happen that between the two rules in Timeout take an initiative.

161
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.760
But probably, if we simplify it and you lie more the other way

162
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.760
It will be really tricky, because we need to have the conversation before.

163
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.960
Yes.
 We need to know how the other works because then it can be called.

164
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:33.000
Just.
 At the same time, it is important, when we talk about just intimacy and sex ...

165
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.560
In fact, I think it's a tricky area.

166
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.120
It is a very important area, but it is clever, because there is a part with sex

167
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.760
Where the incoming, lust -enhancing part is also the mysterious part, so ...

168
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.120
But that does not mean that you should not be able to talk about it.

169
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.920
What I mean is that some things need to be a little mysterious.

170
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.920
Some fantasies should not always share

171
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.720
But some things we need to share, especially what we have been talking about now.

172
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.840
Expectations, that you may need time, that you have different entrances and so on.

173
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:20.040
I also think, based on this with rejection, that if you take an initiative

174
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.800
It becomes important that I not only turn your back, but say:

175
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.040
"I know you want to, but I'm not there. Can we just hug"

176
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.920
Then you don't have to feel rejected.

177
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.800
At the same time I think that if I want to go for a walk and you don't want to

178
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.320
Then I go anyway?

179
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.920
If you don't want to have sex and I want, then I have it with myself

180
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.560
It's really no wonder, but we rarely talk in those terms.

181
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:56.520
For some, it may well be that sex with themselves, or in the self

182
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.920
Almost disappears when you become a couple.

183
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.760
Yes, but if we have different desire needs, it is probably no stranger than the walking liking

184
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.440
It is important to remember that I can still have that opportunity.

185
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.040
Yes.
 And now we talk a lot of sex

186
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.160
and I think that after childbirth, pregnancy and other-

187
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.320
It does not have to be about sex, but it can be a lot about everyday life.

188
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:33.240
That we can actually be physical with each other without having an expectation of sex.

189
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.920
But we may need to hug and take each other in everyday life.

190
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.600
There you have a thing you usually say that we finally say.
 That about everyday life.

191
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:50.800
It is actually that if I am at home with the baby who needs a lot of physical closeness

192
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.920
and maybe also ammar-

193
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.720
So I get a lot of the need for contact.

194
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.320
There is a lot of skin to skin all day.

195
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.880
So I don't have much need for the other in it.

196
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.200
But you have it, because you have not received your contact need.

197
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.760
There you may need to remember to save a little.
 Not so that one should reject the child

198
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.240
But one may need to think that you have not received as much-

199
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.480
As I have received, who have been home.

200
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.920
So save the hug.
 -Save a hug.
 Or two.

201
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.600
Or three, maybe.
 You decide that.

202
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.320
Summary on this part.

203
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.520
Important to consider: you have different desires in different periods.

204
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.720
Do not compare with love.

205
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.800
The driving force must be desire.

206
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.080
Think about what is lust -lowering and lust enhancing

207
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.880
And share it with your partner.

208
00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.600
You often have different entrances to sex.
 For someone can sex lead to closeness

209
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:06.440
And for the other, the emotional proximity can come before and lead to sex.

210
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:12.040
It was all the clips.
 -Feel free to go back and look again.

211
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.560
You have found them via our website and there is also contact details

212
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:23.760
If you want to check something with us or contact some calls.

213
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.080
We also have a Facebook page you can follow, where we put things out every now and then.

214
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:36.720
Yes, it can be good, actually.
 There we can have everything from book tips to general tips.

215
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:44.280
Then I actually thought of something we didn't say in the first clip.

216
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:51.120
If you want a time with us at the family counseling, you can email or call.

217
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:59.000
Yes.
 And now you have listened to us, who are in Halmstad and Hylte.

218
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.160
But on each municipality's website there is a link

219
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.120
to each family counseling with contact details.

220
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.640
And it can be said again: Come early than late.

221
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.320
And good luck with the adventure!
 -Thanks for us!
