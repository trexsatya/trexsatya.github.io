00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:09.920
Coronavirus! Teens make Corona attacks on old people. Or?

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,920
The police dissolved a party yesterday ...

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,720
... coughed and spit on food and then tried to steal beer.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,800
Two young men are visible on the surveillance images ...

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,520
Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the "Viral Reviewer".

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,800
They run the source criticism - Sweden's national team in source criticism.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,320
Now they do and edwin "Källkoll Corona"

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,680
It is a damn way, but there is more behind the story.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,480
-But first: Social distancing. -Shole.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,640
There are coronary parties. Young people drive with the elderly by coughing them.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,960
On March 20, Markus held Söder-

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,360
-Whots are ministerial president of Bavaria, a press conference.

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,360
There he told me that it was young people who had "corona parties"-

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,920
-And coughed on the elderly and shouted "Corona" because it was fun.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,760
It became a news in Germany, then in Europe, then in Sweden.

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,720
-I'm nothing in Sweden too? -Yes. They uploaded a Youtube clip.

17
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,080
They coughed on people and said "Corona".

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,400
It was a prank attempt. Not many people agreed that it was fun.

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,040
And on March 30, Eslöv Municipality posted a Facebook post-

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,640
-If young people coughed on the elderly.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,160
That post also became a news.

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59.960
The Youtube prank is easy to know if it happened, it's just watching.

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Now they have removed the clip, but it was there.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09.400
As far as Germany and Eslöv are concerned, it is more difficult.

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,840
How many were there that coughed and were coughed?

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,480
-Welcome to the police gear. -I am called Åsa and is a journalist.

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,480
We have checked it. We first talked to Germany, or tried.

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,880
It went like that, but they basically said ...

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,160
The police had received "A Smaller Number of Violations".

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,960
-"A Small number of violations". -We have talked to Eslöv.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,360
It seems that it is smaller than it seems.

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,560
The police have no reports on this.

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,080
They had no reports that it would occur to a large extent.

34
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,760
Then we have asked different grocery stores if it has happened there.

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05.800
Nobody said it had happened right there.

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,280
Then we asked Eslöv's operations manager who told the newspapers.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,200
Finally she said it was about an event in a store-

38
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,800
-There older people had taken offense what some young people had done.

39
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,640
She wants to point out that this is not a trend among a lot of young people.

40
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay. But there are so few who do. Why is it big news?

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,400
It's provocative. We get to know the days long how to behave.

42
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,600
And when someone doesn't do, it provokes.

43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,840
When something provokes, it is happy to be a way to show what you must not do.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,320
And disturbing themselves on young people is a folk sport since ancient times.

45
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,400
-Do you remember the clown hysteria 2016? -Yes, who can forget it?

46
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,280
After seeing something like this ...

47
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,400
-When the police in South Carolina ... reports of threatening clowns ...

48
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,320
As it spread, I think this is also spread. There is a similarity.

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,680
Wait. You should explain a little clearer.

50
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,280
My great pleasure. If you think like this:

51
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,480
It starts when someone gets the idea to cough on an old man and say "Corona"-

52
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,680
-Or when there is a rumor about the idea.

53
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,160
Somewhere in the world, some of the world's seven billion inhabitants do it.

54
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,080
It is an event that may be noticed.

55
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,680
There may be a rumor. And then people learn that it has happened.

56
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,400
Then maybe someone will be inspired, for example in Bayern.

57
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,240
Then Minister President Markus Söder takes it up at a press conference-

58
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,680
-As a lot of people reach.

59
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,360
Then someone gets an idea to do a prank on youtube-

60
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,160
-As many people look at, so it gets even greater spread.

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,120
Then someone in Eslöv gets for themselves ... You understand where we are going.

62
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,480
There are four events that have been noticed-

63
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,840
-So that so many people have heard about it.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,800
It has only happened four times but when more and more hears about it-

65
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,400
-Maybe someone new gets the same idea and that's why we stand here talking about it.

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,880
It has not happened exactly four times, but probably few times-

67
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,440
-And the attention has become so great.

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,120
Maybe you should make extra clear that it is a terribly bad idea.

69
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09.840
I have a tip for everyone. Do not cough on the elderly.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,240
But remember that news reporting picks up the deviating-

71
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,160
-And what is different and then it gets so big.

72
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,360
Plus this with who does it. There may be young people in town.

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:37,400
Events may be obtained in number but still get a lot of attention.

74
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,640
Empty barrels that noise loudly.

75
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:49,080
And there is a clear right way to behave and a wrong way.

76
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,960
And then the little things that are wrong can be huge news.

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01.440
They are like banknoting stories, stories about how we should not do-

78
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06.040
-So that's a message. -A Message.

79
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,760
It is a abusive idea to prank cough on people. Don't hell not.

80
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:18,800
But only a few do it and get huge attention.

81
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,320
And stories that provoke we like to spread and share.

82
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,080
That is why they are lifted like this.

83
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,440
So I should not cough on people, as that person does on me.

84
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,160
-How good are you doing? -shit -bad. Don't.

85
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,040
Here comes the bacilli.

86
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,680
See you on Monday!

87
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,400
