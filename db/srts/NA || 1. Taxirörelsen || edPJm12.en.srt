1
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.360
-Tja.
 Two Sörbäcken Special.
 -You haven't struggled with Bean?

2
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.160
No.
 Malak always makes extra.
 Look.

3
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.720
Is it okey?
 SEK 238 including VAT.
 Please and pay.

4
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.400
-You can write it on my list.
 -It's not going, unfortunately.

5
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.120
We don't have chalk here anymore.
 You have a note of 2,000 from last month.

6
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.960
-I can not.
 Unfortunately.
 -I get it.

7
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.880
The terminal alerts

8
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.440
-What the hell now?
 -Has the a-cash has not arrived?

9
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.480
-Or it is wrong with your terminal.
 -It's wrong on your head.
 It is new.

10
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.040
The terminal alerts

11
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.560
It's not possible.
 Unfortunately.
 Buy a sausage instead.

12
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.120
SEK 12.
 Health from Malak, and you get it for 10. Hello then.

13
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.080
Yes, but wait now ... The 23rd should be in the account.

14
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.040
You have to tell people well to let people pull it in.

15
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.520
Oh my God...

16
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.480
In other words...

17
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.080
“Bad Moon Rising” on the radio

18
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.240
-Where is the pizzas?
 -I'll talk about that.

19
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.720
They remain with the pizza baker.
 They have withdrawn our fucking a-cash.

20
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.400
-What the hell?
 Are you kidding?
 -Hherd ... Yes, it was a fun.

21
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.000
It was a joke.
 Laugh a little, then.

22
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
Then laugh, Billy!

23
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.200
Ha-ha-ha ... My God!
 My little brother was born with a frigolite brain.

24
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.480
Why would I go in here and lie about such a thing?

25
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.920
-Fan, take it easy.
 Chilla.
 -Chilla?

26
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.840
Well, is that location for a little chill?
 We take the opportunity to chill and soft!

27
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.880
We can have a small spa evening!

28
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.880
Look here!
 A little mayonnaise?
 How fun!

29
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.240
And maybe cucumber we should have?

30
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.920
We can sit here and have spa-

31
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.200
-S While the economy has gone to hell and that our source of income is gone!

32
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.440
We can only sit here.

33
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.120
-How fuck should we do?
 -I certainly had that we had not cheated.

34
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.920
What a nice weather it has been.
 You have been able to swim and sunbathe.

35
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.080
-Grill ... -We have grilled a lot.

36
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.360
-So.
 Then it became 94. -Yes ...

37
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.000
So.
 You can keep the gear if you ...

38
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.720
How nice you have rebuilt in the store.
 In the char, you had done something beautiful.

39
00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.760
What the hell!
 Release the wrist, I break my arm!
 It is overwhelm.

40
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.560
-Night time I call the police!
 -Yeah, God!

41
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.320
Are you tough because you have a job?
 "Here I sit and judge people!"

42
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.960
-I will never shop here again.
 -Quiet.

43
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.560
The Argentine Copper has the longest penis of all animal-

44
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.720
-In relationship with body size, namely a full 20 centimeters-

45
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.040
-Uy as the body's body length.

46
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.920
Billy!

47
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.040
Billy, come out and you'll see!

48
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.880
-Ding up until I say.
 -Yes.

49
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.040
Open.

50
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.040
-What are you saying?
 -What the hell is that?

51
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.160
Are you blind?
 A taxi, do you see well?
 I have started my own, Billy.

52
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.120
-Started own?
 -Yes.
 We can withdraw some money.

53
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.360
Think that your brother is an entrepreneur!

54
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.880
How did you think we should afford to refuel, then?

55
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.720
-We have no money.
 -Why should you be so damn negative?

56
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.280
Then we put down and hope that there is some harmless turkey in here.

57
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.360
I just wonder, Leif.
 How are you going to solve it?

58
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.600
The fridge gaps empty.
 We have to get money, Billy.

59
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.280
I am becoming a benget.
 I don't get anything in.

60
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:54.280
-Do you have withdrawn any money yourself?
 -Do not say so.
 I've done things.

61
00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.880
I cultivated tomatoes, which we ate.
 I stopped animals, which we sold.

62
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.920
You peeled in that bush for six months.

63
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.320
-And what did we get?
 Six tomatoes?
 -Seven.

64
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.920
Wow!
 Look!
 Here we have Elon Musk!
 He made the Seven tomatoes in Six Months.

65
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.040
Test sitting.
 It's damn nice.

66
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.680
It's like jumping into an Aladdin box.
 Do you know?

67
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.040
This is a good start, Billy.

68
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:43.120
The Argentine copper is known for its long penis.
 It has the record ...

69
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.800
You should be on a job interview.

70
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.120
-What then for work interview?
 -Work interview.

71
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.800
-I haven't reported me.
 -I've got it.
 To my business.

72
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.200
Come now.

73
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.880
Can you tell us a little about your strengths and stuff like that?

74
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.120
Strong sides?

75
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.880
Yes, it is ...

76
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.080
I do not know.
 Well, I ...

77
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.080
-What are you writing?
 -Let's move on.

78
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.560
-But see what you write!
 -Stop!

79
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:37.440
But what...?
 "No Strong Sides"?
 I couldn't say anything.

80
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.800
-I had lots I thought.
 -Welcome to working life!

81
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:49.000
You can't look like a bird's nest and think that the answers just pop up.

82
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.440
-You have to be on your toes.
 -We would do it together.

83
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.240
-Why...?
 You said so.
 -Okay...

84
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:06.880
We do this, Billy, and then I'm nice because you lack experience.

85
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:16.680
-Provination?
 -That's how it looks.
 You work upwards.

86
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.960
-I don't want probation.
 -But check out here.
 Sick days.

87
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.520
If you are sick you will receive pay.
 Such benefits are hardly available today.

88
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.240
Come on.
 It is our family business.

89
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.720
-Or so I look with someone else.
 -No wait!

90
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.120
Okay, I'll take it.
 Let's go.

91
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.960
-Write on there.
 -Thanks.

92
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:05.320
-Leif, is this necessary?
 -I need to know how you are with customers.

93
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.960
Yes, okay.
 Run, then.

94
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.280
Yes, okay.
 Hello Hello.
 What a nice taxi.

95
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:17.920
Hello.
 Thanks so much.
 Welcome to Öhman's taxi and Enterprises.

96
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.840
I'm Billy Öhman.
 Where do you want to go?

97
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.880
-Sthe gorgeous!
 I want to go to Luleå.
 -Okay, Luleå.

98
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.960
Then it will be ... SEK 500, and we do not take cards or swish.

99
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.160
No!
 What did I say before?
 Never outside the municipality for SEK 1,000!

100
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.320
-It's double tariff.
 -I forgot.

101
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.240
Do not sit and glare in the rearview mirror.

102
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.680
They get discomfort in the body when those little fish eyes look at them.

103
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.960
It's not easy.
 There is a lot to hold in your head with tariffs and shit ...

104
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.480
Jaming

105
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.320
-What the hell was that?
 -A cat devil.

106
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.760
Cursed!

107
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.880
-What are you doing?
 -It just went out!

108
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.160
You must use your eyes?
 It's like you have smeared in the brain.

109
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.080
-Check.
 -What the hell?

110
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.640
-How fuck could it survive the bang?
 -He must have become mental ill.

111
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.920
-Do you think?
 -He got a car in the skull.

112
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.080
It is shock or internal bleeding.

113
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.120
-Her God ... Damn, we're pulling.
 -Stop.
 Hello?

114
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.480
-Do we pull and leave the cat?
 -Yes.

115
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.640
We can't do that.
 Should he lie here and die and suffer and have himself?

116
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:59.240
-What the hell are we going to do?
 -As an entrepreneur, you have a responsibility.

117
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:05.600
-But wait ... stop, leif.
 -It can be a potential customer.

118
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.800
It's probably Andersson's cat.
 If we leave it, the rumor goes.

119
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.400
-"Öhmans run cats to death."
 -Nold, wait.

120
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:23.320
-No know that we were running on it.
 -You drove.
 I sat in the back seat.

121
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.160
Now we will take responsibility.
 Thats how it is.

122
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.200
Responsibility.
 Elon Musk had said that.

123
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.320
Hello...

124
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.000
So yes.
 Have you received any brain injury?

125
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.560
Hello, Andersson!

126
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:57.240
Hello.
 We came by because Billy has a thing that we think is yours.

127
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.880
-Yeah?
 -Yes...

128
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.760
But the poor man!
 What happened?

129
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:17.240
We were out and about with the car and he ran out and got the car in his head.

130
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.360
That was not the point.
 I'm sorry.

131
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.520
-We are really sad.
 -I understand.

132
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.120
I appreciate that you came by and did not leave him in the ditch.

133
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.280
-We would never do that.
 -We really regret, and ... yes ...

134
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.200
We should not take up your time.

135
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.040
But you may want one.
 I have started taxi companies if you need to go.

136
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:50.320
You can give to your friends too.
 You may always need a taxi.

137
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.840
Thanks.

138
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.320
Health Lasse.

139
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:04.800
Do you see?
 Doesn't it feel better now?
 It pays to be honest.

140
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.160
-It feels better in the body.
 -Exactly.

141
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:17.840
Entrepreneurial life is something for me.
 I'm starting to become a better person.

142
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.840
Leif ...

143
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.960
But what the hell...?

144
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.800
-Have we killed two cats?
 -Jump in.

145
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.800
-Do you not tell me?
 -Jump in!

146
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.840
-You said you would be honest.
 -Hop in the car, Billy!

147
00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.120
It had become too much for them that we have killed both cats.

148
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.560
Imagine if cats had as long snouts as their own body.

149
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.320
Oh my God...

150
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.960
Good morning.
 It's time to jump up.
 Here's some coffee.

151
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.920
-Did you sleep well?
 -The clock is not even sex.

152
00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:48.400
These are new times now.
 We cannot lie down and pull when we have companies.

153
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.560
-Why are you wearing that one?
 -Sure is it neat?
 Check.

154
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.920
-You have to look respectable for the hell.
 -It's true, Leif.

155
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.600
Now you have to step up.
 I go down the village and put up posters.

156
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.760
You can go and fix soup to the car.
 Soon we are in the process, the brother.

157
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.920
Now Dad would have seen us, the Business Brothers.

158
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.640
Yes?
 Leif Öhman's taxi and ... huh?

159
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.520
But what a fucking idiots!

160
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.360
You may be a little solution -oriented.

161
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.040
Think.
 Use the brain!

162
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.320
Hello!

163
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.680
Solution -oriented ...

164
00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.240
solution -oriented ...

165
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.680
-Hello?
 -Yes?

166
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:17.600
-How has it been?
 -Good.
 It has already called three customers.

167
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.640
We will probably get damn rich.

168
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.840
Fy fuck, Leif ... Team brothers Öhman.
 You fuck a genius, do you know?

169
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.280
-How has it been for you, then?
 -Now the barrel is full and the car refueled.

170
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.920
That's good, Billy.

171
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.400
Do you know something?
 I'm glad I hired you, Billy.

172
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:50.080
-Good work.
 I'm proud of you.
 -Thanks.
 I'm proud of you too.

173
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.920
It's not necessary.
 I'm used to, so ...

174
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.640
It's just to bang in bed.
 There will be a few miles behind the wheel.

175
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.440
You should pick up the first customer at seven.

176
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.120
-Sleep tight.
 -The same.

177
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:22.320
Today you get to give yourself a pat on the shoulder, entrepreneur Leif Öhman.

178
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.880
Tuppy crazy

179
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.920
Billy Hulkar

180
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.840
Hello?
 Rise and shine.
 You should pick up a customer in twenty minutes!

181
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.880
-It's not possible.
 I am sick.
 -Ill?
 You know how important the day it is.

182
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:56.000
-Don't play any fucking games ... -Connect, Leif!
 I'm really sick.

183
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.640
I have spit the whole damn night.

184
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.880
-I feel so damn bad.
 -What is going on?
 Huh?

185
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.680
Your only employee is sick the first day.

186
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.640
Ringtone

187
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.640
Cursed ... - Leif Öhman Taxi.

188
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.640
Yes absolutely.
 You can get to the train.

189
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:26.720
Shut up!
 - sorry, it wasn't for you.
 I have my child ...

190
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.400
It's a child.
 That is my brother.

191
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:37.600
You don't have to worry.
 It is on it's way.
 Yes, hello.

192
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:44.440
-I should be a manager, not a driver.
 -Forgive, but I'm feeling shit.

193
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:51.000
It's not possible, for fucking.
 It is fortunate that I have that sickness money.

194
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:56.600
Watch yourself!
 It's not just spewing that comes out of that mouth.

195
00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.320
-Where is the taxine key?
 -It's here.

196
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.160
-You stuffed it in the spy can!
 -Sorry.

197
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:12.160
Look at this!
 It can be what fans ... Ugh!

198
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.720
BANG

199
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.880
Hello!
 Öhman's taxi and enterprises.

200
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:35.200
-But wait now ... is this taxi?
 -Yes.
 Jump in now so we can.

201
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.280
-Welcome.
 There is chewing gum there.
 -What is it that smells?

202
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:50.120
-I think it's the paper mill.
 -It is in Piteå, 20 miles away.

203
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:55.960
-Yes, but the winds ... -We have to go.
 I'm in a hurry.

204
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.120
-Mit train goes in fifteen minutes.
 -No problem.
 We have a mile left.

205
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.760
It is quiet.

206
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.680
The car sounds bad

207
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:22.480
-Why does that sound like that?
 -The carburetor has been given an air bubble.

208
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.400
-What is wrong?
 -I think the car competition cuts together.

209
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.720
-I do not have time!
 -Take it easy.

210
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.040
-Ring after a new taxi.
 -I can not.

211
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.880
-You must have another car?
 -Do you hear badly?

212
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:14.040
Do I look like a fucking millionaire with a thousand cars?
 I just have this one!

213
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.200
-Welcome to reality!
 -Is it so you treat customers?

214
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.200
-It wasn't it ... -You should be reported to the Consumer Agency!

215
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:30.120
-I was joking.
 -You have to pay what this costs!

216
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.520
-We can solve this.
 -It's the world's worst taxi company!

217
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.920
No, it is not.
 You can get two free yards.
 Then I'm damn generous.

218
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.240
Damn!

219
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.320
Oh my God...

220
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:38.120
Satan, how long you were gone.
 Did you get more customers?

221
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.960
Hello?
 Leif?

222
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.880
Yes ... you are doing well, right?

223
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.880
Yes, I feel a little better.
 It was probably some shit I got in me.

224
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:57.400
Well, you say so?
 How nice.
 Where did you take the gasoline from?

225
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.880
-Wo?
 Where did you get the gasoline from?
 -From a team bus.
 I do not know.

226
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.520
A team bus?
 Huh?

227
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.160
-A team bus?
 -No, hell ...

228
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.840
Sorry!
 Was it diesel I hose?

229
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.480
It was poop you hose in the car!

230
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:27.160
It has cut!
 No wonder you get sick with poop in the full stomach!

231
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.680
Oh ... Damn, sorry ...

232
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:37.720
Billy, you have emptied a football team's diarrhea straight down in the car.
 In my taxi.

233
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.960
-Do you have no taste buds?
 -I kept to my nose.

234
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.960
Not a fucking customer I had to drive.

235
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.320
Do you know what this costs me?

236
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:57.280
Damn ... we can shit in the sickness benefit.
 I don't need it.

237
00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.640
Sickness benefit?
 You think it's time now to talk about sickness benefit?

238
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.240
Bilväljel ... The taxi is ruined.

239
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.320
-Augoze, Leif.
 -Billy!

240
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.280
-Curse, Billy!
 -Take it easy!

241
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.400
