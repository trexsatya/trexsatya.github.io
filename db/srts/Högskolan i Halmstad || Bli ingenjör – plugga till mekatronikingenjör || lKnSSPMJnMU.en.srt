1
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:08,067
My name is Jasmine Tuvesson and I study Mechatronics Engineer-

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:10,200
-At Halmstad University.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,000
And right now we are in Fab Lab.

4
00:00:12,033 --> 00:00:17,067
I chose this program as I have always liked technology from an early age.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,533
I ran around in the garage with dad and played with cars, bicycles and boat-

6
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:26,533
-And that's when I got this great interest in technology.

7
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,267
But I have also liked computers.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,933
Computer games, both \ hardware \ hoch software have always been interesting.

9
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,700
So it was quite clear that I would choose mechatronics-

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,200
-Then it is a great mix of the entire engineering orientation.

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,433
I chose the University of Halmstad because it is close to my family members-

12
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:55,300
-Personally, I like a little smaller schools when you get the family feeling.

13
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:59,333
The best thing about my education is the ability to learn one-

14
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:03,733
-Sid range of these technical modules.

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,167
And then I refer to electronics, mechanics and computer science.

16
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:11,400
I have been able to be in Germany as an exchange student.

17
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:19,567
With the help of Halmstad University, they have helped me with an internship there.

18
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:22,567
So I have made an exchange half-spring-

19
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:28,467
-and six months as a trainee there.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,800
I would like to work in the industry.

21
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:40,733
After doing my internship in Germany, I will now also read my master there.

22
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:46,567
I will read Industrial Security and Safety.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Possibly I would like to work at a medical facility.

24
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,533
And then help to produce medical technology for hospitals or-

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,667
-The dentist clinics and so on.

26
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:09,500
If you have what is required and if you want to become an engineer-

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,567
-So it is a very good start to get a good education and ...

28
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,567
-A good working life.
