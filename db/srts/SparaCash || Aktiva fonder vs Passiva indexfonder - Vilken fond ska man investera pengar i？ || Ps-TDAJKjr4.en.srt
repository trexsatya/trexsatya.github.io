1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,679
Hello you!
 Today, we will talk about funds.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,220
We were going to take up this struggle between active funds

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,639
and passive funds.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,520
Which fund should you choose for your savings?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,430
I have taken help from a guest who knows this with

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,650
funds and we will leg out the question so you find out

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,240
What to choose for your savings

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,240
And if you didn't know it, I'm called.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,840
Marcus Lindblad and I operate Save Cash and Save

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,259
Cash is for those who want to learn to save in shares

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,490
funds and much more so that we will go through it

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,960
is what is an active fund?
 What is a passive index fund?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,809
Who has gone best and which ones should you save?

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,200
Then we have with us Johanna here who is a guest and we are going to

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,530
Talk about active and passive index funds.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,300
But can't you introduce yourself a little bit so that

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,400
Viewers get to know who you are?

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,060
Big, thank you for being here on your channel and talking about funds.

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,930
I work then as saved on them at the fund companies'

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,650
association and it is an industry organization that completely

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,610
Simple seems for.

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,780
Sound fund industry in the savers' interest and my role as

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,860
Savings is that

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,010
Inform and train consumers about funds and fund savings.

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,570
And I do this by blogging, lecturing and so I try

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,560
to present

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,820
Interesting facts about precisely savings and funds in so

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,950
Many different channels as I can.

29
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,039
But Johanna, if you explain just a little

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,270
Shortly like this, what is an active equity fund?

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,520
An active equity fund is a fund where trustee,

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,580
The trustee or the trustee is active in.

33
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,710
The selection of which shares should be included in the fund,

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,710
so it is simply so that

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,390
the managers they do their analyzes and they investigate which

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,080
Companies that they believe most in and which they believe have the best

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,150
potential to get a high return in the future.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,170
And these are the ones they choose to include in the fund.

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,009
If we only take one example then we can say that it is a technology fund

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,610
which is actively managed.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,330
Then the trustee will try to find the technology companies that they

42
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,240
Believe mostly and take them into the portfolio.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,510
Sometimes maybe even go and meet the companies for

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,690
to understand the business.

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,070
They talk to the lead.

46
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,270
Yes they are simply active in the selection of these funds

47
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,390
and an active fund usually costs, but not always

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,430
more than one index fund because the trustees and they must

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,730
The get paid for this work as they do.

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,459
But it is also the active funds that can give it as

51
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,980
called over returns and that means that the fund

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,890
develops better than the comparison index like the fund here.

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,739
This means that active funds.

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,140
They may be worth a higher price if one finds a good

55
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,679
Manager who delivers this excess return

56
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,620
and the other fund types

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,480
index fund that instead follows an index

58
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,350
And then you might wonder, says, what is an index?

59
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,220
Well there is something that shows

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,000
Value development time for a compound number of shares

61
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,720
over a specific period of time.

62
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,770
And one thing I really want to point out.

63
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,290
Medius index management

64
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,390
An index fund does not automatically mean that one has a

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,660
lower risk, without

66
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,270
There are indexes that have a high risk and so are there

67
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,290
Index that has a lower risk.

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,320
Everything depends on

69
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,750
which index that the fund chooses to follow because there is

70
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,010
how many different indexes and since then that this fund

71
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,190
chooses to follow an index and do not make any active choices

72
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,990
Then this management fee may also be

73
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,090
much lower, but that also means that

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,060
Man as a saver

75
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,559
shall expect a return that is

76
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,650
in line with the index.

77
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,550
And I would also like to point out that this return

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,880
as is reported

79
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,540
It is always reported after fees so that

80
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,440
You as a saver should not hold on and count someone

81
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,520
Fee without it is displayed by fee.

82
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,239
So it is that it is very easy to actually

83
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,280
compare how different funds have gone.

84
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,430
But if you are now saved and think about talking

85
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,310
the pretty much about passive index funds fit

86
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,820
the vast majority and

87
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,550
Some others say that active actual funds are much better

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,590
and give better returns.

89
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,190
What should you really choose?

90
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,599
I don't think there is a certain

91
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,130
type that is best for all savers in all types of

92
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,800
positions, without i think that both

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,849
active management and index management fills its

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,130
function and

95
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,049
When choosing which form of savings you should have so

96
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,930
Should you have several different factors in their decision -making process,

97
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,989
So you can't say that.

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,420
This particular type fits all types of savers

99
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,580
Then there are some shapes fits a lot of savers,

100
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,500
But I think man

101
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,680
one should include several different criteria when choosing

102
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,570
What fund you should have in your savings.

103
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,820
So if you look at statistics and data on these different funds,

104
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,800
What is the best?

105
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,560
If you look at if you should say this,

106
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,620
We are on the form's association for no such statistics ourselves.

107
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,620
But Morningstar has a one statistics bank with mass

108
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,700
different statistics where I found these figures

109
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,700
and for the category Sweden shares

110
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,320
so shows painable that 42 % of the active funds struck

111
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,280
its comparison index for one year

112
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,390
and for 10 years the same figure was 28 % so that

113
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,120
It is clear that there are active funds that succeed in beating

114
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,890
its comparison index over time.

115
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,130
But it is far from anyone who strikes the comparison index.

116
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,890
So for who fits an active equity fund?

117
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,080
Yes I think active equity funds can suit someone

118
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,590
which is

119
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,070
a little more interested in their fund savings and can think

120
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,890
themselves to be something more active than those who want

121
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,020
maybe start a monthly savings and then

122
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,750
forget it completely in for maybe twenty thirty years for

123
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,360
If you choose an active managed fund, I think it

124
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,900
may be good to log in sometime sometimes and and

125
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,409
check how this fund has developed you keep

126
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,860
Still with the manager

127
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,790
regarding the administrative philosophy or have you changed

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
you and have the fund performed as you thought it

129
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,580
would do.

130
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,469
O k men

131
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,290
Passive index funds then who will save in one.

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,970
A passive index fund it is really a very simple

133
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,010
Savings form that suits most and if you choose a

134
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,890
Index fund so you can usually be sure you don't pay

135
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,580
unnecessarily high fees.

136
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,270
But you will not receive a return that is better than

137
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,869
Exactly the index you have chosen to follow.

138
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,510
But here is also important to remember that

139
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,630
All index is not the same and your fund will develop

140
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,960
as the index you have chosen to follow.

141
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,780
But then I don't think that but one

142
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,320
Management group necessarily must fit just a certain type of

143
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,370
Investors without me think one can choose both

144
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,190
active funds and passive funds in their portfolio.

145
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,990
For I myself save in both active and passive funds

146
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,609
Maybe you think a passive fund is suitable for

147
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,590
a particular market

148
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,040
while.
 One wants an actively managed fund to come

149
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,620
ate another type of industry.

150
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,580
Then I actually got some viewer questions.

151
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,789
First question is from Jimmy, what is the purpose of having a

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,370
Passively managed index fund?
 In addition to cheaper fee.

153
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,110
Yes, but the purpose is that you can follow a specific index

154
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,850
As is the way you want the exposure

155
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,960
against this particular index so you don't want any others

156
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,410
Deviations from this index so maybe you as a saver

157
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,950
thinks it is unnecessary to have an actively managed fund

158
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,570
that makes some more active decisions if you are still just

159
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,250
interested in getting the particular exposure as the index

160
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,760
gives it.

161
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,979
Karlsson asks, what should a fund portfolio look like?

162
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,820
Yes, that is a pretty hard question actually to

163
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,910
Fund portfolios can look very, very different and

164
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,620
There is no right and wrong here.

165
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,020
One can have

166
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,880
fixed income funds, you can have hedge funds, you can have

167
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,289
Lots of different

168
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,680
kind of fund types and if one as a saver should see which

169
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,540
fund portfolio you should have

170
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,830
So I think that when you are new

171
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,330
As a saver should start by checking out.

172
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,390
What kind of risk one is looking for and from there check

173
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,980
which fund types to choose

174
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,530
and try to think about getting some diversification and

175
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,479
maybe start with them

176
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,620
slightly wider funds that most often invest in many

177
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,720
Thousands of companies.

178
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,180
Machine investment is asking is good to have only active

179
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,770
Funds with high risk if you save long -term?

180
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,329
Yeah, it's a bit tricky question because I don't think so

181
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,949
As mentioned, there are some right and wrong when it comes to savings.

182
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,580
So if you are comfortable with having taken

183
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,260
high risk and that you have chosen active

184
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,280
Funds I don't think there is any problem with it.

185
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,459
If you feel confident in it and you believe in your managers

186
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,480
so I don't see any problems with it

187
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,830
then and if it is in the long term as you say so can

188
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,710
After all, have time to make changes to this savings.

189
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,540
Outside, because time goes by and the conditions may

190
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,480
changes and and you change your philosophy,

191
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,250
philosophy and your savings.

192
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,820
Then we have a question from Adam Glimsell,

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,530
Which fund should you invest in for decent short -term savings?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,770
Yes, that is a bit difficult with what you mean by decent

195
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,260
Short -term savings.

196
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,110
After all, there are fund types that have a lower risk.

197
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,329
There, the fixed income funds end up

198
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,020
And mixed funds fall under pure equity funds.

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
And there you usually like to see as guidelines on

200
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,610
A couple of years when talking about fixed income funds.

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,969
But there is a risk with fixed income funds as well,

202
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,810
So it is not risk -free to save in fixed income funds

203
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,120
so it all depends on what one feels that saves that you are

204
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,250
prepared to lose and what these money is intended to

205
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,869
so if you talk about in a year, would probably say that you

206
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,110
do not have to save in funds but then it can go well to

207
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,410
Insert it into a savings account.

208
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,340
But otherwise over which fixed income funds exist and about

209
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,220
you think you can get any return in this

210
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,660
The interest rate meeting we have.

211
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,440
And then it is Finance Council Barn that has asked a question

212
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,740
so and they ask how likely it is that one

213
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,660
Actively managed fund strikes index in the long term?

214
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,660
Yes, that is there are studies like Morningstar

215
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,450
have done over how

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,260
actively managed funds have gone

217
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,709
over time and what they have found is that it depends

218
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,920
pretty much on which category they have looked at,

219
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,650
so there seems to be some types of categories there

220
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,990
actively managed funds

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,790
has a little more likelihood of beating their comparison index.

222
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,380
But I do not have pure concrete figures on why

223
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,600
probability exists, without

224
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,530
There I think that as a saver must bring their

225
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,229
own thoughts about the future and

226
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,350
which sectors you believe in or which themes you

227
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,359
believe in instead of jumping on something that is

228
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,850
Trendy right now.
