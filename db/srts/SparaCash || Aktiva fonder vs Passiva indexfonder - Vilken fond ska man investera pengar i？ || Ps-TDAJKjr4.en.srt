00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,679
Hello you!
today, we're going to talk about mutual funds.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,220
We thought we'd address this
battle between active funds

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,639
and passive funds.

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,520
Which fund should you choose for
your savings?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,430
I have taken help from a
guest who knows this

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,650
funds and we will clarify the
issue for you to find out

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,240
what to choose for your savings

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,240
and if you didn't know
, my name is.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,840
Marcus Lindblad and I
run save cash and save

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,259
cash is for you who want to
learn how to save in shares

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,490
funds and much more so
we will go through it

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,960
What is an active fund?
What is a passive index fund?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,809
Which ones have gone the best and which ones
should you save?

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,200
Then we have Johanna with us here
who is a guest and we are going

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,530
talk about active and passive index funds.

16
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,300
But can't you introduce
yourself a bit like that

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,400
viewers get to know who you are?

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,060
Great, thanks for letting me be
here on your channel and talking about mutual funds.

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,930
After all, I then work as a saver
for them at the fund companies

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,650
association and it is a
trade organization as a whole

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,610
simple seems too.

22
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,780
Healthy fund industry in the
interest of savers and my role as

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,860
thrift economist is that

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,010
inform and educate
consumers about funds and fund savings.

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,570
And I do that by blogging,
lecturing and so I try

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,560
to present

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,820
interesting facts about
savings and funds in particular

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,950
many different channels that as
I can.

29
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,039
But Johanna,
if you explain just a little

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,270
Briefly,
what is an active equity fund?

31
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,520
An active equity fund is a fund
where managers,

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,580
administrator or the administrator
is active in.

33
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,710
The selection of which shares
should be included in the fund,

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,710
so it is simply that

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,390
the trustees they do their
analysis and they examine which

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,080
companies that they believe in the most and
that they believe have the best

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,150
potential for a high
return in the future.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,170
And they are the ones they choose
to include in the fund.

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,009
If we take just one example
, we can say that it is a technology fund

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,610
which is actively managed.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,330
Then the manager will try to
find the technology companies like them

42
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,240
most believe in and include them in the portfolio.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,510
Sometimes maybe even
go and meet the companies too

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,690
to understand the business.

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,070
They talk to management.

46
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,270
Yes, they are simply active in the
selection of these funds

47
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,390
and an active fund usually,
but not always , costs

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,430
more than an index fund because
the managers and they have to

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,730
get paid for this
work that they do.

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,459
But it is also the active
funds that can provide that

51
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,980
is called excess return and
it means that the fund

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,890
develops better than the
comparison index that the fund here.

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,739
This means that active funds.

54
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,140
They can be worth a higher
price if you find a good one

55
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,679
managers who deliver
this excess return

56
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,620
and the other fund types

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,480
index fund that instead follows
an index

58
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,350
and then you can wonder,
say, what is an index?

59
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,220
Well,
that shows something

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,000
value development time for
a composite number of shares

61
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,720
over a specific period of time.

62
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,770
And one
thing that I really want to point out.

63
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,290
Mediu's index management

64
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,390
an index fund does not
automatically mean that you have one

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,660
lower risk, without

66
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,270
there are indexes that have a
high risk and then there are

67
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,290
index that has a
lower risk.

68
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,320
Everything depends

69
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,750
which index the fund
chooses to follow for it exists

70
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,010
any number of different indexes
and because then that this fund

71
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,190
chooses to follow an index
and does not make any active choices

72
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,990
then so can this
administration fee

73
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,090
much lower,
but that also means that

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,060
man as saver

75
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,559
should expect a
return that is

76
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,650
in line with the index.

77
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,550
And I also want to point out
that this return

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,880
as reported

79
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,540
it is always reported after
fees so that

80
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,440
you, as a saver, should not hold
on and count anyone out

81
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,520
fee without
it being shown after fee.

82
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,239
So it is that it is
very easy to actually

83
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,280
compare how different funds have performed.

84
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,430
But if you are now saved and
thinking because you are talking

85
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,310
after all, quite a lot about
passive index funds being suitable

86
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,820
most of them and

87
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,550
some others say that active
equity funds are much better

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,590
and give better returns.

89
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,190
What should you really choose?

90
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,599
I don't think there is
a certain one

91
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:21,130
type that is best for all
savers in all types of

92
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,800
situations, but I think both

93
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,849
active management and
index management fulfill their purpose

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,130
function and

95
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,049
when you choose which
form of savings you want to have

96
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,930
should you include several different
factors in your decision-making process,

97
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,989
so it cannot be said that.

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,420
This particular type suits
all types of savers

99
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,580
then there are certain
shapes that fit a lot of savers,

100
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,500
but I think that man

101
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,680
you must include several different
criteria when choosing

102
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,570
which fund
you should have in your savings.

103
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,820
So if you look at the statistics
and data on these different funds,

104
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,800
which ones have gone the best?

105
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,560
If you check whether you should
say this,

106
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,620
we are on the form association
for no statistics like this ourselves.

107
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,620
But morningstar has a
statistics bank with mass

108
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,700
various statistics where I
found these numbers

109
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,700
and for the category Sweden shares

110
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,320
so painting shows that 42%
of active funds beat

111
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,280
its comparison index during
a year

112
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,390
and over 10 years the same
figure was 28% so that

113
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,120
it is clear that there are
active funds that manage to beat

114
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,890
its comparative index over time.

115
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,130
But not everyone
beats the benchmark.

116
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,890
So who is an active equity fund suitable for?

117
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,080
Yes, I think that active
equity funds can suit anyone

118
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,590
which is

119
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,070
a little more interested in his
fund saving and can think

120
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,890
themselves to be
somewhat more active than those who want to

121
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,020
maybe start a
monthly savings and then

122
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,750
forget about it completely
ii maybe twenty thirty years too

123
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,360
if you choose an actively managed
fund, I think that

124
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,900
might be good to log in
sometime sometimes and and

125
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,409
check how this fund has
developed don't you think

126
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,860
still with the trustee

127
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,790
regarding the management
philosophy or have you changed

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
you and has the fund performed
as you thought it would

129
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,580
would do.

130
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,469
Ok but

131
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,290
passive index funds then who
would save in such.

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,970
A passive index fund it is
really a very simple one

133
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,010
savings form that suits
most people and if you choose one

134
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,890
index fund, you can usually
be sure that you will not pay

135
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,580
unnecessarily high fees.

136
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,270
But you also won't get
a return that is better than

137
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,869
the particular index that you have
chosen to follow.

138
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,510
But here it is also important to
remember that

139
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,630
not all indexes are the same and
your fund will evolve

140
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,960
as the index you have chosen
to follow.

141
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,780
But then I also do
n't think that but one

142
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,320
management group necessarily has to fit
just a certain type of

143
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,370
investors but
I think you can choose both

144
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,190
active funds and passive
funds in their portfolio.

145
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,990
Because I myself save in both
active and passive funds

146
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,609
perhaps it is that you think
a passive fund is suitable for

147
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,590
a certain market

148
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,040
meanwhile. You want an actively
managed fund to come

149
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,620
for a different type of industry.

150
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,580
Then I
actually got a few viewer questions.

151
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,789
First question is from Jimmy,
what is the purpose of having one

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,370
passively managed index fund?
except cheaper fee.

153
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,110
Yes, but the purpose is to be able
to follow a specific index

154
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,850
as that is how you want the exposure

155
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,960
against this particular index so that
you don't want any others

156
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,410
deviations from this index
, so perhaps you as a saver

157
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,950
think it is unnecessary
to have an actively managed fund

158
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,570
who make a little more active
decisions if you are still alone

159
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,250
interested in getting that particular
exposure as the index

160
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,760
gives it.

161
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,979
Karlsson asks,
what should a fund portfolio look like?

162
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,820
Yes, that is a very difficult
question actually because

163
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,910
fund portfolios can look
very, very different and

164
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,620
There is no right or
wrong here.

165
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,020
You can have

166
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,880
bond funds, you can have hedge funds,
you can have

167
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,289
lot of different

168
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,680
kind of fund types and if you
as a saver should see which one

169
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,540
fund portfolio you should have yourself

170
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,830
that's how I think when you're
new

171
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,330
which savers should start by
looking at.

172
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,390
What type of risk you are looking
for and from there check

173
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,980
which fund types to choose

174
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,530
and try to think about bringing
in some diversification and

175
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,479
maybe start with them

176
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,620
a little wider the funds that
usually invest in many

177
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,720
thousands of companies.

178
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,180
Machine investment asks is
it good to have only active

179
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,770
funds with high risk if you
save for the long term?

180
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,329
Yes, it's a bit of a clever question
because I don't think so

181
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,949
As I said, there are some right and
wrong when it comes to saving.

182
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,580
So If you are comfortable that you
have taken

183
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,260
high risk and that you have chosen active

184
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,280
funds, I don't think
there is any problem with that.

185
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,459
If you feel safe in it
and you believe in your trustees

186
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,480
I don't see any problem
with that

187
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,830
later and if it is in the long
term as you say, it can

188
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,710
after all, also have time to make
changes in this saving.

189
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,540
Out, because time goes by and
the conditions maybe

190
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,480
change and and you change
your philosophy,

191
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,250
philosophy and your savings.

192
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,820
Then we have a question from Adam Glimsell,

193
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,530
which fund should one invest in
for decent short-term savings?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,770
Yes, that is a bit difficult with what
you mean by decent

195
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,260
short-term savings.

196
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,110
After all, there are fund types that
have lower risk.

197
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,329
That's where the bond funds end up

198
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,020
and mixed funds end up
just below pure equity funds.

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
And that is usually
seen as guidelines

200
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,610
a couple of years
when talking about bond funds.

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,969
But there is a risk with
bond funds too,

202
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,810
so it is not risk-free to
save in bond funds

203
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,120
so it depends entirely on what you
feel saves that you are

204
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,250
prepared to lose and
what this money is meant for

205
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,869
so if you talk about a
year from now, you would probably say that you

206
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,110
don't need to save in funds
, but then it can be good to

207
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,410
deposit it into a savings account.

208
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,340
But otherwise about which
fixed income funds exist and about

209
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,220
you think you can get some
return in this

210
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,660
the interest rate meeting that we have.

211
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,440
And then it is the Financial Council children
who have asked a question

212
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,740
so and they ask how
likely it is that a

213
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,660
actively managed fund beats
index over the long term?

214
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,660
Yes, that's it, there are
studies like morningstar

215
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,450
have done
over how

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,260
actively managed funds have gone

217
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,709
over time and what they have
found is that it depends

218
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,920
pretty much
what category they've looked at,

219
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,650
so there seems to be some
kind of categories there

220
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,990
actively managed funds

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,790
is slightly more likely to
beat its benchmark.

222
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,380
But I don't have pure
concrete figures as to why

223
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,600
probability exists, without

224
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,530
there I think that as a
saver you have to bring your own

225
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,229
own thoughts about the future and

226
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,350
which sectors you believe in
or which themes you

227
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,359
believe in instead of
jumping on something that is

228
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,850
trendy right now.

229
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,340
