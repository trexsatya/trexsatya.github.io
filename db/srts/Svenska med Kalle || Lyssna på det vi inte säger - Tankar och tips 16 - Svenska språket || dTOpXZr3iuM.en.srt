00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02.080
Hello Hello

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04.040
Anyone who trains Swedish

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I usually forget to say what my name is

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,480
So my name is Kalle

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,540
And are SFI teachers

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,680
And today I have a little tip

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
It is that

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
Listen very carefully

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,620
on how we pronounce the words in Swedish

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,220
for if you only read

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,120
or if you read

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,240
But don't listen carefully

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,580
on how we pronounce the words

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,940
so it becomes harder to understand

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
When a Swedish person

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,980
speaking Swedish

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48.060
Quickly

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51.560
and

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,660
an important thing to

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,080
listen to

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,280
that's all we don't say

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02.080
anything we take away

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,760
that disappears

24
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07,980
or as we reduce

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,520
when we speak

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,040
So I'll give some examples

27
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,600
If I speak slowly

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
and just as one writes

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,780
So I say

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,620
I have one child

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
I have one child.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,980
okay

33
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,420
But if I talk quickly

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,500
I say

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,380
I have a child [Jaaettbarn]

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Yes. About so. I have one child.

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,200
I have one child.

38
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,000
so you hear yourself

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
one more time

40
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,700
I have one child

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,780
or

42
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,680
I have one child.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,760
I have one child.

44
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,280
Yes you understand

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
It does not sound exactly the same

46
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,680
And I say or I don't pronounce all the letters.

47
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
available

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,880
on the paper if you read

49
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,880
We could take another example

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,140
At least like this

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
This is how I talk. This is how I say.

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,620
If I read.

53
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,480
So it says: I don't know

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,920
I do not know

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
But if I talk quickly

56
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,600
for example with a mate

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,820
So I say

58
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,020
I don't know [yes ve'nä]

59
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,960
listen again

60
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
I do not know

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,420
I don't know [yes ve'nä]

62
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,680
There is

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52.560
Many many examples

64
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
on how we don't pronounce

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
All the letters you read

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,820
on the paper

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01.880
and therefore it is very important to

68
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,240
Exercise you

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05.060
on that

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,720
Listen to how Swedes really talk

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
It will be much easier to understand then.

72
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,020
What we say

73
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,620
and a simple way is if you have a book

74
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
With sound on the internet

75
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,080
or a book with a CD to

76
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,340
so listen carefully to the text

77
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,760
at the same time

78
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,980
As you read

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,680
and think carefully about

80
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,840
How we pronounce the words for real

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,380
so you don't think we pronounce the words

82
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,640
As they stand in the book

83
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Without listening how it sounds

84
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,300
What letters do we pronounce

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,160
and which letters disappear

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,620
when we talk

87
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57.560
You can also do it if you look

88
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59.420
For example, on my videos

89
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02.800
When I have both talk and text

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,820
So look at how we write the sentence

91
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09.700
and then listen how I say it

92
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
If you work out a bit on it every day

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,680
so it will be much easier to understand

94
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
When Swedes talk quickly

95
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,320
Okay. That was my tip for today.

96
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
Hope you benefit from it.

97
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Keep training Swedish

98
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,140
And then we will see you again soon.

99
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,260
Thanks so much. Bye!
