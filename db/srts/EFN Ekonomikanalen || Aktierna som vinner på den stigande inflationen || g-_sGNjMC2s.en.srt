00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Everyone who knows something about economics knows that too high inflation means disaster ...

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,560
... for the economy.
 We tell you what shares you should have in inflation.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,120
In inflation, the price of everything from material to wages rises.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,120
This leads to increased costs for companies.
 So what should they do then?

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,880
Well, raise their own prices.
 But then they can lose their customers.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,560
An example: A hamburger chain sells expensive burgers and increases prices.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,200
Finally, customers say: "SEK 250 for a burger is too much."

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,480
Cooking one at home becomes much cheaper.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,800
But a grocery store chain that raises prices retains customers-

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,920
-For we must have food, and probably other grocery stores have equally high prices.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,760
Normally, companies with large loans are doing well.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,440
We take a real estate company with high indebtedness.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,480
In inflation, prices for everything, including housing, increase.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,200
And the loan becomes diluted.
 But high inflation often leads to higher interest rates.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,600
And with higher interest rates, interest costs can rush.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,080
The danger is that the little positive inflation ger-

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,760
-Drinks in the big negative, when interest costs rush.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,720
Otherwise, producers of basic goods can often do well.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,640
As mining or energy companies.
 Their costs also increase-

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,000
-But we must have materials and energy, even when prices are raised.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,480
So getting the money from the consumer becomes easy.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Now you have control over which shares can handle high inflation well.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,080
Good luck.
