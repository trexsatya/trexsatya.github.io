1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:07,640
The Middle Ages got its name because it is seen as a middle period.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,440
The dull transport route between times that really matters.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,720
A time of darkness and decay when people died like flies.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,480
A thousand years of boring, but is that true? Yes partially.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,640
There are plague epidemics, migrations, war and persecution-

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,040
-But also a flowering time for e.g. agriculture.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,560
Positive things also happen.

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,440
Everything is not black or white, and a thousand years are not a parenthes-

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,880
-So what happened during the Middle Ages, and what was it like to live then?

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,840
Europe's early history can be divided into three eras.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,720
This is in the middle, but how did that name get?

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,480
Which determined that the most characteristic of a thousand years-

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,680
-Where they came between two things?

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:24,200
In the 15th century, when Italian Humanists begin to read antique texts-

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,240
-They decide that they are in a new era.

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,960
The time between antiquity and this new time-

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,560
-Doice as a boring period that you have now come across.

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,760
It begins when the Empire of Rome falls-

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,640
-And ends when Christofer Columbus arrives in America.

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:55,120
It starts with the Roman Empire falling, and Europe remains in the ruins.

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,960
There is no longer a central power that holds the continent together.

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,480
There is still a fragmented world with a lot of small kingdoms.

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,280
The kingdoms cannot hold up all the Roman Empire has done.

24
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,320
The roads decay and trade decreases.

25
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,080
There will be less kingdoms and cities and worried.

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,960
The early Middle Ages is a bit like going into a foreign landscape.

27
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,240
World trade decreases dramatically, and with that money economy.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,240
Without the Roman tax system, the kings are becoming poorer.

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,480
Many people move out into the countryside and become self -sufficient.

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,800
There is still a solid foundation to lean on - and have around your neck.

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Here I have a cross, and it shows that we are Christians during the Middle Ages.

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,360
The church governs the entire life of man, from the cradle to the grave.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Religion is always present, and one should be reminded of it.

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,400
The church remains as a unifying kitt-

35
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,000
-For a politically divided Europe that is still connected culturally.

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,080
The church makes sure to preserve the Latin language-

37
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,680
-And the organization of the church extends over several kingdoms.

38
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,360
But a period of cold and humid climate leads to malnourish and starvation

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,400
-and that's not even the worst.

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,440
They suffer from a bulge. The first proper pandemic.

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,080
The Justinian plague harvests 25 million lives.

42
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,880
The church is given a very great meaning-

43
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,120
-For the church can explain all the evil.

44
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,040
Why is it starvation and illness?

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,320
Religion was nothing that just took place in the head or heart.

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,400
It was part of society. They thought about society as a Christian.

47
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Church is the only strong organization-

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,880
-And becomes one of the strongest powers in Europe.

49
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,880
For the weak kings, the church becomes crucial to regain power.

50
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,960
One who allies with the church is Karl the Great.

51
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,520
He inherits the huge France of his father, Pippin the little one.

52
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,800
It turns out that Karl is a cheer on expanding his rich-

53
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,680
-But it is not easy to check and administer.

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,640
He needs a lot of soldiers.

55
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,480
It is important that they stay faithful, so he gives them land.

56
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,000
In this way he creates Countesses in his kingdom

57
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,680
-When a way to administer the kingdom.

58
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,880
Karl's solution leads to a whole new social system: the feudal community.

59
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,080
But how does it work?

60
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,800
The king, as the church proclaimed king of God's grace, governs over an area-

61
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,480
-But he lacks money and soldiers, so he splits his land.

62
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,280
The areas are granted - they are given to great men who swear a loss of allegiance.

63
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,640
They also have to pay with surplus from agriculture and assist with soldiers.

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,920
Those who work on agriculture are farmers who do not own their land.

65
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,120
The feudal community is often illustrated with a pyramid, but that is to simplify.

66
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,000
A woman loudly up-

67
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
-Can have more in common with a peasant woman than her husband.

68
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,320
There are village teams and Gillen.

69
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,440
Organizations that are not hierarchical.

70
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,760
Everyone has a place and sees themselves as part of a unit.

71
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,680
In Sweden, we are far from this.

72
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,880
While the rest of Europe has the Middle Ages, we are still in the Viking Age.

73
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,720
On Europe's coasts, the Viking ship spreads fear.

74
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,520
You plunder, promise protection and shop.

75
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,840
In this way, the Vikings are an expression of a community form-

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,120
-Or serves as sea -borne kingdoms, with control of different land areas.

77
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,640
The Vikings are dependent on water-

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,760
-And much of their success lies in their ship technology.

79
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,880
Man draws up a method of producing very thin table plank-

80
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,640
-So that it becomes light, basic ship.

81
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,920
You have sails that have taken years to produce.

82
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,800
In the 11th century Sweden enters the Middle Ages-

83
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,040
-When we follow the rest of Europe and embrace Christianity.

84
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,880
The king Olof Skötkonung is baptizing, and the old Asa gods are phased out.

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,840
But how much does life change?

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,080
The big change is that one does not burise at home at the yard-

87
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,280
-Outan begins to bury their dead in consecrated soil at a church.

88
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,560
Christianity becomes a long process that makes us similar to the rest of Europe-

89
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,560
-And in that community there are these: the knights.

90
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,120
The knights are professional soldiers who fight for those who pay.

91
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,440
They dominate on the battlefields-

92
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,000
-But of farmers and the church they are not so popular.

93
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:12,080
Farmers were ruined when the knights had large tower games on their land.

94
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,800
The church long sees the knights as gangsters.

95
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,800
Then you realize that you are dependent on them as a police force and bodyguards-

96
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,280
-So you accept the armed knights.

97
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,600
The church has a problem that the knights can help them with.

98
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,920
In the Arabian Peninsula, Muhammad has been given a revelation.

99
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,160
Within very briefly, Islam is expanded and takes over the entire Arabian peninsula-

100
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,360
-And also expands to Europe.

101
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:51,360
When Islam spreads like this, you become next door to Christian Western Europe.

102
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,400
It has several consequences, and it leads to conflicts.

103
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,280
The Muslims have conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.

104
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,680
In 1095, Pope Urban II holds a sermon.

105
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:14,080
His call is clear: "Get to and free Jerusalem."

106
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:19,240
He promised that those who participated in the war and dog-

107
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
-Whell come straight to heaven.

108
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,600
At the Pope's request, the first crusade to Jerusalem-

109
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,040
-And begins the first Holy War in the Church's name.

110
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,320
The crusade idea is that it is a defense war.

111
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,360
You want to defend Christianity and take back Christian areas.

112
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,240
After the loss of the Holy Land, the Church must bring people-

113
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,840
-In the struggle to take it back from the Muslims.

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,680
The crusades are a war against the enemies of the church-

115
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
-Which gives forgiveness for your sins.

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,680
But for Christians it is a sin to kill someone.

117
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,920
Why can people suddenly imagine breaking one of the commandments?

118
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,480
The main explanation is mental. They tried desperately to remove a shame.

119
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,760
Everyone sins in some way.

120
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,600
Had one killed their mother-in-law, which happened-

121
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,120
—kind the Grandma who made it-

122
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,240
-In seven years go around to the churches in the diocese and ask for forgiveness.

123
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,040
They didn't like it, but you could get bred and replace the confession-

124
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,680
-mot that e.g. danger on crusades, and it was much more fun.

125
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,760
For a hundred years, crusades go in Europe-

126
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,440
-To recover what has been Christian.

127
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,480
After the conquest of Jerusalem 1099, the crusades grow into idea.

128
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,480
Just two years later, a crusade is conducted in Spain-

129
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,240
-In the same way as Jerusalem.

130
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,680
At the end of the 13th century, Jerusalem falls back under Muslim control.

131
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,000
In connection with this, the crusade time is over.

132
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,560
That cold, dark Europe with plague - forget it.

133
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,920
It finally gets warmer, and the sun shines over the population.

134
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,800
One grows on new soils, the population grow-

135
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,560
-And now we are in the Middle Ages.

136
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,840
The foreign landscape in the ruiner-

137
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,440
-Have rose from the ashes and grown steadily.

138
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,520
With the Middle Ages, new inventions come within agricultural-

139
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,760
-like the in -depth plow and horse shoe.

140
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
It gives a surplus in agriculture.

141
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,200
It promotes trade, so more people move to the cities.

142
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,840
The cities are now making grand comebacks.

143
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,080
Everywhere communities emerge, and there is money again in the flow.

144
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,720
Pompous cathedrals are built, and the first universities are founded.

145
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,240
Inside the city walls you will find everything.

146
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,560
Something on your feet? Go to the shoemaker.

147
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,760
Do you need a bowl? Find a potter.

148
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,960
With all the objects of the Middle Ages you come close to the people.

149
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,960
This barrel was at home with someone.

150
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,640
In this casserole, which you just see the paw, have someone cooked.

151
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,720
We are Catholics and fasting.

152
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,840
Then you ate fish, a little more fish and maybe even more fish.

153
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,600
Then we must define “fish”-

154
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,120
-And, according to the Middle Ages, it was an animal in the water.

155
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,920
Therefore, you could eat beaver and seals.

156
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,960
In order to sell fish, the merchant must into the city-

157
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,440
-As has a lot of different rules.

158
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,400
You organize and decide who is allowed to perform crafts and shop.

159
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,520
There is no free market economy.

160
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,720
Despite rules, life is now at its best on the Middle Ages-

161
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,440
-With flourishing city life, beaver in the stomach and existing trade.

162
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,240
But don't shout hello until you're over the creek.

163
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,440
As the population increases, there is competition for work and land.

164
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,320
Many may grow where there are no good harvests.

165
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,960
In some places it is malnutrition, and the population decreases.

166
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,160
And then comes the killing: the death of the poet.

167
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,160
1347 is the plague back.

168
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,520
Venice is first affected by the disease, and no one is left untouched.

169
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,120
Listen to this contemporary poem by Italian Francesco Petrarca.

170
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,480
No cheerful noises.

171
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,040
People wonder why they suffer from horrors.

172
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,000
The obvious explanation is-

173
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,600
-That the God who rule over the universe is twisted on the people.

174
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,120
We are sinful, and this is some kind of punishment.

175
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,240
In some villages 80 % of people die.

176
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,880
A total of 30-40 million people die in Europe.

177
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,800
You have to remember that you were used to different types of threats to life.

178
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,680
Other diseases and work were also very dangerous.

179
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,760
The expectations of living long were not so high.

180
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,640
Some who get better are the farmers who survive.

181
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,880
The fields are empty and have never been so cheap.

182
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,120
Farmers can buy their own land and break away from their feudal lord.

183
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,800
Others also break away from the feudal system: the kings.

184
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,520
To raise money, they dust off the old Roman tax system.

185
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,200
With the tax system, the king can tax more.

186
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,800
It creates an improved administration and richer royal power

187
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:59,080
-As can increase their power over the people and expand over other kingdoms.

188
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,560
With that, the feudal community begins to loosen up.

189
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,600
About then Columbus gets out on the open sea-

190
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,400
-And it is seen as the end of the Middle Ages.

191
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,800
Now the millennial historical bracket is over.

192
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,320
There was a great deal of darkness during the Middle Ages a thousand years-

193
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
-But it has not always been seen as a transport route.

194
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,080
In the 19th century, the Middle Ages were something you were interested in.

195
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,720
It was seen as a time-

196
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,240
-There were ideals in society and a community.

197
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,840
The Middle Ages take place in Europe, but outside happens equally important things.

198
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,600
In China, the song dynasty and then the Ming Dynasty lead the country.

199
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:56,640
There, the compass and letterpress are invented, something that becomes crucial for Europe.

200
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,960
In the Arabian Peninsula, Islam brings a huge development of knowledge-

201
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,840
-In medicine, astronomy and mathematics.

202
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,800
How, then, can we know all this?

203
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,800
It's a bit like a puzzle. You have to have many pieces in place.

204
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:22,760
There are raged house walls, fireplaces and clothes that people have had.

205
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,800
When you pull up posts in long houses they can smell tar-

206
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:34,280
-For they have impregnated them for them to last longer.

207
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,360
However, we do not need to pull up posts to find traces of the Middle Ages.

208
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,000
It is a basic period for the most part in our society.

209
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,640
City life - the urban - is a medieval invention.

210
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,160
As we walk in an old town, along crooked, winding streets-

211
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,120
-To we walk in the footsteps of our medieval predecessors.

212
