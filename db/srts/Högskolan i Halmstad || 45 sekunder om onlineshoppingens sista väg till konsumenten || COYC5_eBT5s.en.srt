Hi, I am Vaike Fors-

2
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,565
-I'm a Professor of Design Ethnography
here at Halmstad University.

3
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,956
I'm going to tell you a bit more
about the project GREEN-LOG.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,829
Come with me into the elevator
and I will tell you more.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,489
Have you ever purchased anything online?

6
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:34,916
Imagine all the logistics
behind getting that product-

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
-from the producer to your kitchen table.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,000
In Project GREEN-LOG we are 29 partners
 in ten countries-

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,200
-and with a 6.3 million EU contribution
we are going to implement- 

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,267
-really innovative
last mile delivery solutions-

11
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,600
-that are completely sustainable.

12
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:56,906
Halmstad University researchers
are in this project-

13
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,326
-to help five cities
to establish living labs.

14
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:05,036
And those living labs will also do
co-creation activities together-

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,975
-with stakeholders
and citizens in these areas.

16
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:11,905
And we are also going
to facilitate trading zones between those.

17
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,110
We are designing with people,
not only for them.
