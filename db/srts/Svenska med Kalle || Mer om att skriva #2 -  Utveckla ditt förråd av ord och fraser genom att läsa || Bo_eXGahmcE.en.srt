Hello Hello

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,145
I was going to keep talking a little about

3
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:09.475
how to improve one's writing

4
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,745
and in the last movie I did about it

5
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:15,885
So I talked a little more big about that

6
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,395
Writing is about thinking

7
00:00:18,705 --> 00:00:21,735
and discuss, both discuss with

8
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:24,775
self and discuss with others so

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,755
To write better so you need to be curious

10
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:30,265
on the world and so to speak

11
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:33,285
develop your thinking too, not

12
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:34,445
Just your language

13
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:38,095
In this movie I will try to go into a little more on

14
00:00:38,095 --> 00:00:40,455
The language part then

15
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:43,605
If one thinks of yourself

16
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,495
the language you need to

17
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,975
able to express your thoughts in a good way

18
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,615
And then I don't think exactly

19
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:57.025
on grammar and order and such things

20
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:00.075
Without liters more how

21
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:02,775
one should find and learn

22
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:05.725
a language that one can use when one

23
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:06,725
Writes

24
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:08.425
and

25
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,105
A good goal

26
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,115
a simple and good goal to have

27
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:18,115
When writing a text, it is to

28
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:20,865
The one who reads the text should not

29
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:24,095
at all need to think or be

30
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26.535
unsure what you mean

31
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:30,265
so especially if you write any type

32
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,345
by investigative or debate

33
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:36,245
or accounting

34
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:39,365
text and so on

35
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,355
informative text in the school, ie one such

36
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:45,155
academic or formal text

37
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:48,395
Then I think a good goal is

38
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:51,345
that the reader should have as easily as possible

39
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,105
To understand your thought

40
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:57,205
And it is not always easy to write

41
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:59,385
so that it is completely

42
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00.795
clearly what one means

43
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:04,765
okay and how to then

44
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:07.915
get better at this to express their thoughts

45
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:11,095
Well you need exactly

46
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,375
right word

47
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,555
one needs many different words

48
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:18,665
and expressions of expressing one's

49
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,165
thought exactly

50
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:23,125
So then you need to learn it
