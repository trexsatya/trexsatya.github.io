1
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,000
My absence started in nine, but it was still okay to

2
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,240
one in high school.

3
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,240
Then I was at home at 85 %.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,119
My schooling has been like a roller coaster before.

5
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:45.560
During middle school there was a little on and off with

6
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,520
absence and presence.

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,759
It was more in high school as things really happened

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,679
With my absence.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,200
Because that's when I felt less safe in school and I

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,960
Started sitting at home and I played.

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,719
And I turn around the clock which of course makes one not

12
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:02,280
going to school.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,079
What was most difficult in school was that there was so much sound

14
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09.120
And so much impression and so long days all the time.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13.519
We sought help all the way from me began the seven, but they said

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,280
Just that it is puberty, you are tired, you are a girl.

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,799
Then it is like that.

18
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,480
But we knew that the symptoms of ADD existed, and that it goes in

19
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,439
The family and such.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,480
So I got my diagnosis in November 2021,

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,719
first year of high school.

22
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,439
It was a big school, there were a lot of people and I felt

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,040
That I had no support.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,760
There are no rules for how to, how to behave

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42.560
yourself at lunch or who you can sit with.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,719
And I thought it was difficult, learning it myself.

27
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,480
What was hard for me when it was to be able to even get out of bed

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,280
It took such power so it was not possible to go

29
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:54,840
to school.

30
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,680
I was very stressed by all performance anxiety and all

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,599
that all the time and feel every day that I needed

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,359
do my best.

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03.040
And if I failed one day then the whole could

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920
the future be over.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,480
Type.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,799
The school didn't understand me at all.

37
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,759
There was no understanding from their direction.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,159
There was no adjustment from their direction.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,439
It wasn't that they wanted to sit down and talk

40
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,000
with me.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,120
But what really happens?

42
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,080
The time I was at school, it was.

43
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,120
There was nothing adapted to me at all.

44
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,080
I had a very messy class and everything was messy.

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,759
I had needed the teachers to listen to me and

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,520
actually believed that I could also be right and not

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,280
Just themselves.

48
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,599
Less class, definitely.

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,960
It is kind of the first thing I think about.

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,080
Smaller classrooms, not so large classes,

51
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,479
More people or others may have similar problems as I do.

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,439
Because I think that would help.

53
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,400
Then you understand each other better.

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,199
What I would have liked from school is understanding that they

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,120
Just would have realized that something is wrong.
