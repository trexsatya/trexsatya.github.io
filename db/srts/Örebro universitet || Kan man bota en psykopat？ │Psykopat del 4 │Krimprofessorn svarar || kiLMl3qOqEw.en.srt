1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,520
Can you treat people with psychopathy?

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,080
My name is Henrik Andershed and I am a professor of criminology and

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,220
Psychology at Örebro University.

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,860
In this section, we will talk about the incredibly important question:

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Can we treat and prevent psychopathy?

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,400
These are people who do not apply for psychiatry and say:

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Hi, I think I have psychopathy.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,880
It is probably that many people with psychopathy do not have a feeling of illness.

9
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,620
The people I have met primarily in the Prison and Probation Service.

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,820
And where they have received a psychopathic diagnosis.

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,060
Should I guess that 9 out of 10 of the cases are very surprising.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,920
And don't feel at home in that description either.

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,180
It says that there are quite often people who fail in insight.

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,840
If you fail in insight, you do not think you have the problem.

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,260
Then you also do not think that you have the need for treatment.

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,520
First, we must probably clarify what we mean when we say:

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,920
Can we treat psychopaths?

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,380
Do we mean that we should cure them from psychopathy.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Make them feel empathy.

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,160
Make them less impulsive.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
Make them lie less.

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,540
Can we change a 35-year-old person who has done this all his life

23
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,780
To begin to feel empathy?

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Is that we mean?
 That we should cure psychopathy ourselves?

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,500
Or do we mean by treatment that we should

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,780
Ensure that people who come in criminal justice and forensic psychiatry

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,380
which we find to have psychopathy does not relapse in crime.

28
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,260
Should we work with behavior change?

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,280
Ok, you might have psychopathic personality

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,820
But we do not want it to have these consequences.

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,320
There are two potentially quite different approaches

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,500
And focus in treatment.

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,920
Cure the disorder itself or perhaps accept

34
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,440
disturbance but work with behavior instead.

35
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,560
To get the person not to commit crimes.

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
What has been seriously tested in research.

37
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,020
That is if you can reduce relapse in crime.

38
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,840
Among people with psychopathy compared to people who do not have psychopathy.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,480
The answers we get there are: It seems pretty problematic.

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,000
For quite a number of years it was said that it is not possible.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The best thing we can do is lock them in.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,600
We hear that quite often in the media that this is how it is.

43
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,280
I would like to say that it is not a correct picture of what we can show in research.

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,760
There is absolute reason for cautious optimism that we can do something.

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,160
There are studies and you have references down here in the section description

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,400
that shows that we can reduce violence and crime

47
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,960
Among these people.

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
So far, we get in no huge effects.

49
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,660
But it also does not get on criminal non-psychopaths.

50
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,440
I think we can develop methods that can do this pretty well,

51
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,860
What you do in the methods is that you work quite a lot with the risk factors for crime

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,860
Among people with psychopathy.

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,900
One is not working so much to change the psychopathic core

54
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
in the person necessarily.

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,720
If you abuse alcohol.
 Work on the abuse.

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,200
If you have problems in the labor market.
 Work on it.

57
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Known risk factors for crime.

58
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,720
Can we reach psychopathic individuals with that type of treatment?

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,720
It seems pretty difficult.

60
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,380
You are manipulative, grandiose etc.

61
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,640
You may use the treatment.

62
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
We see such examples, absolutely.

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,340
We see that it is often excluded from treatment programs because they do not take care of themselves.

64
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,900
I'm not saying it's problematic.

65
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:55,140
But that it would be impossible we have shown that it is probably not.

66
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,340
If we see that treatment is problematic.

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,340
Maybe not impossible.

68
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,340
What about the question then:

69
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,340
Can we prevent psychopathy?

70
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,100
Can we make it not develop?

71
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,780
When we see that something is going on at an early age:

72
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,780
Can we steer it away?

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Can we steer it away with good parenting?

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,600
Or with other support.

75
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,240
And here is research.

76
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,840
Among other things, research from Örebro University

77
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Who has started to find out this.

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
We study this and so do many others

79
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Researchers in other countries as well.

80
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,060
We try to find out how early you can measure these personality traits.

81
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,060
And psychopathy's risk factors.

82
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,660
How early in life we can measure it?

83
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,740
And we seem to be able to measure it as early as the age of three.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
What we want to do with that research is:

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,460
What are the most important risk factors for adult psychopathy?

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,620
To be able to identify those children early and help them.

87
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,520
It is definitely not about stamping children and calling them psychopaths.

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,420
Without it is about seeing early risk indicators.

89
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,420
Can we then help those children.

90
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
For example, it may be that we see in a child that there is a lot of lack in empathy.

91
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,560
And we also see that it can relate to being very aggressive.

92
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,820
Now we have a problem that could be manifested over time

93
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,280
and stables in the individual and develop further into other problematic behaviors.

94
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,340
And maybe actually develops psychopathy.

95
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,280
So then the question will be: Can we work with empathy?

96
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,200
Can we work with empathic ability?

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,440
And maybe other psychopathic traits such as impulsivity.

98
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,080
In early age.

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Can we do it in preschool age?

100
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,660
And there are studies that indicate that we can probably do it.

101
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,180
It seems we can work with perspective -taking

102
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
And other things that have to do with empathic ability.

103
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,780
It seems that we can work on this to inhibit.

104
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,780
When you get very angry.

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
That it does not fall into a act of violence.

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,820
That you can learn to inhibit and control yourself.

107
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,020
And it is promising to prevent psychopathy.

108
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,960
That research is in its infancy and there are a number of studies that are promising.

109
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,420
But to have entire pre -built and preventive programs for this.

110
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
We're not there yet.

111
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,020
What to do if you think your child has this kind of

112
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Personality traits and problems?

113
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,260
The first is that it is not about this.

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,180
We have talked about that before.

115
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,760
There may be other similar problems that look like these features.

116
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,040
It may also be that you have individuals of these features.

117
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,820
That is, you may be very impulsive or shortcomings in empathy.

118
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,000
Thus, individual psychopathy -like features.

119
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,460
It is not psychopathy.

120
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,960
Then the individual features can be problematic.

121
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,940
If they are related to physical aggressiveness.

122
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,000
Or other threateningness.
 Or whatever it may be,

123
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,460
I still think the advice should be if you worry so much

124
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,440
If you see that it can lead to problems for the child.

125
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,660
And maybe it already does.

126
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
Then I think you can seek help.

127
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,160
You can start by seeking help in child and adolescent psychiatry.

128
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,980
So they can certainly help you further.

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,960
Thank you for being with us today.

130
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,880
Like if you think what we do is good.

132
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
This is the series about crime.

133
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Where we seriously talk about crime.

134
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,000
It is important that we give nuanced images of crime.

135
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,720
Instead of what happens in your information flows every day.
