Hello everyone!

2
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:09,674
Today is Friday.

3
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:16,026
It was my last day of work.

4
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:21,149
Now I'm free. I'm on holiday.

5
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:25,211
What have I done today?

6
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:28,246
I worked first.

7
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:31,713
I worked in the morning.

8
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:35,889
I worked in the afternoon.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,059
Then the children came home from kindergarten.

10
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:46,512
It was their last day in kindergarten.

11
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,363
It was warm.

12
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,713
We grilled sausages.

13
00:00:53,717 --> 00:00:57,403
We ate sausages with bread.

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,693
a sprinkler

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,588
Kids love to play with the sprinkler.

16
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:13,716
They played and laughed.

17
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:15,824
They had fun.

18
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:20,479
I've baked a cake.

19
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,805
a strawberry cake.

20
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,604
It stands in the fridge.

21
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:31,129
Why did I bake a cake?

22
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:37,184
My daughter Arina turns one tomorrow.

23
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,370
She is 6 years old.

24
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:45,604
Tomorrow we will eat cake for breakfast.

25
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,227
Do you want to see?

26
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:44,170
We have to pump!

27
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:56,656
We'll be cycling, the whole family.

28
00:02:56,817 --> 00:03:00,092
We will cycle to Sigtuna.

29
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:30,072
They fish.

30
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:32,184
Look, they're sitting and fishing.

31
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,549
Now we cycle home again!

32
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:32,612
Thank you so much for looking at the short vlog.

33
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:37,472
See you in the next video! Bye!
