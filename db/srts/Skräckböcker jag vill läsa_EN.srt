00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:12,000
  Hi, Elza here from Elza's bookshelf. It is October, which is the type of Halloween horror month and I am very hungry for horror books.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
  I thought I would ... On Goodreads they have listed type 66 of the most beloved horror books in the last three years.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
  I have gone through that list and thought I should tell you what books I am very curious to read.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
  Because I'm a little craving for fear, I feel. So we go through that list, I think, and then you hear some of those books.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
  I have ... I saw in that list that I have type ... The majority of those books are in my goodreads list that I want to read.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
  So we shouldn't go through everyone, but maybe top five, top six? Yes, as I really want to read. And of course I want to hear your thoughts on those books.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
  The first one I think of and that has several books in this list is T. Kingfisher. He has books like A House with Good Bones,

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
  The Twisted Ones, The Hollow Places are just three of the books I know I really want to read him.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:18,000
  And I know they should be mild, horror, a lot of atmosphere and the one I think I will start with, The House of Good Bones I think,

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
  Where it is about a mother ... yes, or daughter, son whose mother says it is ghosts in my house and then you find out a lot of things.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
  Yes, with a little mild, atmospheric horror, I like that. So here we have a book that I have on my TBR too, which I really want to read for a long time,

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
  And that's The Sundown Motel of St. James, Simone St. James. After all, I have read two other books from her and liked her very much.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
  And she also has this atmospheric horror, where you like mysterious ghost stories, where you kind of, is it really ghosts or what is I reading for something,

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
  And this one should be really good. Another writer that I am very curious about and whose one of the books I am just about to start, and it is Grady Hendrix.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
  I have just started how to sell a haunted house. It is the next book we will read in the book club and I am so peppy.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:22,000
  He is the one who has written a horrors. It is this book anyway, that is type IKEA catalog, it feels like.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
  He has several books that I have on my TBR that I really want to read, and I will finally start my first Hendrix, so I'm so peppy on it.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
  Then we have a sci-fi horror, Dead Silence, by Barnes something, and look at the cover, I just love it and it is included on this list as well,

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
  And I'm super happy when I saw this one. So the one, I don't really know what it is about except that you are out in space simply,

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
  And the sci-fi took over, so I am bad at reading although I like it. So here, this combination I think is perfect for me.

21
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
  A pictures too, such a horror that was included on this list which is also a book I want to read.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
  So, I don't really know what it is about more than it is a child, a boy, there are pictures, not so ...

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
  It should be unpleasant, it is good looking, like atert, and seems to be very, very good.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
  Just the cover and the feeling it gives me seems to be a book for me. So we'll see.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,000
  The only good indians by Stephen Graham Jones I have heard very well, and it should also be such a book that is uncomfortable.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
  Like this kind of thing, atmospheric horror. Should it be a little disgusting too? I don't know, but I've heard incredibly well about this one.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
  And it is also such a book that just climbs up in my TBR that comes closer and closer that I really want to read and grab it.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
  I don't know who has read it, but I think I've heard several pieces that have read and liked it.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
  So now we have two. In this list I found two books that are like Latin American feeling.

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
  And one of those I've had for a long time is Mexican Gothic. Check out how good it is.

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
  Yes, it is very cover. You know how I am. I like cover. Scary covers, stylish covers.

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
  And here we have a really, really nice cover that really attracts me.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
  And that it is such a Mexican, South American horror or mysticism I like. And this seems great.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
  And another who was in this one like I had not seen before and who makes me very exciting.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
  House of Hunger. And this vampire books.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
  A book that I also found here that I had forgotten that I had put last year more clearly when I put it in.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
  And it's The Book of Accidents by Chuck Wending. It should also be some kind of dysfunctional family.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
  Past present. Yes, but it should be uncomfortable.

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
  That said, I added this last year, April 2022, and had totally forgotten that it was there.

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
  So now I saw this and it seems very, very interesting. And check the cover as well.

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
  Hello. And of course, all Stephen King that is included in this list is of course an absolute must.

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
  So that goes without saying. So I don't have to say anything.

43
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
  And this book, The Last House on Needles Street by Katrina Ward.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
  I have it when I saw it on the list. But I've heard and seen it like everywhere.

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
  But this is how serial killers, Revenge, Death, A chair Child, all that.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
  I just, wow, this sounds very, very, very good.

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
  I have to say, overall this list is incredibly, incredibly good.

48
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
  I have found a lot of new favorites like that. Or not new favorites, but books that I really want to read.

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
  And all Kingfisher are there, almost everyone I want to read is on this one too.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
  So it was new acquaintance too that I had not really seen so and I am incredibly, incredibly curious about.

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
  One who, a book I want to talk about in this Sundial Katrina Ward again.

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
  And this one was also such a book that I added last year and which I had forgotten.

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
  Check out the cover. I mean, how unpleasant and good looking is it?

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
  I do not get it. This made me fall for this book.

55
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
  Twisty Psychological Horror. So psychological, twisty.

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
  It's just, I have to read it at once.

57
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
  And it has got pretty good and high grades anyway.

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
  So Katrina Ward may be a writer that I should look out for.

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
  Have you read anything from her?

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
  I think this list was so good. Really, really good list at all.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
  For especially me, who is like the craving for terror but don't really know where to start.

62
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
  But I am very happy that I will start on Hendrix books now.

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
  Then I think I should go and take some Kingfisher books.

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
  But this list I thought was so fantastic and I just wanted us to go through it a little neighbor.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
  And I took some books that I'm curious about.

66
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
  I look at the list, that's why I look down and not at you.

67
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
  I don't know, what do you think about horror? Do you get extra sucked now when it is October or do you hate horror at all?

68
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
  I am the one who loves terror and can read horror in April or March, it doesn't matter.

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
  But I feel that this year, October, I have got such a ghostly feeling and I have had a strong suction.

70
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
  So when I saw this list I became like this, thank you so much goodreads, now I'll go through it.

71
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
  And look, and there were many of them like me, it's totally sick, I don't know if you can see, so many of them stand like this

72
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
  Want to Read, Want to Read, that I put it on my goodread list.

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
  I am so flatly curious about what you think about horror at all.

74
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
  The books I have talked about, have you read any of them or are you so curious about them too?

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
  Talk to me in the comments field and we will hear there. We will be visible next week. Take care bye!

76
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
  Bye!
