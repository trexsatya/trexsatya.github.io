1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,480
Want to know a home run?

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,040
I don't think we're alone.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,560
- a grand adventure

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,840
Anchored in ...

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,480
The little man.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,000
- Then we are ready again!

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,760
- it is about both supernatural things

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,640
But it is also about warmth and friendship.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,240
- she lived, hip hip

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,080
Hurray! hurray! hurray!

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,240
- This is such a movie that I wanted when I was growing up.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,680
- We have wanted to create a cinematic experience

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,200
An adventure that one should want to turn off the lamps and sit in the bio darkness to see.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,520
- I think it will be so damn fat!

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,560
- This is a movie that has never been made before.
