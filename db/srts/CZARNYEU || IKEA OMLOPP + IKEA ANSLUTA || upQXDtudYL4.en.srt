00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:17.334
Welcome to the new video on the channel

2
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.767
Today we will deal with LED lighting strips

3
00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:27.200
Circulation LED lists for kitchen

4
00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:34.800
There have been no Ikea products on the channel in a long time, but now that I was in the store I found a campaign (sale) of this model

5
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.221
The default price is around 22 euros

6
00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:47.834
In my opinion it is quite a lot, even if they are real

7
00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:55.500
Ikea has accustomed us at substantial quality at fairly affordable prices

8
00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:59.934
Unfortunately, LEDs from Ikea are quite expensive.

9
00:01:00.404 --> 00:01:04.400
The selling price of these LED strips is approx.
 7 euros

10
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.000
So i bought 2 pieces such orbit led strips

11
00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:20.518
Parameters: 60cm / 300 lm / 5.4W

12
00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:30.858
Two such moldings are enough for me to replace the lighting in the kitchen with new ones above the kitchen counter. Think

13
00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:47.067
However, these strips do not require the more common 12V, only 24V tensions

14
00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:54.500
Cent

15
00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.134
of such power supplies outside Ikea starts from about 10 euros LED, I had to spend on the power supply

16
00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:17.134
The cheapest 24V power supply in IKEA is connecting (cost about 17 euros)

17
00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:27.100
I saved on the strips, and on power supply no longer ....

18
00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:33.634
But I preferred not to waste time adjusting a power supply from another manufacturer (except IKEA)

19
00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:39.067
Thanks to this I can be sure that everything will match

20
00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:42.337
24V power supply.

21
00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:52.243
The effect is limited to 19W

22
00:02:53.448 --> 00:03:04.434
A strip is 5.4 W, so we can operate up to 3 such strips

23
00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:17.700
The power supply is modular, let's

24
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:23.767
Connect the ends of the strips

25
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:44.134
Ikea also has more expensive wireless power supply, but they are definitely more expensive

26
00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:51.434
.
 Then we increase the cost of such installation even more

27
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.134
Therefore, my choice fell on the basic model of the power supply.

28
00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:09.034
It is not a very modern design, rather classic, but it is enough

29
00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:11.585
You can't use the switch

30
00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:22.056
The use of a traditional switch is also not a problem in my opinion

31
00:04:25.914 --> 00:04:27.914
.
 Such a switch is definitely more reliable than control of external servers

32
00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:40.988
The split itself supports the power up to 3A

33
00:04:50.064 --> 00:05:04.059
.
 Remember, however, to limit the power supply to 19W

34
00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:16.299
There is also such information on the packaging.

35
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:20.364
Therefore, we can operate up to 3 such strips.

36
00:05:23.685 --> 00:05:25.685
What will probably interest you is ...

37
00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:28.088
How does such a circulation light up

38
00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:34.294
I will demonstrate it in a moment.
 Let us

39
00:05:35.517 --> 00:05:40.324
See what we get in the sales package.

40
00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:46.662
In addition to the list itself, we also get one

41
00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:56.913
Clip to screw in the cabinets

42
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.544
Screws

43
00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:17.334
included

44
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:26.230
After screwing the guide we can

45
00:06:27.258 --> 00:06:35.200
mount

46
00:06:37.453 --> 00:06:42.522
The list

47
00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:47.467

48
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.458
clips

49
00:06:55.118 --> 00:07:02.748
The

50
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:09.526

54
00:07:39.317 --> 00:07:44.288
is

55
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:52.934
detachable.

However, it turns out that it is completely unnecessary tell

61

In the comments what you think about IKEA leadership offer
