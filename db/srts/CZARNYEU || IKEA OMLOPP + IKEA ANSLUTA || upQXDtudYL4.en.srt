00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:17.334
Welcome to the new video on the channel


2
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.767
Today we will deal with LED lighting strips


3
00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:27.200
OMLOPP LED lists for kitchens


4
00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:34.800
There have been no IKEA products on the channel for a long time, but now while in the store I found a promotion (sale) of this model


5
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.221
The standard price is around 22 Euro


6
00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:47.834
In my opinion, it is quite a lot, although they are solid


7
00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:55.500
Ikea has accustomed us to solid quality at fairly affordable prices


8
00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:59.934
Unfortunately, LEDs from IKEA are quite expensive The


9
00:01:00.404 --> 00:01:04.400
sale price of these LED strips is about 7 Euro


10
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.000
So I bought 2 pieces of such Omlopp LED strips


11
00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:20.518
Parameters: 60cm / 300 lm / 5.4W


12
00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:30.858
Two such The strips are enough for me to replace the lighting in the kitchen with new ones above the kitchen worktop


13
00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:47.067
. Remember, however, that these strips require not the more common 12V, only 24V voltages.


14
00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:54.500
Cents of such power supplies outside IKEA start from about 10 Euro.


15
00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.134
LED, I had to spend on the power supply


16
00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:17.134
The cheapest 24V power supply in IKEA is ANSLUTA (Cost about 17 euro)


17
00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:27.100
I saved on the strips, and on the power supply not anymore ....


18
00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:33.634
But I preferred not to waste time adjusting a power supply from another manufacturer (except IKEA)


19
00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:39.067
Thanks to this I can be sure that everything should match


20
00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:42.337
24V power supply


21
00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:52.243
The power is limited to 19W


22
00:02:53.448 --> 00:03:04.434
One strip is 5.4W, so we can power up to 3 such strips


23
00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:17.700
The power supply is modular, let's


24
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:23.767
connect the ends of the strips


25
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:44.134
IKEA also has more expensive wireless power supplies, but they are definitely more expensive


26
00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:51.434
. Then we increase the cost of such installation even more.


27
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.134
Therefore, my choice fell on the basic model of the power supply.


28
00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:09.034
It is not a very modern design, rather classic, but it is sufficient


29
00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:11.585
You can not use the switch


30
00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:22.056
The use of a traditional switch is also not a problem in my opinion


31
00:04:25.914 --> 00:04:27.914
. Such a switch is definitely more reliable than control by external servers


32
00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:40.988
The splitter itself supports the current up to 3A


33
00:04:50.064 --> 00:05:04.059
. Remember, however, to limit the power supply to 19W


34
00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:16.299
There is also such information on the packaging.


35
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:20.364
Therefore, we can power up to 3 such LED strips.


36
00:05:23.685 --> 00:05:25.685
What will probably interest you is ...


37
00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:28.088
How does such an OMLOPP strip light?


38
00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:34.294
I will demonstrate it in a moment. Let's


39
00:05:35.517 --> 00:05:40.324
see what we get in the sales kit.


40
00:05:43.103 --> 00:05:46.662
In addition to the strip itself, we also get a


41
00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:56.913
Clip for screwing to the cabinets


42
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.544
.


43
00:06:09.358 --> 00:06:17.334
Screws are included.


44
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:26.230
After screwing the guide,


45
00:06:27.258 --> 00:06:35.200
we


46
00:06:37.453 --> 00:06:42.522
can


47
00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:47.467
mount the list with


48
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.458
clips


49
00:06:55.118 --> 00:07:02.748
. It


50
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:09.526
looks


51
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:17.256
much more aesthetic.


52
00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:29.165
Connect


53
00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:37.000
the LEDs .


54
00:07:39.317 --> 00:07:44.288
The


55
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:52.934
plug is detachable.


56
00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:01.483
Connect the power supply . Connect


57
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:07.232
the


58
00:08:08.326 --> 00:08:15.184
LED strips to the distributor


59
00:08:15.806 --> 00:08:19.497
. LED


60
00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:25.000
It turns out, however, that it is completely unnecessary.


61
00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:31.734
Let me know in the comments what you think about the IKEA LED offer.


62
00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.159
Write what your opinion is.
