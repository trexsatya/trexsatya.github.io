1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,600
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,060
We are in Khao Lak, Thailand!

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,420
Today we are going on an excursion to...

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,200
...a waterfall!

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,800
- It will be so cool!
- Yes, and we will take you with us, of course.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,860
But first Harry is going to get braids in his hair.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,300
Yes, because look at Alma!

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,720
- It looks good, right?
- It has even got beads in it.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,580
When Harry saw how nice it looked,
he wanted his hair to look the same.

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,240
Braids first, then we go on the excursion!

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,720
Mom is busy right now with work, so she stayed at the hotel.

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,340
Are you okay with the pearls?

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,800
Only one. I will fix for you.

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,960
One, two, three, four, five, six...

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,860
- Does it hurt?
- Mhm.

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,980
When they braided my hair I got ticklish all over.

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,580
But I was kind of scared to scratch it
because I didn't know if I was supposed to or not.

18
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,280
It was kind of hard.

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,500
It's almost done, Harry.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,660
Am I done now?

21
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,400
Just a few more beads.

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,680
Wow!

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,040
- Do you like it?
- Mhm.

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,900
Let's take a look.

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,440
Bye bye!

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,400
- Bye bye, thank you!
- Bye bye!

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,820
Bye bye!

28
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,020
Oh, it looks so cool!

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,860
He looks so good!

30
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,780
It must feel so good to get your hair out of your face!

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,120
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen!

32
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,500
- Guys, our taxi is here so let's go!
- Okey-dokey!

33
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,860
Nice car! It's blue.

34
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
It's really hot today! Yesterday was 34°C (93°F).

35
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,980
- I'm guessing it's about as hot today.
- Mhm.

36
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,860
It's hot no matter where you are. Inside, outside, it's just...

37
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,860
- I'm hoping for some branches and shade.
- Yes.

38
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,160
What are you two chatting about?

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,360
- He's saying that marshmallows can bite really hard.
- What kind of marshmallows do that?

40
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,160
- In a movie.
- I see.

41
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,260
This heat has knocked our kids out.

42
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,740
Now to get them to wake up...

43
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,320
Oh, asleep?

44
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,040
- Baby is sleeping?
- Yeah, baby is sleeping.

45
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
...to you. ♪

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,860
♪ Happy Birthday, Dear Alma ♪

47
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,380
♪ Happy Birthday to You! ♪

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,160
It's so cute that people keep calling Harry a baby.

49
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
"Baby sleep?"

50
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,340
It is always good to have some dried fruit on hand
for when the kids are tired.

51
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,320
- May I eat it?
- Yes, you may.

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,400
- How are you, Almis?
- Fine.

53
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,920
- Are you ready for a 1.5 km walk? (1 mile)
- Yes!

54
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,380
This road is pretty cool.
You can hear the water on this side...

55
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,860
Maybe you can even see it?

56
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,660
- Oh, God! You wouldn't want to fall here!
- Oh! Oh, be careful! Whoa!

57
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,360
Okay, that was a huge steep...

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,080
On this side the vegetation is very dense.

59
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,360
- Do you know what that means, Alma?
- Jungle!

60
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,400
Yes, but... "vegetation"; lots of greenery.

61
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,380
- Jungle!
- Yes, it is a jungle.

62
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,700
Oh look, it's so beautiful!

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,820
Is it okay walking in sandals, Alma?

64
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,640
Well...

65
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,540
It's like...

66
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,940
It...

67
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,600
It's not completely...

68
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,420
...fine, but...

69
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,300
- To be honest I don't have any other shoes.
- Why not?

70
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,920
I have outgrown them!

71
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,060
- All of your shoes?
- Yep!

72
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,780
- If you think it's hot, raise your hand!
- Yes!

73
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,420
- Yes!
- Yes!

74
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,180
The heat is pressing despite all the branches and leaves.

75
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,400
A dip is going to feel so good!

76
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,640
We have arrived at "Level 1".

77
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,860
Well, in another 100 m (328 ft).

78
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,020
- Oh. My. God!
- Oh, look at the bridge!

79
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,120
Good!

80
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:37,320
When you two go back down,
we are going in the waterfall all the way down!

81
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,740
- Look at how big they are!
- I see, can we make them go away?

82
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,260
They are feeding on me! I think it's scary.

83
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,680
- What? Feeding on you? The big fish?
- Yes!

84
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,280
- Oh God...
- I did not enjoy that!

85
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,580
- Are you recording?
- Yes.

86
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,420
Oh, yuk! A big fish nibbled on me!

87
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,340
- Fish spa... in nature.
- But it was like this big...

88
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,080
- This pool wasn't as nice as I thought it would be.
- No.

89
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,140
This "pool" wasn't that nice...

90
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,000
Alma goes first so she has something to fall on.

91
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,100
- Are we going up here?
- Yes, to the next level.

92
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:34,060
Now we will never find our way back...
We will be up here forever.

93
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,480
Oh my God.

94
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,420
There are some people in this pool...
so we will leave.

95
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,300
Yes, let's check out level three.

96
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,340
I'm not that concerned about going higher.
I'm more concerned about getting back down again.

97
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,460
But it would be nice if we could have our own "pool".

98
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,340
- I'm worried about falling.
- Yes, that too.

99
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,920
80 m to level 3 (262 ft).

100
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,780
There are four levels, but I think we will stop at the third level.

101
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,620
The terrain is getting worse.

102
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,000
Wow!

103
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,880
It's so beautiful!
I hope it shows through the camera how cool this is!

104
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,600
Let's get in!

105
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,460
- We can ride it like a water slide!
- No...

106
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,520
Not a single fishie.

107
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,500
Good!

108
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,760
- Do you want a sandwich?
- Yes, please.

109
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,080
The water is flowing all around us!

110
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,580
- Will they even be able to hear us?
- I think they will.

111
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,960
We brought some food with us.

112
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,880
Yummy!

113
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,040
The time is...

114
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,020
You are not wearing a watch, I am...
The time is 4.55 PM.

115
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:05,120
The sun sets at about 6:15 PM. We need to focus on
getting down, so we will pack away the camera now.

116
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,620
- Yes, we can't hold it when we are going back down.
- No, some parts were this steep....

117
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,280
- I'd like to get back down with the kids still alive.
- Yes. See you then!

118
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,500
We made it back down. Look what we found...

119
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,460
They are spa fish! Over here...

120
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,820
Look, they are already here!

121
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,240
Ouch!

122
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,940
- What does it feel like?
- They...

123
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,560
They are chewing!

124
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,060
They're taking bites of my heels!

125
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,200
You could grate my heels like a block of Parmesan...

126
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,720
- Can I see your heels?
- They're like "Oh, Parmesan!".

127
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,920
Here are my heels.

128
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,260
Eww...

129
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,980
"Ewww"!

130
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
Look at this. They are coming right away!

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,320
The Fish Spa was very interesting!
It didn't hurt, but it felt a little weird.

132
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,820
I found it very unpleasant.
I can't understand that people pay for it.

133
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:46,440
- Harry, you dared to put your feet in.
- I put them in super many times, like three times!

134
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,140
Harry is always brave.

135
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,880
Question of the Day is from MOAS VÄRLD, she asks:
"What is the best thing about being away?".

136
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,680
To experience all the experiences.

137
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,560
- Lots of "exper"...
- Yes.

138
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,500
- But I really agree!
- Me too! Do you agree, mommy?

139
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,380
I agree. And to be with you sillybillys!

140
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,540
- Me too. I agree!
- Yes. It's fun!

141
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,040
I like playing with you guys!

142
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,440
- Kiss!
- What about me?!

143
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:26,500
