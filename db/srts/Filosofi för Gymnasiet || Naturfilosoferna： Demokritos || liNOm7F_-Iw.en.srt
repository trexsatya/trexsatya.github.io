00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05.720
The most insightful of the natural philosophers are the so -called atomists,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:14,300
A term aimed primarily on democritos (Ca \ H460-370 \ HF \ HKR) and his teacher Leukippos.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:22,920
They meant that everything is made up of small building blocks they called atoms (Átomon is Greek for indivisible).

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,180
They had noted that everything is slowly due.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,260
Over time, even mountains and stones are worn out of wind and water

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,240
- Thus, seemingly solid objects must consist of less invisible constituents.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,400
The basic question, meant democritos,

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,220
Is how does it come to the same material, plants and animals over and over again?

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,520
Take an oak tree as an example; Each individual tree is perishable,

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,320
But it consists of the same material as all other oaks that ever exist.

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01.560
The properties of the material oak must therefore be descended from something eternal and unchanging,

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05.040
Something that comes from within the material itself.

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08.860
He thought that everything is made up of microscopic atoms

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,440
which hooks into each other purely mechanically through small hooks.

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,760
A material gets its properties from the shape, size and movement of the atoms.

16
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,500
Iron atoms are hard while water atoms are slippery.

17
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,440
Salt atoms are sharp and pointed while aerable atoms are light and swirling.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,020
What properties a thing has been determined by the atoms that build up the object.

19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:38,220
Even the soul consists according to democitosis of atoms, especially smooth, light and rounded,

20
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42.060
which are scattered over the body and dissolved in death.

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,040
These atoms are eternal and unchanging, and exist in an infinite number.

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,580
When a thing is dissolved, the atoms will form new things and materials.

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,280
But Democritos realized that this is not enough to explain the world.

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,980
Had atoms been the only thing that existed, change would not have been possible

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,380
- This is because the atoms did not then have the opportunity to move.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,780
Therefore, the void between the atoms also plays an important role in theory.

27
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,500
This void is something Aristotle would later call "vacuum".

28
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:20,280
Today's modern atomic theory originates from British chemist John Dalton and the beginning of the 19th century.

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,900
Democritos atoms are most recently reminiscent of what we today call molecules

30
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,880
- Thus, a set of atoms that together create a Ting's characteristics.
