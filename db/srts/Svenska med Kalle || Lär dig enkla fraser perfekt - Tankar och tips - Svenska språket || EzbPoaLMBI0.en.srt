00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,280
Hello Hello

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06.320
This will be a short movie I hope

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,100
I recall that I always text my movies so that

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,260
If you turn the text on your mobile or computer

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,420
so can you read what I say at the same time

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,040
I just made a short movie

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26.560
About the phrase: "Where should I ..."

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
There were different examples

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,260
Where you can ask "Where should I ask ....?"

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,960
"Where should I put ....?"

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
"Where should I leave ....?" and so on

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,040
and I was just thinking of reminding that

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,220
a way you can work

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,380
with your pronunciation

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,160
with your understanding too

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,820
and with

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52.640
to become better at talking in general

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,740
It is to learn simple phrases

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,420
as you can use frequently

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,300
so good you can only

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03.860
Try to learn by the way

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,780
Try memorizing

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,460
Try to learn exactly how to say the phrase

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,760
With the right grammar and good pronunciation

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,960
and this video then you can learn

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,180
Beginning: "Where should I .... where should I ...."

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,000
Then comes a verb

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,320
Then maybe it's done, yes an object too

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,480
But really, you just have the beginning, it's very good

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,520
where should I go.....?

31
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,060
For many say they want to be better at talking

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,960
and i think this is a good way

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,660
Learn simple phrases

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,660
finished sentences that you can use

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,820
or parts of sentences

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,620
that you can use

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,360
and try to find things that you can use a lot

38
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,320
and i have quite a few videos now

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,880
where I teach just a little bit

40
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06.060
maybe a sentence or

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,740
some examples with a phrase

42
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,300
you can find many such videos

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,520
by other teachers as well

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,700
And you don't have to watch the whole video without

45
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,220
just take a phrase

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,960
In the video, in the movie

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
As you think is good for you

48
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
listen to it

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,680
many times and try to say it many times

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,280
and then when you

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,920
comes to school or job

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,140
or hits a friend

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,860
so try using this phrase

54
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37.560
for

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,680
every time you can say anything

57
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,160
without thinking after

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,120
without feeling too hard

59
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,100
Then you strengthen your speech mod (speech-mod)

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
your courage to speak

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
your feeling that you can

62
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,860
every time you say anything

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00.100
and that it feels good, it feels simple

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
The other understands what you mean

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,900
Then, what is it called, do you strengthen your self -confidence

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
You strengthen your self -esteem

67
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,620
and an easy way to do that

68
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,120
It is easy

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,640
to learn a sentence or phrase by the outside

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,360
is simple, it's easy, it goes fast

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,100
If you devote three minutes to a phrase

72
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,740
so can you late

73
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,080
so learn step by step

74
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,480
light, useful things

75
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,680
Outside

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So you get a lot of chances to

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,840
to say something

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,740
and it gets absolutely right

79
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,860
and it feels simple

80
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,540
Then you will quickly get ready

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,320
To say more difficult things too

82
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,620
So you can look around a bit, I have ...

83
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,200
Quite a few movies

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,460
where I teach any simple thing

85
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,360
But you can really take any movie

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00.560
and focus on a phrase

87
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02.920
and learn it perfectly

88
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
That was just what I wanted to say now

89
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,140
good luck with the training

90
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09.260
Don't give up, keep fighting

91
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,860
So your Swedish will be better all the time

92
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Have a good one! Bye :-)
