00:00:01,578 --> 00:00:07,626
Hello and warm welcome you should be light Swedish with Oskar.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:15,535
My name is Oskar and I do a podcast called easily Swedish with Oskar.

3
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:17,298
You may have heard it?

4
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:21,253
It's like a fun and easy way to learn Swedish.

5
00:00:21,343 --> 00:00:24,176
You can listen while doing other things.

6
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:34,603
You can listen while you go for a walk, while you wash, while cleaning, while driving, while you go by bus.

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,675
...and so on.

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:42,168
And now I want to try to make easy Swedish with Oskar as video, as well as video,

9
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:45,374
Right here on Youtube.

10
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:50,700
I think it will be fun to try to do something completely new.

11
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:52,864
I can show things,

12
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:55,547
I can ... like ... I exist!

13
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:56,538
...differently.

14
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:58,779
I can show that you sleep, for example.

15
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:00,909
... or whatever it may be.

16
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,000
You can play guitar for example.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,459
And in this first, first clip I want to introduce myself.

18
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:14,582
And I think like this, that you who have listened now ... There are 170 episodes of the podcast, to listen to.

19
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:16,957
You feel pretty good already,

20
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:20,150
But you may not have seen me ever.

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:26,426
And are you brand new here, and have YouTube: that you want to learn Swedish,

22
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:33,308
Yes, then it is also a perfect way to feel welcome and feel that we get to know each other a little.

23
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:36,889
Remember to like and subscribe and you will help me very much.

24
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:43,428
Here it will be filled with materials and content that is used to learn Swedish in a fun way.

25
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:51,276
My name is Oskar Nyström and I am 31 years old.

26
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,559
I live in a small town called Forshaga,

27
00:01:54,559 --> 00:02:00,354
which is located two miles north of another city called Karlstad - a larger city.

28
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,586
20 kilometers north of Karlstad.

29
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:07,393
There is Forshaga and there I live.

30
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,000
... in this house.

31
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:15,796
I live with my fiancee, Amanda, and our two children.

32
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,275
We have twins.

33
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:22,350
Daughters.
 Twin daughters.

34
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:28,401
They turn seven this year.

35
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:35,392
Amanda and I have been together for eight years.

36
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:45,507
... so then you may understand that it went pretty quickly from the fact that we suddenly had two children.

37
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:48,797
They came at the same time.

38
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:53,635
But it has been great and we are very happy together.

39
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,387
We have a lot of fun together.

40
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:00,556
We also have a puppy called Sixten.

41
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:04,122
Sixten is only four months old,

42
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:07,355
And we have had him for three weeks now with us,

43
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,000
So he's brand new.

44
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:14,034
He is brand new in life and brand new to us.

45
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:17,002
None of us have had a dog before,

46
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:22,106
So it's struggling and fun and we love him.

47
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,859
I enjoy playing music.

48
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:31,742
It began as a love for the piano,

49
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:35,118
And then became a love for guitar and such.

50
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:38,714
And now it has also become a job.

51
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:40,657
So I work with playing music.

52
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:44,378
I work on producing music in studio

53
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:46,768
And I play music live.

54
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:49,833
Most guitar and vocals,

55
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:56,139
But also with my band called the Norrskens Orchestra.

56
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:03,515
Last year, in the summer of 2022, I took a motorcycle driver's license.

57
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:07,587
It was a dream come true for me.

58
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:13,400
And I took my driver's license on a Triumph Trident 660.

59
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:17,580
It was an absolutely perfect motorcycle to start.

60
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:22,716
And absolutely perfect to commute with, for example.

61
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:23,808
And like that.

62
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:30,496
But, it was a little too small to take on long holiday trips,

63
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:38,164
And I also felt that it is probably a little too small overall.

64
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:42,669
I wanted a little more huge motorcycle.

65
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,312
You feel, when you are on the highway for example,

66
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,402
That it goes very, very fast.

67
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:57,245
Especially on a small motorcycle like Triumph Trident 660.

68
00:04:57,944 --> 00:04:59,863
And...

69
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:05,718
Last summer we did so, me and Amanda - my fiancee - that we went on a holiday.

70
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:08,639
A motorcycle holiday to Öland.

71
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,542
It is an island on the southeastern part of Sweden.

72
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,471
Very nice.

73
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:21,659
And then we took an old, scruffy ...

74
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:29,057
Old and risky - but big - motorcycle called Honda Deauville.

75
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:32,216
We took it there, and then we noticed that we love this.

76
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:37,573
It was as much fun to go on a motorcycle holiday together.

77
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:44,320
So then I did so I sold both Hondan and my Triumph Trident 660

78
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,698
and bought a Triumph Tiger 900 GT Pro.

79
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:53,430
And it does ... everything as well.

80
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:00,210
I can't imagine a better motorcycle in any category really.

81
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,181
It is absolutely amazing,

82
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:07,235
And on it we will go on a motorcycle holiday this summer again.

83
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:13,103
And I use it to commute, to go out on the weekends, and such.

84
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,228
Riding a motorcycle has become a kind of meditation for me.

85
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:21,577
I can relax.

86
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,858
And just disconnect the thoughts.

87
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,710
And you are just here and now.

88
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:35,760
There is something about sitting outdoors, on a bike as well as ...

89
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:39,616
But that goes very, very fast ...

90
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:46,587
which is very addictive.

91
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:55,955
And the idea of this Youtube channel is, among other things, to take with you on fun trips, and to great places in Sweden.

92
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:57,181
So from the motorcycle.

93
00:06:57,181 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll take you on the motorcycle.
 You sit something like here.

94
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:01,500
And so...

95
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:03,128
are we going.

96
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,018
So I hope you will look forward to it.

97
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:09,144
I also like to read books.

98
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:14,358
Especially fantasy, horror and science fiction.

99
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:16,928
I like playing video games,

100
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:19,749
And I like to watch sports.

101
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:24,446
Football, Hockey, Formula 1, Motogp ...

102
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:25,985
For example.

103
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,881
Handball I think is totally okay too, if Sweden plays like that.

104
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:35,888
And yes!
 In recent years here I have learned Japanese.

105
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,630
I have plugged Japanese from home, on the internet as well,

106
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,032
Quite so diligently.

107
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:47,922
So I know what it's like to learn a new language.

108
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:57,907
And I know pretty well what resources, what materials, what tools you need, such ...

109
00:07:58,248 --> 00:08:05,107
And that, it's a journey that is still going on for me, to learn Japanese.

110
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:10,041
But I also know the joy of understanding more and more,

111
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,000
To find a good routine,

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,852
Finding something that is not super boring, but something you like.

113
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,703
Something fun to do.

114
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:23,578
And it's something I hope and believe this Youtube channel should be able to become,

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And something that I think the podcast easily Swedish with Oskar is already.

116
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:30,827
Actually.

117
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:33,515
I think we got it good.

118
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:37,509
That was a little about me,

119
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:42,281
And I think it will be enough for presentation in this first video.

120
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:49,597
In the next we do some kind of deep dive into a subject,

121
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:50,707
What it can be.

122
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,074
How did it go for you?
 Did you understand everything?
 Did you understand a little?

123
00:08:57,193 --> 00:08:58,318
It's totally okay.

124
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:05,693
If you just understood a little, you can get back to this video in a few weeks

125
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:09,333
And see if you can understand more.

126
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,902
Subscribe so we continue to learn Swedish together simply.

127
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,728
Okay, we'll hear again next time.

128
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:20,318
Bye.
