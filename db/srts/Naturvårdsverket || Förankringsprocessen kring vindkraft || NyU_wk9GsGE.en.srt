1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09.984
You are one of the main authors to it

2
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,312
Chapter in the synthesis report which deals with anchoring.

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,640
What are the most important conclusions there?

4
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,084
The most important conclusions

5
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:20,480
is just that we have to

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,552
press much more on openness and dialog

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,672
Both in permit processes and planning processes

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
Thus, in overview planning for wind power.

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,072
We must have an open posture

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,888
And not dismiss the public's questions as stupid or

11
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45.568
problematic, without truly seeing the value of that

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,592
Get them into the process.

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,200
Where people can feel this I understand, now I understand why

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51.968
The wind turbines should stand here.

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,528
I may not love it, but I understand why.

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57.088
And to be able to answer the question "Why?",

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,392
That's the important thing.

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03.488
Then it is also so that you might not just go out

19
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09.632
And talk to people without having an understanding of their landscape, so you have to do your homework.

20
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,448
A tool to understand the landscape and

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
have something with them in the dialogue,

22
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,521
It is precisely landscape analysis

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
As we press pretty much on the report.

24
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:27.808
Now we are on our way out on a boat trip through Luleå and Kalix archipelago.

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:34,208
It is part of the dialogue -based landscape analysis conducted within the context of

26
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40.608
A permit project for a wind farm on Bergön in Kalix municipality.

27
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
I work as project manager

28
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51.026
At WPD Scandianvia. Today we will focus

29
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:53.068
In the landscape and how we experience it.

30
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59.808
As we entered this project with those

31
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03.017
special conditions in an archipelago

32
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:08,480
where there is a richly moving outdoor life, so we felt that

33
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09.674
This was a good method

34
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,674
in order to

35
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:17,271
Develop a good decision basis. It is also a good shape

36
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,026
for our consultation process

37
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:23,649
where we can cooperate with people

38
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:26,574
found in place, instead of

39
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:27,455
Just use

40
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:29,455
Expert expertise available

41
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:32,010
with our consultants

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,010
at the County Administrative Board

43
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,010
And the municipality

44
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44.608
We are going to do a dialogue -based landscape analysis and we do

45
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46.608
In accordance with the Landscape Convention

46
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:49,119
directive

47
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,119
about how landscape analyzes should be done

48
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,260
And what methods

49
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,673
You can use.

50
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03.808
You have received these compendiums.

51
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04.558
If one browses to

52
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,319
Page three

53
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,444
So you see the tour we are going.

54
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:16,608
The route is laid out so that we can look at Bergön from different

55
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,608
distance

56
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:22,546
And in different contexts. Where there are very small islands around

57
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
And from open bars. On the tour we will

58
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,408
stop and talk a little extra

59
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:35,399
In four different places.

60
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,399
Landscape,

61
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,835
It's not just what we see,

62
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:42,464
Without what we hear, smells, tubes,

63
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48.608
Experiences. We have our own unique

64
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49.862
perspective.

65
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03.712
What did you get out of the boat trip today?

66
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04.736
Good information about the project you want to implement.

67
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
Clear and good information.

68
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,648
We know the area well before. We have had a boat for many years and

69
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,720
visited this island on many different occasions

70
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
So we know the environment very well

71
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
But then to see

72
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
Photo montage,

73
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
how it will be able to look about if you build

74
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
the wind turbines, how it

75
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
will look in reality.

76
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Good information.

77
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,127
You have holiday homes here and wind turbines

78
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
as you see

79
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
already

80
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Today from the house.

81
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
How does it affect you?

82
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Nothing.

83
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
We don't notice it.

84
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
We sometimes see

85
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,799
That it stands still, and says "now it stands still".

86
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Otherwise it is common to

87
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,341
Leisure residents have views on wind power?

88
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,191
I understand that. If you have a very scenic environment,

89
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02.079
Beautiful and nice views. Then I understand that people may react to the fact that there is a wind farm.

90
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03.871
But

91
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05.919
As we experience it so don't have it

92
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07.893
been troublesome for us.

93
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12.831
I think it's been good to get

94
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
look with your own eyes

95
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
these

96
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
The sketches

97
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,135
When it has sketched in

98
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
The intended establishments.

99
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,959
It makes a lot for visual impressions,

100
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,959
and that we got to look

101
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,730
Based on different

102
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,548
distance and understanding

103
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:35,825
because one moves

104
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
In the archipelago for example, which makes

105
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41.801
that it's not like sitting still in a cabin and watching

106
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:47,391
on a fixed vantage point.

107
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
I think it has been very valuable.

108
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53.023
But almost the best I think is that they have chosen

109
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,918
the dialog -based process, so one becomes

110
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:58.943
Invited to that

111
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01.471
partly fill up with knowledge

112
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,525
So that you can have better opinions yourself,

113
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:07.103
but also that man

114
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07.615
may come to speak.

115
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,152
It feels very important.
