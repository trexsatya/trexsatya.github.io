00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,746
Hello all legends!

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:04,665
Hi everyone!
Today it's a new reaction video

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,944
where we react to what you said
last time: near-death experiences.

4
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,696
Shall we do this darling?

5
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:11,958
-Jump?
-Parachute jump.

6
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:14,434
Yes, or...

7
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,387
What just happened? Lord...

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,839
Oh, shit. I thought they
were going to do a trick.

9
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:25,316
They're flying into a plane.

10
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:28,089
Oh, what? He's on the other plane.

11
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:31,482
Oh, shit. I didn't realize it was
that serious with the balloon.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,061
It just crashes. Then you wonder
what's happening with the pilot right now.

13
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:39,738
Yes. Look, there you got
to see it from a different angle.

14
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:42,097
Oh, wow. It's burning and stuff.

15
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:47,076
-There are like seven people in the air.
-It was the plane they were in that broke.

16
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,226
I think it's what they
collide with that breaks.

17
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,951
Okay, is this a car, or?

18
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:55,085
It's an airplane, I think.
I mean, how can one be so stupid?!

19
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,180
-I mean, I'm getting angry.
-Oh, my God!

20
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:02,276
Imagine if he gets hit in the head by that.

21
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:05,847
-I mean, how can the other one not see it?
-What an idiot, really.

22
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:10,914
-But how lucky he is.
-Yes, that luck, guardian angel.

23
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,231
This is just crazy.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But okay.

25
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:18,338
No sharks please. I think it's so scary.

26
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:21,284
Oh, it's a shark.
I would have been so scared!

27
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:26,759
How cool he is.
He just knocked the shark. He hit it.

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,634
Yes, but who wouldn't have done that?

29
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,807
I mean, what a legend!

30
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,021
I mean, he just "Bam"!

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:40,013
I've read somewhere that you
should hit so it feels that it's not...

32
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:43,826
-It's a hammerhead shark, right?
-Yes, it is.

33
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:45,593
I've heard they're quite aggressive.

34
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:47,609
It doesn't want to eat him, does it?

35
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,148
But he might have caught its baby
in the line.

36
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:55,157
No! He must think it was a turtle.
They often think that.

37
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:59,533
-But if he hit it hard...
-A big yellow banana boat is a turtle?

38
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,592
He fights this thing for a long time.

39
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:04,449
Yes, it doesn't give up.

40
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:07,657
It could easily tip his boat.

41
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:08,807
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

42
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,061
Imagine being the one
sitting alone out on the sea.

43
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,870
I would have been so scared.

44
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:17,403
I think this is cool but so scary. Shit.

45
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,690
What's he doing?
Throwing himself off a mountain?

46
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:20,766
Yes, probably.

47
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:25,173
-Go go, dude.
-Okay. Can you just, like...

48
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:26,910
Oh, no, man!

49
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:34,358
Oh, my God! Poor guy. My God.

50
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:37,192
What? How did he survive?
I don't understand.

51
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:40,839
But it's the fall that slows down.

52
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,776
But still.
That must have hurt so freaking much.

53
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,847
Why is that dude just filming?

54
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,696
Oh! What's happening there? Oh, what?!

55
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:53,339
I didn't even see.
Was someone flying into a sign?

56
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:55,837
We'll try to understand what's happening.

57
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:59,704
-Something is coming flying.
-Oh, wow!

58
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,574
It's one of those squirrel suits, I think.

59
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:05,958
Oh, one of those with a flying thing?
I've never understood those.

60
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:07,435
How do you fly those?

61
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:17,184
Shit, I mean. What a freaking...

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,974
Oh, my freaking God!

63
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:25,752
-I mean, that guy!
-Did you see how lucky?!

64
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:27,560
No, ugh, how scary.

65
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:30,585
Can we rewind and watch again?
That was just insane.

66
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:36,053
-Oh, my God.
-That's inches, really. Wow.

67
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:39,636
Inches? He probably hit the car,
but made it really well.

68
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,093
Ouch. What? What's happening?!

69
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,244
He's on fire!

70
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,855
No, put out the fire!
I just want to put out the fire on him.

71
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:54,410
I love that he is just
"Shit, I'm outta here!"

72
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:57,514
First, he went out and then he just bailed.

73
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,760
Maybe he saw that the others
were coming up to him.

74
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,601
-No, that was cowardly of him.
-Yes, I think it was cowardly.

75
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,727
I mean, imagine how lucky you must be
for such a thing.

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,196
What now? This wall won't...

77
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:19,673
Oh, no.

78
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:23,279
No no, it's going to collapse!
This feels like a game with blocks.

79
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:27,090
-Oh, no, no, no. Please.
-So stupid.

80
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,934
Don't do this, please.
Look at all the things above him now.

81
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,204
Why? Oh.

82
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:36,958
I mean, I'm kind of angry.
You're so stupid!

83
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:38,641
Stop!

84
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:45,363
Really?! What did he think would happen?

85
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:47,228
Oh my God. Did he die? No, okay.

86
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:50,505
Oh, is he going to be robbed?

87
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:54,021
-No, how cool!
-What's he doing?

88
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,683
-He has this...
-...hairspray and lighter or something.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,133
I mean, how cool!

90
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:04,355
-But how smart that he just...
-That was a legend move.

91
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:08,530
They didn't even get in
before he did that. Brilliant.

92
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:09,856
Pure legend thing, really.

93
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:14,125
-GTA.
-No! Oh...

94
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:19,323
No, animals shouldn't be harmed. It's
just like that. It's something special.

95
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,685
-He just walks away then.
-Ouch, ouch, ouch...

96
00:05:29,003 --> 00:05:31,201
Yes, he's totally in shock. Shit, really.

97
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:33,995
Oh. No!

98
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,598
I mean, that's just insane.

99
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,950
Oh, no!

100
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,387
I mean...

101
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,974
Oh my God, how close that was.
Did you see that?

102
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:54,061
No, no, no. Wow.

103
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:56,915
Goodbye.

104
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,344
No, God, what a freaking drop there was.

105
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:04,427
-Hey hey, Skye?!
-I'm good!

106
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:08,433
Okay, sorry that I said goodbye, perhaps.
But wow.

107
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:12,646
Oh, my God. Run!

108
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:15,223
You flew!

109
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:20,635
I flew? I felt sorry for those
who stood there. He flew.

110
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:24,585
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

111
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:26,688
He made it.

112
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,782
All guys are breathing out.

113
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,409
I mean, I thought it was a nut shot
on that one. Wow.

114
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,434
God.

115
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:37,895
What's happening? Oh!

116
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:43,236
...deserves it but I mean...
yes, you shouldn't walk by on...

117
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:44,261
Ah but... wow.

118
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:49,604
It looks like Sweden. It could be Sweden.

119
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:52,429
-This is you, darling.
-Yes, it could be.

120
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:56,906
Wow, how freaking lucky...

121
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:01,537
-It could have been me.
-Is it the lady?

122
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:02,657
Oh!

123
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:07,324
Talking on the phone
and crossing the road at the same time.

124
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:09,998
-Did she walk into the bus?
-Yes, yes, yes. She was so close.

125
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:13,640
That's why you shouldn't talk
on the phone if you're not focused.

126
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:14,776
It's life-threatening.

127
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,601
But you have to look to the left.

128
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:21,372
And she's not even crossing at the
crosswalk, so she's in the middle of...

129
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,641
Damn how scary, really.
I would have just died.

130
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:30,728
But I felt sorry for the snake at first.
But then... can't just leave the snake.

131
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,201
Oh, no, no, no. Watch out,
watch out! You're in the way. Hello!

132
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:41,887
Wow, did you see
how he just threw that kid away?

133
00:07:41,912 --> 00:07:45,244
-That was also a legend move.
-Yes, what a hero.

134
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:49,927
See, he was hanging on the hood.

135
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:54,903
This is just a total fail, really.

136
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:57,482
-What are they doing?
-No, no, no! Oh.

137
00:07:57,507 --> 00:08:02,577
Oh, Lord... Wonder how much that weighs.
Maybe it's not that heavy.

138
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,559
I would guess 100 kilos,
but I'm just guessing.

139
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:08,752
-It's just...
-Now it's bombs.

140
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,019
-Ouch! Ouch, ouch. Was he really shot?
-But, like, what?

141
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,082
No, he probably wasn't shot because then
he would have screamed a lot, but shit.

142
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:24,736
Take the weapon from him!

143
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:28,657
-People like that shouldn't have guns.
-But why does he turn around?

144
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:30,593
And then just "Ah, but hey! Bam!"

145
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:33,585
Okay, a bit louder, please.

146
00:08:34,268 --> 00:08:38,863
That was all the videos we had for today.
Good Lord, my heart just pounds.

147
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:42,355
And it doesn't stop.
You're just "Uh, uh, uh!" all the time.

148
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,980
You're just up here.
You get such an adrenaline rush.

149
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,784
You just don't get a quiet moment.

150
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:53,561
But hopefully no one died
or got excessively injured, I hope.

151
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,280
I felt most sorry for that snake.

152
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:59,236
And those little sheep. No, Lord.

153
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:02,985
It was really fun making this video.

154
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:07,529
Thanks so much to those who suggested
reacting to near-death experiences.

155
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:09,030
A really good suggestion.

156
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:11,681
So more comments,
spam with suggestions.

157
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:16,070
Don't forget, if you like these videos,
give a thumbs up, it will make us happy.

158
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:19,192
-Write a comment and...
-...subscribe.

159
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:24,485
-So, I hope you have a really great day.
-We'll see you soon again. Goodbye.
