1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,120
We all put things off now and again. 
Sometimes because we have no choice.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,840
But doing it when we don't have to, 
knowing there will be consequences-

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,080
-is called procrastinating.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,960
Maybe you put off studying for an exam 
because you don't have the energy-

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,800
-knowing you'll have less time tomorrow-

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,000
-which means you won't be able 
to study as much as you should.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,720
We base decisions on the short-term 
benefits of putting something off-

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,680
-and fail to use a long-term perspective to 
see the benefit of just doing it right away.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,400
Identify your own patterns 
and any excuses you tend to use.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,040
"I'm too tired right now." "I'd rather read 
that text when I'm in the right mood."

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,320
"I work better under pressure anyway." 
"I'll do it after I've..."

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,760
Get an overview.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,920
A common reason for procrastination 
is feeling overwhelmed by the task.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,440
But it helps 
to divide your work into segments.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,080
If you're doing maths, start with a single 
page in your textbook, or with ten pages.

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,200
Plan and structure your work.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,360
Make a plan for when to study, 
and when to have time off.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,920
It's great to schedule short sessions 
and allow yourself breaks.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,880
Make sure your plan is doable.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,200
If you plan to do too much, 
you won't want to do it at all-

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,600
-and that increases the risk 
that you keep procrastinating.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,480
Learn to live with not wanting to study.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
You won't always be excited 
to sit down and study-

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,800
-and we're all great at finding excuses.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,560
But you actually can study even though 
you don't feel super motivated.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,160
Five minutes.

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,880
If you notice that you keep putting off 
a specific thing, try giving it five minutes.

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,280
Maybe that gets you over that first hurdle 
so you can finish the task.

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,000
If not, 
give it another five minutes a little later.

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,880
"Good enough." 
Sometimes that's all you need.

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,720
Demanding too much of ourselves 
keeps us from getting work done-

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,800
-but every single thing we do 
doesn't have to perfect.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,480
Lowering the bar can be a good thing.

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,720
Study with a friend. If you schedule 
a study session with a friend-

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,360
-you're more likely to actually sit down 
and study instead of procrastinating.

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,480
-Want to do that biology thing today? 
-Yeah, see you at my house later.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,240
Give yourself rewards, however small.

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,000
One reward could be getting to watch the 
latest episode of your favourite series-

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,600
-once you've finished the first two pages 
of your Swedish essay.

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,720
Sometimes we do need to put things off, 
but try to ignore the short-term benefits-

41
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,880
-and use a long-term perspective: 
"What's actually best for me?"
