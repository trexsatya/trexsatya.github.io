1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,080
An important purpose of open asset-

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,720
-Is research results should be found and recycled-

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,520
-Which anyone at no cost and in a simple way-

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,440
-By searching the internet.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,040
There are different methods for how the access is made.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,600
Often the terms "Golden Road", "Green Road" and "Hybrid Publication"- are used.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,480
-To describe the different methods. “The Golden Way” means-

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,400
-That the researcher publishes his article in an openly available magazine.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,800
All items published in the magazine are immediately available-

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,280
-and searchable for everyone.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,000
It is common for the publisher to invoice the researcher for a publishing cost-

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,360
-So called Article Processing Charge, APC.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,320
This is a big difference compared to the traditional system-

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,400
-while means that the publication itself is free-

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,880
-But the reader needs to pay to access the article.

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,560
Publication in hybrid magazine means that the researcher publishes article-

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,840
-In a traditional subscription-based magazine-

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
-and the publisher invoices the researcher for a publication cost-

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,360
-To make the individual article immediately openly available.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,840
"The Green Way" means that the researcher publishes the article-

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,760
-In a traditional, subscription -based journal.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,280
In retrospect, then an earlier, expert-review version-

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,040
-In a digital archive for open access.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,960
Most often, the publisher requires that the open publication does not occur directly-

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,120
-Os a certain number of months need to go between publication in the journal-

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,280
-and the publication for open access.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,360
The time period is called embargo time and is often between 6-12 months.

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,680
There is a trend with increasing embargo times.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,000
This means that anyone who wants to read the published version of the article-

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,680
-Endure to pay high subscription fees to the publishers.
