1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,380
All cardboard

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,000
Look

3
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,880
This was delicious

4
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,420
Gosh...

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,800
What's with you? Do you throw the food on the floor? Don't you like the food?

6
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,500
What are you saying? Potato?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,720
You want potatoes? Where can you find it then?

8
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,340
Robots eating potatoes. It's the strangest I've heard.

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,940
Do they sell potatoes here?

10
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,880
No ... this is a fish shop.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,500
Here you buy fish.

12
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,740
Do they sell potatoes here, then?

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,120
Where are you going now? Wait for me!

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,880
Sorry.

15
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,020
Little red, wait for me.

16
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52.080
Where did we?

17
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58.560
To a place there are lots of potatoes?

18
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,480
Yes, but where is it somewhere, then?

19
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,280
A surprise? I don't like surprises.

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,420
Huh, a cycling potato?

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,020
And here someone has built a potato machine.

22
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,620
A potato.

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,600
Of potatoes you can make ... potato chips,

24
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,000
Oops.

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,260
And mashed potatoes.

26
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,880
Well, little red. Where are the potatoes?

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,120
Huh? Where are you going?

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54.060
Gosh...

29
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,960
No, little red. Now I want to know.

30
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,200
Take out the potato.

31
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09.120
I can not take it. I want to go home.

32
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,100
Is potatoes grow here?

33
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,280
But there is only soil and grass and stones here.

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,640
A potato field? What do you mean?

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Nämen, look ... look

36
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,020
A tractor with lots of potatoes.

37
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32.560
Huh? Do you want to ride along?

38
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,780
I do not want that. Never.

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,200
Drop off me. I want to go off!

40
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,600
Look here. This potato is very nice.

41
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,100
Little red, check out this one.

42
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,520
This is wonderful.

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,160
Hello Hello.

44
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,980
It's wonderful, little red.

45
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,980
It was not believed this morning,

46
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07.560
That you and I would foam among potatoes.

47
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09.560
Great

48
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,340
This potato is the route.

49
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,080
Hello Hello!

50
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,820
This one is fine. Take out the wagon, little red.

51
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,700
Well, there it is.

52
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,100
Now we go home again.

53
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,700
Can you guess what this is?

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59.540
A potato!

55
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03.540
And now several vegetables.

56
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,260
Asparagus, tomato ...

57
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,760
...broccoli...

58
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,440
And even more broccoli.

59
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,760
Little Red? Fried potatoes smell really good.

60
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,800
Soon it's done. We fry a little more.

61
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,760
I've never heard of a robot eating potatoes.

62
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,100
There you go. Now it's finished.

63
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09.440
You are welcome.

64
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,420
Do you spit out the food?

65
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,740
But you wanted potatoes. Now ... now you can actually eat up.

66
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,700
Nämen, what are you doing?

67
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,800
Disgusting? You want something else to eat?

68
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,840
Well, you are craving a fork.

69
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,880
Do you want the roasting pad too?

70
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,700
Yes, the roasting pad is delicious, right?

71
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:13,920
I said that. Potatoes are for humans, not for robots.

72
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,340
Are you full now?

73
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,420
Yes, how nice!
