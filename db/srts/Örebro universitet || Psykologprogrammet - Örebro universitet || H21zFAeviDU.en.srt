1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
- Yes, but we drive! - Let's go!

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,600
- My name is Sebastian. - My name is Emma.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,800
We will answer questions about the psychology program.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,240
If you want to learn more about other people.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,280
Why people do certain things for example.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,240
And also learn more about yourself.

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,720
- as with all health care, if one has an interest in,

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,520
Helping others, the psychology role is a very good way to do it.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44.560
It is very wide and you can divide it into different parts.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,320
Some are different perspectives to look at man and psychology.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,080
An example of this may be what happens in the brain during childhood and adolescence.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02.320
- Then it is very much about how different substances in the brain affect us.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,320
And what happens in the brain, for example, when we feel good or are sad.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,880
- What happens to an individual when they are in groups or different group processes.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,720
- Then it is about a scientific method and how we can absorb the research that is done.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,200
And how we can use the results of research studies to,

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,280
Understand man both now during the studies and then in professional life.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,920
- Then we learn a lot about different professional skills such as,

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,440
Call methodology - How to talk to a client during treatment,

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,480
And how to work in an ethical way. - mm.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,960
A lot of focus is on trying to work health promotion.

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52.840
Counteract ill health before it even has occurred.

23
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02.760
- The first two years are a bit more basic knowledge of psychology,

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,000
Different perspectives on man and psychology.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09.720
- Then it becomes more and more practically directed.

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,160
So we have to apply what we learned earlier in the program.

27
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,600
- The last two years, years four and five, is the deepening of the knowledge.

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,280
Then we can also start receiving our own patients here at the university.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,640
- Do you look forward to it?

30
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,280
- Yes, it is a little dreaded delight.

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,920
Because it is very exciting to receive their own patients for the first time,

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,320
But it's a little scary because it's a responsibility.

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,720
- Mm, absolutely! - What do you think?

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,200
- Yes I feel ready, but it's a little scary.

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:57,640
At semester 6 we have VFU, business-placed training, ie internship.

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00.440
It is for 15 weeks.

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02.240
I thought it was pretty nice,

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,720
Because then I could really get into the company I was at.

39
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,000
So that you can follow people and processes a little longer.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,160
- The point of VFU is that we should use what we have learned in practice.

41
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,480
- What did you have to do on your internship?

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,720
- I was at child and youth rehabilitation.

43
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,120
Which most people do not know if they have not been there.

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,160
What we did was offer support efforts to children and adolescents,

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,280
Who needed it for various reasons.

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,040
I gave information about different diagnoses to children,

47
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,120
carried out some play observations, when observing children when playing,

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,160
To see where they are in terms of development.

49
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,480
Then I also had some support calls.

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
You just did your internship, what did you have to do?

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02.600
- I worked at a company that offers psychological tests for companies for recruitment purposes.

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09.360
What I did the most was trying to educate HR managers and HR staff,

53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,800
In how to use psychological tests

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,720
And how to create a fair recruitment process with the help of the tests.

55
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,800
After the training you have quite a few choices of workplaces that you can apply for.

56
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,800
It depends a little on what you feel you have become interested in.

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,880
For example, you can work in primary care, at a health center.

58
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,280
Where you might be the first contact with someone who has started to feel bad,

59
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,600
Or that has a certain problem that they want to get help with.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
Then you can also work at a school for example.

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,120
Where you work more preventively with staff and students to create a better school environment.

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,360
- Then you can also work with recruitment processes,

63
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59.880
to develop recruitment processes.

64
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05.960
You can also work in the Prison and Probation Service with both treatment and risk assessment.

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08.400
- Then you can research too. - Yes you can do that.

66
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,000
- If you have become very interested in something specific.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,480
- Then you can open your own too, which is not uncommon to do.

68
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,200
Yes, I can say that I have probably changed a number of times.

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,480
And I'll probably change a number of times.

70
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,920
But right now I feel most craving for primary care, health center.

71
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,520
To be the first person that people meet.

72
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,880
Also occupational health care. To help people who may be exhausted,

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,840
Who needs support to get back into work.

74
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49.840
Can also imagine opening my own, in the long run maybe.

75
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,800
- Open my own I think would be great fun! - Yes.

76
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
- A little more later maybe.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,000
I have been in a lot on groups and organizations,

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Think it would be something I would like to test.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Then I think you might get tired of it in the long run,

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07.560
And then maybe I want to do something else too.

81
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,160
You get to see a little, but right now I feel maybe group development,

82
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,400
or a little more to help organizations to streamline,

83
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,880
And make their workplace better for their employees.

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32.560
When you start at the university, there is one thing called the introduction.

85
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,360
There are a lot of different activities indoors and outdoors, different kinds of activities.

86
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,480
Where you get to meet people from other courses and programs.

87
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,800
Meet new people.

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,840
- I thought the introduction was a very good way when you come from outside,

89
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,200
And don't know anyone or keep track of town.

90
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,720
It was a great way to get friends quickly,

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,360
And also to learn a little about orienting yourself in the city.

92
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,720
- Then the psychology program has some special days at the beginning of the program as well.

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13.560
- Exactly, the first two weeks we have what we call conference days.

94
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,800
Then you really get to know your class very quickly and effectively.

95
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,000
It was also a lot of fun!

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
- Then you can get involved in other ways as well.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,400
I have been a leader at the campus gym, as it is called.

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,320
I have been a volleyball leader there and play volleyball several times a week.

99
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,600
It has been a lot of fun!

100
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,200
Then it is also the various corps sections that organize lots of stuff.

101
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,920
We have a corps section Sobra that organizes activities.

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,800
There you can find something that you think is fun.

103
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46.560
If it is to be outdoors and do stuff or,

104
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,680
If there are different parties and stuff.

105
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51.080
There is something for everyone it feels like!

106
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,240
- It is a great way to create community outside the class as well.

107
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
More programming. - Yes.

108
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,360
- Then we have Superego too!

109
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,200
It is the psychology students' own section, or what to say.

110
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,280
They also organize activities over the semesters on the psychology program.
