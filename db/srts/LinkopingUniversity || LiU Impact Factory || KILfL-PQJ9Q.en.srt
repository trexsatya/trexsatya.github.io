1
00:00:06,627 --> 00:00:09,900
LiU Impact Factory is our investment in social innovations

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,809
There we recruit teams that have sustainable ideas,

3
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,900
based on the global goals.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,899
During the program we give them among other things

5
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,899
offices, colleagues and skills.

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,081
When we make a program that has a clear direction toward

7
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:23,899
the global goals and we noticed that we got in

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:28,127
A brand new type of idea carrier in our systems.

9
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:31,718
So we really broadened at the university through this.

10
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:35,127
We develop Mathetopia, which is game -based teaching material

11
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:38,036
which shows students the purpose of math and

12
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:41,263
its areas of application in reality.

13
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:43,581
It is based on a series of research findings and we

14
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:47,899
using us of 3D visualization for increased understanding and

15
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:49,899
Clear connection to mathematics.

16
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,581
Broad look is a non -profit association, which works for more votes

17
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:59,536
and perspective, which is usually not allowed to be heard in public

18
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:01,990
the conversation, should arrive.

19
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,763
We are currently running a project called Listening Post Norrköping

20
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:09,718
where we try to develop methods for journalists to more easily come

21
00:01:09,718 --> 00:01:13,218
In contact with new arrivals and others who have an immigrant background.

22
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:16,036
So that it will be easier for them to include them in their

23
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,536
Everyday reporting.

24
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:22,263
We have two offices that we offer members of the LiU Impact Factory.

25
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:25,309
We have an office at Kårallen on Campus Valla,

26
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,444
Where you sit in the middle of the student world.

27
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:32,263
The majority of our team consists of students and sitting on

28
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:35,490
Kårallen gives us an opportunity to find the skills that we

29
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,457
Need among students and researchers.

30
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:41,763
And so we have an office at Coffice in Norrköping,

31
00:01:41,763 --> 00:01:43,990
which is part of Norrköping Science Park.

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,509
Coffice has also been a very inspiring

33
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,718
context, where we have had to meet other people

34
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,671
who has the ambition to do their own thing.

35
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:02,252
For two people like me and Mattias, who have also had

36
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:05,432
that ambition, but not had that experience, then it is

37
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:09,944
Great to be surrounded by like -minded people.

38
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:12,637
This is a project that I think all universities

39
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:16,944
should offer their students who work with social innovation.

40
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:20,490
Impact Factory has expanded our contact network and contributed

41
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,671
Valuable knowledge of how we can meet our challenges.

42
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:28,900
For us, Impact Factory has mainly been an environment

43
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,438
where we can look at our ideas and our commitment

44
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:35,036
As something one should invest in as a job

45
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:38,797
And I don't know where could have received that perspective otherwise.

46
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,853
Social innovations may sound new now, but it will

47
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:44,643
Become part of the new normal in the future.
