Hi Sten, it is the Swedish Research Council.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,340
Yes, we were going to come in and talk a little about your research.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,060
What is so interesting with municipal politics

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,660
It is this that people can still make the municipality their own.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,420
Where you try to start seeing:

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,180
"Ok what should we do in our society?"

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,000
We can't wait for the state to come with

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,880
Or that aid provider comes with things.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,440
We have to solve these issues.

11
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,560
And that's an important part.

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,840
[Sten Hagberg is researching municipal politics]

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,340
[In Burkina Faso]

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,700
In this way, it interests me to see how politics becomes concrete for ordinary people.

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,300
Namely; Care, school and care. We usually say that in Swedish election debates.

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,300
It is basically the same type of basic, civic needs

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,300
which comes up in municipal politics.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
[But if politics does not deliver?]

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,820
You have a long tradition of rising against power.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,200
When power goes too far.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,200
In Burkina Faso 2014

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,820
so the president wanted to manipulate with the constitution and sit left

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Virtually for life.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,760
And then, the first to go out and really took the lead, it was the women.

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,800
A group of women of between five and ten thousand went out

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,720
And demonstrated with porridge and with brooms.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,160
"Grötslevsmarchen" or "La Marche des Spatules" as it is called.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Then they went out and screamed "Dégane Blaise! Dégan!"

29
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,320
So away from power! Off you go!

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,280
And this is so interesting.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,000
That in this power, one often talks about the angry young men

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,800
They often talk about these violent rebellion.

33
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,039
But in fact, we see that women's ability to organize themselves - and for that matter men who

34
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,520
Organizes - in the diligent organizational work.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,280
There is a key that we often overlook.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,640
[Is popular rebellion part of democracy?]

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,480
Popular rebellion is part of democratization processes.

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,160
Or it can be, we should say.

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,800
Therefore, it also becomes a way; That when people see that it is not possible to influence in other ways.

40
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,500
So it is very positive that people mobilize themselves.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,240
In Burkina, the mobilization has been avoided all the time, violence, violence,

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,600
avoided attacking people

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,600
And holders of power that way.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
And it is very important.

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,360
That is, it is a civil disobedience. These are peaceful demonstrations.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,760
So it is definitely part of democratic processes.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,940
[What is required for a successful municipal policy?]

48
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,840
One thing that is very important about the municipal processes in Burkina Faso and other countries.

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,700
It is that people organize themselves.

50
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,840
You organize yourself in both civil society and organizations, in political parties and in different ways.

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,280
That is, you organize yourself to create change.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,200
These organizations, they do not primarily follow religious or ethnic lines.

53
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,040
Without you organizing a question, one thing.

54
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,160
And it can be a development association in the municipality or so.

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,640
This is an important process because then one does not create a we and them

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
in this type of organizations.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,040
And this in turn leads to something of a paradox.

58
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,160
These rather crunchy municipal council meetings

59
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
which I think most of us associate with.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,060
And all such committee preparations

61
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,860
And committees and things that we think about when we hear the word municipal policy.

62
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,420
It is also the core of democracy.

63
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,520
It is also there that you create an opportunity to live together.

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,080
This is where you make decisions that can lead to us improving our society.
