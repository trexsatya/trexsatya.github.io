1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,480
My "babes", here are my "sidekicks" Åsa and Jack, who do their thing.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13.560
Now we will have advertising. The sweater is from ---, and the shoes are from ---.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,440
And this face is "all natural, babe".

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,520
We will hear next time. Kiss!

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,600
-Ope to see you in a good mood. -Yes, I'm a comet.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,760
-Is that is burning? -A celestial body in space in the dark?

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,320
"Whatever!" What you nerd nerds about will not "get me down".

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,640
-What are you doing? -We come on "Källkolls" tagline.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120
No problem! "'Källkoll' - Slayer of fake news."

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,520
It's "catchy", maybe.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,320
Or: "'Källkoll' - Bad News for fake news."

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
-We have a problem with fake news. -I know, Åsa.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00.400
No, not like that. The concept is kasst.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,400
When it began to be used, it meant something.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,080
Then it meant that a fake site publishes something completely invented.

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,480
It was the electoral movement in the United States in 2016.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,000
After that, the concept has begun to mean pretty much anything.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,800
It is used for rumors, propaganda, poor journalism, misunderstanding.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,920
-Everything can be described as fake news. -It is a very specific concept.

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,480
People say fake news, so you don't know what they mean.

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,120
It's almost like a belligerent: "What you said is fake news."

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,840
Or: "You are fake news."

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,280
It sounds like something we can do in the program. All kinds of fake news.

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,920
-Good idea, but first some coffee! -Or energy drink! Just wait.

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,360
Honey, your favorite star makes uninhibited advertising, but for you over 16.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02.600
If you want to party or plug all night, you should drink ---.

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:10,120
It solves all your problems. You are "Perfect, beautiful, amazing"!

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,920
We will go through all the fake transmitters once and for all, "right"?

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,320
Have you been cheated on social media?

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,360
Yes, you get cheated everywhere. It may be a friend who lurks one.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,080
Then people can fool you into clicking on a link that will take you to a page.

32
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,440
Most often so ...! Sometimes it looks shady.

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,920
Usually you do not have money so you can't be fooled!

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,680
When I was a kid, they said: "If you follow me, you are in a competition."

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,880
Or: "You get free products if you write this." But it's false.

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,760
You go on it when you are small.

37
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,080
I probably haven't been fooled, but if you get cheated you don't know it.

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,240
No. I am careful what I buy and what I trust.

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Do you remember the freight ship that got stuck in the Suez Canal for several days?

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,880
-Yes. -It was exposed to fake news.

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,200
Egypt's first female sea captain-

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,680
—the falsely accused of Suez channel blocking-

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,600
-trot that she worked on a ship far from the scene of the accident

44
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,080
It was a campaign. She had figured in an article-

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,520
-If she was Egypt's first female sea captain.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Then some changed it:

47
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,280
"Egypt's first female sea captain has caused the chaos in the Suez Canal."

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00.400
But she had nothing to do with the disaster. She was far from there.

49
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04.080
Sometimes you easily realize that it is wrong.

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09.080
Sometimes it is much more difficult. More often it is more difficult.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:16,200
Often things are mushy and not a hundred percent true or false.

52
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,360
One may ascertain that all that is wrong-

53
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,800
-Don't come from a man who has lied.

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,120
Sometimes it's not even wrong.

55
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,760
-What do you mean? -Covid situation in the United States for example.

56
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,400
In an open society, people can testify to what they have been through.

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,480
When Pandemin swept across the countryside in the United States, it looked like this:

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,720
You said that even when hospitals are over-loaded with covid patients-

59
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,040
-do they come in, are seriously ill, tickle after spirit-

60
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,280
-And they still don't think they got covid.

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,520
Yes, the hardest thing to see is that people are looking for other causes.

62
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08.080
They want a magical answer, and they don't think covid exists.

63
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12.560
-This got stuck with me strongly. -But?

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,200
But, then it turned out that this picture was not obvious.

65
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,680
A reporter had contacted other hospitals in that area-

66
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,800
-And heard with emergency nurses who did not share this picture.

67
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,480
This does not mean that the nurse is lying.

68
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:40,360
The reporter who called around may not get hold of those who saw the same thing.

69
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,440
Different nurses see different parts of reality. Hence the problem.

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,880
How representative is a testimony?

71
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,680
That a person is involved in something does not have to say what the whole looks like.

72
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,480
After all, a testimony can color a very many picture of the truth.

73
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,520
One has to ask how common and representative phenomenon is?

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,440
Just. Much like "Tafsar Day" which was a few weeks ago.

75
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,040
It was alleged that there were calls in social media, on tiktok-

76
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,360
-"Challenges" that guys would paw on girls on the big "pawing day".

77
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,880
It seems to start with the police warned of "Tafsardag".

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,400
The big spread of "Tafsardag" came late.

79
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,400
It's disgusting.

80
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,480
It's good if parents talk to their children about it.

81
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,360
This is the problem:

82
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,120
When it spread in all media, there were no first -hand sources.

83
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,400
When many young people are asked if they heard it, it is likely that they heard about it-

84
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
-For the police, newspapers, the school has talked about it.

85
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04.320
One has to weigh the balance between worrying or warning of something-

86
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07.320
-What is a phenomenon for real.

87
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,600
We talked about that in previous programs. There is a risk of a "copy cat" effect.

88
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,400
When someone does stupidity or it is talked about it-

89
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,640
-Tris it to inspire people to do stupidity.

90
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,720
Was it a joke from the beginning? Would just a few idiots do it?

91
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Was it big or small? We do not know that about "Tafsardag".

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,440
We must be clear that abuse must be reported to the police.

93
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,080
If things happen at people's schools, they should tell you about it.

94
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,040
If we pick it up.

95
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,920
It happens that such stories start with that an individual person-

96
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,680
-Have have been involved in something, tells about it, and it gets huge spread.

97
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,800
That it is not a celebrity, or scam in the background ...

98
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,560
It really happens and then it can be anything from truth to rumors ...

99
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07.840
-... to misunderstanding to jokes. -And the individual stories ...

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,680
... can then be picked up and reached by those who have a purpose.

101
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,920
They can screw it, add things-

102
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,080
-and even omit stuff that is relevant-

103
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26.560
-As to make a point of it. It becomes political propaganda.

104
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,800
In India there are cases where rumors have led to lynching.

105
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,280
This is fired by contradictions between people groups.

106
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,320
When someone has something to gain on it purely political-

107
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,720
-Then you can expect them to look for individual examples-

108
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,040
-To get this point.

109
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,840
It doesn't just have to be political actors or groups-

110
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59.840
-What may be states that want to promote their own purposes.

111
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,800
On Russian state television last month, AstraZenecas vaccine-

112
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,480
-When an APVaccine and is portrayed as dangerous.

113
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,720
A study from the United States says the same Russian troll-

114
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,760
— which is suspected to have affected the election result in 2016-

115
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,280
-Have tried to fire on a debate about how safe vaccines are.

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,360
Sometimes even states use magic factories and armies of bottoms.

117
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,800
Very sci-fi!

118
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,080
The origin of the concept of "troll" is someone who just wants to joke-

119
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,240
-And a debate to derail at fun, as well.

120
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:46,240
But with magic factories it is about states wanting to promote their own sake-

121
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,760
-And they want to get into other countries' internal debates and perhaps influence.

122
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,760
When a person comes to the magic factory-

123
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59.560
-They get a list of topics that the factory is working on.

124
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,480
Which event has happened and what is to be written about it-

125
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,200
-And what feeling the troll should evoke in the audience.

126
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
Hello? Hello! Yes, it goes amazing!

127
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,920
Yes, I'll do more just right away. You have a new thing? A cream?

128
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes, send it over! Certainly! Kiss!

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,880
Money, money, money!

130
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,760
But must it be someone who does it for the money, right?

131
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,840
There are many who do it. For example, fake sites.

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Those who only find stuff. "The original fake news."

133
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,440
After all, we have not had so many of that in Sweden.

134
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
This is Veles.

135
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,400
As a 22-year-old, I earned more than some do for a lifetime.

136
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,760
And these are the people behind it.

137
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,280
It is a huge industry and a huge network.

138
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,200
We create fake profiles so that we can reach more people.

139
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,520
There is a strategy here.

140
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,760
But we have some satirical sites that want to make some kind of satirical score-

141
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,560
-and that can therefore find or exaggerate.

142
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,720
They may also have the purpose of making money.

143
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,440
You do this by having these little boxes with Google Ads-

144
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,520
-And then you get money through traffic.

145
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Then we also have the viral sites.

146
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,080
Those who are looking to get articles very scattered and viral.

147
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,040
They pick up the most engaging news.

148
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,280
Sometimes they can just write them straight off a news site.

149
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,160
They also do not care that what they write should be just right.

150
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,000
No ... here we have old favorites like "Mikropopcorn is fatal!"

151
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,040
"Chips are fatal!"

152
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Are you sent by the snack lobby, right?

153
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,320
No, but these pages have a tendency to pick up study-

154
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04.560
-What says something is dangerous in very high doses when really ...

155
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08.880
It is not dangerous if you stick to the daily intake.

156
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,480
Then we have the fraudsters who find different types of scams-

157
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,800
-To access personal data.

158
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,520
A man called my mom. He said he called from the Public Health Authority-

159
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,440
-And had found her through infection tracking.

160
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,640
He would send mouth guard-

161
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,760
-And she just needed to verify that she is she.

162
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,840
Fraudsters try to find weaknesses.

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,520
They are looking for man who does not know they exist.

164
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,360
They try to get over personal information, money.

165
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,720
This can happen in many different ways. They can send sms, messenger-

166
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,520
-dm, anyway!

167
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,520
I'll do a thing, but that's something you should include in your channel.

168
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,680
-Absolutely! It has eighteen followers now! -Wow ...

169
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,440
There are many different types of false content on the web.

170
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,240
All to what is intentionally wrong for things that are not.

171
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,840
Here are all types of senders to this content.

172
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,360
We ourselves.

173
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,640
We do as we have always done. We talk, joking, lie, misunderstand-

174
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
-and all this can get viral.

175
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,760
Fake sites.

176
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,800
Fake sites find their articles straight up and down.

177
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,280
Their purpose is to amuse and sometimes make money.

178
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,480
Viral sites.

179
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,240
Viral sites are like fake sites, but they take their material from reality.

180
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,880
They cut and borrow things from the web that they think should spread.

181
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,360
The goal is to get traffic in and then make money on traffic.

182
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,680
Fraudsters.

183
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,160
Fraudsters are looking for our money and personal data.

184
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,560
Personal data can be used for different things-

185
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,520
-As to order cards or stuff in other people's names.

186
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,560
Ideologically motivated.

187
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,400
It may be those who create and spread political propaganda.

188
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,000
It is not always wrong, but it may be busted-

189
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,240
-Or so something has been omitted to make a political point.

190
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,360
Foreign influence.

191
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,160
It is when states sit behind the fake accounts and pull the threads.

192
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,200
The goal is to promote their own purposes-

193
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,360
-And sometimes disturb or influence the debate in other countries.

194
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,360
You can release your pores and put yourself in focus with ---!

195
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,640
You don't have particles in the eyes-

196
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,640
-and unnecessary cascade effects around the temples. Best of all?

197
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,480
No Corona!

198
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,240
No, but ... I can't say it helps against Corona!

199
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,800
I don't feel amazing perfectly beautiful with this cream.

200
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,960
My safaris, you deserve better! I jump off my advertising contract.

201
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,720
Good moral compass, Edwin!

202
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,640
Think of all the money you had earned! But you stayed on the narrow road.

203
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,200
-Perfect! -Yes ... Yes, it felt good indeed.

204
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,760
