1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Do you want SEK 20,000 today

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,704
Or do you want SEK 1.3 million in 30 years? You decide

3
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,688
You may be dreaming of making a lot of money

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,016
And the truth is that most of them want to get rich today

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,600
But if you knock it out, if you look

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,256
in the long run and how the other millionaires and billionaires how the very richest in the world

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,048
have become rich

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,864
So it is with the help of the compound interest

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
Everyone wants a quick fix

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,192
You want abs now

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
But you do not want to go to the gym

12
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,312
You want to buy a car today but you have no money

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
Do you have patience

14
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
Then you will get rich

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Believe me

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,712
After this video you will have

17
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
The formula

18
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
To how to do

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,320
We will go through three points

20
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,904
And then you will understand what the interest rate on interest rate effect is

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,208
And how to apply it

22
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
On your

23
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,048
investments so you can easily start investing

24
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,864
And in the long run build a large fortune

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:15,264
So we start with point No. 1 And that is perhaps the most boring point But what is interest on interest

26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
And simply put, it's about you

27
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
Invest your money

28
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
And after a year

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
So they increase

30
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
Let me take an example, let's say I have SEK 100, your SEK 100 will receive 10% interest

31
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
Return every year

32
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,232
After one year, your SEK 100 has become worth SEK 110

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
After a year

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,656
This is how you got an interest on your money and it is now that this interest-on-interest effect strikes

35
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
Year 2

36
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
When you have already received

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
Interest on your already interest-bearing money then

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,312
Earlier then

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,128
Then you will receive interest on your already interest-bearing money

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Year 2

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Yes, then you get ten percent

42
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
On your SEK 110

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
As they are now worth

44
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,624
And when you pull it out in the long run it's then

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928
You can see the great effects of the interest-on-interest effect

46
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
Overtime

47
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,560
So these will increase in value because you always get

48
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
interest on your already interest-bearing money

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
It is an interest-on-interest effect

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
very briefly explained

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
And now you come

52
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
surely ask "But how do I get interest, where do I get interest from"

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,688
And it can be a savings account, it can be funds it can be shares,

54
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,166
Cryptocurrencies it can be anything for investments that you get a return on.

55
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,856
The most common and what

56
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,416
I usually talk about investing in stocks

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
on shares

58
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,072
This is how you get a profit sharing from these companies that you have invested in

59
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,168
And if you do not know what a stock is, check out my video about stocks for beginners

60
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
But with stocks

61
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,800
Yes, then you get a dividend from the company's profit

62
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
Which allows you to reinvest the money

63
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
And normally you might get two to four percent

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
In different shares

65
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,272
Which gives out this kind of profit sharing

66
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,088
And that is exactly what is magical in the long run

67
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,416
When you reinvest this dividend year after year

68
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
That's when you can see really cool effects

69
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,512
With how your money grows

70
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
I want to take the example

71
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Castellum a real estate company

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
Those who bought shares

73
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,264
For SEK 100,000 in Castellum in 1997

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
and has retained them

75
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
Today has shares for a value of

76
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,920
SEK 4 million

77
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
Those shares currently yield

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Dividend

79
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,064
At approximately SEK 110,000 per year

80
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,904
That is more than the original investment amount

81
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
How sick!

82
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
So more than what they invested

83
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
Get them back every year

84
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
In dividend

85
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Crazy!

86
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,960
The key to why the interest rate effect is so crazy

87
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
It's because you use the time

88
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
The longer you invest

89
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,360
The greater this interest rate on the interest rate effect

90
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,968
Therefore, it is extremely important that you who are young

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
That you invest

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
As early as possible

93
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
The greater the interest rate on the interest rate effect.

94
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
This is what gives some an edge over others

95
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
For example, many parents invest their money in their children before they are even born

96
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:24,920
Which means that this interest-on-interest effect can only work for the money, just over time

97
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,567
How should you think when investing your money if you want to get an interest rate effect?

98
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,871
Yes, I'm thinking like this

99
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
Money I do not need

100
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
Money that I pile up, I invest it!

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
I have no direct plan with them.

102
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,623
But I just want to invest them and let the money work for me.

103
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
And so you should think.

104
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:50,800
You do not have to worry about saving a latte a month or whatever

105
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:56,191
Live your life, enjoy! But money that you get over that you can afford to invest does it!

106
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,543
And let this money be invested over a longer period of time.

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
The longer you invest

108
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,639
The greater this interest rate on the interest rate effect

109
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,680
And that's what I want you to understand

110
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
This is how it looks

111
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
If you, for example

112
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
Deposits SEK 20,000 that you invest

113
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,535
After one year, they have increased by 15% to SEK 23,000

114
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Year 2

115
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
Yes, then they have increased to SEK 26,450

116
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
Now keep an eye on this green bar here

117
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,280
So that's how much It increases For each year

118
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,320
After 3 years DKK 30,000

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
After 4 years DKK 34,000

120
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
5 years

121
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Six years

122
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
7 years

123
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,599
Look at the green how much bigger it will be than the blue bar

124
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,680
And this then proves how much your money increases over time

125
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,520
And now we max out on this really properly

126
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,600
So that you can see what a difference it makes

127
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
After 30 years

128
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
so have your 20,000

129
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
become worthwhile

130
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
1.3 million

131
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
And this is an example of what the interest-on-interest effect can do to your invested money if you just have patience

132
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
And let them work year after year

133
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
Einstein called this the eighth wonder of the world

134
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
And there's something in that

135
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
This when you pull it out in the long run

136
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,279
That's when they get these magical effects

137
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
So it

138
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
So-called interest-on-interest effect

139
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
"snowball effect"

140
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
This is what allows you to get filthy rich

141
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
In a really long time

142
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
And what the interest-on-interest effect is really about

143
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
It is that you have to be patient

144
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
Just like you do not get stomach cramps

145
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
After a gym workout

146
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
And you will not get rich

147
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
of scratching a bouncy castle, if you do not have a damn lucky

148
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,671
It's simply about investing your money

149
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
And then you have to be patient

150
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,791
You should let the money grow over time

151
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Year after year, they grow and grow

152
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,191
And the longer you wait, the longer

153
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,280
The bigger the snowball and the more money you make.

154
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
This is not revolutionary

155
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
You will not get rich today

156
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
And that's not the point either

157
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,039
The very purpose of telling this is just to be long-term when investing in stocks

158
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
It is in the long run that you make the big money

159
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
Now these people are talking about the fact that a friend or uncle or something else has become a millionaire

160
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
In one day through stocks

161
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:36,160
That may be true, but there is a very low chance that you will succeed as well.

162
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
That's why I want to

163
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,775
Clarify over how important it is to you

164
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,127
Is long-term and that you have a long time horizon when you invest in shares

165
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
It's incredibly important

166
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Have patience

167
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,503
Because that's when you make the big bucks

168
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,879
If you do not already know what stocks are or how they work If you have not already opened

169
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
A share account, I think

170
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
that you should do it

171
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:02,559
And in my video shares for beginners, I go through how easy it is to actually buy shares

172
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
And how it works and how you make money on them

173
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
I think you should watch that video

174
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:14,079
And if you already have a stock account and know how it works, I think you should check out my second video about beginner mistakes

175
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
as different beginners do when buying stocks

176
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,735
Thank you so much for watching this video and if you like it, feel free to press thumbs up

177
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Have a good time See you next time

178
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Hello
