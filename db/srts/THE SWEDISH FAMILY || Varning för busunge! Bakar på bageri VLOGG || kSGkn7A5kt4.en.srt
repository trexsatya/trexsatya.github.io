00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,500
Hello Hello!

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:06,652
We are in Hammarby SjÃ¶stad in Stockholm, and what should we do?

3
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,341
- Bake!
 - Yay!

4
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:16,168
A while ago we got an email from a guy named Albin.
 His father is a baker and is called Magnus.

5
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:18,555
His bakery & pastry is there!

6
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:20,537
Here!

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,740
- They should teach us to bake.
 - Hopefully something very miserable.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,720
We will bake pastries and croissants.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,900
- Yes!
 I love croissants.
 And pastry.
 - It will be super good.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,180
See what a lot of butter.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,220
Below the camera is the butter that we will bake into the doughs.

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,580
- Is that the Croissants and that to the pastries?
 - Yes exactly.

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,660
- What a lot of butter is needed for croissants.
 - Is this a messy guy?

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,580
- Yes, he's super busy.
 - You can sit on my shoulders and bake, maybe.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,220
Here we will add the dough.
 Then we will press some of these buttons, but not now!
 Then the hand becomes pancake.

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,020
Any?

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,920
If you press it, it goes here and if you press it it goes to it.

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,820
This is what we will roll into the dough.
 It's almost as much butter as dough, do you see?

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,420
- Yes.
 - Feel it.
 It's a bit elastic.

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,040
- It's hard.
 - It's a bit like rubber.

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,760
Check!
 Now it came out.

22
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:37,240
We will try to get it as long.
 It should be as much dough at the bottom as on the top.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,240
- Harry, do you want to help put on the butter?
 - Yes.

24
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,320
- Nice!
 - Good there.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,820
High five!

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,180
- Now you got lots of butter ... - Okay.

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,700
Fold over it, Alma.

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,100
All the way.

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,800
Then you can pull a little in the butter ... or in the dough, sorry.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,960
- ... so it's just like this, do you see?
 - It is not possible to pull in butter.

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,420
You have made a sandwich!
 No, it's no sandwich.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,240
We make it layer of butter, dough, butter, dough.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,800
- Stay there.
 - Harry, do you want to press the second button?

34
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,520
Perfect.

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,340
Now we will do what you call "three -stroke" in bakery language.
 This is one.

36
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,900
So this will be two, it is important that you dot almost right, and so it will be like this - three.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,120
- Do you know why you do it?
 - No.

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,340
In pastry and croissants there is layer of butter and dough.

39
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:04,920
Now we will have about 1044 layers of butter, dough, butter, dough ... so they get crispy and good.

40
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,580
- How big will they be?
 - It depends on how big you make them.

41
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,980
What did you say?

42
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,620
- 1044 layers exactly?
 - Stay here.
 No Harry, absolutely not!

43
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,820
- May I count them?
 - Yes, you have to do that when we eat them.

44
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,020
We have rolled so, and then we turn it in this direction, and we will do the same again.

45
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,780
- Who is going to drive now, then?
 - Alma!
 Alma, beware!

46
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,800
Now we must be careful so that we do not destroy the layers.
 Okay Alma, then we press here.

47
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,800
- Pull a little in the dough too.
 - Good.

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,840
A little more.

49
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,940
Get to know, do you have muscles here?
 Yes, you had.
 Then we do this, oh hi oh.

50
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,060
Harry.

51
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,460
So.

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,300
What happened now?

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,480
Place it there.

54
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,580
Oops!

55
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,940
- Place it straight and think about the layers.
 - I'll see where Harry and Axel went.

56
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,520
How's it going?

57
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,840
Yes it is good, but we needed a little break and talk a little about that with listening.

58
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,020
It was a little difficult for Harry in there for a while.

59
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,940
I asked if he heard what Magnus said and then he just said "no".

60
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:01,900
There were some other sounds and machines and dough you could dress with, then so ... there was so much that happened.

61
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,320
- The machines were cool.
 - Yes, they are cool.

62
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,620
- Harry has the ability to be overhead.
 - Yes.
 Then it is difficult for him to take in what others say.

63
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,700
Yes, and today Alma is also a little overhead, I would say.

64
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,100
Then it becomes super difficult to be a parent, but we do our best.

65
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,800
Yes.
 It will be difficult to record a vlog in a good way and get good material.

66
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:35,440
And it will be very difficult to edit the material and make it so that you who are watching understand what we do.

67
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,680
That's why we went out to give Alma a little more space so she can join in and bake.
 And it gets a little calmer.

68
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,000
- Now let's roll pastry!
 - Yep.

69
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,820
Then I think we can do this with this one, that we cut up lengths.

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,340
- And then you roll it.
 - Oh!

71
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:16,360
For example, you can do an eight by making an S first, turning them there, and turning it.
 Then you have an eight.

72
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,620
- If we want an eight.
 - If you want an eight.

73
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,140
If you don't want an eight, you can just spin it like a round ...

74
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,300
- I will do that.
 - They look like macaroni.

75
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,160
- Fold the snibber under.
 - I want to do that.

76
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,000
Good.

77
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,360
Now these are going to ferment for about an hour and a half.

78
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,860
Okay.

79
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,680
- Sad, huh?
 - Yes.

80
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,860
- Then we have to sit and roll our thumbs.
 - It's lucky that I have ice cream then, right?

81
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,580
Yes!

82
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,060
Albin will ask today's question when eating ice cream.

83
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,100
"What countries have Alma and Harry been in?"

84
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,680
Good question.
 Do you remember?

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
- Jamaica.
 - Malaysia.

86
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,220
- Greece.
 - New Zealand.

87
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,700
Thailand.
 Taiwan.

88
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,720
- Spain.
 - Yes, just that.

89
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,460
And Cape Verde.

90
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,060
And Singapore.

91
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,500
There are a total of ten countries that Alma and Harry have been in, with Sweden.

92
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,620
Yes!

93
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,160
- What a good bill.
 We have never counted ourselves.
 - No, but I think it's actually true.

94
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,460
Move some Harry, so Alma comes out.

95
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,580
Here comes the Tuffe-Tuffe train!

96
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,240
TUT-TUT!

97
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,260
TUT-TUT!

98
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,340
They crashed.

99
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,580
TUT-TUT-TUT!
 Pang!

100
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,880
- In the middle of the cake.
 - Stylish holes.

101
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,800
Move down your hand, Alma.

102
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,400
- So there.
 - Oh!

103
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,320
Oh!

104
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,560
Well!

105
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,880
- What did you do?
 - She threw a piece of chocolate!

106
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,260
- Did she eat a bit?
 - Yes.

107
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,560
It is okay.

108
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:26,580
Do you remember, now we have done the three -stroke, the lighthouse and the three -stroke, right?
 Check out what many layers, do you see?

109
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,740
Oh.

110
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:35,100
The best thing about pastry and when you rolled and so, do you know what to do then?
 The best of all.

111
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,040
Oh.

112
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,720
It's crispy and then it melts ... mmm!

113
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,840
Do you want to taste?
 Harry?

114
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,260
Oh!

115
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,720
- Beware my fingers.
 - Yes.

116
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,720
Check out what nice layers, huh?
 Three strokes, four -strokes and three strokes.
 Perfect!

117
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,740
- Mmm!
 - Albin?

118
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,620
- They are so good!
 - Mm!

119
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,600
Beware the dental position.

120
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,100
Sinally good.

121
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,080
- Open the dental position.
 - No.

122
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,520
- May I see the dental position?
 - It's a horror movie now.

123
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,000
- Bye.
 - Thanks and good bye.

124
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,820
- It was very nice.
 - Thanks for coming!

125
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,400
You are welcome.

126
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,180
- Bye friend!
 - Hello then, Harry.

127
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,760
- Bye!
 - Bye!

128
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,120
Hello then, hey, hey then!

129
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,600
- The world's messiest recording.
 - Yes but ... so, my God I just say.

130
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,580
Oh my God!

131
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,740
Fantastic nice people!
 Albin, Urgent guy.

132
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,120
And Alma and Harry showed up from their absolute worst side.

133
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,940
Yes, they were completely impossible today.

134
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:16,860
It was like they pressed "Mute" when we went in and just didn't listen to us.
 They are still so!

135
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,260
- Oh!
 - I know.
 Spin doors get stuck!

136
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,520
I have been pronounced.

137
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,480
- NÃ¤men ... Alma.
 - Are you a ninja?

138
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,240
- Stop it!
 No, now it is enough.
 - But, but, but ...

139
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
So.
 Just stand here and listen to Magnus.

140
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,620
Harry, come here.
 Harry, come.
 Well, you wanted to go there.
 It will be fine.

141
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,880
Do you know what to do now?
 Are you with?

142
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,180
- Alma!
 - Are you groaning?

143
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,480
Still, it feels great to show that we are not a perfect family.

144
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,220
Sometimes people ask, "Do you never argue?".

145
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,480
Yes, we are struggling.
 Well, our children turn off.
 Yes, we are messy.
 Just like everyone else.

146
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,180
But you wish you could be it just in your loneliness and not when you go to record anything.

147
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,080
- I first come to the car!
 - Yes that is good.
 Run to the car you.

148
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:31,660
Thanks for watching this video!

149
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,640
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

150
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,480
Recommend, subscribe and have a great time until we see you next time.

151
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,860
Bye!
