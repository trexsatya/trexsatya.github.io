1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,500
Hey, hey!

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,060
We are in Hammarby SjÃ¶stad
in Stockholm. What will we do?

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,180
Bake!

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,420
A while ago we received an e-mail from a boy
named Albin. His dad, Magnus, is a baker.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,100
- His bakery and confectionery is right there.
- Here.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,720
- They will teach us how to bake.
- Hopefully something delicious.

7
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,720
We will be making
Danish pastries and croissants.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,900
- Yay! I love croissants. And Danish pastries.
- It's going to be delicious.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,080
- Look at all that butter.
- This is the butter we will be folding into the dough.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,600
- Is this for the croissants, and this for the Danish?
- Yes, exactly.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,580
Oh, croissants need a lot of butter.

12
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,460
- Do we have a little rascal here?
- Yes, he is super rascally.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,000
We will put the dough here. Then we will
push one of these buttons, but not now!

14
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,020
Any of these?

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,920
If you push this one it goes this way,
if you push that one it goes that way.

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,260
We will roll this butter into the dough.
They are almost the same size, see?

17
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,600
Feel it. It's kind of elastic.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,040
- It's hard.
- It's a bit like rubber.

19
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,200
Here it comes.

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:37,240
Now we will make the dough long enough
to cover the butter both underneath and on top.

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,240
- Harry, do you want to help put the butter on the dough?
- Yes.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,320
- Nice!
- Good job.

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,820
High five!

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,180
Now you got butter on your hand.

25
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,700
Fold it over, Alma.

26
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,100
All the way.

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,800
Then we can pull on the butter...
Sorry - the dough.

28
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,960
- One can't pull on butter, right?
- Make sure the dough covers the butter. See?

29
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,420
You have made a sandwich!
No, it's not a sandwich.

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,240
Eventually there will be layers
of butter, dough, butter, dough.

31
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,400
- Harry, do you want to push the other button?
- Stand there.

32
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,520
Perfect.

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,340
Now we will do what us bakers call
a three-fold. This is one.

34
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,960
This is the second layer.

35
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,900
And the third.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,120
- Do you know why we do this?
- No.

37
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,460
This creates the layers of butter and dough
in Danish pastries and croissants.

38
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:04,940
Eventually there will be 1044 layers of butter and dough.
It will make them crisp and delicious.

39
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,800
- How big will they be?
- That depends on how big you make them.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,980
Sorry?

41
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,620
- Exactly 1044 layers?
- Stay here. No Harry, absolutely not!

42
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,820
- Can I count them?
- Yes, when we eat them.

43
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,900
We have rolled it this way, now we will
roll it that way and do the same thing again.

44
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,040
- Who wants to push the buttons?
- Alma! Alma, watch out!

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,800
Be careful with the dough.
Alma, push here.

46
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,800
- Pull on the dough.
- Good.

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,020
A little bit more.

48
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,220
Let's see, you have nice muscles.
Here we go.

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,060
Harry.

50
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,600
What just happened?

51
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,500
Put it there.

52
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,580
Oops!

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,000
- Straighten it out and be careful with the layers.
- I will see where Harry and Axel went.

54
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,520
How are things?

55
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,780
It's fine, we just needed a break
to talk about listening.

56
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,020
Harry had a hard time
listening in there.

57
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,940
I asked if he heard what Magnus said
in there, and he said "no".

58
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:01,680
There were other sounds and machines
and dough to play with. There was a lot going on.

59
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,360
- The machines were cool.
- Yes, they were cool.

60
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,620
- Harry tends to get overly excited.
- Yes, then it's hard for him to listen.

61
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,700
Yes. Alma is also a bit
overly excited today, I would say.

62
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,100
Then it's very difficult to be a parent,
but we are doing our best.

63
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,680
It's hard to record a vlog in a good way,
and get good footage.

64
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:35,400
And it's very difficult to edit so that
you all understand what we are doing.

65
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,680
That's why we left, to give Alma more space
so that she can join in on the baking. And it's calmer.

66
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,280
Now we will roll Danish pastries!

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,380
I thought we would cut
this dough into long pieces, like this.

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,340
- And roll it.
- Oh!

69
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:16,480
You could shape it like an eight by first shaping it
like an S, tuck these in and flip it over. There's your eight.

70
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
- If we want an eight.
- If you want an eight.

71
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,160
If you don't want an eight
you could just swirl it like this.

72
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,300
- That's what I will do.
- They look like macaroni.

73
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,160
- Fold the end piece under.
- I also want to do it like that.

74
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
Good.

75
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,360
Now we have to let them rise
for about one and a half hour.

76
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,860
Okay.

77
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,680
- Boring, huh?
- Yes.

78
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,860
- We will sit and twiddle our thumbs.
- Good thing I have ice cream, right?

79
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,580
Yay!

80
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,180
Albin will ask us Question of the Day
while we eat ice cream.

81
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,900
"Which countries have
Alma and Harry been to?"

82
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,680
Good question.
Do you remember?

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,280
- Jamaica.
- Malaysia.

84
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,220
- Greece.
- New Zealand.

85
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,540
Thailand. Taiwan.

86
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,720
- Spain.
- That's right.

87
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,460
And Cape Verde.

88
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,060
And Singapore.

89
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,500
Alma and Harry have been to a total of
ten countries, including Sweden.

90
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,860
Yay!

91
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,100
- Good counting. We haven't counted them ourselves.
- No, but I think that's right.

92
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,500
Move over a little bit, Harry.

93
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,580
Here comes the chu chu train!

94
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,240
Chu chu!

95
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,260
Chu chu!

96
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,500
They crashed.

97
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,520
Chu chu!

98
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,300
- In the middle of it.
- Nice holes.

99
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,980
Move your hand down, Alma.

100
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,480
- Here you go.
- Oh!

101
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,320
No!

102
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,560
No!

103
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:43,000
- What did you do?
- She stole a piece of chocolate!

104
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,260
- Did she eat one?
- Yes.

105
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,560
That's okay.

106
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,700
Do you remember that we did
the three-fold and the four-fold?

107
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,640
- Look at all the layers.
- Oh.

108
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,700
Do you know what the best thing
about making Danish pastries is?

109
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Oh.

110
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,180
It's crisp and it just
melts in your mouth.

111
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,480
Would you like to taste it? Harry?

112
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,720
- Watch my fingers.
- Yes.

113
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,400
Look at all the nice layers.
Three-fold, four-fold, three-fold. Perfect.

114
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
Albin?

115
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,620
- They are so good!
- Mm!

116
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Watch your braces.

117
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,100
Sinfully good.

118
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,000
- Open and show your braces.
- No.

119
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,700
Can I see your braces?

120
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,560
It's a horror film now.

121
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,000
- Bye bye.
- Thank you and bye bye.

122
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,820
- It was lovely having you here.
- Thank you for having us!

123
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,240
You are welcome.

124
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,180
- Bye bye, friend!
- Bye bye, Harry.

125
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,760
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

126
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,120
Bye, bye, bye!

127
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,600
- The messiest recording in the world.
- I mean...  "Oh my God" is all I can say.

128
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,520
Oh my God!

129
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,940
They were all incredibly nice.
Albin is a super sweet guy.

130
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,960
Alma and Harry showed them
their absolute worst side.

131
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,940
Yes, they were impossible today.

132
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,520
It was like they pressed "mute" when we
got inside and just didn't listen to us.

133
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,620
- They are still like that!
- Ouch!

134
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,260
I know, you get stuck.

135
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,200
BLOOPERS

136
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,520
I have farted.

137
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,480
- But... Alma.
- Are you a ninja?

138
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,120
- Stop it! That's enough.
- But, but, but...

139
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
Just stand here
and listen to Magnus.

140
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,460
Harry, come here. Harry, come.

141
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,720
You wanted to go there, that's fine.

142
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,620
And now... are you with me?

143
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,180
- Alma!
- Are you rowing?

144
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,480
Still, it feels good to show
that we are not a perfect family.

145
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,180
People have asked if we never fight.

146
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,840
Yes, we fight. Yes, our kids don't listen.
Yes, we are messy. Just like everyone else.

147
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,980
But you wish it was only in your alone time
and not when you have gone somewhere to record.

148
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,360
- I will be the first one to the car!
- Yes, that's good. You run to the car.

149
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:31,660
Thank you for watching this video!

150
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,640
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

151
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,480
Recommend, subscribe
and take care until next time.

152
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,120
Bye bye!
