1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,400
- Let's go!
 - Yes!

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,600
I was not sure what I wanted to work with in the future and therefore I thought,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,640
System science was a good choice because you can work with a lot of different things.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,200
I chose the program because I always had an interest in computers and IT,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
As well as working with people.
 This was a good mix of both.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,800
When you plug system science, you do not educate yourself as a profession, but to an industry,

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,680
Where you can work with different things.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,840
Such as requirements analysts, programmers or business analysts,

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,360
or UX designer or project manager.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,280
I was unsure and wanted a breadth with my studies.
 Therefore chose to study the master's program in informatics.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,280
I probably want to start working right away.
 Initially, perhaps as a programmer and later project manager or reached.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,960
What most people think about system science is programming and database management,

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,800
But system science is so much more.

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,280
You also read a lot of UX design and requirements management.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
It is also about learning the connection between IT and man.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,560
During a semester, you have the opportunity to do internships or system development projects at a company.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,560
Which can be good for making contacts.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,840
Yes, but you don't have to be out at a company.
 You can do your own project just like me.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,280
I made a mobile application.

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,680
I think student life is good and there are a lot of things you can get involved in.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:45,120
For example, one can get involved in union sections, sesame is ours, be sponsor, holding an introduction,

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Keep in sessions, sit on the board and be responsible for various events.

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,200
You can also get involved in many other non -profit associations at Örebro University.

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
For example, if you are interested in football, theater or similar.

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,160
Do you want to enter a future industry and to have easy jobs?

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,400
Do you want to work with problem solving and people's use of IT systems?

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,360
Then you should apply for the system science program at Örebro University.

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
- Then we were ready now!
 - Lovely!
