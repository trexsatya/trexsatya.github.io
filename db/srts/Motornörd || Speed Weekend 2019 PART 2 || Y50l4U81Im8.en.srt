00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,400
Episode 57, Speed Weekend on ice 2019 PART 2.
-New personal record!!

2
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,020
-Hello, there was an odd choice 
of Motorcycle to drive on the ice.

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,760
Do you think?
It's perfect.

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,600
It's a perfect motorcycle.
I will use what I have.

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,320
And this is what I have available.

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,440
-It's really beautiful.
Thank you very much, it's from 1948.

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,940
-What speed can you reach?

8
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,720
I had a top speed of 141 km/h. (87 mph)
-Oh, wow!

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,700
That is really good.
-Great!

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,620
It's only 40 hp on the rear wheel.

11
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,900
So this is no racing machine.

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,260
-Have you been here before?
Yes, I was here in 2017.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,940
I have ridden faster this year.

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,680
Now the bike has performance anxiety.

15
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,220
Come on!

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,800
What's up?
I'm fine.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,300
-We should mention why we sit in the caravan.

18
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,460
-I think no one understands 
how much noise it is here.

19
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,300
-We are in the middle of the line of fire 
and you will get an example of how it sounds here.

20
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,080
If we want some decent sound then we need to be sitting in the caravan.

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,160
It is difficult to explain Speed ​​Weekend
for those who have not been here.

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,840
There are so many different vehicles and people
which appreciate this weekend once a year.

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,760
This is the third year we run with this one.
The first year I had the original suspension.

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,880
I had skates mounted on the tires.

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,420
Then I went just 150 meters before it started 
to wobble like I was about to crash.

26
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:36,840
Last year it was rebuilt with a snowmobile 
suspension and a new skate and swing at the back.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,500
Now it is stable.

28
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,340
I'm now looking for more power so I can go faster.

29
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,300
-What's your average speed?

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,960
I think it was 92.35 km/h. (57 mph)

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,860
Last year it was 83 km/h. (51 mph)
Now we should try to turn on more power.

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,660
-Well, good luck!
Thanks!

33
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,700
Now it feels relatively stable.
It's just a little bit nasty.

34
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,580
I'm not aiming for 200 km/h (120 mph) 
but it would be nice to reach 100 km/h.(60 mph)

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,100
My name is Rickard Eklund and I'm from Åland Islands.
-Åland Islands!?

36
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,700
It is a road trip to get here.

37
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,720
-How has it gone?
I've just driven once.

38
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,300
200 meters before the finish line, 
the engine broke.

39
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,440
The entry speed was 279 km/h. (173 mph)

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,860
And it was 233 km/h out. (144 mph)

41
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,700
But I was probably around 320 km/h (200 mph)
when the engine broke.

42
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,700
Better luck next time, Hahaha.

43
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,440
On the dyno the engine was producing 920 bhp at the wheel and a little over 1,000 bhp at the flywheel.

44
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,100
I had problems with the boost pressure 
control on the straight line.

45
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,220
It couldn't hold the boost right...

46
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,880
...The boost should be 2.5 bar.

47
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,000
But the boost was 2,7-2,8 bar the whole time.

48
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,080
So I had about 100 hp too much.

49
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,560
I knew it wouldn't work.
And it didn't.

50
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,640
The cylinder head gasket went,
the cylinder head cracked and got holes in the valve.

51
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,640
We’ll see what I can do for next year.

52
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,020
It's just to start over.
-Have you started to pack up?

53
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,820
We stripped the engine yesterday
to see if it could be fixed.

54
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,660
At first we thought it was just the cylinder head gasket.

55
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,860
We removed the spark plugs since the engine was working.

56
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,840
But the hole in the valve is difficult to repair.

57
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,080
We just let it stand for now.
We can pack up later tonight or tomorrow.

58
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,360
This is the best event.

59
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,880
It is absolutely crazy to drive on the ice.
And all the people who are here.

60
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,715
You find so many strange and odd things here.
It is extreme in every way.

61
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,260
If you like a jet-kick, V8's or turbo machines.

62
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,480
There is something for everyone and it's cool.

63
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,520
There is no other event that is like this.

64
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,600
And it's only once a year.

65
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,940
-Why did you build a such a machine?

66
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,580
I helped a colleague's brother to change
an engine on his motorcycle.

67
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,180
He gave me the engine for the job
and said do something fun with it.

68
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,720
Then I found a garden tractor.

69
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,145
Everything you see is original: the plate, 
the bonnet, the plastic and the sides

70
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:14,860
The rear fenders are not original, only widened.

71
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,120
On the ice,
I have driven 152 km/h (94 mph) as average speed.

72
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,260
The top speed is 162 km/h. (100 mph)

73
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,820
-Oh my god, on a garden tractor.
It should go faster!

74
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,515
-How is it to drive?

75
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,500
It is very high.
It's not like a go-cart since you're sitting high up.

76
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,240
Yes the weight point is very high.
and it is swaying when driving.

77
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,020
Sometimes it feels like it can tip over.

78
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,660
The last round I drove I was 
almost driving over the photocell.

79
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,125
The front wheels are not often in the ground.

80
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:54,040
So you have to plan if you are going to turn.

81
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,580
It's fun, but also frightening to drive.

82
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,400
-Why Speed Weekend?

83
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,500
I saw that Hubbe Berg had
built a garden tractor.

84
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,000
I was influenced and thought it was a cool thing.

85
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,720
Well, it thanks to him.

86
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,580
This is a great event.

87
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,360
I like this and love to compete with myself.

88
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,580
-Is it just me, 
who thinks this looks dangerous?

89
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,700
Stop, stop, stop!!

90
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Stop, stop, stop!!

91
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,820
Let's lift the whole car.

92
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,860
Is it done?
Yes, this one is done anyway.

93
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,480
-What is wrong?
Have you no gears left?

94
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,740
1st and 2nd gear is still working but the rest is gone.

95
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,820
Maybe there are more gears on the junk yard?

96
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:10,000
I thought there was an accessory for the gearbox 
oil so you would get the gears back, hehehe.

97
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,800
-This was probably the weirdest 
load I've ever seen.

98
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,420
There should be room for another car underneath.

99
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,120
But that car has survived so far.

100
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,300
Mmm, but yes..

101
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,960
Loading cars should be fun.
-It looked very scary.

102
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,295
The thought was good.

103
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:31,165
Just after I took this picture
the whole ramp gave way.

104
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:34,015
We had to reinforce the ramp underneath.

105
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:37,265
Now the ramps weigh 60 kg each.

106
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,580
You learn as long as you live.
And if it goes to hell then it goes to hell.

107
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,000
It is quite easy to change the gearbox here.

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,280
Yes, would you change it now then?

109
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,035
-What have you done here?
Have you been drifting on the track?

110
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:53,085
The idea was that I would have had another car.

111
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:56,540
But the parts didn't come in time from the US.

112
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,140
I have a supercharged Ford Mustang
that I should have been driving.

113
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,760
But it is not assembled yet.

114
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,595
I will fly to the US in 2 weeks to pick up the parts.

115
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,340
-That wasn't practical!
It is cheaper to fly and pick up the parts.

116
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,880
It is absolutely crazy it should be that way.

117
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
But you get a short vacation.

118
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,020
Now we are two who will fly to the US.
We have rented a Ford Mustang cab.

119
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,360
So we'll see if we buy extra tires for it.

120
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,020
We'll see what happens, we don't really know yet.

121
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,135
-What's great about Speed ​​Weekend?
What is great...

122
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,720
...it's all odd and strange vehicles.

123
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,520
It's all people and strange vehicles.

124
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,060
We all builds strange vehicles together.

125
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,120
There are special people here.

126
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,520
It's everthing from super serious to totally crazy.

127
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,140
Just look at the Svarthålet, they are...

128
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,480
...really odd petrol heads.

129
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,180
You have to be crazy to create the thing they do.

130
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
But I want to try everything.

131
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,120
It is an event for everyone.

132
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,420
You can do so much more than just driving.

133
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,720
Talk to people and watch all the crazy builds.

134
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,440
People are very friendly.

135
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
-And you can fly airplanes.

136
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,520
We were going to check if we could take a flight later.

137
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,620
We tried the hovercraft yesterday.

138
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,000
Then we should try aircraft today
since we are not allowed to fly ourselves.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,540
We will be back next year.

140
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,800
Maybe with other stupid stuff.

141
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,460
You never know what we will bring.

142
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:44,055
It's a water rocket kick.

143
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,840
It's like an oversized
plastic bottle water rocket.

144
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,740
It's an old Compressed Natural Gas
tank from a Volvo V70.

145
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,340
The tank is rated for 200 bar.

146
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,495
It is 2/3 water and the rest is pressurised air.

147
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,480
It pushes out the water with a high force
which means that it drives on the reaction force.

148
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,940
Stand on a kick is no optimal acceleration position.

149
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,840
Especially when you accelerate
hard with a lot of G forces.

150
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,320
The best ride I have done is 
when I went in 0-80 km/h (50 mph) in 6 seconds.

151
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,860
That's is pretty good, 
is still not difficult to stand on kick.

152
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,300
But have to hold on.

153
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,500
The kick was suppose to be a quick build.

154
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,580
But unfortunately it became very detailed.
Technical nerd as I am.

155
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,640
I would guess it has taken
200-300 hours to build it.

156
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,220
100 km/h (60 mph) is the magic number for all my vehicles.

157
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:55,700
I would like to go faster than 105.2 km/h (65 mph)
That something Mobacken racing did a long time ago.

158
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,480
It would be a milestone to beat their record.

159
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:05,795
-Should we comment on how much noise it makes?

160
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:09,045
-How far away we can be, 300 meter?
Yes, something like that.

161
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:13,220
Okey, 300 meters away from the pulsjet snowmobile.

162
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,340
We'll hear it.

163
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,280
Above all, the body will feel it.

164
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,300
I know you can hear it all the way to Sandviken. 15 km (10 miles)

165
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,520
They're really great guys.

166
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,120
Now they will start soon.

167
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,320
This is enjoyable.

168
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,380
Lovely!

169
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,420
There you hear a knock sound.

170
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,700
Now they adjusting the fuel levels.

171
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,980
Now it's full throttle!

172
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,700
Wow!

173
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,520
It is wonderful!

174
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,540
We have to check how far out they will come.

175
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:24,720
As a kurriosa, the engine type does not have
has been used for something sensible since the 40s.

176
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,000
And it was not used for anything sensible in the 40's 
either since the Germans used it for the V1 missile.

177
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,160
Well, that's what is the most famous for...

178
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,640
...the application that used large pulsejet engines.

179
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,360
They were used with varying success.

180
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,200
The Germans shot many V1 missiles
against UK and some came all the way.

181
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,460
The V1 missile was called for
"buzz bomb" due to how they sound.

182
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,760
There are probably still people alive
who could testify how bad it sound.

183
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,560
I could imagine it was 
quite horrifying to hear it.

184
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,600
I think this engine differs 10% on traction.

185
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,820
We have found different information though
but it is almost the same traction.

186
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,980
However, our engine is smaller.

187
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,580
There is a V1 missile at the Arboga robot museum
for those who want to see one for real.

188
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,915
I was there and watched it and
their engine was considerably bigger.

189
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,180
Their engine rus much smother which I can understand 
since they probably used worse material.

190
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,040
And it should last longer.

191
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,900
I don't know why we started with pulsejet.

192
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,060
It's really simple technology.

193
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,980
Basically it's simple but it gets 
complicated when you peel it up.

194
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,660
Especially with durability.

195
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,620
The biggest problems the last few years are
to make the engine mounts stick together.

196
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,640
The engine becomes 4-5 cm longer when it is hot
and then the diameter also increases.

197
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,380
The engine tear off the engine mounts.

198
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,860
The good news is, we haven't found any damage 
on the engine mounts or the engine after this weekend.

199
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,020
Which feels good.

200
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,040
We made no performance increases this year.
We spend all the time on better engine mounts.

201
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,140
And it seems to have succeeded.

202
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,580
It have been many hours in front of 
the CAD program and with clues and discussions.

203
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,120
Normally, there are a lot of debate between us.

204
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,220
And usually the result is good.

205
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,380
Warning signal, please!

206
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,600
Svarthålet is aiming go faster than last year.

207
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,540
Which was 241 km/h (150 mph) on average.

208
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,400
What?!, uh, yeahhhh!

209
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,560
They got it, 258.52 km/h! (160 mph)

210
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,240
An average of 254.86 km/h. (157 mph)

211
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,160
New world record for pulsejet engines.

212
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,180
Congratulations Svarthålet!

213
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,120
258 km/h (160 mph) at top speed.

214
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,100
Absolutely crazy!
I didn't think it was possible today.

215
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,580
That was really good.

216
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,540
Congratulations Svarthålet!

217
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,000
Deeply impressed.
That was heavy metal.

218
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,540
Amazing!

219
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,920
-Personal record?
Yes exactly.

220
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,360
I didn't really believe it but suddenly it went fast.

221
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,760
Normally, I'm not used to high speed.

222
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,560
I don't do any other motorsport.

223
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,460
I think the track gets very narrow.

224
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,020
I didn't think we were going to beat any record today.

225
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,380
But the second ride was amazing and it went well.

226
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,960
It was stable and it goes straight.

227
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,860
We haven't run it since last year.

228
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,740
Sometimes we use start it at a motor show.

229
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,560
We don't do show events anymore since
It is a little bit too expensive to break just for fun.

230
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,720
We have lost interest of just starting it for fun.

231
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,960
But...

232
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,340
...it depends on who is calling.

233
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,060
254.86!

234
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,500
Hahaha, totally off sync...

235
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,560
Motornörd = Engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

236
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,560
More episodes will be translated to 
English in the near future.

237
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,760
