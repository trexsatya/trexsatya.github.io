1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,640
Doing multiple things at the same time
in order to be more efficient-

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,440
-might sound like a good idea-

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,600
-but there's a risk that
that might make you less efficient.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,400
The brain's working memory
is limited in how much it can handle-

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,960
-so too many things to focus on,
too many disturbances-

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,320
-can lead to you losing focus.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,000
You're actually not focusing
on multiple things at the same time-

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,640
-you're sharing and shifting focus-

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,880
-and you lose your concentration
every time.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,480
It can take time before you find it again
and for your brain to reset.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,320
Time that you could've used
in a better way.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,600
You might miss important information
in class-

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,760
-find it harder to learn,
accomplish less-

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,120
-and might need to bring
more school work home.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,120
At home it can take longer
to do homework or other tasks-

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,840
-than it really should.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,360
That's not very efficient.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,200
So it's best to do one thing at a time-

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,520
-and reduce the number of times
you're disturbed or change tasks.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,600
So try to reduce the risk
of you being distracted.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,960
Find a place that suits you.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,440
Think about what distracts you
and what makes you focus better.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,120
A calm place often works well.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,080
Planning what you should do, and when,
reduces the risk of you changing tasks.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,560
Split large tasks into smaller chunks.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,160
This increases the chance
of you staying focused.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,680
Set aside a special time for tasks
that require a lot of concentration.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,240
Then it's extra important
not to be distracted.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,720
If there's something on your mind-

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,880
-you can try to set a time
when you can think about it.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,720
Put your phone away,
turn off notifications-

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,640
-and tell your friends and family
that you're busy.

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,080
By focusing on one thing at a time
and relieving the working memory-

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,000
-you can increase your focus
and concentration.

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,840
That can then make you more efficient-

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
-both when it comes to learning
and time management.
