1
00:00:01.565 --> 00:00:03.845
one of the most important

2
00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:06.795
the sentences when you learn a language

3
00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:07.795
Is this one

4
00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:09.045
aha

5
00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:11.225
is it sooo they say

6
00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:14.365
I will explain why I think so

7
00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:17.385
In this video and also

8
00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:19.925
bring up some words that are good to be able to

9
00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:22.955
When we talk about reading and listening

10
00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:24.945
So then we drive

11
00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:28.685
Hello Hello and welcome to Swedish with Kalle

12
00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:32.385
In this movie I think

13
00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:35.205
once again talk about why it is important

14
00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.485
to listen and read a lot

15
00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:41.555
and I was going to take up

16
00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.745
a few words here that are about just this

17
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:45.745
-—-—-

18
00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.355
hear the language a lot, read the language a lot

19
00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:50.505
and see the language a lot

20
00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:54.215
one might call it inflow

21
00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:57.285
with a nice word it's like the language

22
00:00:57.285 --> 00:01:00.175
flows in, flowing in, ie that is

23
00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:03.315
you receive, what you hear, what you see

24
00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:05.885
not what you produce yourself

25
00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:09.165
It can be called inflow

26
00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:12.405
If one wants to, flow is much like running

27
00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:15.995
Often you use the English word input

28
00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:19.495
instead and there is more to put in then

29
00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.355
But that is the side of language

30
00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:25.195
learning that is about that

31
00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:28.555
receive the language, not to talk and write yourself

32
00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:32.225
Sometimes you say that you

33
00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.995
exposes to the language

34
00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.445
expose

35
00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:39.865
one can expose oneself to the sun

36
00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:43.185
for example, that the sun is shining on a

37
00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.425
to expose oneself to the language is

38
00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:47.425
Simply to

39
00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:50.795
listen and read, do different things

40
00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:53.455
so that one hears the language

41
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.520
And read the language

42
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.080
and another way of saying that is to

43
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.120
expose oneself to the language

44
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.785
and it's really a little negative word

45
00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:07.695
expose themselves to

46
00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:10.535
But there you try to catch this particular

47
00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:13.665
that it can be a bit difficult and a little hard

48
00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:16.475
A little overwhelming

49
00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:19.565
To hear much of a new language

50
00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:22.045
or read something that is difficult too

51
00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:25.735
so it is that one dares to go in

52
00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:28.515
and listen and read a lot

53
00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.545
Although it is difficult, you can say that you are exposed to

54
00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:34.445
the language, this is anyway

55
00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:37.665
extremely important, to get a lot

56
00:02:37.665 --> 00:02:38.665
inflow

57
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.855
to hear a lot and see a lot

58
00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:45.045
And that is also the standard tip

59
00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:48.015
If someone asks, how should I learn a language

60
00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:51.475
so many will say, watch TV

61
00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:53.855
listen to the radio

62
00:02:53.855 --> 00:02:56.835
read things to

63
00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:58.465
expose yourself to the language

64
00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.175
And this is absolutely true but

65
00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:04.215
I think you can think a little about

66
00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:07.245
What is it that is important

67
00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:08.925
what is it you are looking for

68
00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:12.685
and how to do

69
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:16.075
And then I think there are three good words here

70
00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:19.435
so there are three good words but they catch too

71
00:03:19.575 --> 00:03:21.315
what one wanna try to do

72
00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:25.115
and the words I wrote up here were

73
00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:28.205
The words note

74
00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:31.555
as can also be said

75
00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:35.265
with the expression notify

76
00:03:35.265 --> 00:03:38.235
notify and it is simply to see

77
00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:41.225
To focus on

78
00:03:41.225 --> 00:03:44.245
So when you listen you note

79
00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:46.835
or notice important things

80
00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:49.875
It may be words that are new to you

81
00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.935
Then you think aha, that word, it was important

82
00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:56.015
I want to be able to, then you note that word

83
00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:59.155
and then you can also say that you are

84
00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.815
attentive to important words

85
00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:04.965
you are attentive to or

86
00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:07.105
You pay attention

87
00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:11.165
So it's simply about concentration

88
00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:13.835
and focus, and that not only

89
00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:16.285
read and listen without concentrating

90
00:04:16.285 --> 00:04:19.425
Without noting

91
00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:21.815
to notice

92
00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:24.595
to notice

93
00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:26.745
to be attentive to

94
00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:30.015
that's what you are going to do when you

95
00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:32.265
actively trying to improve your language

96
00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:33.965
By reading and listening

97
00:04:34.595 --> 00:04:37.525
and that's where I come to this phrase then

98
00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:40.085
as i think .... or so i think in all fals, that's my own phrase

99
00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:43.165
But I often think if I read in English

100
00:04:43.165 --> 00:04:45.945
that is my best second language

101
00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:48.655
So I read a book or I watch a series

102
00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:51.535
And then just: "Aha, that's how you say"

103
00:04:51.975 --> 00:04:54.565
is that as they express it

104
00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:57.185
Is there the way there is the expression?

105
00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:01.025
so that one notes how

106
00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:03.965
a writer or a person

107
00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:06.260
in a television program

108
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.840
actually talk

109
00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:11.665
and you can say a lot about this

110
00:05:11.665 --> 00:05:14.675
by translating to learn

111
00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:18.035
But of course one must translate

112
00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:21.045
and one has to ask

113
00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:23.755
How do I say this in Swedish

114
00:05:23.755 --> 00:05:26.905
We can discuss that more in another video

115
00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:30.245
for it is important to translate and of course

116
00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:33.005
translates and looking for,

117
00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:36.505
so to say one starts in one's own language

118
00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:39.565
This expression is in my language

119
00:05:39.565 --> 00:05:41.015
How do I say it in Swedish

120
00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:44.025
But I think many

121
00:05:44.605 --> 00:05:47.305
translates too much and focuses

122
00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:50.235
too much on it, instead of making sure that

123
00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:53.105
Get a lot, a lot of inflow

124
00:05:53.105 --> 00:05:56.225
so that they learn the language from the fact that

125
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:59.085
actually hear it and read it

126
00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:02.045
by people who are good

127
00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:05.175
In Swedish because then it becomes more

128
00:06:05.175 --> 00:06:06.445
yeah, is that how you say that

129
00:06:06.845 --> 00:06:09.355
If you understand what you read

130
00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:12.375
If you understand what you hear, then you can pick the important

131
00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:15.345
the expressions directly from the Swedish instead

132
00:06:15.345 --> 00:06:18.335
To try to take something in your own language

133
00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:20.255
and find it in Swedish

134
00:06:20.805 --> 00:06:21.965
-—-—-

135
00:06:22.345 --> 00:06:23.345
-—-—-

136
00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:27.165
and this is at least as important

137
00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:28.815
like translating, if I say so then

138
00:06:29.295 --> 00:06:31.685
because

139
00:06:32.675 --> 00:06:35.505
Can't learn a language

140
00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:38.475
Without getting much exposure

141
00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:41.505
much inflow, much input

142
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:44.535
to expose oneself to the language, because you have to hear

143
00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:47.265
How those who speak Swedish and write Swedish

144
00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:50.515
In fact, expresses themselves

145
00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:53.345
This is where you find the natural language

146
00:06:53.345 --> 00:06:55.715
The genuine language

147
00:06:56.535 --> 00:06:59.035
And it is then different then then

148
00:06:59.035 --> 00:07:01.885
If you read academic text you will find that language

149
00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:04.695
Do you listen to a hip hop song

150
00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:07.445
so you find another language but that is there

151
00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:10.415
You will find the Swedish

152
00:07:10.415 --> 00:07:12.895
and be aware of how

153
00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:16.565
the one you read or listen to

154
00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:19.875
actually expresses themselves and especially then

155
00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:22.815
Focus on such things as you need

156
00:07:22.935 --> 00:07:25.955
so that when you read a text

157
00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:28.805
And then you see an expression that you understand

158
00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:31.915
And then you think, aha, that's how the Swedes say

159
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.280
When they are surprised,

160
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.900
is that how the Swedes say when they want to express something polite

161
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.560
is that so a Swede expresses himself

162
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.560
When he or she is angry or cursed

163
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.220
and take those expressions step by step

164
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.420
either just note them a little

165
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.980
So that you stop a little, aha ...

166
00:07:52.575 --> 00:07:54.575
or maybe write down

167
00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:57.815
one cannot write everything

168
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.780
one can write down the most important

169
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.920
But you can still stop yourself, instead of just reading on

170
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:07.195
and think, okay

171
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:10.155
there was an important expression

172
00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:12.235
So you say, so you express yourself

173
00:08:13.045 --> 00:08:14.045
-—-—-

174
00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:17.305
my feeling as a sfile teacher

175
00:08:17.305 --> 00:08:18.965
is that many miss this

176
00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:22.265
I give a lot of texts and input

177
00:08:22.265 --> 00:08:25.155
But when a person is to write, then the phone goes

178
00:08:25.155 --> 00:08:27.965
and the lexicon and Google forward

179
00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:31.135
and then one begins to try to translate instead of

180
00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:34.265
Remove that layer, of the storage room

181
00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:37.205
of phrases and words one has received

182
00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:40.560
from textbooks, texts we read

183
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.520
otherwise one has exposed to

184
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.360
exposed to

185
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.520
So I think you build up your storage room of words

186
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.575
and phrases and expressions

187
00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:54.485
By collecting things from

188
00:08:54.485 --> 00:08:57.505
your inflow, from what you hear

189
00:08:57.505 --> 00:08:58.505
and what you read

190
00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:01.985
So if you want to be good in Swedish

191
00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:04.755
and don't read and listen a lot

192
00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:07.735
Then you have to get in a way to start doing

193
00:09:07.735 --> 00:09:10.775
You can't learn Swedish

194
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.860
just by talking a little bit at school

195
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.060
and listen to your teacher

196
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.360
you need a massive, a large

197
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.880
a large amount of Swedish in your life

198
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.855
every day

199
00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:27.635
It is the only chance to become good at the language

200
00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:29.005
I think

201
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.280
So do you want tips and help with it

202
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.080
So maybe we can discuss it

203
00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:37.895
people usually ask about movies sometimes

204
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.800
I don't watch so much at Swedish film so I'm not so good at tips about that

205
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.800
But as I said, the most important thing is to find something

206
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.080
that you think is fun to

207
00:09:47.085 --> 00:09:50.395
listen to and read and that are

208
00:09:50.395 --> 00:09:53.875
on an okay level, it must not be too hard

209
00:09:53.935 --> 00:09:56.235
Because then you lose motivation

210
00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:58.295
-—-—-

211
00:09:58.715 --> 00:10:00.105
so think about this

212
00:10:00.465 --> 00:10:03.645
How can you increase the inflow of Swedish so that you get

213
00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.765
More experiences of

214
00:10:06.585 --> 00:10:08.895
aha, is that the way they say

215
00:10:08.895 --> 00:10:11.075
is that the way they write

216
00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:14.355
There you have a huge key

217
00:10:14.355 --> 00:10:17.105
to learn Swedish

218
00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:18.525
And get better

219
00:10:19.025 --> 00:10:22.075
Okay, that was

220
00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:25.505
ask, comment, discuss

221
00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:28.475
and have a great day

222
00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:30.685
So we will be heard and see you again soon;
