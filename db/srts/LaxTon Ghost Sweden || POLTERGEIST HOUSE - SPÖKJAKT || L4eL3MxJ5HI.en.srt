1
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,526
There are many houses around the world, in which paranormal phenomena happen.

2
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:04,132
The house that really stands out is a house located at 24 Jelen Rynek, in Poland.

3
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:12,878
There are many stories surrounding the house and no one really knows the source of the evil that resides there.

4
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,296
Other families left the house very quickly. Within 10 years, more than 30 families have moved out.

5
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:19,783
That's right, no one has stayed that long.

6
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:20,548
Around 1940, a house is built for a family and their two children. As soon as they moved in, the parents started arguing.

7
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:28,666
It even goes so far that the father in the family abuses the wife and children.

8
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:39,802
Time passes and after a couple of years the children disappear under mysterious circumstances.

9
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:48,145
A rumor spreads in the village that it is the father who has murdered the children and that they are buried in the basement.

10
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:55,882
The parents flee the country and during a house search bloody tools are found in the basement.

11
00:03:55,882 --> 00:04:00,827
But the remains of the children were never found.

12
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:12,641
In 1961, a new family moved into the house. Those who have now moved in start calling the police about strange phenomena starting to happen in the house.

13
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:24,235
They hear someone walking in the attic, things are thrown in rooms where no one is, and the daughter of the family screams in the middle of the night, which wakes the whole family up.

14
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:30,440
When the parents enter the daughter's room, she is hovering above her bed.

15
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:41,768
It went so far that the Catholic Church sent priests to the house to perform an exorcism.

16
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:49,026
Despite attempts to clean the house, no one has succeeded in making it completely calm.

17
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:58,714
We have now been around and tried to interview people, Simon has helped. Do the stories match? We have tried our best, unfortunately not many people want to join.

18
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:32,376
So I still think that we have received very good things from those who are here in the immediate area.

19
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:35,149
So exciting to see what happens here tonight.

20
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:07,815
Then we are here in the Poltergeist house here in Poland. We also have here and did a live, it can be seen on the website.

21
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:16,870
We recognize this house, we have been here before with Spökjakt, a lot happened then. Danjal was dragged in the leg, banging in the house and things being thrown.

22
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:24,665
So there is a lot that happens and is said to happen here. Over 30 families are said to have fled here.

23
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:30,321
And earlier today, very interestingly, we got Theodor through during our live broadcast from here.

24
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:43,436
And a witness outside, an elderly man, talks about how there were two Theodors here. A father named Theodor and he named his son Theodor Jr. So we got that confirmed very quickly.

25
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:52,323
He was also able to tell that an exorcism has been performed here in the house, so that is also confirmed and it is super interesting for the evening.

26
00:06:52,323 --> 00:07:02,480
It's time to go inside, the surveillance cameras are ready. We will test different sessions, we have Simon from Poland who will translate some Polish words that come through.

27
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:10,803
Mixed sessions, we will go through the basement and up to the attic. But we will first go into the living area itself.

28
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:11,729
We go in.

29
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:17,539
As I said, we were here and played a live and it feels...

30
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:23,945
it feels different in the house, I don't know how to say.

31
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:32,762
I got chills immediately when we entered, just standing in the hall. And now it's also much quieter, we don't have the traffic outside.

32
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:40,000
We have installed k2 meters. 6 pcs, Rem Teddy is there too.

33
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,736
And if something comes close, they will react. We have some balls too, Niclas.

34
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:53,278
Shall we place them on the piano here? If something is thrown.

35
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:08,125
We allocate a little bit.

36
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:11,856
PRP there.

37
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,991
We put a parascope here.

38
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:31,629
We will mix Swedish and English, Simon will run a session in Polish later.

39
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:38,305
If there's anybody in here with us, can you come up with any of the things that are on the floor here?

40
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:08,514
I shivered when I said his name, it was strange. Theodor was something that came through on our live broadcast, several times.

41
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:13,667
And as I said was confirmed by someone we spoke to out here.

42
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:19,701
Immediately!

43
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,193
I got a pain here in the side, like something was stabbing me.

44
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:36,161
It's cool, when I try to film it keeps getting out of focus.

45
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:41,965
And it is classic from here, that it is not possible to focus, many say that it is not possible to focus the image.

46
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:45,265
What shivers, it's really freezing in here.

47
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:47,166
You called for him and this is what we get.

48
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,851
Direct answer.

49
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:04,180
I'll try an Ovilus at the same time and see if I can get any communication with him.

50
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:19,122
It's interesting though that it stops here..

51
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:20,602
now it continues.

52
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,650
It's wandering around now.

53
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:33,443
There it disappeared.

54
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:42,825
I have a hell of a lot of discomfort from the doorway. By a great deal of discomfort I mean it feels like I'm being watched and when I look over there quickly...

55
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:48,200
then it feels like someone is standing there. It's a little hard to focus because we have a surveillance camera there.

56
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,648
Yesterday we saw a little child walking, a black shadow walking there.

57
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:55,653
Now at Ovilus we got..

58
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,894
Now a lot comes through here.

59
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:24,796
Theodor, are you the one who murdered your children?

60
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:34,252
Now I get pain in my back, it jumped from here up to my left shoulder. It's like I've been carrying a camera for a very long time.

61
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:39,200
Now it starts to ache in the entire spine, as if it is taking energy from you.

62
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,531
I asked about this with the children.

63
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:54,298
Did you strangle your children?

64
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:20,699
I think we put PRP here.

65
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:44,986
Touch the antenna.

66
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,730
As soon as I said that, I start to shiver, my back gets cold.

67
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,378
Do it?

68
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:14,871
Shit I shiver...

69
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:32,842
Throw that cross down if you don't believe.

70
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,582
I think we're moving on, we're leaving this room.

71
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:51,686
Now we are in the room where the radio was before, now it has been removed. But it was here before, in the corner.

72
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:54,886
I put the PRP here on the couch.

73
00:13:54,886 --> 00:14:00,000
More symbols of God and Jesus.

74
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,507
Yes.

75
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:10,836
What was that sound?

76
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,562
Is that the floor?

77
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,630
It sounded like something bounced...

78
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,593
The surveillance image is behaving strangely.

79
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:24,212
Show your power here now. You have caused so many families to flee from here.

80
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,408
The picture is slow and blurry.

81
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,560
Are you mad that we're here?

82
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,187
I have slight dizziness, it spun once.

83
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:02,630
Who are you? Why are you here and why are you attacking people?

84
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,788
You pushed a person down the stairs here.

85
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,496
Why did you push him?

86
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,597
The picture is still slow and blurry.

87
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:17,686
So you mean he slipped?

88
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:20,138
You weren't the one who did it?

89
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:24,155
If it wasn't you who did it, tap once somewhere.

90
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:29,572
2 knocks and some strange noise.

91
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:33,056
Can you knock like this?

92
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:39,197
2 knocks.

93
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:43,918
This painting here has been thrown down. Can you throw it down?

94
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:47,142
After Tony knocks on the room, the surveillance freezes.

95
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:59,055
If you don't like the Jesus symbol here, throw the painting down.

96
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:06,298
Then the image drops again, could the house have done this so we wouldn't get anything on film at the board?

97
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:13,411
Every time I say it, I get chills down my spine. A chill creeps behind me..

98
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,670
Forced boy.

99
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:41,952
It's a theory we're thinking about, the dark that's here, maybe it forced the father Theodor, or the son, we don't really know which of them it is, to do things.

100
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:52,840
Did you become obsessed with something?

101
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,075
Do you have the Flux on you?

102
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,450
Yes.

103
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,829
What came in here now? Now you can also communicate with this flashing light, soon it will be blue.

104
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,780
Did you become obsessed with something?

105
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:21,942
Were there six people possessed here? There are over thirty families who have left here.

106
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,171
I'm just going to check here quickly.

107
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,466
Throw some china.

108
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,094
There is a lot of crack here. It's because we walk on the floor, it creaks all the time.

109
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:06,437
Every time you say something, it creaks, but it's the floor.

110
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:12,975
Has there been anything here that is connected to Auschwitz

111
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:18,851
All this tragedy and evil that was there.

112
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:25,187
Did it accumulate and come here to this house somehow?

113
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,693
It's only 20 minutes from here.

114
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:34,782
We have the theory that German was also here doing his shit..

115
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:41,089
Come into this room.

116
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,468
Touch the blue light here.

117
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:50,277
If we have any children here..

118
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:04,164
We have an underground cellar down there. With rammed earth floor.

119
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:07,540
You don't know about the children's...

120
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:16,766
We go down there, we take the two of them and go down there.

121
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:19,137
Okay, we follow what Ovilus says.

122
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,522
We know where it is.

123
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:21,940
We're going down there right now.

124
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,679
Take the Flux with you.

125
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:33,843
Now we go down into the basement here and those of you who have seen the first time we were here with Spökjakt, it was down here that I saw this rock that fell.

126
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:46,534
After all, it said Soil, so we go straight to the soil trampled floor.

127
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:48,288
Lay the instrument out on the ground there.

128
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,661
Here we have soil. 

129
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:56,200
It has a very low ceiling.

130
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,841
We're down here now.

131
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:02,999
Kill.

132
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,258
Were you buried here?

133
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,737
Are the children buried here?

134
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:38,974
Were you murdered in this room?

135
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,544
Nothing here.

136
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,440
We'll take the next room too.

137
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:01,231
If Theodor is here...

138
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:06,854
walk up to any of the equipment and we'll know you're still in this house.

139
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,235
It feels like it's just moving around us.

140
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,654
Come down here. If you are here with us..

141
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,073
come down and touch these lamps.

142
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:28,307
We got 6 up there too.

143
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:35,842
Are there six spirits left here?

144
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:38,595
Who are you then?

145
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:54,137
Do you know you are dead?

146
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:02,323
Strange noise in the basement.

147
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:03,807
Wait..!

148
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,240
A voice that Tony hears.

149
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,874
It sounded like...

150
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:16,380
..it sounded like a child..

151
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:38,251
I thought I saw something black right here.

152
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:44,425
It might have been my eyes playing tricks on me when I looked into the lamp. But it looked like something black was there.

153
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:49,100
Not big at all, very low...

154
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:52,802
Did I just see you?

155
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,632
Touch the lights if you're in here now.

156
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,000
We're shifting a bit, you can try standing here. Then we'll see if you get something through.

157
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,480
And if it's a little bit calmer here, we'll get up to the attic.

158
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,641
If there's a child here, can you come in here and ring that bell that's over there?

159
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:23,748
Can we hear your voice?

160
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:31,920
You can come in and grab this iron stick or walk up to the light flashing over here.

161
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:36,100
I'll start Ovilus too, see what it tells me.

162
00:23:54,781 --> 00:24:01,755
The battery dropped quite quickly from 75 and now it stands at 66.

163
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:07,977
The figure 6 has been pretty consistent here.

164
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:12,972
It could have been an ir light, otherwise you got a light phenomenon at you. Or a reflection.

165
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:18,388
It may have been a reflection.

166
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:24,800
Are we just going to test a theory, we pull out the cable, we have a surveillance camera here...

167
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:38,542
Sometimes it happens that there is more activity when it is not documented in the same way. So we try pulling the cable out here. Then we'll see what happens.

168
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,201
Immediately!

169
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:46,101
You see, right away!

170
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:49,810
You don't want to be filmed from the front, do you?

171
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:54,208
I don't know if you feel it, but it was a completely different feeling in here.

172
00:24:54,208 --> 00:25:00,000
There was a shiver behind my back that went as I stood there doing it.

173
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:02,486
Always.

174
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:06,280
It's goosebumps deluxe when I'm standing in here now.

175
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:18,196
It is an extreme discomfort from here. At that doorway.

176
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,019
Do you mean them here or?

177
00:25:57,027 --> 00:26:00,647
It said Scratch and heard...

178
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,416
We might feel someone scratching.

179
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:12,511
Okay, we'll try putting the monitoring back in then.

180
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:21,580
Then we plug it in. I'll see if anything happens, I've been keeping track of this for a while.

181
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:45,200
We're doing this Tony, we're going up in the attic.

182
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:52,605
It was on this staircase that Danjal was pushed.

183
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:54,665
Here somewhere he was stuck with his leg.

184
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:55,694
Right.

185
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:05,053
You can also see here that we have a doll that we found here at the place.

186
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:13,132
We put a motion detector behind, in case something gets in. And you know how they sound, they say Hello welcome.

187
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,970
This doll..

188
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:27,793
this doll is very, very special.

189
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:32,956
Missing a leg too. I'm putting a PRP in front of her here and we'll see what happens.

190
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:46,789
Where you stand Niclas, that's where Danjal got pulled in the leg. It was also here that we heard the loud bang, loud noises, like the building shaking.

191
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:49,062
We have the boxes here.

192
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:51,387
The suitcases. They are completely empty.

193
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,378
Scraping noise and a high tone

194
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:03,413
What was that?

195
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:04,338
Huh?

196
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,305
A loud note..

197
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:28,023
Bang out there.

198
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:32,800
It's a special feeling up here.

199
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:41,331
It was so intense up here when we were here. You have to keep that in the back of your mind when you move around here.

200
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,935
Sound down there.

201
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:01,702
Shall we put the Flux down there?

202
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:03,175
Do it.

203
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:16,445
I keep the flashlight on so I don't hit my head on the beams.

204
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:35,425
We have traffic, we have a major highway a little further away, we have cars passing by...

205
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:39,195
it's very late here, so we don't understand why cars are going...

206
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,866
I'll also say it's Sunday.

207
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:50,000
And we don't wear microphones, it's because we want to hear all these sounds. Because there are so many things that have been thrown away...

208
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:51,280
Exactly.

209
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,399
Thrown stuff.

210
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,529
I'm going down with this one.

211
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,081
I'm coming with.

212
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:15,458
I can barely get here..

213
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:35,490
Very strong.

214
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,787
If you back off a little, I can get closer to you.

215
00:30:46,897 --> 00:30:50,745
There it backed up, good! It listens.

216
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:08,650
Do you notice that it immediately follows your commands?

217
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,935
Is that Theodore?

218
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:40,589
Now it went behind you.

219
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:47,366
And then we got movement in that direction, I think.

220
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,224
It really follows what you say.

221
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:18,360
Now I saw something, something white behind you. A little further up on the right. I thought it was a human.

222
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:22,385
I can't focus at all now... here it comes.

223
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:32,574
You know like you see in a ghost movie, something transparent? It was up at the edge there.

224
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:37,279
It looked like a...

225
00:32:47,943 --> 00:32:51,974
We'll test the theory and pull the surveillance out here.

226
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:09,387
Where do you mean exactly as you saw it?

227
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,806
Diagonally up there, we have a small point of light there in the ceiling. You see the slanted ceiling?

228
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,244
There yes.

229
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:18,136
And then maybe one and a half meters down.

230
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:19,743
Yes, there.

231
00:33:35,255 --> 00:33:37,100
Now it's just us here.

232
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:44,369
It becomes completely out of focus when I stand here.

233
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:06,980
So, you get it on command. You control it somehow.

234
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,803
It also jumps around, I want to be able to communicate with it.

235
00:34:11,803 --> 00:34:15,117
Somehow I get a calmness throughout my body, a sense of security.

236
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:18,059
So what's here isn't...

237
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:24,596
evil in any way. But it can also be false security.

238
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:33,300
That's exactly where it is.

239
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:37,567
Then it disappears, it's so fucking crazy.

240
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,794
If it's the children here, come near me.

241
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:54,134
My theory is that it's something pretending to be calm. But still a discomfort came back now.

242
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,881
There.

243
00:35:04,093 --> 00:35:07,694
Wondering why it listens to me when I tell it to reverse..

244
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:22,285
Green there.

245
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:42,783
I'll turn this off now and then I'll test Ovilus. Testing if they want to say their name. It's strange, we got Beast and Gone there before, right?

246
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:43,775
Yes.

247
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:46,416
If it is the one who is here..

248
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:56,644
The one who moves in here. And you stand on a spot where we were before, so the whole house shook.

249
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:57,850
Right.

250
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:10,836
I'm pulled away from here, I'm pulled this way.

251
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,917
We'll go there then.

252
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,808
I plug this one back in.

253
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,324
We got well too. We've had that before.

254
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:38,674
The theory is also that the children were thrown into a well that was covered with stone.

255
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,816
Give us a sign that you are up here with us now.

256
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:53,240
A loud sound would be great.

257
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:56,197
Or knock us over.

258
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:58,744
Throw something.

259
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,894
Is this your doll?

260
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,598
Say what you wish.

261
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,718
We wish this doll would fly off the chair.

262
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:20,413
Can you do it?

263
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:51,232
Can you throw something in here?

264
00:37:57,715 --> 00:38:06,471
I'm thinking like this now Tony, we know what it was like when we did the live stream, spiritbox. Then it started.

265
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:09,158
We bring in Simon as well.

266
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:13,459
I'm going to get the Flux down there, but should we leave this one?

267
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:19,440
We can leave it on. Take the Flux and we'll go back into the house.

268
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:42,049
Now we're outside, we brought Simon here too.

269
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:12,192
Who's in here with us?

270
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:24,040
Is Theodor here with us?

271
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:35,343
"Maybe"

272
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:55,127
What dark entity is in this house?

273
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,741
Are you from Germany?

274
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:41,824
"Yes"

275
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,542
What do you want?

276
00:41:59,488 --> 00:42:01,247
Are you mad at us?

277
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,950
"Move"

278
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,433
It just said roughly stick or move yourselves.

279
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,282
Where are we going?

280
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:31,398
"Up"

281
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:47,541
When we are going up to the attic this happens with the camera.

282
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,398
If you are up here make a loud noise.

283
00:43:28,331 --> 00:43:31,131
Have you lived here?

284
00:43:43,598 --> 00:43:48,782
Do you want us into the dark room?

285
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:05,211
Did we see you?

286
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,829
Can you make the house shake?

287
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:31,288
"Yes"

288
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:52,070
Are you standing here?

289
00:44:57,363 --> 00:45:00,541
"Standing here"

290
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:10,233
Why are you here?

291
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:15,527
"I don't know"

292
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:27,762
What's your name?

293
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:05,088
Is there a dark entity with us up here?

294
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,381
Are you standing here?

295
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:26,496
Shall we go there?

296
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:11,902
"Go"

297
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:24,046
We're going down now. We've been testing up here and trying to get in touch. We have something down the corner and we see now that Simon is communicating in his language that he is constantly getting answers.

298
00:47:24,046 --> 00:47:27,473
We will also test Este's method on Simon.

299
00:49:18,411 --> 00:49:20,110
"Go"

300
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,018
There we got a Go.

301
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:36,683
"You can"

302
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:47,566
We ask many questions but no answer.

303
00:49:56,849 --> 00:49:58,514
I think we're breaking here.

304
00:49:58,514 --> 00:50:01,843
We decide to switch communication tools to Ghostbox.

305
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:25,439
"I am"

306
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:33,007
I just asked if the children are still on this land.

307
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:36,091
Are they buried here?

308
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,577
"Yes"

309
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,343
I thought I heard something...

310
00:51:02,941 --> 00:51:05,096
Behind here..

311
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,432
"Yes"

312
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:14,866
Okay, you are in that room then.

313
00:51:23,574 --> 00:51:25,918
"Yes"

314
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:33,442
"Quiet"

315
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,196
He doesn't want you to talk to him.

316
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,730
"Yes"

317
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:56,094
"He's listening"

318
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,832
Battery drains very quickly, from 26 to 19%.

319
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:11,457
We must break soon.

320
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:16,543
We must break soon or we will lose this.

321
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:17,646
"I see"

322
00:52:21,981 --> 00:52:23,134
Shall we break there then?

323
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:24,608
We do it.

324
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:28,146
So we don't lose the session, so we change the battery.

325
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:30,631
"Yeah, go"

326
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:29,202
Lennie, now we've changed a bit. Tony got in the car with Simon so you and I get in and you get to run a Paranormal Puck.

327
00:53:29,202 --> 00:53:42,644
I have this in my pocket. Paranormal Puck 2. I also have the phone where we type the questions.

328
00:53:42,644 --> 00:53:48,436
We test everything possible here because we are in contact with something dark in there. So we'll see.

329
00:53:55,955 --> 00:53:57,649
I'll put it down there.

330
00:53:57,649 --> 00:54:18,625
We put the Puck down by the instruments. Your phone will flash a bit, but it's just iphones, they flash. Now we see all the dots there, it has nothing to do with this feature.

331
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,060
Shall we start asking questions then Niclas?

332
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:23,491
Write and ask if Theodor is here.

333
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:29,793
Is Theodor here?

334
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:39,504
Memories of Theodor are here.

335
00:54:54,196 --> 00:55:06,085
You can also say that, if it is a demon that has been here from the beginning. They did an exorcism here, so we're starting to understand that it's back here.

336
00:55:16,788 --> 00:55:24,908
I know it goes down in the basement too. There is a dirt floor there, so you can interpret that as dirt, perhaps.

337
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:30,000
We've had that theory, but we also believe when we go down there, we don't get anything, but it's up here.

338
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,174
But if we say that everything has started down there, in the earth floor, it is not entirely impossible that the dark has been projected from there.

339
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:50,000
And got into the building here. Because it is precisely in this room that there is the greatest discomfort. The wind is decent, but it's here. You feel the most here, I think.

340
00:56:04,002 --> 00:56:06,021
Didn't get an answer..

341
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:11,835
Very interesting actually because something always comes through.

342
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:20,641
When you asked that question, if something is buried in the dirt... nothing came of it.

343
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:23,708
Almost like our theory is starting to hold true.

344
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:59,526
Maybe through the camera then. Or the other surveillance camera.

345
00:56:59,526 --> 00:57:03,906
I shiver. Damn I'm starting to shiver.

346
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:24,866
Damn awesome! I'm thinking if you should ask about something Christian..

347
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:16,081
It's also damn exciting, if it were to be. They want us to think it's a nun, something religious, but that it's something else trying to influence.

348
00:58:33,606 --> 00:58:36,237
Then there is no one who likes the religious.

349
00:58:36,237 --> 00:58:39,077
*What's being recorded now scares us*

350
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:43,184
*It's just Lennie and Niclas in the room, but a voice is being recorded laughing or growling at us.*

351
00:58:43,184 --> 00:58:44,561
There was another voice!

352
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:46,099
What was that?

353
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:49,426
Someone else was also laughing with us.

354
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:52,830
What the hell was that Niclas?

355
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:57,341
There was another voice laughing at the exact same time as you.

356
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:01,449
Who called Jesus Christ a Witch.

357
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:04,812
Now we're starting to talk, now maybe he's here.

358
00:59:21,956 --> 00:59:23,900
Kind of like Niclas.

359
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,881
It almost starts saying my name.

360
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:33,891
There was another voice that came in.

361
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:36,889
So damn clear it was.

362
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:40,389
A real  laugh. When we both laughed, it laughed with us.

363
00:59:56,769 --> 00:59:58,041
No answer.

364
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:04,892
Now there is no nun anymore. When it called Jesus Christ a Witch.

365
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:09,603
Now I haven't even written anything and had to sneak.

366
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:16,317
And that means sneaking up on someone.

367
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:18,107
Exactly.

368
01:00:18,107 --> 01:00:22,410
And you didn't even write anything?

369
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,558
No nothing.

370
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:25,998
Okay.

371
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:32,399
But that was so damn uncomfortable. Damn how unpleasant.

372
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:39,741
That's why I want to film with a microphone, because then we capture everything. If we had something else, we probably wouldn't have gotten it. It was perfectly clean!

373
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:48,646
There was one more voice. We got a dark, dark voice through ghostbox.

374
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:57,898
We go into where the painting and the cross are, bring Paranormal Puck there. We ask a few questions there.

375
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:15,989
Something is moving in the kitchen.

376
01:01:15,989 --> 01:01:16,744
Did you hear?

377
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:18,319
What was that?

378
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,958
Something sounded out there.

379
01:01:28,948 --> 01:01:31,630
It sounded like cutlery...

380
01:01:40,568 --> 01:01:42,814
It sounded like it came from the kitchen.

381
01:01:56,777 --> 01:02:00,773
There are teacups up there, wonder if it was one that sounded?

382
01:02:00,773 --> 01:02:02,987
I ask a question.

383
01:02:08,817 --> 01:02:11,040
Evp is recorded.

384
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,589
"Man's voice"

385
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,440
So it's a lot down to the basement there.

386
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,382
It's sick when we talk about children and digging.

387
01:02:36,382 --> 01:02:51,950
Paranormal Puck stands there and you stand there. What if we put it exactly on the floor? Because right below there is the dirt.

388
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:54,222
What if it's some sort of portal?

389
01:02:54,222 --> 01:02:57,218
I think it's really uncomfortable going into the kitchen now.

390
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,117
But it was the porcelain that sounded. We have previously asked if they can move something there.

391
01:03:18,124 --> 01:03:20,945
It's like they're stuck there...

392
01:03:23,822 --> 01:03:27,936
so they keep them there in the basement, but I'm wondering why.

393
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:36,325
What they should have done here is dig out the bottom of the house. See what they get out there, if there are bones...

394
01:03:36,325 --> 01:03:40,845
if anything, certain energies remain tied to this house.

395
01:03:40,845 --> 01:03:43,031
Shall we test the kinect in here?

396
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:43,784
We can do that.

397
01:03:43,784 --> 01:03:48,543
We'll go around in here and see if we can get an up mapping. We got some good stuff on Paranormal Puck.

398
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:49,508
Really.

399
01:03:49,508 --> 01:03:51,707
So we go get it.

400
01:04:03,023 --> 01:04:08,371
Do we have anyone in this room with us? Show yourself now!

401
01:04:23,255 --> 01:04:25,226
Come into this room now.

402
01:04:28,218 --> 01:04:30,050
Back to bed.

403
01:04:35,689 --> 01:04:38,688
I stand here and look at the piano.

404
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:53,798
It's like it's creeping around..

405
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:56,394
It doesn't want to show itself in any way.

406
01:04:58,224 --> 01:05:00,936
Shall we try going in there?

407
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:28,251
I'm checking to see if anyone is standing here in the kitchen.

408
01:05:30,246 --> 01:05:33,480
There was something that sounded at the mugs before.

409
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:53,085
Then we go into the room where we have a picture of Jesus.

410
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:56,959
And a cross. That picture has flown down.

411
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,784
Says the owner.

412
01:06:05,768 --> 01:06:09,309
Is there anyone with us in this room?

413
01:06:16,444 --> 01:06:21,920
Strange, because it really feels like there is something here.

414
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:30,446
We have felt a discomfort. If you back off a bit, we'll just hold it out here. So we try to call in what is there.

415
01:07:12,835 --> 01:07:19,765
No up mapping here. We have also tested the basement and the attic.

416
01:07:21,261 --> 01:07:23,430
Shall we try going up to the attic and check?

417
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,406
There! From the piano.

418
01:07:32,124 --> 01:07:33,782
It's the bed.

419
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:41,301
It was like it lay there then crawled out.

420
01:07:42,068 --> 01:07:44,943
It's the first up mapping we have here.

421
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:47,473
We make an attempt and go up.

422
01:08:18,336 --> 01:08:20,201
At the doll!

423
01:08:20,201 --> 01:08:25,875
Just like someone was sitting there. Now it's nothing.

424
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:31,391
Now someone is hanging above.

425
01:08:38,258 --> 01:08:40,098
Two!

426
01:08:41,675 --> 01:08:46,052
One is sitting on the chair, one is..

427
01:08:46,052 --> 01:08:50,193
It's either hanging above or standing....

428
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:54,325
It almost looks like it's standing on the chair.

429
01:08:54,325 --> 01:08:57,127
Sick!

430
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,569
Damn awesome.

431
01:09:10,559 --> 01:09:11,979
What was that?

432
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:13,997
Is there something that sounds in front of you?

433
01:09:13,997 --> 01:09:16,034
Here in the corner.

434
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:26,407
Now it is up on the roof.

435
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,755
It looks like he's climbing.

436
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:39,490
Now it climbs down.

437
01:09:44,286 --> 01:09:48,717
It holds the ceiling. This is what happened to Danjal, he had something on his back when he walked here.

438
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:49,802
Right.

439
01:09:49,802 --> 01:09:54,826
Wonder if it's the same energy hanging from the ceiling beams here.

440
01:10:06,488 --> 01:10:09,816
I'll see if there's anything on the site here.

441
01:10:17,258 --> 01:10:21,614
Nothing there. I feel a discomfort on the left side in here.

442
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:22,512
When you stand there?

443
01:10:22,512 --> 01:10:23,475
Yes.

444
01:10:27,004 --> 01:10:29,198
Shall we go further into the room?

445
01:10:36,947 --> 01:10:41,277
It is so difficult with night vision when you have this screen.

446
01:10:47,146 --> 01:10:51,136
Do we have anyone else in the room?

447
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:57,739
We had a good run down there in the corner?

448
01:11:12,354 --> 01:11:14,853
There was something.

449
01:11:36,072 --> 01:11:38,483
Someone is screwed up there.

450
01:11:38,483 --> 01:11:40,151
Damn.

451
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:44,787
Looks like someone is hiding up here.

452
01:11:44,787 --> 01:11:46,365
This is a little sneaky...

453
01:11:46,365 --> 01:11:48,739
This is damn sneaky.

454
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:55,060
I'm just wondering what it is. That's how it was before, we had contact then it disappeared.

455
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:02,230
It's so sick, that it almost hides... You get hold of it and then it just disappears.

456
01:12:05,222 --> 01:12:07,287
Here's another one.

457
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,719
Did you see?!

458
01:12:12,021 --> 01:12:19,270
It was standing behind the chair here, almost standing on all fours.

459
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:25,122
Now we've run kinect and Paranormal Puck, we've got mappings up here.

460
01:12:25,122 --> 01:12:31,432
But there is something that is not right here, there is something that calls itself what it is not..

461
01:12:31,432 --> 01:12:40,173
It is so sneaky, first you look for it, then it disappears.

462
01:12:40,825 --> 01:12:43,798
It's so sick.

463
01:12:56,802 --> 01:13:10,000
The Poltergeist house in Poland really lives up to its expectations. As soon as we arrive at the house, we get shivers all over our bodies, something that everyone feels very strongly.

464
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:17,342
Talk about Jesus or other Christian words, then the discomfort comes right back.

465
01:13:17,611 --> 01:13:25,457
Perhaps it is that the evil that was once tried to be cleansed by exorcism still remains.

466
01:13:25,457 --> 01:13:33,127
During the investigation, we received many words that indicate that the children's remains may still be in the basement.

467
01:13:33,127 --> 01:13:38,795
The question is what would you find if you start digging in the ground...

468
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:47,623
What was clearly felt most strongly, because we both heard and felt it physically, is the entity that calls itself Nun Sally.

469
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:56,139
Is she the one who stays behind and sucks in spirits and souls? Or is it the house itself that keeps them locked inside the walls of the house?

470
01:13:56,139 --> 01:14:00,796
It seems that those who remain do not know why they are there.

471
01:14:00,796 --> 01:14:10,921
Once again we see the theory of not having all the cameras running, works. And that the activity increases when we pull out one of the surveillance cameras.

472
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:16,594
We then got to experience phenomena that we haven't been able to experience for a long time.

473
01:14:16,594 --> 01:14:26,345
What is in the house has such power that it can even freeze the image on our surveillance system. Just like it knows it is being documented.

474
01:14:26,345 --> 01:14:33,487
We have never experienced this image freezing before in all our years as investigators.

475
01:14:34,484 --> 01:14:45,134
In the attic, we got two mappings of energies through our sls camera. Could this be Theodor or the children who wanted to show themselves to us?

476
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:54,429
If we summarize the investigation from the Poltergeist house, we can say that it has been a long time since we experienced such strong phenomena during an investigation.

477
01:14:54,429 --> 01:15:05,024
Bringing out the name Theodor, which is highly topical for the house, as a previous owner means that we got one step closer to who is still there.

478
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:13,380
But the darkness that rests over the place is something else entirely. It is a force that you should have great respect for when you are in the house.

479
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:25,561
You never know what it is capable of, but those who have the courage to visit the house, at Jelen Ryned 24..
