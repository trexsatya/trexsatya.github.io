1
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,526
There are many houses around the world, in which paranormal phenomena happens.

2
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:04,132
The house that really stands out is a house located on Jelen Rynek 24, in Poland.

3
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:12,878
There are many stories about the house and no one knows the real source of the evil that is there.

4
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,296
Other families left the house very quickly.
 Within 10 years, more than 30 families have moved out.

5
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:19,783
That's right, no one has stayed for so long.

6
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:20,548
Around 1940, a house is being built for a family and their two children.
 As soon as they moved in, the parents began to argue.

7
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:28,666
It even goes so far that the father in the family abuses the wife and the children.

8
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:39,802
Time passes and after a couple of years the children disappear under mysterious circumstances.

9
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:48,145
A rumor is spread in the village, that it is the father who has murdered the children and that they are buried in the basement.

10
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:55,882
The parents flee the country and during a house search, bloody tools are found in the basement.

11
00:03:55,882 --> 00:04:00,827
But the remains from the children were never found.

12
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:12,641
In 1961, a new family moved into the house.
 Those who have now moved in are starting to call the police that strange phenomena are starting to happen in the house.

13
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:24,235
They hear how someone goes in the wind, things are thrown into the rooms where no one is and the daughter in the family screams in the middle of the night, which wakes up the whole family.

14
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:30,440
When the parents go into her daughter's room, she floats above her bed.

15
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:41,768
It went so far that the Catholic Church sent priests to the house, to implement an exorcism.

16
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:49,026
Despite attempts to clean the house, no one has managed to get it completely calm.

17
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:58,714
We have now been around and tried to interview people, Simon has helped.
 Are the stories correct?
 We have tried as best we can, not many people want to be with unfortunately.

18
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:32,376
So I still think we have got very good things from those who are here in the immediate area.

19
00:05:32,376 --> 00:05:35,149
So exciting to see what happens here tonight.

20
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:07,815
Then we are here in the Poltergeist house here in Poland.
 We also have here and did a live, it can be seen on the website.

21
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:16,870
We recognize this house, we have been here before with ghost hunting, much happened then.
 Danjal was drawn in the leg, bangs in the house and things that are thrown.

22
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:24,665
So there is a lot going on and is said to happen here.
 Over 30 families say they have moved away.

23
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:30,321
And earlier today, very interesting, we got through Theodor during our live broadcast from here.

24
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:43,436
And a witness outside, an older man, talks about that there were two Theodor here.
 A father named Theodor and he named his son to Theodor Jr.
 So we had to confirm that very quickly.

25
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:52,323
He could also tell you that an exorcism has been performed here in the house, so there is also confirmed and it is super interesting for the evening.

26
00:06:52,323 --> 00:07:02,480
It's time to go in, the surveillance cameras are ready.
 We will test different sessions, we have with Simon from Poland that will translate some Polish words that come through.

27
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:10,803
Mixed sessions, we will go through basements and up to the wind.
 But we will first go here in the Bo part itself.

28
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:11,729
We go in.

29
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:17,539
As I said we were here and drove a live and it feels ..

30
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:23,945
It feels different in the house, I don't know how to say.

31
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:32,762
I got shivers right when we came in, when I was just standing in the hall.
 And now it is also much quieter, we do not have traffic outside.

32
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:40,000
We have put out K2 meters.
 6, Rem Teddy is there too.

33
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,736
And if something comes close, they will react.
 We also have some bullets Niclas.

34
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:53,278
Should we place them on the piano here?
 If something is thrown.

35
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:08,125
We place a little neighbor.

36
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:11,856
PRP there.

37
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,991
We put a paracope here.

38
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:31,629
We will mix Swedish and English, Simon will run a session in Polish later.

39
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:38,305
If someone is in here with us, can you come up with any of the things that are here on the floor?

40
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:08,514
I got shivers when I said his name, it was strange.
 Theodor was something that came through on our live broadcast, several times.

41
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:13,667
And, as I said, was confirmed by someone we talked to here.

42
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:19,701
Immediately!

43
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,193
I got a pain here by the side, as if something stuck me.

44
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:36,161
It's cool, when I try to film it becomes unfocusy all the time.

45
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:41,965
And it is classic from here, that it is not possible to focus, many say that it is not possible to focus the image.

46
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:45,265
What shivers, it is really icy in here.

47
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:47,166
You shouted at him and we get this.

48
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,851
Direct answer.

49
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:04,180
I try an oily at the same time and we will see if I can get any communication with him.

50
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:19,122
It is interesting yet that it stays here ..

51
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:20,602
Now it continues.

52
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,650
It wanders around now.

53
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:33,443
There it disappeared.

54
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:42,825
I have a damn great discomfort from the doorway.
 By a great discomfort I mean it feels like I was observed and when I look there quickly ...

55
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:48,200
So it feels like there would be someone there.
 It is a bit difficult to focus because we have a surveillance camera there.

56
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,648
Yesterday we saw a small child walking, a black shadow that went there.

57
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:55,653
Now at Ovilus we got ..

58
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,894
Now there is a lot through here.

59
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:24,796
Theodor is it you who murdered your children?

60
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:34,252
Now I get back pain, it jumped from here up to the left shoulder.
 It's like I've been a camera for a long time.

61
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:39,200
Now it is starting to ache in the entire spine, as it takes energy from one.

62
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,531
I asked about this with the kids.

63
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:54,298
Did you stroll your children?

64
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:20,699
I think we put PRP here.

65
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:44,986
Stir the antenna.

66
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,730
Immediately when I said it I start to shudder, it gets cold on my back.

67
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,378
Do it?

68
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:14,871
Shit what i shudder ...

69
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:32,842
Throw down that cross if you don't believe.

70
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,582
I think we move on, we leave this room.

71
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:51,686
Now we are in the room where the radio was before, now it is removed.
 But it was here before, in the corner.

72
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:54,886
I put PRP here on the couch.

73
00:13:54,886 --> 00:14:00,000
More symbols for God and Jesus.

74
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,507
Yes.

75
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:10,836
What sounded?

76
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,562
Is that the floor?

77
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,630
It sounded like something bounced ...

78
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,593
The picture from the surveillance behaves strangely.

79
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:24,212
Show your power here now.
 You have got so many families to escape from here.

80
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:25,408
The picture is slow and blurred.

81
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,560
Are you angry because we're here?

82
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,187
I have light dizziness, it spun at once.

83
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:02,630
Who are you?
 Why are you here and why are you attacking people?

84
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,788
After all, you pushed down a person for the stairs here.

85
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,496
Why did you push him?

86
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,597
The picture is still slow and blurred.

87
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:17,686
So you mean he slipped?

88
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:20,138
It wasn't you who did it?

89
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:24,155
If it wasn't you who did it, knock once somewhere.

90
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:29,572
2 knocks and some strange sound.

91
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:33,056
Can you knock like this?

92
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:39,197
2 knocks.

93
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:43,918
This board here has been thrown down.
 Can you throw it down?

94
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:47,142
After Tony knocked in the room, surveillance freezes.

95
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:59,055
If you don't like Jesus symbol here, throw down the board.

96
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:06,298
Then release the picture again, could the house have done this so that we would not get anything on film at the board?

97
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:13,411
Every time I say it gets icy at my back.
 It crawls a cold behind me ..

98
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,670
Forced boy.

99
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:41,952
It is a theory we think of, the dark that is here, it may have forced himself to the father Theodor, or the son, we do not really know which of them it is, to do things.

100
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:52,840
Did you get obsessed with something?

101
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,075
Have you flown on you?

102
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,450
Yes.

103
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,829
What came in here now?
 Now you can also communicate with this flashing light, soon it will be blue.

104
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,780
Did you get obsessed with something?

105
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:21,942
Were there six people who became obsessed here?
 After all, it is over thirty family who left here.

106
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,171
I'll just check out here quickly.

107
00:17:36,331 --> 00:17:38,466
Throw some porcelain.

108
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,094
There is a lot of crunch here.
 It is because we walk on the floor, it crackles all the time.

109
00:17:58,094 --> 00:18:06,437
Each time you say something it crashes, but that's the floor.

110
00:18:07,281 --> 00:18:12,975
Has there been something here that is linked to Auschwitz

111
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:18,851
All this tragic and evil that was there.

112
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:25,187
Has it been accumulated and come here to this house in some way?

113
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,693
It is only 20 minutes away.

114
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:34,782
We have that theory that German was here too and did his shit ..

115
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:41,089
Come in to this room.

116
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:44,468
Stir the blue light here.

117
00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:50,277
If we have any child here ..

118
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:04,164
We have a cellar down there.
 With stamped ground floor.

119
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:07,540
You do not know about the children's ..

120
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:16,766
We go down there, we bring them two and go down there.

121
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:19,137
Okay, we follow what Ovilus says.

122
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,522
We know where it is.

123
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:21,940
We go down there right now.

124
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,679
Bring with you flux.

125
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:33,843
Now we go down into the basement here and you who have seen the first time we were here with ghost hunting, it was down here I saw this stone that fell.

126
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:46,534
It said Soil, so we go straight to the soil stomped the floor.

127
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:48,288
Place the instrument on the ground there.

128
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,661
Here we have land.

129
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:56,200
It is very low in ceilings.

130
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,841
We're down here now.

131
00:20:01,715 --> 00:20:02,999
Kill.

132
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,258
Were you buried here?

133
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,737
Are the kids buried here?

134
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:38,974
Was you murdered in this room?

135
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,544
Nothing here.

136
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,440
We will take the next room as well.

137
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:01,231
If Theodor is here ...

138
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:06,854
Go up to one of the equipment and we know that you are left in this house.

139
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,235
It feels like it is just moving around us.

140
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,654
Come down here.
 If you are here with us ..

141
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,073
Come down and touch them the lights.

142
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:28,307
We got 6 up there too.

143
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:35,842
Are there six spirits left here?

144
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:38,595
Who are you then?

145
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:54,137
Do you know that you are dead?

146
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:02,323
Strange sound in the basement.

147
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:03,807
Wait..!

148
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,240
A voice that Tony hears.

149
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,874
It sounded like...

150
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:16,380
.. it sounded like a child ..

151
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:38,251
I thought I just saw something black here.

152
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:44,425
It may have been my eyes that played me a joke as I looked into the lamp.
 But it looked like something black that was there.

153
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:49,100
Not at all big, very low ...

154
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:52,802
Did I just see you?

155
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,632
Stir the lights if you are in here now.

156
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,000
We change a bit, you have to try to stand here.
 So we see if you get through something.

157
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,480
And is a little calmer here so we get up to the wind.

158
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,641
If there is any child here, can you come in here and call the bell that is there?

159
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:23,748
Can we hear your voice?

160
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:31,920
You can come in and take in this iron stick or go to the light that flashes here

161
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:36,100
I start Ovilus too, see what it says to me.

162
00:23:54,781 --> 00:24:01,755
The battery dropped quite quickly from 75 and now it stands at 66.

163
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:07,977
The figure 6 has been quite throughout here.

164
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:12,972
It may have been an ir light, otherwise you got a light phenomenon against you.
 Or a reflection.

165
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:18,388
It may have been a reflection.

166
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:24,800
Should we test a theory only, we pull out the cable, we have a surveillance camera here ...

167
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:38,542
Sometimes there is more activity when it is not documented in the same way.
 So we try pulling out the cable here.
 So we see what happens.

168
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,201
Immediately!

169
00:24:43,352 --> 00:24:46,101
You see, right away!

170
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:49,810
You don't want to be filmed straight from the front then?

171
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:54,208
I don't know if you feel it, but it became a completely different feeling in here.

172
00:24:54,208 --> 00:25:00,000
There was a shudder behind my back that went, as I stood there.

173
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:02,486
Always.

174
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:06,280
It's goose skin deluxe when I'm in here now.

175
00:25:12,418 --> 00:25:18,196
It is an extreme discomfort from here.
 At that doorway.

176
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,019
Mean them here or?

177
00:25:57,027 --> 00:26:00,647
It said scratch and heard ...

178
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,416
We may feel that someone is scratching.

179
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:12,511
Okay, we try to put in the monitoring again then.

180
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:21,580
Then we connect it.
 See if something happens, I have some control here for so long.

181
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:45,200
We do this Tony, we go up in the wind.

182
00:26:47,924 --> 00:26:52,605
It was in this staircase that Danjal was pushed.

183
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:54,665
Here somewhere he was stuck with his leg.

184
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:55,694
Right.

185
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:05,053
You also see here that we have a doll that we found here at the place.

186
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:13,132
We put a motion detector behind, in case something comes in.
 And you know how they sound, they say Hello Welcome.

187
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:22,970
This doll ..

188
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:27,793
This doll is very, very special.

189
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:32,956
Missing one leg too.
 I put a PRP in front of her here and we will see what happens.

190
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:46,789
Where you stand Niclas, that's where Danjal was pulled in the leg.
 It was also here that we heard the loud bang, loud sounds, such as the building shaking.

191
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:49,062
We have the boxes here.

192
00:27:49,062 --> 00:27:51,387
The suitcases.
 They are completely empty.

193
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,378
Scratch sound and a high tone

194
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:03,413
What was that?

195
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:04,338
Huh?

196
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,305
A high tone ..

197
00:28:25,293 --> 00:28:28,023
Battle out there.

198
00:28:30,248 --> 00:28:32,800
It is a special feeling up here.

199
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:41,331
It was so intense up here when we were here.
 You have to have it a little in mind when moving here.

200
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,935
Sound down there.

201
00:29:00,193 --> 00:29:01,702
Should we put flux down there?

202
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:03,175
Do it.

203
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:16,445
I light the flashlight all the time so I should not hit my head in the beams.

204
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:35,425
We have traffic, we have a large highway a little further away, we have cars passing ...

205
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:39,195
It's very late here, so we don't understand why cars are going ...

206
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,866
I'll also say it's Sunday.

207
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:50,000
And we don't have microphones on us, that's because we want to hear all these sounds.
 Because there are so many things that have been thrown ...

208
00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:51,280
Just.

209
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,399
Threw stuff.

210
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,529
I go down with this one.

211
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,081
I'm coming with.

212
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:15,458
I barely come here ..

213
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:35,490
Very strong.

214
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,787
If you back a little neighbor I can get closer to you.

215
00:30:46,897 --> 00:30:50,745
There it backed, good!
 It listens.

216
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:08,650
Do you notice that it directly follows your commands?

217
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,935
Is that Theodor?

218
00:31:38,555 --> 00:31:40,589
Now it went behind you.

219
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:47,366
And then we got movement in that direction I think.

220
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,224
It really follows what you say.

221
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:18,360
Now I saw something, something white behind you.
 A little further up the right.
 I thought it was a human being.

222
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:22,385
I can't focus at all now ... Now it came.

223
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:32,574
You know as you see in a ghost movie, something transparent?
 It was up at the edge there.

224
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:37,279
It looked like a ...

225
00:32:47,943 --> 00:32:51,974
We try the theory and pull out the monitoring here.

226
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:09,387
Where do you mean exactly as you saw it?

227
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,806
Obliquely up there, we have a small bright spot there in the ceiling.
 You see the oblique roof?

228
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,244
There yes.

229
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:18,136
And then maybe one and a half meters down.

230
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:19,743
Well, there.

231
00:33:35,255 --> 00:33:37,100
Now only we are here.

232
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:44,369
It becomes completely unfold when I stand here.

233
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:06,980
So, you get it on command.
 You control it in some way.

234
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,803
It jumps around too, I want to be able to communicate with this.

235
00:34:11,803 --> 00:34:15,117
Somehow I get a calm throughout the body, a security.

236
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:18,059
So what's here is not ...

237
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:24,596
evil in some way.
 Although it can be false security as well.

238
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:33,300
There it is exact.

239
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:37,567
So it disappears, it's so damn sick.

240
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:46,794
If it's the kids here, get close to me.

241
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:54,134
My theory is that it is something that pretends to be calm.
 But still a discomfort came back now.

242
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,881
Where.

243
00:35:04,093 --> 00:35:07,694
Wondering why it listens to me when I say it should back ..

244
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:22,285
Green there.

245
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:42,783
I turn this off now and then I test Ovilus.
 Tests if they want to say their name.
 It's strange, we got Beast and Gone there before huh?

246
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:43,775
Yes.

247
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:46,416
If it is the one here ..

248
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:56,644
The one who moves in here.
 And you are at a point where we were before, so the whole house shook.

249
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:57,850
Right.

250
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:10,836
I am pulled away from here, I am drawn here.

251
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,917
We go well then then.

252
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,808
I relax this again.

253
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,324
We got well too.
 We have received that before.

254
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:38,674
The theory is also that the children were thrown into a well covered with stone.

255
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,816
Give us a sign that you are up here with us now.

256
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:53,240
A loud sound would be very nice.

257
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:56,197
Or push us over.

258
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:58,744
Throw something.

259
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,894
Is this your doll?

260
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,598
Say what you want.

261
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,718
We wish this doll flew away from the chair.

262
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:20,413
Can you do it?

263
00:37:48,647 --> 00:37:51,232
Can you throw something in here?

264
00:37:57,715 --> 00:38:06,471
I think like this now Tony, we know what it was like when we drove lives, spirit box.
 Then it started.

265
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:09,158
We bring in Simon as well.

266
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:13,459
I'll pick up flown down there, but should we leave this one?

267
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:19,440
We can leave it.
 Take the fluff and we will go into the house again.

268
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:42,049
Now we are outside, we picked up Simon here too.

269
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:12,192
Who is here with us?

270
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:24,040
Is Theodor here with us?

271
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:35,343
"Perhaps"

272
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:55,127
What is the dark entity in this house?

273
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,741
Are you from Germany?

274
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:41,824
"Yes"

275
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,542
What do you want?

276
00:41:59,488 --> 00:42:01,247
Are you mad at us?

277
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,950
"Move"

278
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,433
It said exactly about sting or moving on you.

279
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,282
Where are we going?

280
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:31,398
"Up"

281
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:47,541
When we are on our way up to the wind, this happens to the camera.

282
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,398
If you are up here make a loud noise.

283
00:43:28,331 --> 00:43:31,131
Have you lived here?

284
00:43:43,598 --> 00:43:48,782
Do you want us into the dark room?

285
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:05,211
Did we see you?

286
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,829
Can you make the house shake?

287
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:31,288
"Yes"

288
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:52,070
Are you standing here?

289
00:44:57,363 --> 00:45:00,541
“Standing here”

290
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:10,233
Why are you here?

291
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:15,527
"I do not know"

292
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:27,762
What's your name?

293
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:05,088
Is it a dark entity with us up here?

294
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,381
Are you standing here?

295
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:26,496
Should we go there?

296
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:11,902
"Go"

297
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:24,046
We're going down now.
 We have tested up here and tried to get in touch.
 We have something down in the corner and we now see when Simon runs communication in his language that he is constantly receiving answers.

298
00:47:24,046 --> 00:47:27,473
We will also test Este's method at Simon.

299
00:49:18,411 --> 00:49:20,110
"Go"

300
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:25,018
There we got a go.

301
00:49:34,953 --> 00:49:36,683
"You can"

302
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:47,566
We ask many questions but no answer.

303
00:49:56,849 --> 00:49:58,514
I think we are breaking here.

304
00:49:58,514 --> 00:50:01,843
We decide to change communication tools to Ghost Box.

305
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:25,439
"I am"

306
00:50:28,508 --> 00:50:33,007
I just asked if the kids are left on this ground.

307
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:36,091
Are they buried here?

308
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,577
"Yes"

309
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:56,343
I thought I heard something ...

310
00:51:02,941 --> 00:51:05,096
Behind here ..

311
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,432
"Yes"

312
00:51:12,621 --> 00:51:14,866
Okay, you are in that room.

313
00:51:23,574 --> 00:51:25,918
"Yes"

314
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:33,442
"Silent"

315
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,196
He doesn't want you to talk to him.

316
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,730
"Yes"

317
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:56,094
"He listens"

318
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,832
The battery goes down very fast, from 26 to 19 %.

319
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:11,457
We may soon break.

320
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:16,543
We will soon break otherwise we will lose.

321
00:52:16,773 --> 00:52:17,646
"I understand"

322
00:52:21,981 --> 00:52:23,134
Should we break there then?

323
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:24,608
We do it.

324
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:28,146
So we don't lose the session, so we change battery.

325
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:30,631
"Yes, go"

326
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:29,202
Lennie, now we have changed a bit.
 Tony went in with Simon in the car so you and I go in and then you have to run a paranormal puck.

327
00:53:29,202 --> 00:53:42,644
I have this in my pocket.
 Paranormal Puck 2. I also have the phone where we enter the questions.

328
00:53:42,644 --> 00:53:48,436
We test everything possible here because we have contact with something dark in there.
 So we'll see.

329
00:53:55,955 --> 00:53:57,649
I put it down there.

330
00:53:57,649 --> 00:54:18,625
We put the puck down on the instruments.
 It will flash a little from your phone, but it's just the iPhone, they blink.
 Now we all see dots there, it has nothing to do with this feature.

331
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,060
Should we start asking questions then Niclas?

332
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:23,491
Write and ask if Theodor is here.

333
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:29,793
Is Theodor here?

334
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:39,504
Memories of Theodor are here.

335
00:54:54,196 --> 00:55:06,085
You can also say that, if it is a demon that has been here from the beginning.
 After all, they have done exorcism here, so we are starting to understand that it is back here.

336
00:55:16,788 --> 00:55:24,908
I know it goes down into the basement too.
 There is a ground floor there, so you can interpret it as dirt maybe.

337
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:30,000
We have had that theory, but we also believe when we go down there, so we get nothing, but it is up here.

338
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:40,174
But if we say that everything has started down there, in the ground floor, it is not entirely impossible that the darkness has been projected from there.

339
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:50,000
And got into the building here.
 For just in this room it is the greatest discomfort.
 The wind is decent, but it is here.
 You know most here I think.

340
00:56:04,002 --> 00:56:06,021
Got no answer ..

341
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:11,835
Very interesting actually because it always comes through something.

342
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:20,641
When you asked that question, if something is buried in the dirt ... then it became nothing.

343
00:56:20,641 --> 00:56:23,708
Almost as our theory is starting to match.

344
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:59,526
Maybe through the camera then.
 Or the second surveillance camera.

345
00:56:59,526 --> 00:57:03,906
I shiver.
 Damn what I'm starting to shudder.

346
00:57:16,949 --> 00:57:24,866
Damn cool!
 I think if you should ask about something Christian ..

347
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:16,081
It is also damn exciting, if it would be.
 They want us to think that it is a nun, something religious, but that there is something else that is trying to influence.

348
00:58:33,606 --> 00:58:36,237
Then nothing likes the religious.

349
00:58:36,237 --> 00:58:39,077
*What is being recorded now scares us*

350
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:43,184
*It is only Lennie and Niclas in the room, but a voice is recorded that laughs or growl to us.*

351
00:58:43,184 --> 00:58:44,561
It was another voice!

352
00:58:45,213 --> 00:58:46,099
What was that?

353
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:49,426
There was someone else who also laughed with us.

354
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:52,830
What the hell was Niclas?

355
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:57,341
It was another voice that laughed exactly at the same time as you.

356
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:01,449
Who called Jesus Christ witch.

357
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:04,812
Now we start talking, now maybe he is here.

358
00:59:21,956 --> 00:59:23,900
Type like Niclas.

359
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:28,881
It almost begins to say my name.

360
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:33,891
There was another vote that came in.

361
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:36,889
So damn clear it was.

362
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:40,389
A real tan.
 When we both laughed, it laughed with us.

363
00:59:56,769 --> 00:59:58,041
No answer.

364
00:59:58,041 --> 01:00:04,892
Now there is no more nun anymore.
 When it called Jesus Christ witch.

365
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:09,603
Now I haven't even written anything and got to sneak.

366
01:00:09,603 --> 01:00:16,317
And that means you sneak on someone.

367
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:18,107
Exactly.

368
01:00:18,107 --> 01:00:22,410
And you didn't even write anything?

369
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,558
No nothing.

370
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:25,998
Okay.

371
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:32,399
But that was so damn uncomfortable.
 Damn what uncomfortable.

372
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:39,741
That is why I want to drive with a microphone, because then we catch everything.
 Had we had something else we would not have received it EVP.
 It was clean!

373
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:48,646
It was another vote.
 After all, we got a dark, dark voice through Ghostbox.

374
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:57,898
We go in there where the board and the cross are, bring you paranormal puck there.
 We ask some questions there.

375
01:01:13,549 --> 01:01:15,989
Something is moved in the kitchen.

376
01:01:15,989 --> 01:01:16,744
Did you hear?

377
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:18,319
What was that?

378
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,958
There was something that sounded out there.

379
01:01:28,948 --> 01:01:31,630
It sounded like cutlery ...

380
01:01:40,568 --> 01:01:42,814
It sounded like it came from the kitchen.

381
01:01:56,777 --> 01:02:00,773
Up there are teacups, wondering if it was one that sounded?

382
01:02:00,773 --> 01:02:02,987
I ask a question.

383
01:02:08,817 --> 01:02:11,040
EVP is recorded.

384
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,589
"Men's voice"

385
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,440
So there is a lot down to the basement there.

386
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,382
It's sick when we talk about children and dig.

387
01:02:36,382 --> 01:02:51,950
Paranormal puck stands there and you stand there.
 What if we put it exactly on the floor?
 For just below there is the dirt.

388
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:54,222
What if it's a kind of portal?

389
01:02:54,222 --> 01:02:57,218
I think it's damn uncomfortable for the kitchen now.

390
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,117
But it was porcelain that sounded.
 We have previously asked if they can move something there.

391
01:03:18,124 --> 01:03:20,945
It's like they're stuck there ...

392
01:03:23,822 --> 01:03:27,936
So they keep them there in the basement, but I wonder why.

393
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:36,325
What they had to do here is to dig out at the bottom of the house.
 See what they get there, if there are legs ...

394
01:03:36,325 --> 01:03:40,845
If something binds some energies left to this house.

395
01:03:40,845 --> 01:03:43,031
Should we test Kinect in here?

396
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:43,784
We can do that.

397
01:03:43,784 --> 01:03:48,543
We go around here and see if we can get a mapping.
 We have got good stuff on paranormal puck.

398
01:03:48,543 --> 01:03:49,508
Really.

399
01:03:49,508 --> 01:03:51,707
So we go and pick it up.

400
01:04:03,023 --> 01:04:08,371
Do we have someone with us in this room?
 Show yourself now!

401
01:04:23,255 --> 01:04:25,226
Come into this room now.

402
01:04:28,218 --> 01:04:30,050
Back to bed.

403
01:04:35,689 --> 01:04:38,688
I stand here and look at the piano.

404
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:53,798
It's like it sneaks around ..

405
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:56,394
It does not want to show up in any way.

406
01:04:58,224 --> 01:05:00,936
Should we test go in there?

407
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:28,251
I check if anyone is here in the kitchen.

408
01:05:30,246 --> 01:05:33,480
There was something that sounded there at the mugs before.

409
01:05:48,594 --> 01:05:53,085
Then we go into the room where we have a picture of Jesus.

410
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:56,959
And a cross.
 That picture has flown down.

411
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,784
Says the owner.

412
01:06:05,768 --> 01:06:09,309
Is there anyone with us in this room?

413
01:06:16,444 --> 01:06:21,920
Strange, because it really feels like there is something here.

414
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:30,446
We have felt a discomfort.
 If you back a little bit, we just hold it out here.
 So we try to call in what is there.

415
01:07:12,835 --> 01:07:19,765
No mapping here.
 We have also tested the basement and the wind.

416
01:07:21,261 --> 01:07:23,430
Should we test go up in the attic and check out?

417
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,406
Where!
 From the piano.

418
01:07:32,124 --> 01:07:33,782
The bed is.

419
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:41,301
It was like it lay there then it crawled out.

420
01:07:42,068 --> 01:07:44,943
It is the first up the mapping we have here.

421
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:47,473
We try and get up.

422
01:08:18,336 --> 01:08:20,201
At the doll!

423
01:08:20,201 --> 01:08:25,875
Just like someone was sitting there.
 Now it's nothing.

424
01:08:29,212 --> 01:08:31,391
Now someone hangs above.

425
01:08:38,258 --> 01:08:40,098
Two!

426
01:08:41,675 --> 01:08:46,052
One sits on the chair, one is ..

427
01:08:46,052 --> 01:08:50,193
Either it hangs above or stands ....

428
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:54,325
It almost looks like it is on the chair.

429
01:08:54,325 --> 01:08:57,127
!

430
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,569
Damn cool.

431
01:09:10,559 --> 01:09:11,979
What was that?

432
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:13,997
Is it something that sounds in front of you?

433
01:09:13,997 --> 01:09:16,034
Here inside the corner.

434
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:26,407
Now it stands up in the ceiling.

435
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,755
It looks like he is climbing.

436
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:39,490
Now it climbs down.

437
01:09:44,286 --> 01:09:48,717
It holds in the ceiling.
 This was this that happened to Danjal, he had something on his back when he walked here.

438
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:49,802
Right.

439
01:09:49,802 --> 01:09:54,826
Wonder if it is the same energy that hangs in the roof the beams here.

440
01:10:06,488 --> 01:10:09,816
I'll look if there is anything on the page here.

441
01:10:17,258 --> 01:10:21,614
Nothing there.
 I feel a discomfort on the left side in here.

442
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:22,512
When you stand there?

443
01:10:22,512 --> 01:10:23,475
Yes.

444
01:10:27,004 --> 01:10:29,198
Should we go further into the room?

445
01:10:36,947 --> 01:10:41,277
It is so difficult with the darkness when you have this screen.

446
01:10:47,146 --> 01:10:51,136
Do we have any more in the room?

447
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:57,739
We got a good rash down there in the corner?

448
01:11:12,354 --> 01:11:14,853
There was something.

449
01:11:36,072 --> 01:11:38,483
Someone is curated up there.

450
01:11:38,483 --> 01:11:40,151
Damn.

451
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:44,787
It looks like someone is sitting and hiding up here.

452
01:11:44,787 --> 01:11:46,365
This is a bit sneaky ...

453
01:11:46,365 --> 01:11:48,739
This is fucking sneaky.

454
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:55,060
I'm just thinking about what it is.
 So it was before, we had contact then it disappeared.

455
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:02,230
It is so sick that it almost hides ... you get hold of it and then it just disappears.

456
01:12:05,222 --> 01:12:07,287
Here's another.

457
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,719
Did you see?!

458
01:12:12,021 --> 01:12:19,270
It stood behind the chair here, almost on all fours.

459
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:25,122
Now we have run Kinect and Paranormal Puck, we have got mappings here.

460
01:12:25,122 --> 01:12:31,432
But it is something that is not right here, it is something that calls itself what it is not ..

461
01:12:31,432 --> 01:12:40,173
It is so sneaky, first you look for it, then it disappears.

462
01:12:40,825 --> 01:12:43,798
It's so sick.

463
01:12:56,802 --> 01:13:10,000
Poltergeist The house in Poland really lives up to its expectations.
 As soon as we arrive at the house, we get shivers throughout the body, something that everyone feels very strong.

464
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:17,342
Talking about Jesus or other Christian words, then the discomfort comes back immediately.

465
01:13:17,611 --> 01:13:25,457
Maybe it is that the evil that once tried to be cleared away through exorcism is still there.

466
01:13:25,457 --> 01:13:33,127
During the investigation, we received lots of words to indicate that the children's remains may remain in the basement.

467
01:13:33,127 --> 01:13:38,795
The question is what to find if you start digging in the ground ...

468
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:47,623
What was clearly felt strongest, because we both heard and felt physically, is the entity that calls itself the nun Sally.

469
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:56,139
Is it she who stays and sucks in spirits and souls?
 Or is it the house itself that keeps them locked up inside the walls of the house?

470
01:13:56,139 --> 01:14:00,796
It seems that those who remain do not know why they are there.

471
01:14:00,796 --> 01:14:10,921
Once again, we see the theory of not having all cameras going, works.
 And that activity increases as we pull out one of the surveillance cameras.

472
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:16,594
We then got to experience phenomena that we have not experienced much anymore.

473
01:14:16,594 --> 01:14:26,345
What is in the house has such power that it can even freeze the image on our monitoring system.
 Just as it knows it is being documented.

474
01:14:26,345 --> 01:14:33,487
We have never experienced this freezing of the picture during all our years as investigators.

475
01:14:34,484 --> 01:14:45,134
In the attic we got through our SLS camera two pieces up mappings of energies.
 Could this be Theodor or the children who wanted to show up for us?

476
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:54,429
If we sum up the investigation from the Poltergeist house, we can say that it was a long time we got to experience such strong phenomena during an investigation.

477
01:14:54,429 --> 01:15:05,024
Getting the name Theodor that is highly topical for the house, as a former owner means that we came a step closer to who is still there.

478
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:13,380
But the darkness that rests over the place is something completely different.
 It is a force that you should have great respect for when you are in the house.

479
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:25,561
You never know what it is capable of doing, but those who have the courage to visit the house, on Jelen Ryned 24 ..
