1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,769
We are fed every day with new information and new impressions,

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:06,049
And much of that we don't have to remember.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,089
For example, it is not important to remember exactly

4
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,009
What all the people on the bus looked like.

5
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:14,289
But many things want and we need to remember!

6
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:18,049
With different memory strategies we can remember better.

7
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:20,809
One such strategy is the Loci method.

8
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:22,809
Also called memory palace.

9
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,209
Loci is Latin for places.

10
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:29,289
The strategy is based on converting what you want to remember

11
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,329
to pictures and imagine these placed

12
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,209
Somewhere in an environment you know well.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,649
Starting from a place.

14
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,478
For example, your home.

15
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:42,569
The best thing is if the place is divided into several parts

16
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,169
For example, different rooms.

17
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,489
The more defined places are apart, the easier it will be.

18
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,209
Go for a walk through your palace

19
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:53,409
And place what you need to remember!

20
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:58,089
For example, if you have to remember different types of vertebrates

21
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:00,369
can you imagine a snake to rush out

22
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,969
Under that old office standing out in the hall

23
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:05,569
Imagine what it looks like,

24
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:06,836
How the mountain feels.

25
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:09,729
When you then move on into the kitchen

26
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:12,569
Do you see that the kitchen doors have become bird cages.

27
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:15,849
When you open the cabinet, a pigeon flashes.

28
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,889
Visualize how it sounds, feels or smells.

29
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,889
The more in -depth you imagine things,

30
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:24,889
The easier they will be to remember.

31
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:27,249
When you then sit on a sample

32
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:30,009
Can you go through your "palace" mentally.

33
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,609
Stop in the different places and pick up the fact that is connected to the site.

34
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:37,249
It is important that you follow a definite route,

35
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:39,289
both when placing out the items,

36
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:41,129
And when to remember them later.

37
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,329
It is with the help of our senses

38
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,689
sight, taste, hearing, feeling and smell

39
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,289
We perceive information.

40
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,729
So when you are going to learn something new,

41
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:53,569
Try to use as many senses as possible.

42
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,409
Then it becomes easier to remember!

43
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,889
Had you just said crawfish in the hall

44
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:01,649
And birds in the kitchen would not have become as strong.

45
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:04,929
Make the pictures in your palace as vivid as you can!

46
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,489
How or where you place the knowledge

47
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,649
does not have to be logical or useful for someone else.

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,729
The method works better

49
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:18,729
The strange and more personal information you connect to the item or place is.

50
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:22,649
The reason why weird images work better

51
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:25,969
is because the memory is more susceptible to what is deviant.

52
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:30,089
The brain records easier things that are strange than completely normal.

53
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:32,889
The more you use the loci method

54
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,889
The better you will be at creating your memory palaces!

55
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,929
It may feel unusual at first,

56
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:40,129
But over time you will get the strategy
