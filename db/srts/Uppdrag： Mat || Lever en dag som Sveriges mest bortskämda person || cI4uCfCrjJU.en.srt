1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,560
After thousands of tips and a solid research work-

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,560
-Have I put together a top three list of the most extreme cases of spokenness.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,480
You should meet the whole trio today.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,760
We start at Södermalm in Stockholm, because here 19-year-old Elliot lives with mom and dad at home.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,960
He has never ever contributed with work in the home-

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,560
-And even though he has a job, he really lives on his parents.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,040
- Then we stand here with Erika.
 You are the mother of our first guest.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,040
It's early in the morning.
 Why are you and I stand here now?

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,040
- We have to wake him.
 I wake him every morning.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,200
- And your husband he prepares breakfast.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,600
It is going on as a small operation here.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,600
- Well, but it flows on.
 He is my little prince.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,600
- He's your little prince.
 Then we step in then.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,520
- Elliot?

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,280
The baby, now you get to wake up.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,920
Elliot Hörru, were you tired?

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,520
- My name is Elliot, I am 19 years old and turn 20 in a few months.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
I would describe myself as very spoiled.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,720
Gets serviced and curled at home.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,040
Do nothing at home.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,800
But I enjoy it.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,560
- Never has anyone made such a tired and let go of this program.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,400
- My dad prepares breakfast for me every day.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,640
So it is served in the kitchen when I go up.

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,680
It feels like ... I'm almost a little sooty on you.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,360
That you only get to paw here and as a 20-year-old get the whole breakfast served.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,600
- Now you would like me.
 -Gladly.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,960
- And I understand that.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,160
- What would have happened if this one was not here?

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,200
- Then we have a problem.
 Then we have a very big problem.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
First of all, it is ...

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,480
- Then we have a ...

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,480
- Yes, but then we have a huge problem.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,200
- Elliot is always ... He always looks a little tricky.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,440
You don't understand ... Is he spoiled for real?

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,880
Or is he just kidding a little?

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,400
- No, but he's spoiled.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,880
- Do you know someone who is more spoiled than Elliot?

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
- Mmm ... no.

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
- In ... in ... no.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,680
- Now I have soon eaten here.

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,680
- You have a lot left.

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
- Yes, though I'm done.

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
- What happens then?

45
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
- No we leave.

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
- Are we going from here?

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
- With the coffee of course.

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
- Where are we going with the coffee then?

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
- I'm to my bed.

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,480
- You make everything sound so obvious when you say it.

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
- Yes, but we should.

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
- What happens to this now?

53
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
- No, it must stand here.

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
- Who will remove it?

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
- Dad I think.

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
- It's probably your dad or your mom.

57
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,480
- Yes I am not me.

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,480
- I'm pretty good.
 I think there are many who are worse off than me.

59
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,480
- Still think what it looks like for children in the world.

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:52,480
- And it's sad.
 Yes usually ... mom ... my comp ... i know people who usually give money to good charity

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,480
- But do you ever help with household chores?

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
- No.

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
- You have cleaned your own room?

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
- No.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
- Have you ever washed?

66
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
- No.

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
- But have you ever vacuumed?

68
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
- No.

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
- Have you never held a vacuum cleaner?

70
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,480
- Yes, I have held.
 But I've never sucked.

71
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:17,198
- You understand where this is going.

72
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:26,480
- Now let's go and vacuum.
 You need to do that when you live at home.

73
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Electroluxus.

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,480
- What in ... no this I do not take responsibility for.
 For real.

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,760
It is important that you are careful when sucking.

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,840
This is really sick.
 This is what I say that this is fatal.

77
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,400
Now it's clean.
 Now we have cleaned the entire living room.
 It was no more difficult than that.

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,240
- You press the cord there.
 You feed.

79
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
- What is wrong?

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
- Oh!

81
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
- Yes.
 Now you breathe.

82
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
- I'll show a thing.

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
That's how they do.

84
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,720
Next week in Elliot's cleaning TV.

85
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,240
Elliot teaches us how to use a dishwasher.

86
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,920
- It doesn't sound.
 It usually sounds like this.

87
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,000
- But one thing should be said in your defense is that you have a job.

88
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,000
- I have a job.
 - You are a seller.

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,520
- I am a successful seller.
 - A successful seller?

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
Yes but I would call it.

91
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Yes, hey it's Mauri?

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,360
- Yes, hello.
 It's Ragnar here.

93
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,320
Customer manager at ...

94
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
- Ragnar?

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,960
- Yes, that's my alias.

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,640
- What is your real name?

97
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
- Elliot.

98
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,440
- Okay, why do you tell me this?

99
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,320
- Yes, it doesn't matter.

100
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,280
- Anyway, just call out here a little quick to you.

101
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,080
- Yes.

102
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,920
- But now ... no but I'm not in fashion.

103
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
- What did you say?

104
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
- I'm not in fashion, Mauri.

105
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,280
I do not want to talk to you.

106
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
- You just called me like ...

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,440
- Yes, but I don't feel like talking to you right now.

108
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,960
- Well.

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
- You are not a good customer.

110
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
You are actually not a good customer.

111
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,760
- sorry, but who are you?

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,520
- Yes, this is very strange.

113
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,240
Now you may be scared as a customer, but you don't have to be.

114
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,760
- No.

115
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,640
- I just feel that it's not the right location.

116
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
- Okay.

117
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
- So put on.

118
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
- Should I?

119
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,760
- Yes, I must not hang up.

120
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,400
I must not put on my customer.

121
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
- So you force me ...

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
Who are you?

123
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,720
- No, but now you can actually hang up.

124
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,720
It doesn't matter who I am.

125
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm just saying you need to hang up now.
 For the best of our both.

126
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,080
Yes...

127
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,760
Hello.

128
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,160
Hello.

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,760
- How much do you earn as a seller?

130
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,160
- A good month ... 30.

131
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,320
- What do you spend the money on?

132
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,320
- There will be a lot of exits.

133
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,720
- He has a good salary.
 But really everything goes to night out.

134
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
- I don't want to hear that.

135
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
- I shouldn't have said that.

136
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
- No, that's not what we've agreed on.

137
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Without him, he should save.

138
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
- He's going to?
 Elliot came once?

139
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
I just have to double check one thing.

140
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Erika says you save parts of these 30,000 in monthly salary.

141
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Do you?

142
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
- Yes.

143
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,720
It is 18 o'clock, now it is time for exit.

144
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
And who offers?

145
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Elliot!
 Elliot!

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
- Champagne I want.

147
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
I want champagne

148
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Should we bowl or?

149
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Bowl!

150
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Bowl!

151
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Cheers for Elliot.

152
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Or what?

153
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Drive!

154
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
- Wait, wait, wait!

155
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,049
Light, lit, lit, lit.
 Pause, pause.

156
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,690
Now you have partyed five thousand SEK tonight.

157
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,726
So I think it's time for a little wake up call.

158
00:07:10,726 --> 00:07:13,726
Welcome to Magnus from the Luxury Trap!

159
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,920
- No!

160
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
No!

161
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,240
- Yes you, Elliot.
 You know what this is, huh?

162
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,320
- Unfortunately yes.

163
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,720
- I can say that I have seen a lot of private economies.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,440
But I have never seen anything near yours.

165
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
- Yes, okay.

166
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,440
If we start with food then it is neither you who cook nor shop the food.

167
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,440
What do it?
 Well, that makes your parents.

168
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,440
So when we are accommodation then and who pay they.

169
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Yes, that makes your parents.

170
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
And then we come to your clothes then.

171
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Your parents who pay.
 Yes.

172
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
And if we look at this then.

173
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Saving.

174
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
The mams and paps that save.

175
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,440
But is the question how it is on this others.

176
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,020
- Yes.
 It's just tearing off the patch

177
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,300
- Oh!

178
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,840
- So there is SEK 30,000.
 Your entire income sits on the rest.

179
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,100
Images.

180
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,920
But seriously, what do you think about this?

181
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,180
- When you put it up, it gets a little ...

182
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,740
I don't laugh, I'm a little shocked actually.

183
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,700
You want to take a bowl on this I feel.

184
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,060
- Is it the first spontaneous you know?

185
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,460
- Yes, but that's actually what I know.

186
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,060
- Can't it be nice for you sometime to just shit it and take a bowl instead?

187
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,143
- Yes we can try.

188
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:55,060
- We bowl for me, we bowl for the party.

189
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,460
Yes, it had to be a party instead.

190
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,100
We simply had no chance against Eliott's charm.

191
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:09,100
For the first time in his life, Magnus finally had to throw all the financial rescue packages in the garbage basket and just have some fun instead.

192
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,100
- I have to say a thing.
 Have I learned anything today?
 No.

193
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,100
It is soon payable again.
 Then there are 30 new

194
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,424
- It's the day after.
 Elliott is probably just so baked.
 Now we will surprise him a little.

195
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:28,758
Elliot!

196
00:09:28,758 --> 00:09:30,758
You should get a blindfold.

197
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:31,758
- No.

198
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:33,614
This is unpleasant.

199
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,614
I sat and drank coffee just recently.

200
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,327
- Okay, Elliot.
 Now I leave you here.

201
00:09:43,076 --> 00:09:47,076
Okay, Elliot.
 You can now take off the blindfold.

202
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:50,177
- God.

203
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
What are we doing here?

204
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,440
Domestic science.

205
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,040
- You are today a home knowledge teacher for class 9A at Örbyskolan.

206
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,607
- What do you do on home knowledge?

207
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:20,074
- Elliot You are a home knowledge teacher, you should not ask this.

208
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:22,039
- I know I'm a teacher, but I want to ...

209
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,679
Damn.

210
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,505
Here is a computer anyway.

211
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:30,397
There I am.
 Here is a picture of me.

212
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,368
I have both brush and cream.

213
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,668
Wait here now.
 Shall we see.

214
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:40,615
Wash symbols, how to suggest them.

215
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
You should not put your hand down in the washing machine.

216
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
I guess it means.

217
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
I'm a little unsure.

218
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
And a circle.

219
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Circle.
 Yes.

220
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Somewhere we leave Elliot and take the car north.

221
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,010
For now it's time for second place.

222
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,760
And the tip about this spoiled 17-year-old I did not get from anyone-

223
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,560
-Outan from the mother herself.

224
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,680
And there is a problem, because the daughter herself does not seem to agree at all.

225
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,800
- Hello!

226
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,480
- Hello!

227
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,840
- Warm welcome!

228
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
- Thanks!

229
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
- Hello, and welcome to Gävle!

230
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,760
- I called Mauri because my daughter Maja is spoiled.

231
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,760
- Hi Linda and Maja.
 -Hello!

232
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
- What a happy hello!

233
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,760
- We are happy when you're here.
 - Are you?

234
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,840
- Despite the very serious subject ...

235
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,520
- It's probably more you who have your opinions.

236
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,040
- But Linda, in what way is Maja spoiled then?

237
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,760
- She does not cook and does not wash.
 Then she gets Swish of course.

238
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,400
Shoots do mom everywhere.

239
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,640
- I see her as my personal taxi.

240
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,040
- You see her as your personal taxi?

241
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,360
It is especially said by a girl who just said that she is not at all spoiled.

242
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,480
- When did you vacuum here last?
 -Never.

243
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,760
- When did you last wash?
 - I did on Christmas Eve.

244
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,640
Two glasses.
 Carolina Gynning glass.

245
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,920
- She is spoiled, she does not spread her sandwiches herself.

246
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
- Doesn't their sandwiches burn yourself?

247
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,720
- No, she can't spread sandwiches.

248
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,000
So then Mom gets to spread sandwiches.

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,120
- It is such a detail that is difficult to just release, Maja.

250
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,720
That you cannot spread your own sandwich.

251
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,120
- It might be a little bad anyway when I think about it.

252
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,600
- This is almost historically then.

253
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,520
A seventeen -year -old who brings his first sandwich in life.

254
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,640
- Should I cut it?

255
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,200
- That's how you ... You know when you get bread from your mom in the morning she has cut it.

256
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,840
- Why don't you break first and then cut off?
 Isn't that easier?

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,240
- You do as you wish.

258
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,320
- Yes, like this and burns, and then chop off.
 It may be a little easier.

259
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,120
- No, do you not have to spread the other side?
 - How to spread the other side?

260
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,080
- It's been wrong in the head.
 I thought they did both.

261
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,760
- I thought it first.
 - It's like you are doing your first day in life.

262
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,040
I've never seen...

263
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
- Have I been broadly clear now?

264
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,360
- This didn't break.

265
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,385
- There is butter on all edges.
 What has happened here?

266
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,880
So!

267
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
How nice!

268
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,600
- God, I feel almost awkward ...

269
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,080
- No, no it's quiet.

270
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm used to everyone to ...

271
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,440
- Say you're spoiled?

272
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,960
- Yes.

273
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,680
So it's like ...

274
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,240
So do all my friends so ...

275
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,760
- Your friends also say that you are spoiled?

276
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,200
Everyone has the same opinion.

277
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,118
- But not yourself.
 - No

278
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,497
- No argument bites?
 - No

279
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,440
- I don't think you can convince me.
 - You are spoiled?

280
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,320
- You would almost want to have a debate between you.

281
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,840
A clear, with program manager.

282
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,800
So you can take your best arguments and then we will see who is right.

283
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,600
- Welcome to debatable debate.

284
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,440
Tonight it is about spoiled young people and curling parents.

285
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
- How spoiled is Maja?

286
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
- I think she is very spoken.

287
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,600
- What do you say Maja?

288
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
- I say I'm not.

289
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
- You're not spoiled?

290
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,820
- No.

291
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,200
Thanks for tonight.
 We are back in a week and then it is about raspberry caves.

292
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Could it be good sometime from time to time?

293
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
How many raspberry caves do you eat this week?

294
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
- Two three...

295
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
- It's so damn stupid this.

296
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,960
- What would you do Linda, to make her understand?

297
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
- I think she has to experience me.

298
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
- It would have been something.

299
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,000
Said and done it got to be.

300
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,360
This afternoon was instead Maja who was allowed to push her mother down to the local gaming center.

301
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,200
- Then Linda, now me and Maja will go home and cook some food for you as you get when you come.

302
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,160
- God, so perfect.

303
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,600
Yes, I play yes a little.

304
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,120
At the same time, Maja had to stand at home and manage everyday chores.

305
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:29,320
And here we actually have to pause and just jointly try to take in how much detergent she thinks is needed to wash a single ladle.

306
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
- Oh...

307
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
God, what a luxurious.

308
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:51,187
Then it was time to cook minced meat sauce before Mom Linda's arrival.

309
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:53,187
- Maybe I should wait until it boils?

310
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:56,187
No, I'll put it down now.
 I feel a little professional anyway.

311
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,187
- Do you?
 - Yes!

312
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,440
- Yes, I can kind of.

313
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,560
I really try my best, I promise.

314
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,560
- I know you are doing it.

315
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,600
- That is really awful.

316
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,760
- You don't have so much fun right now.

317
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,000
This is how your mom has it every day.

318
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,000
- Maybe ... yes, it's not so fun actually.

319
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,520
No, but this was really awful.

320
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,800
- Food is served.

321
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,080
- It's absolutely fantastic.
 It's luxury.

322
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,880
- You are so happy about it.

323
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
- I am very happy.

324
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,560
But it's just that you do, Maja.

325
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,880
It's absolutely fantastic!

326
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:52,061
Ehh yes ...

327
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:56,813
After all, you have got a paste or spaghetti and meat sauce.

328
00:16:56,813 --> 00:17:00,433
- But wait, now we get wrong here.
 We talked about this before.

329
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,911
If you are to be honest?

330
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:04,455
- Then I'll be it ...

331
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:05,760
It wasn't good.

332
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
It wasn't good.

333
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,000
- How long have you been curled Maja in this way?

334
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,640
- She turns 18 in August, so it has become to curl her for 17 years.

335
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,360
To celebrate this curling anniversary, I took Maja and Linda to the local curling hall.

336
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,320
- Okay Linda, you have been curled your daughter for 17 years.
 -Yes.

337
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
- You didn't understand why we were in ...

338
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,160
- No, I didn't.
 Now I understood.

339
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,360
- Now you came in!

340
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,800
It is mostly a word, but I also get curious about ...

341
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Can I beat a curling mom in curling?

342
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
- Up to match.

343
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,720
- Each stone, the one who comes closest to the yellow, wins.

344
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
- Yes.

345
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,480
- That was great!

346
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
- It was great!

347
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,520
Are you ready?

348
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,020
- Yes!

349
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,520
- Good!

350
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,880
- And then you slip.

351
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,140
- Pretty!

352
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,560
You should simply curl, not your daughter but a stone today.

353
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,060
- Yes.

354
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,560
Yes!

355
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
- Okay, drive!

356
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
- So, that's good!

357
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
- It will put yours!

358
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,360
- Or is it too hard?

359
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
No, it goes by!

360
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,840
Oh, it was just too hard.

361
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,800
It really was that you just lost in curling.

362
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,600
- Yes.

363
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,440
- Actually.

364
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,040
- Yes.

365
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,560
- Thanks.

366
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,080
- Thanks.

367
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,680
- Thanks, Maja.

368
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,200
- Thanks.

369
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,960
- Oh oh oh.

370
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,560
- Thanks.

371
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,120
- And in the midst of this anti -climax I leave you.

372
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,600
Because I'm going down to Åhus.

373
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,000
Now is the time to go to Åhus in Skåne where we find the number one list.

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,120
A 21-year-old who does not plug and who has not worked a single day throughout his life.

375
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,720
- But before you get to meet the main character himself, we will meet his best friend Hassan.

376
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Is he the most spoiled person in Skåne?

377
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
- Yes, easy.
 He is so spoiled.

378
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,120
In the days when we work as well, he is just home.

379
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,520
When we went to high school.

380
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,920
So, Jeppe could take a taxi to school and home from school.

381
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,520
- No!

382
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,320
- So, that's only half the study fraud.

383
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
So, yes Mauri.

384
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,320
He gives a real wake-up call now.

385
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,720
- I have something to bite in there.

386
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,000
- Yes it really is.

387
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,120
- And here, my ladies and gentlemen, Jesper lives.

388
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Behind this door.

389
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Hello!

390
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,800
- My name is Jesper, I am 21 years old and I am extremely spoiled.

391
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,400
I love being spoiled.

392
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,840
I don't have to do anything, I don't have to work like everyone else.

393
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,920
So it's nice.

394
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,760
I have it easy in life.

395
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,200
- We can drive now.

396
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,720
We're going to start talking now.

397
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,680
- Yes, okay.

398
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,800
But this apartment, how did you get it?

399
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,400
- It fixed my dad to me.

400
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
He pays the rent and the electricity bill.

401
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,080
- This sweater?

402
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,720
- Dad.

403
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,280
Food, everything.

404
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,400
Everything, you see here, from body to toe.

405
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,880
- Everything?

406
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
- Yes, I have zero kronor on my card.

407
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,920
The most expensive thing I got from my parents is my car.

408
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
SEK 300,000

409
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,640
- But then it is very nice car.

410
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,000
- That one is a little dirty.

411
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
- Who cleans the car?

412
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,640
- I have a friend who does it for me.

413
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
- No!

414
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,960
- Who pays for that cleaning?

415
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
- Dad.

416
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
- You call Felix and do he clean?

417
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,120
- Yes.

418
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
- Can we call Felix now and ask him to come and clean the car?

419
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,000
- This spare that we still have to call it.

420
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,560
Yes.

421
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,080
Don't just go, just not only directed at your parents.

422
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,760
- No, it goes against others too.

423
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,320
- But we so.

424
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,120
- Everyone can be victims in Jesper's world.

425
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
- Exactly.

426
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,880
Hey!

427
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,440
Yes Felix you usually wash my car inside.

428
00:20:59,440 --> 00:20:59,940
- Yes?

429
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,480
- Do you want to come and do it with me?

430
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,240
- Yes, then I may well hurry

431
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
- Yes, there he is.

432
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,400
How often does this happen that you wash Jesper's car?

433
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,640
- Maybe ...

434
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,720
- Yes ...

435
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,040
- It's like you are both ashamed of this relationship.

436
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,760
Yes, it's just ...

437
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,520
Yes!

438
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh God!

439
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Do you work with this?

440
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,260
- No.

441
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,480
- Also take the inner panel there.

442
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,840
- Which one do you mean?

443
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,600
- At the meter.

444
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,520
- At the meter?

445
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
No no.

446
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,620
- How spoiled would you say Jesper is?

447
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,320
- If I say this on a scale of 1 to 10 then you would say an 11.

448
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,140
- He's an 11.

449
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,540
- He's off the scale.

450
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,200
- What else has he paid for?

451
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,000
- Yes, for me to go and buy food for him.

452
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,920
- Jesper!?

453
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,420
- Yes?

454
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,780
- What do you pay for him to go and buy food?

455
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,280
- Yes.

456
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,320
- Nice.

457
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,620
- Thanks so much.

458
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,820
- This is friendship when it is at its most beautiful.

459
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,320
- Yes.

460
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,640
- This is where you live?

461
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,320
- This is where I live.

462
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,080
Welcome.

463
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,760
- And here we have the toilet.

464
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,920
- I've never washed my clothes all my life.

465
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,080
- Who washing your clothes?

466
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,840
- Mom.

467
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,920
- But you live here now.

468
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,720
- I have a laundry basket where I put all my clothes in.

469
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,360
Then mom comes and fetches them and washes them at home.

470
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,600
And then she leaves them.

471
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,760
- No.

472
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,520
Can you try to figure out what this thing is for?

473
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,560
- Water.

474
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
No wait.

475
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,560
I'm kidding.

476
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,560
Washing-up liquid.

477
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,640
No, what the hell is it?

478
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,320
- And here are you sitting?

479
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
- Here I sit every day.

480
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,080
So I go up at eight, go and work out.

481
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Going home, eating breakfast.

482
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
And then I check Youtube.

483
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,440
- It feels like you've become a little passive.

484
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
- Yes, but I'm waiting for something to happen.

485
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
- And what do you think ...

486
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
- That I become kind of billionaire.

487
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Without working.

488
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,040
Sometime I think it will happen.

489
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,720
I have asked to God once.

490
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,520
- Have you?

491
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Yes, and I said I want money in my account when I wake up.

492
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,120
- You are even a little spoiled when it comes to your relationship with God.

493
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,120
That you just, God give me money.

494
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,660
- Then I sat up and checked.

495
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,400
Closed.

496
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,200
- And what happened?

497
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
- Nothing.

498
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,400
- Zero kronor on the card when I woke up.

499
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
- Did you go in and checked?

500
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,900
- Yes.

501
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,400
- And here's the kitchen?

502
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,920
How often do you shop?

503
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,320
- I'm not shopping for myself.

504
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
I can't shop for that.

505
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,800
I don't want to walk around with a trolley at ICA.

506
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,920
My parents must do that.

507
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,320
It is embarrasing.

508
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,080
- Embarassing!
 How is it shameful?

509
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,640
- I look like a dad walking around there

510
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,800
No, so for eating food, it is instead all that usually the local pizzeria.

511
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,440
So did this evening as well.

512
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,280
- It's good.
 It's good.
 It's good.

513
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,720
- mm.
 You should then become a billionaire.

514
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
- Yes.

515
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,720
- How much have you worked in your life?

516
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,720
- Nothing.
 Zero hours.

517
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,320
Zero hours, yes.

518
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,640
I have conditions when I work.

519
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,920
I'm going to work four hours a day max.

520
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,440
And I'll earn maybe 200,000 a month.

521
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,840
- But are you like an art project?

522
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,640
How do you think it has worked with this tactics so far?

523
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,600
- Not good, but I can do.

524
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,520
I live.

525
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,720
- Thanks to someone else giving you money.
 - Exactly.

526
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
- You don't know what it's like to work.

527
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,120
- No.

528
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,560
- You have never tried it.

529
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,320
- No, I have never really worked.

530
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,120
But it is...

531
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,000
People say it's boring.

532
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,720
- I wonder if we should stay here tonight.

533
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,400
Yes, we stayed overnight.

534
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,000
The next morning I went home to Jesper and woke him up.

535
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,360
Before he was brusently shipped into a car.

536
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Because I had arranged a little surprise.

537
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,840
- Do you speak english?

538
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:19,360
- Welcome to my labor camp.

539
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
- What should I do here?

540
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,360
- Today you will be able to make your first working day in your entire life.

541
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
- No, this is very full.

542
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,360
- I want you to build a pile of soil.
 At least one meter high.
 Good luck.

543
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,360
- huh?
 What is high?
 What about earth?

544
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
No I do not have the energy.

545
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,360
It's really boring.
 It doesn't go bigger.
 It just goes down here.

546
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
- Yes, that's a bit of what is the tricky.

547
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
- Check out, half disappeared.

548
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,360
It is so...

549
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
- Look into the camera Jesper.

550
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,360
- Please I can't build a whole ...

551
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
I can not take it.

552
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:23,096
Ohh and Jesper Worked Hard and Long That Day.

553
00:26:23,096 --> 00:26:27,462
While the sweat was pouring down his spoiled little cheeks.

554
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,642
He learned The Lesson About Hard Labor.

555
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
- May I take a break?

556
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
- You have worked for a quarter.

557
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:43,082
So he Kept On.
 Sweating and grinding.

558
00:26:43,082 --> 00:26:46,536
Until he realized that the foundation of a great society.

559
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:51,815
Lies on the pain and suffering of hard working but.

560
00:26:51,815 --> 00:26:54,354
- What's wrong with you?

561
00:26:54,354 --> 00:26:56,062
- I do not know

562
00:26:56,062 --> 00:27:00,715
- I have actually invited some who will enjoy a little to see you work.

563
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:02,527
Welcome!

564
00:27:05,616 --> 00:27:08,732
- Axel, Hassan, Juan and Felix?

565
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:11,325
- It's all your friends.

566
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,402
It's all your friends who love you and are forced to stand out with your spokenness

567
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:15,933
Welcome!

568
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,067
- Thank you thank you.

569
00:27:17,498 --> 00:27:19,200
- It comes more on the sides than on top.

570
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,320
Yes it is no longer, it just gets wider.

571
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
- Yes but how the hell should I do then?

572
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,225
- Oh.

573
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:36,578
- Hahaha

574
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,600
- But God, that is really ... Now we can fucking.

575
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,706
One meter!

576
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:53,473
Jesper!
 Jesper!
 Jesper!

577
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,742
- I love him as a person.

578
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:02,730
You want to pay tribute to him for making it.

579
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,396
It's a small task, but it's a big deal for him.

580
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:08,383
- That's what he's best at.

581
00:28:08,383 --> 00:28:10,324
To break about their loved ones and dear family and friends.

582
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,560
- So, he can be spoiled, but it does not change how he is as a person.

583
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
- The situation was ...

584
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
It was degrading

585
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,480
- These are your first earned crowns in life.
 Look at them!

586
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,560
- Are they genuine?

587
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,440
- Yes, yes, yes.

588
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,920
- There is still something in this concept of work and salary, right?

589
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,160
A little!

590
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,600
Still, I think I'm starting to look at something.

591
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,000
A little insight.

592
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,360
What would you do for him then?

593
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,360
- I must take the guys on a beer.

594
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,240
A beer round.

595
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,360
- Cheers for Jesper's first AW ever.

596
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,960
Before we make a point, I really want to thank all the guests who dared to show an honest side of themselves.

597
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,920
The charm troll Elliot with his bushy smile.

598
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,920
The wonderful curling duo Maja and Linda.

599
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,520
And then Jesper who really became happy and proud right into the reasons when I liked his local favorite pizzeria.

600
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Of all the crimes you can be committed as a human being, a bit of a spoil is not the whole world.
