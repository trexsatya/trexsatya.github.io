00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06.560
After thousands of tips and a solid research work-

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,560
-Have I put together a top three list of the most extreme cases of spokenness.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,480
You should meet the whole trio today.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,760
We start at SÃ¶dermalm in Stockholm, because here 19-year-old Elliot lives with mom and dad at home.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,960
He has never ever contributed with work in the home-

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26.560
-And even though he has a job, he really lives on his parents.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,040
- Then we stand here with Erika. You are the mother of our first guest.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,040
It's early in the morning. Why are you and I stand here now?

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,040
- We have to wake him. I wake him every morning.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,200
- And your husband he prepares breakfast.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,600
It is going on as a small operation here.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,600
- Well, but it flows on. He is my little prince.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,600
- He's your little prince. Then we step in then.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,520
- Elliot?

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,280
The baby, now you get to wake up.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,920
Elliot HÃ¶rru, were you tired?

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,520
- My name is Elliot, I am 19 years old and turn 20 in a few months.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06.040
I would describe myself as very spoiled.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07.720
Gets serviced and curled at home.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09.040
Do nothing at home.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,800
But I enjoy it.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15.560
- Never has anyone made such a tired and let go of this program.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,400
- My dad prepares breakfast for me every day.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,640
So it is served in the kitchen when I go up.

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,680
It feels like ... I'm almost a little sooty on you.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,360
That you only get to paw here and as a 20-year-old get the whole breakfast served.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,600
- Now you would like me. -Gladly.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,960
- And I understand that.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,160
- What would have happened if this one was not here?

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,200
- Then we have a problem. Then we have a very big problem.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
First of all, it is ...

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,480
- Then we have a ...
