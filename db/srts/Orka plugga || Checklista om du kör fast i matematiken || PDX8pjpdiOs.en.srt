<i>Sometimes, your maths solution</i>				
				<i>doesn't match the answer book.</i>

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,400
<i>This is good. It's important to know</i>				
				<i>how to calculate accurately.</i>

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>It's also important to have strategies</i>				
				<i>for understanding what went wrong:</i>

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,600

TROUBLESHOOTING

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,560
Have you understood
the maths problem?

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,680
Read it once more, to make sure
that you haven't missed anything.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,720
Have you chosen the right method?
Maybe there's another way to do it?

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,800
Have you made any calculation errors or
written the wrong signs?

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
Maybe you've missed a parenthesis
or a minus sign.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
SIGN ERROR?

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,760
Still can't find the error?
Then please do the following:

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,480
Write down the maths problem
and recalculate it.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,360
If you get the same solution twice,
you probably haven't made an error.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,960
But if you get different solutions,
you should compare your calculations-

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,280
-and reflect on what went wrong.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,360
Compare!

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,560
Read it once more! Right method?

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,120
Wrong sign? New page. Compare!
