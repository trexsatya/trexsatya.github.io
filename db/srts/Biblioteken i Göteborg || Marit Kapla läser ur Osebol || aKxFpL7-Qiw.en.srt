00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,260
Hi, my name is Marit Kapla

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,460
And I have written a book called Osebol.

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,240
In Osebol I have interviewed

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,980
almost all adults living in Osebol,

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,380
namely,

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,880
My old hometown in northern Värmland.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,180
So there are 42 people talking in the book.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,600
Now I will read a little from the book

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,740
And I thought, I have chosen some parties that are about

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,440
crisis consciousness, you might say,

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,480
in Osebol,

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,220
Speaking of what we are going through right now.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,400
Per-Erik Andersson,

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01.640
Born 1940.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,320
“I have old -fashioned payment with Giro.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,420
Someday it is to go to Torsby

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,100
to Nordea

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,280
They had offices in Malung

19
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,616
But now they have moved it to Mora

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,140
it said.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,680
As if they would not have had

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,300
Any office in Mora before.

23
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,360
There was a note on the door.

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
"We've moved our office to Mora."

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,820
Not that "we have put in Malung".

26
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,820
It had looked worse.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,580
Not many people handle cash.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,880
And the ATM,

29
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
who was at Värmlandsporten,

30
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,980
Have they removed now again.

31
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,980
I'm so much in Malung

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,400
So I can withdraw money there.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05.840
But that's not good.

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Non-profit organizations,

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,040
that sells lotteries,

36
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12.560
How should they carry on?

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
How is it going

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,460
If it were to become

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
A proper power outage?

40
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,104
Then one cannot trade anything,

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
without cash,

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,700
If it even goes with it. "

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,680
Anna-Karin Larsson,

44
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,420
Born 1972.

45
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,020
“Last time we talked

46
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,840
It was winter and misery.

47
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
Then I felt

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,500
Well,

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,480
I'm not going to stay.

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Now the summer is coming soon.

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,120
Then I feel that it's pretty nice

52
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,420
Living here anyway.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,280
Then you can also feel this way,

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06.368
I mean, Stockholm last Friday.

55
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,180
It is quite quiet to live here in the country anyway.

56
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,740
It is a security here as well.

57
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,160
A social network you have.

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,240
I have a hard time seeing

59
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
That someone else would live here.

60
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
It's my house.

61
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
It's split.

62
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
There would be a good intermediate. ”

63
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Levi Stenberg,

64
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,816
Born in 1973.

65
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,960
“Maybe there is a huge book

66
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,800
where all people's lives are written down.

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,160
How and when, he or she is going to die.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,780
If I'm going to die next year in a climb, so ...

69
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09.340
I am not afraid.

70
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,920
There is always something in play

71
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
that can be bad.

72
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
I can die

73
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,375
If I go out and it's slippery.

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,420
I can die

75
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,720
in a car accident

76
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28.031
or a flight crash.

77
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
I believe life is more dangerous

78
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151
In a city

79
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35.711
than up in the mountain.

80
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
I've talked to Åke about this.

81
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
We feel happy

82
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
that we live here

83
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49.535
and not in Stockholm

84
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,320
Or Gothenburg.

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,920
Not in large cities.

86
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,760
There is still security here.

87
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
We are not close to terrorists.

88
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05.151
It was horrible,

89
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07.711
What happened in Stockholm.

90
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
It is the same thing

91
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
As in France

92
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,620
And in Germany.

93
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,580
It's a new world. ”

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,760
I wrote the book about Osebol to,

95
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
For many different reasons.

96
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,500
The most important thing was to

97
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,320
I felt that

98
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51.080
It stands too little about such villages in the media

99
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,160
and people know too little about who lives there

100
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,980
And what's going on there.

101
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,660
Even I

102
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,580
In the process of becoming one who didn't really know what was happening in Osebol.

103
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,500
I grew up there

104
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09.100
But in 2007 my parents sold the house.

105
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,220
When started working on the book

106
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,620
Then I had barely been Osebol in eight years

107
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,860
And then I felt that even I was becoming such a person

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,080
Who does not know what is happening in a village in the countryside.

109
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,200
I think the book

110
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,440
Tells about so many different things.

111
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,880
It shows that,

112
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,180
I chose to make the book as an interview book,

113
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,320
It is not my story about Osebol directly

114
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,420
Without it, those who live there are now telling us about life there now.

115
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,280
They also tell about their lives

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,740
They have,

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,460
they are different old,

118
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,320
It's men and women,

119
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,580
They come from a lot of different places -

120
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03.640
some have lived there all their lives

121
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,920
and some come from other countries

122
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,340
Or other places in Sweden.

123
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,240
The book got along

124
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,460
Very much of Sweden and Europe's present history.

125
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,160
Above all, I think it has got with

126
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,500
urbanization,

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,580
So this with that very many people

128
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,400
have left the countryside and moved into cities,

129
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29.893
Just as I've done,

130
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,580
I live in Gothenburg now.

131
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,540
I think there is some kind of sense of loss at

132
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,860
a large part of - not just Sweden's population but

133
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,220
The world's population - somehow.

134
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,940
There are many who,

135
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,420
somewhere consciously or unconsciously

136
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,740
Maybe have ties to a place

137
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,500
as one has left or the family has left,

138
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,340
The family has left for a long time

139
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,360
But somewhere there was something that was lost

140
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,120
with this move.

141
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06.620
I think that's why

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
so many

143
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,200
can take the book.

144
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,260
It is anyway

145
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
many who contact me and say

146
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,640
that the book has got one to think about

147
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,500
their old relatives

148
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,160
or any completely different village elsewhere

149
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,320
or just a feeling of something

150
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,600
lost.

151
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,160
Yes, what has happened in Osebol since the book came out

152
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,420
It is that people,

153
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,160
Other people have started to go to Osebol

154
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,140
in a way they didn't do before.

155
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,840
It is quite common for a car to come

156
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,220
and drive down to the bridge over the Klarälven -

157
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,040
The bridge is very much in the book -

158
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,420
you can't drive a car, you can't really have

159
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00.940
Some traffic on it now but sheep goes and cycles across the bridge anyway.

160
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,280
The cars drive down to the bridge,

161
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03.918
goes out,

162
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05.740
takes pictures of the river,

163
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,180
Takes selfies at the road sign.

164
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,240
This thinks those who live in Osebol are fun.

165
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,000
We have quite a lot of contact

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,020
and have had during this year now

167
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,460
That has passed since the book came out.

168
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,421
That was the point then,

169
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,320
There are plans for,

170
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,900
or like this,

171
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32.560
It should be a printer course about Osebol

172
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34.560
At the Folk High School in Stöllet

173
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,580
which is just three kilometers away.

174
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,960
But as it looks now so

175
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,000
is it still supposed to

176
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,720
The course will get rid of in early June.

177
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,160
And then we'll see.

178
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,280
It's full, it's great,

179
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,420
The places on this course went to,

180
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,591
were filled very fast.

181
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,340
I hope the course gets off

182
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,820
And then I come,

183
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:58,280
then you will try to

184
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,180
to write that way I have done

185
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,460
this book,

186
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,080
And so it's a poet with too

187
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,540
So you have to try writing poetry too.

188
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,100
The book has, well,

189
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,400
as they say,

190
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,080
Sit ocebol on the map.

191
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,980
But not just Osebol may

192
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,320
Without the entire countryside in Norra Klarälvdalen.

193
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32.060
Yes

194
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,720
Books, for me, books have always been a huge part of my life.

195
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,360
Yes, but, for me ...

196
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,620
I believe that books and literature mean different things

197
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,700
for different people.

198
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,940
Through literature and books of different kinds so

199
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,140
partly is books something that takes longer to read

200
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,220
than a newspaper text,

201
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,120
or takes longer to take part in a television element,

202
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,340
so one gets like a depth in something

203
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,040
I think it's important,

204
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,920
Just that time it takes to read a book,

205
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,620
that one gives something that time

206
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,520
and take that time to think about

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,460
and be involved in this particular

208
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,440
which this book is about.

209
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,220
I have been thinking about that may have become more important now when

210
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,740
the information flow is still much larger

211
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,840
than it was when I grew up in Osebol.

212
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,700
Then also books are a way to

213
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,800
try out their own view of the world

214
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,375
Against others' view of the world.

215
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,180
It is unbelievable...

216
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,840
an incredible tool for discovering the world and oneself

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Is books and literature.

218
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,140
Right now I'm reading Michel Houellebecqs

219
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,100
Second novel, I think it is,

220
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,880
The element particles.

221
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,900
I have read his later books

222
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,520
But I hadn't read it.

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,380
It's just an example of I think,

224
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,901
one, really,

225
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,760
His novels are books that make me,

226
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,540
They challenge me

227
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,020
In my view of the world and

228
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,320
humanity.

229
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,720
Then I read in parallel,

230
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,540
I often read a trade book

231
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,360
At the same time as I read a fiction book,

232
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,840
So I am also doing a book by Anna Jungstrand,

233
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,120
The documentary and literature,

234
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,880
So it's all about a little neighbor

235
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,680
What I am doing myself.

236
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,340
Yes, but I think,

237
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,340
A thing that I think,

238
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09.040
As I have read more of lately,

239
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,280
These are short stories

240
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,500
and there are a lot of good short story collections

241
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,200
As a man, there is as much as possible,

242
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,760
But for example

243
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,740
Olga Tokarczuk

244
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,680
have a short story collection called

245
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,140
Games on many small drums.

246
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,500
Then I have also just read Sven Olov Karlssons

247
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,960
The yearbook

248
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,400
And Annika Norlin has just come out with a short story collection,

249
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,520
And it's something you can read aloud to each other,

250
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,660
If one splits this one

251
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,340
quarantine time with someone or some

252
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,580
so a short story is like,

253
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,680
one just right,

254
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,540
It takes just a long time, somehow, to read a short story

255
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,840
In a while in the evening, for example.

256
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,540
So that's my tip.
