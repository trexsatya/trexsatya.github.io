1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,120
Look at the hare, rushing, hopping
and running, but getting nowhere.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,040
But what's this? A tortoise!

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,440
Methodical, clever, focused,
taking one step at a time.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,320
Now that's something else!

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,800
That's kind of how it is with maths.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,040
Doing maths can be hard,
even feel hopeless at times.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,960
When that happens, don't speed up.
Instead, take it slow.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,320
One step at a time. It's not a race.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,440
Don't be like the hare: rushing,
guessing and hoping for the best.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,440
Think like the tortoise.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,760
Be methodical. It won't be quick, but
you're not being judged on your speed.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,200
And in the end, the tortoise gets it right.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,520
There are a lot of strategies to use
in maths.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,200
The most important one is perhaps
to take it slow.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,320
Take a deep breath and examine
your result. Does it make sense?

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,840
If it's an equation, substitute x
for your answer and count again.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,560
That way, you'll know if you're right.
That's pretty smart.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,280
So, take it easy.
One step at a time, like the tortoise.
