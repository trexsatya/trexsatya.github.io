Hi Adrienne, this is the Swedish Research Council.

00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,600
See if I come in here.

[The global nobility. The power of the elite behind closed doors.]

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,060
The closed room gives a kind of mysticism around it.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,820
You get curious about that

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,080
One would like to join in and see

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,900
What happens behind it?

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,020
[The think tank World Economic Forum]

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,620
The biggest meeting, for which they are best known, is what is happening in Davos at the end of January

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,260
Many of those who participate hope that they will be allowed to come to a meeting to

17
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,320
And another meeting after that.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,720
It's like they dream of belonging to a global nobility

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,800
where they dubate each other to become world enhancers

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,300
Global elites who want to improve the world

[Hidden agenda. Power without responsibility.]

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,660
It is one reason why they are so interesting, they are part of a larger trend,

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,380
who go towards some groups, we can call them elites,

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,460
Like want to pull away and have closed meetings

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,460
and discuss difficult questions.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,600
What happens there is about power

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,400
A form of discreet power.

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,060
Discreetly precisely because we can't see it, and we can't hear it

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,200
Those who participate tell very little about what is really said there.

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,420
There are both positive and negative consequences

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,919
It is good if political leaders can talk and come up with good solutions

32
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,560
For the world's most difficult problem

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,720
The disadvantage is, of course, that we just do not have transparency.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,460
We don't know what's going on.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,120
We do not know how to demand responsibility for what is happening there.

36
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,760
And we do not know how those who are welcome there have been selected, on what grounds

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,240
Who are they said to represent?

41
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,200
Yeah it is adrienne

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,780
Why is it so important to research this really?

43
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,180
It is a matter of democracy.

44
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
These closed arenas, they are becoming more and more.

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,620
And that means that more political issues

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,500
Become a reality in these closed rooms.

47
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,580
It is so effective to do that way

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Instead of doing something very public.

49
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,180
But it is not so good for us who are citizens.

50
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,940
Because we need to know what is happening and we may need to discuss

51
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,880
What this development means.

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,940
For this to be possible, we need to have stable and reliable knowledge

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,240
about that change.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,400
So, we need research.

55
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,640
That was a good answer!
