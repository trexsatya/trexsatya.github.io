1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
To talk and reason orally

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,120
included in several subjects in school

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,000
and that is something your teachers judge

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,440
when to score.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,280
But how to do to widen

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,680
and deepen a discussion

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,360
And make sure it leads to a well -developed reasoning?

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,000
Here are some good things to think about!

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,280
Keep a nice tone

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,480
and contribute to a good call climate

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,200
where everyone is allowed to speak

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,360
and feel comfortable to be with.

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,360
And where everyone's opinions are respected.

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,000
It is important to let many different perspectives

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,640
and ideas come up,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,320
In this way, the discussion is broadened and deepened.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,920
Participate actively and engaged in the call

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,800
And adapt your language to what you are talking about.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
It might be good to have some extra control

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,920
on important concepts that belong to the subject.

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,480
Try to formulate your thoughts in a clear way

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,320
and was factual by using

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,000
Well substantiated opinions and arguments.

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,280
Also, be sure to stick to the subject.

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,000
Remember it is equally important to listen to the others in the group

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,520
Like talking for yourself.

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,560
Invite the others in the conversation and ask follow -up questions

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,800
In order to further develop the reasoning.

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,840
To broaden and deepen the discussion,

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,480
Listen carefully to the others' views and spin on!

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,040
And if you find it scary to talk to others,

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,640
Try to say something early in the lesson.

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,080
Often it feels creepier the longer you wait.

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,120
So in order to facilitate for oneself

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,600
Can you say something small at the beginning!
