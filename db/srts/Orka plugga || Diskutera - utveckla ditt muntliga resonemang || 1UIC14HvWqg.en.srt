00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,040
Oral discussions and arguments are 
a natural part of many school subjects-

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,440
-and your teachers assess your skills 
when they grade you.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,640
But how do you broaden 
and deepen the discussion-

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,680
-in order to reach 
a well-founded argument?

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,880
Here are some great tips:

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,720
Keep a friendly tone and contribute 
to a positive conversational climate-

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,680
-where everyone feels comfortable 
talking and participating-

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,600
-and where everyone's opinions 
are respected.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,120
It's important to let many different 
perspectives and ideas be heard.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,440
That way 
you broaden and deepen the discussion.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,360
Be an active and engaged part 
of the conversation-

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,840
-and adapt your language 
to the subject at hand.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,640
It's good to have a grasp of important 
terms associated with the subject.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,040
Try to articulate your thoughts 
and make them clear.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,040
Be matter of fact, by using 
well-founded reasons and arguments.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,320
And remember: Stick to the subject.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,880
Don't forget that it's just as important 
to listen to the others, as it is to speak.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
Invite everyone into the conversation 
and ask them follow-up questions-

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
-as a way to help develop 
the conversation.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,320
In order to broaden 
and deepen the discussion-

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,160
-pay attention to everyone's views 
and build on them.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,840
If you find it scary 
to talk in front of people-

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,160
-try to speak and say something 
early on in class.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,320
It might be scarier if you wait too long-

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,720
-but adding a short statement early on 
can help make things easier for you.
