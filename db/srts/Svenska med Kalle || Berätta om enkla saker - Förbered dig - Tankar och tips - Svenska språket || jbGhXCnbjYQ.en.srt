00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello again

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08.340
I was going to record a new video

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,040
And I will remember to say that I am texting these videos

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,080
I write subtitles

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,840
So if you put on subtitles in

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,020
the movie on your mobile or computer

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,540
so can you see quite exactly what I say

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,520
So it is good if you find it difficult to understand just by listening

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,940
So check it out, how to put on the subtitles, so you get more out of this video

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,640
And last time I gave some ideas or discussed a little

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,060
how to practice writing

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,800
in a systematic way

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,180
gradually

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
with a small plane

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,740
And today I was going to continue a bit on the same theme

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,200
but talk maybe more about telling things

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,760
And then I think orally orally

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,780
But really so

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,200
fits this way of thinking both

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,680
When you write and when you tell

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,660
But my main point, the most important

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,880
What I want to come up with is that I think you will gain very much from ....

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,780
study and train with a plan

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,020
to always have a small plan

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,340
And then I don't mean any big one-year plan but more how you train day by day

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,240
And then I just think about

27
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00.800
So, all the chances you have to train something

28
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03.660
by telling something

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,100
and it may be in class if you go to school

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,860
or it can be with friends you train with

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,320
Swedish friends or other friends who also learn Swedish

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,440
or it might be a language friend or a language café, it doesn't matter

33
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,440
I think about this when I work in school with my students

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,660
But this way works in many different situations

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,080
And what I think is to

36
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,900
when something happens

37
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,980
small in your life

38
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,860
It might be that you greet someone

39
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,180
that you go to a party

40
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,820
that you go to language café, that you go to the dentist

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
that you buy clothes

42
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,140
It really doesn't matter

43
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,900
All these small situations, things that happen in your life.

44
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09.800
You can use this to train Swedish

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,160
By telling us about that

46
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,540
So for example if you

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,700
went to a concert and listened to music

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,780
or you went to a theater or movie

49
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
and looked at something

50
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,860
So maybe you can tell it to your classmates at school

51
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,200
the next day

52
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Maybe you can ask your teacher

53
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,660
Is it okay if I take five minutes and tell you about this movie I saw for example

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,600
Or take one of your friends and say that now I want to try to tell something in Swedish

55
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,920
Can you listen a little to me then I will try to tell

56
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02.260
what happened yesterday, or last week

57
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06.660
or something you should do in the future

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,460
It doesn't matter, it can be both past and future

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,040
But the important then, this I mean by having a plan

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,620
It is that if you are going to tell us something, for example for the class

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,560
as you have done or something that has happened

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
so prepare a little

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,520
Don't just think yes yes, I'll tell you something uhh

64
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,660
and then when you stand there and tell you you notice

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
that there are many words

66
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,660
As you cannot in Swedish

67
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,940
thus important words that you need

68
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
for the others to understand you

69
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:51,820
This is where you can become more efficient and learn faster

70
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
if you

71
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58.060
for example in the evening when you get home and you have done something

72
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,940
Sit down for a while with lexicon

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,800
And look up five or ten more important words that

74
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09.440
you need to tell us about this thing

75
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,940
and maybe think of some sentences

76
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,080
I do not mean that you should write a whole text

77
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,380
But when you think about this situation

78
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,520
So will you find words that you can in your mother tongue

79
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
that you would use if you told a friend in your mother tongue

80
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,860
But as you have not learned on the Swedish end

81
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,940
And now is a fantastic opportunity

82
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,480
to teach you those words and try to use those words

83
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,320
and that said, it can be about telling you something in two, or three or five minutes

84
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,740
The important thing is that you

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54.620
actively trying to find words you need

86
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59.820
To tell you something that has happened to you in person in your life

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,200
Why is it so important to tell things? Yes...

88
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09.080
I've been thinking a lot about this ...

89
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,640
lately and we work pretty much with this in my class

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,500
... that stories are an important way to get to know each other

91
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,660
Both to show themselves and as well as presenting who you are

92
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,200
and also just get social contact

93
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,280
We do very much by telling little things about our lives, about what has happened to us ...

94
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,700
It can ... and also just ....

95
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,940
In everyday life to tell you that you had problems with the car or that you bought a nice shower yesterday

96
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49.060
And you got it cheap ...

97
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,920
or that the train was delayed

98
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,800
all this we do

99
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,120
To get in touch with each other and get closer to each other and ...

100
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,420
Then you can step by step

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09.760
train yourself to get better at doing it

102
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
in Swedish

103
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:19,720
And it is not just to learn new words or use better grammar

104
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,920
It is important and you also practice that but ...

105
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:30,980
The most important goal of that is to get a chance to talk

106
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,140
with people in Swedish in a more relaxed manner

107
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,240
Get more contact and better contact and would I say in the end

108
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,780
become more yourself in Swedish

109
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,900
When you are new or not great in a language, then you are not really yourself

110
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56.060
So I can feel for myself, so I can feel anyway

111
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01.440
And to practice telling, it's a way to

112
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
be able to step by step

113
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,500
be more yourself in your new language

114
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09.960
In this case Swedish

115
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,000
And if you are a beginner then you can't start with difficult things

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,900
This is where the plan comes in

117
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,720
Tomorrow you can tell me that you listened to this video for example

118
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,460
And the day after tomorrow you can tell me that you woke up a little late in the morning and be really tired

119
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,980
And after the weekend you might be able to tell us how you called a friend

120
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,100
and tell me something about what you were talking about

121
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,080
Think about it! There is an incredible force

122
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,680
in telling simple things, to develop their language

123
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,360
But you have to look for the situations and opportunities

124
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00.580
and you have to look for the words and expressions

125
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02.560
that allows you to tell

126
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06.840
So that's my tip

127
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09.960
Prepare a little! It doesn't take long.

128
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,340
And then find an opportunity to

129
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,180
Exercise on what you've prepared

130
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,220
And you will learn something

131
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,060
every time you do it

132
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,040
Those steps together can take you long way

133
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
With your Swedish language

134
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
so take that chance

135
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,180
Tell us something in Swedish!

136
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,080
Every day, you will learn a lot

137
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,140
I am pretty sure

138
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,020
That's what I had and say

139
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Thank you so much for listening and ...

140
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Please check the links in the description

141
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,520
There is a link to my blog among other things

142
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,680
and there you can read

143
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
About more tips on how to work out

144
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03,280
and just practice words and lyrics too

145
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,120
And as I said, don't forgot to put the texts on the video

146
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
so it becomes easier to understand what I say

147
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,220
Have a great time. See you again soon. Bye!
