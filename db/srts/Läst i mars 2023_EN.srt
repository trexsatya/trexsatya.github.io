00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:12,498
  Hello, Elza here from Elzasbokhylla. It's time to summarize the reading for March.

2
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:21,502
It's been a real month, I have to say that. But my top three is really top three.

3
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:26,254
Everything else is a bit like that.

4
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:32,122
I have even gained the DNF two books already this month.

5
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:39,868
  As I said before that I am, like almost a reading, but ..

6
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:45,840
I believe that thanks to I have DNF: that two books and that I have as well

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,931
  really listened to what I'm craving, my mood so,

8
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:56,147
So I feel that the lubrication does not feel as tangible

9
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:59,445
Or it feels like it is starting to back down.

10
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:02,703
   So I'm very happy about it. But there are some books.

11
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:06,948
I start with what I liked at least and ending with what I liked best

12
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:12,455
But it's a meh month so I might not be so enthusiastic when I talk about these

13
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:13,935
Until we get to the top three.

14
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:17,840
The first book I want to talk about is actually this series that I go through now,

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,840
  Haunting Danielle. This book, The Ghost Who Wanted Revenge, could it be book three, book four? I do not know. I have kind of lost myself

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,840
  In this series as I just, yes, take them one by one and it should be 31 books in this series. But The Ghost Who Wanted Revenge

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:43,840
  by Bobby Holmes. I thought it was boring because it had a lot, some characters from all these books. You can not

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,878
  Listen to them even but you have to listen to them in order, in the right order.

19
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,538
And these characters who are in this book,

20
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:56,737
  I'm not so interested in them. I think they were boring.

21
00:01:56,737 --> 00:02:01,899
It's fun still. I'm still giggling. It is still a cozy ghost story.

22
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:08,840
But just in this book I experienced it more like it was tough. That's how it is. I'm still curious about the series

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,264
  But I think it's tough. I think I gave it a third but I mean two and a half. So.

24
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:15,264
So you know

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,858
Other book I want to talk about is the book that chance chose and it is stags by M.A. Bennett.

26
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:25,995
This is all about like one, it's like almost like

27
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:34,971
  Hunger Games meets dark Harry Potter type. Because this is British too. Incredibly British.

28
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:37,381
Spring, what was her name?

29
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:40,444
  McDonalds. What is her name? Our main character.

30
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:43,313
I think she is called McDonald's in surname. That's why I remember it.

31
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:45,345
  The surname not the first name.

32
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:46,985
Anyways.

33
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:54,167
She is taken to this prestigious school. She goes there. She gets some kind of scholarship.

34
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,829
She goes there and all of a sudden this starts.

35
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:05,041
Everyone is very rich and it is very good and it is very private and it is incredibly British.

36
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:11,840
  So she gets to come along and she is kind of taken to accompany the richest and nicest guy's

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,000
  Cottage to spend a weekend there.

38
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:24,568
Then they have three games. They should hunt, they should fish, they will be something more.

39
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:26,500
She thinks this is just

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,561
  A game and play for fun. These three games turn out to be very bloody.

41
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:37,620
I liked this one, I liked the reader. It was very good excitement

42
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:45,746
But there were no disputes. Everything was so predictable.

43
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:52,079
I already knew what was going to happen. I've done a vlog on this.

44
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,840
  I link the vlog down there if you want to know more about what I think. I think I gave the third, meant two and a half. But do you want to know more

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,185
  About what I think and thought, I link the vlog down there.

46
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:05,840
The next book we will talk about is actually a review copy. A deck. I thought

47
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,302
  Notice that it is so exciting. I talk about white like snow by Samuel Björk.

48
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:14,840
I should be apparently. This one is part of a series of the wonderful

49
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,423
  It is called. The wonderful granddaughter Mia Kruger together with the police Holger Munk.

50
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:27,255
There is a series here but this case is just a prequel. That's how they met.

51
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:34,840
I thought it was pretty good to jump into this. It was great to jump into it because what comes late in their lives is not revealed.

52
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,336
  Because they have just begun. So it was pretty good to start with this book I thought.

53
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:46,957
There are two boys who are murdered. These are psychopaths. It's puzzle decks.

54
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,751
  It's excitement, excitement.

55
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:51,415
I thought this was great indeed.

56
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:55,523
I listened to them and it was even better indeed. Very good reader.

57
00:04:55,523 --> 00:05:04,840
  But what I thought was such a shame was that it was not original. It was typically decks. A thrill novel where one gets exactly

58
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:12,840
  What one expects from a suspense novel. That way it is perfect. If you are looking for a suspense novel/deck then you have this one

59
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,370
  Definitely recommend this.

60
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,840
It was no problem that it is not original. It's a bit boring just. But what I had a little problem with is enough

61
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,707
  And that's probably because I don't know Mia Kruger this wonderful. It's her first case.

62
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:31,229
It is that I do not know her but she is so damn smart.

63
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,780
  She just knows everything. The problem is that I have a hard time buying it.

64
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,093
For me she just guesses. How does she know all this and so she says anyway

65
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:50,590
  wow whatever you can. How will you say you can she only. I read a lot about Ture Crime stuff.

66
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:56,337
I thought it couldn't make you a professional. There must be something else that makes you wonderful and it will not come out.

67
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,840
  I thought that was a shame. But I am curious about the series and would like to read more about Mia and Munk.

68
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,744
So I think I gave this third.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,815
The next book is actually a "dust off" book. A book like me ..

70
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:16,840
Could it be the nicest book I own. Deep light by Frances Harding.

71
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:22,440
  Hardinge? Harding? I still haven't looked up how to pronounce her last name

72
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,230
But Frances. And check out what good it is.

73
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,370
  Everything with this book attracts me. Everything with this book.

74
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,527
And that's a fantasy. We follow two boys. What was his name? Hark and jolt.

75
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,257
  They are best friends. They are orphans.

76
00:06:40,257 --> 00:06:47,840
In this world, there were gods in the sea that they sacrificed things to them and such worship.

77
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,692
  There was a fight between these gods so they all died and their bodies dropped to the bottom.

78
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:59,840
In this world after 30-50 years after all gods are dead.

79
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:09,834
  Every body part of the gods is worth a lot of money. These two boys are looking to find

80
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:14,840
A body part, a piece of a god to sell and become rich.

81
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,413
  And a lot of things happen.

82
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:21,872
I don't know what it is with this book that doesn't really get stuck.

83
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,840
  It starts very well, is very curious, is extremely interested.

84
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,555
  It becomes like twister and everything it is.

85
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:34,312
There are Twists and Turns in this book Absolutely.

86
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:38,840
I think it's about having a hard time. The rhythm of the language was a problem.

87
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,145
  It stopped at me all the time.

88
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:51,644
It was not a wonderful flow and I don't really know why. Then it is very tough. It bites incredibly tough.

89
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,926
  It doesn't happen so much and you have to be very much..yes ..

90
00:07:56,746 --> 00:08:02,084
But it is still well written in the way that it portrays these boys' relationship very well.

91
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:09,912
  How they are best friends but there is different power between them.

92
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:13,112
I can't explain without revealing too much and I don't want to.

93
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:17,190
  I think it's still readable. I probably expected so much more.

94
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,893
What I loved was how ..

95
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,859
How I felt I was living on an island.

96
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:27,908
  That it was the sea was everywhere. The wind, the salt smell, all that I really love with

97
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,840
After all, being close to the sea was here.

98
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,399
  But I wished it was more speed in it. That's probably it.

99
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,892
A third. Strong like that. Still very good looking.

100
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:39,712
I thought I had a little too high expectations too.

101
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,495
  Another "dust off" comes here.

102
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:47,277
I was most curious about this book.

103
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,117
I wanted to know what relationship I would have with this writer.

104
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:55,996
  Because I read another book by this writer and it is so shark this book and ...

105
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:58,530
  I became like this, I understand but still do not understand.

106
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:03,806
  So I thought I have another book by this author so that I test and see what I think.

107
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,667
  I'm talking about history is all you left me off. Adam Silvera.

108
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:14,146
After all, Adam Silvera wrote this incredibly shark book. Or popular by the book.

109
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,692
  They Both Die at the End. And..

110
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:24,840
I read it. I was very upset, peppered and just wow everyone likes it. I also want to like it.

111
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,755
  But there was something that made me not.

112
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't really know why. So I was curious about, it is his way of writing or was it because I am not at all connected with the characters.

113
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,239
  In this book we have to come along, and what was he called now? Griffin.

114
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,270
His first love, when we meet him so his first love. Theo dead. He died in an accident.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,072
And his boyfriend and his lifelong love, or what to say. They are probably young. Have died in an accident.

116
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:59,861
  I don't know what it was for accident. Drowning accident. At least he is dead.

117
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:10,840
And then he starts writing to Theo and we can follow both then how Theo and Griffin got to know each other.

118
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:19,840
  How their love arose. And then we jump to the present. He will try to handle the funeral. And Theo's boyfriend. Because they ended.

119
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,840
  Theo found another. Jackson thinks his name was. And now he will relate. This is a grief process simply.

120
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,395
  You can follow Griffin's grief process.

121
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,840
What the grief does to him. What choice he makes because of the grief.

122
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,536
  I thought this one was totally okay. But I didn't cry. Don't be sad at all.

123
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,639
Partly because I don't like the characters. Or I like a character.

124
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,410
  But he who we can come along. Griffin and Theo. Those two love couple. It is an incredibly destructive.

125
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,410
I didn't think it was at all loving.

126
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,498
  I understand he thinks so. But from the outside, I think this was a very destructive love. I don't think at all ..

127
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:00,498
They were toxic. Both were Toxic.

128
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,741
  It was so hard to see their love when I actually don't think they should be together.

129
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:10,586
So. I do not know. It was something that didn't really work.

130
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,300
  Third. Yes.

131
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:20,496
Still, I think the strength of this book is that Adam Silvera is actually very good at putting words into grief.

132
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,604
  Some chapters were like this it feels

133
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:30,673
when losing someone. This really heavy grief that cannot be described. But he succeeds. I think he does.

134
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,852
  Therefore, I think this one took even if I didn't cry.

135
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:44,673
So I got. That was good. Strongly said. More than they Both die at the end. Do I have to say.

136
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,136
  A third. Adam Silvera and I ...

137
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:54,000
We have taken a break from each other. It is also not such great relationship we have.

138
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
Another "dust off".

139
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,248
  I'll just say that this month I can tick off four of them.

140
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:04,840
I am very proud, very happy and very, very, very nice. Do I have to say.

141
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,863
  Okay. This other. This was a book I bought on second hand.

142
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,840
A few years ago. Two years ago maybe. And I know there is a TV series.

143
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,438
  And everything with this book attracts me.

144
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:24,840
And it was good. I'm talking about The Returned, the returners as it is called in Swedish. By Jason Mott.

145
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,840
  There is a TV series. I haven't got the series yet. But firstly, I think I think it is an incredibly nice cover.

146
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,834
  This one is reminiscent of the plot. Or the act itself reminds of

147
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:40,498
The handling of undead by John Ajvide Lindqvist. You know.

148
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,791
  There, suddenly, kill just live again and come back to their loved ones.

149
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,791
And it's a bit like happening here too.

150
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:55,083
  In this world, where Jason Mott has written then, the dead start to return.

151
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,894
And then we have to come with this couple.

152
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:03,176
  A retirement couple who lost their son type 30-40 years ago. When he was only eight.

153
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:05,381
He comes back, is still eight years old.

154
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,840
  And so they have to handle this. And how the world handles this great situation as well.

155
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:19,840
  I like this take it. I like it. I like it much more. It is much more philosophical and turns and turns on the moral thinking.

156
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:30,840
  How to do? And how the world, different continents, different people handle such a great crisis.

157
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,840
  I think it's world -written that way. But it is so incredibly tough. It's not so much action.

158
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,840
  It's not very thick either. But it felt very thick, I must say.

159
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,840
  I also gave this a third. You hear, this is like this meh month. All is three. Two and a half, threes.

160
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:56,840
  And this is no underwear. But then, I like this. I like how it is low -key, character -driven.

161
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,000
  It doesn't happen very much, but still ..

162
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,849
Still I have to say ..

163
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:06,939
That I wish there was a little more drive in it.

164
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:12,840
  I wish there was a little more action in it. Sure, I understand that he wanted to turn around and twist on the question about life after death,

165
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:20,840
  About religion, about all this as you know. This extensial. I appreciate that.

166
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:28,840
  But you can actually have some action too. Or shorten it. A third as I said. But yes, I want to watch the TV series a lot now.

167
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,840
  In fourth place now. Soon we are in the top three. Oh, what I long to talk about this top three.

168
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,546
  But before it goes to them I'll talk about ..

169
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:40,940
The Ghost Who wasn. This one I am almost sure is type ..

170
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:43,367
number two, number three in

171
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:47,433
Haunting Daniele series.

172
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:54,694
I like this very much and that is because I like the character we can follow here.

173
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:57,659
  There are different characters.

174
00:14:57,893 --> 00:15:02,294
I think this one was great because it is nice. In this, the sibling was emerged.

175
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,658
  It's about Danielle's best friend.

176
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm not going to reveal that much. But here at least it is the characters that make me like this one

177
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:14,633
  Much more than if I like the other books for example.

178
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:21,162
It is a nice friendship that is well written and well portrayed.

179
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:27,840
  That makes me like it. A character. It's cute. I giggle. I don't take everyone seriously.

180
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,840
  And so I have to say that in this series at all, people die to the right and left and become ghosts and create chaos for our Danielle.

181
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,244
  That's what the whole series is all about. So you know. I do not know.

182
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:43,645
But this one was great and that was exactly what I wanted and needed.

183
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:50,840
  I actually gave the four. A strong four I think. I do not remember. I think I gave it four. What did I give these stuff?

184
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,620
  But it may not matter with the grade. I liked this one. I had fun.

185
00:15:56,293 --> 00:16:00,000
And this was exactly what I needed, cozy ghost story

186
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,009
  Hörrni, now we are in the top three.

187
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:08,405
Speaking of cozy books. After all, I'm such a person who doesn't really like cozy books.

188
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:14,660
  And it worked with these Hunting Danielle because there is a ghost or natural touch in it. And it works for me.

189
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:22,806
  But on the other hand. For those of you who know, I am trying to get me through this book challenge.

190
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:30,840
Goodreads Choice Award. There they have listed different nominations and so we all vote for who we think should win.

191
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,512
  I will go through and read all the books in the Mystery Thriller category.

192
00:16:37,098 --> 00:16:40,064
And in it there is this ..

193
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:41,840
The man ..

194
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,840
  This is at least the third book in the Thursday mothers club is there. And then I realize that I just read the first book.

195
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,840
  And then I thought, then I can get through the second book to see what I feel. And it is the man who died twice. So then I listened to it.

196
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,840
  And I'll be honest, I don't like a cozy deck. And I was not very impressed by the Thursday mother's club either.

197
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,839
  It was cozy like that. But you know I was not so impressed. I just, yes.

198
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:13,839
  So when I went into this book I was like this, we'll see. I have to read it to understand what is happening in book number three. I do not know.

199
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,839
  And I was so pleasantly surprised. This one was so much better than the first book.

200
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:27,839
  Here came like, okay we get to come with four pensioners who live in one, we are still, we have been here somewhere, we are in London, England.

201
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,840
  England, very British. It is too, it was very British this month. In all cases.

202
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:42,840
  Who lives in an old age home. They have different properties all and they have a True Crime club.

203
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:50,840
  Where they will solve True Crimes. And then it happens that people die and then they should solve real cases. And here it is also the same thing here too.

204
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,840
  But now we get to know much more about the main character. Elisabeth's background, she has a very interesting background.

205
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,840
  And so we have Joyce who is probably the cutest aunt in the world. And we have Ron and so we have Ibrahim.

206
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,840
  And this is one, that is what lovely, what a lovely, what a lovely gang. I do not know.

207
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,840
  And I thought it was very interesting with the case itself as well. Was very interesting.

208
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:20,840
  It was like so twist and turns. There were actually turns. I gave it a four and am so happy.

209
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,840
  For now I became even more peppy in continuing to read the third book. Now I look forward to reading the third book.

210
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,840
  So it was pretty nice, I thought. I gave it a four and didn't think I would like it as much as I actually did.

211
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,840
  Because I didn't like one so much. So, yay! Am I becoming a cozy reader? No.

212
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:51,840
  In place number two, then we have a dust off. And a dust of a favorite author.

213
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:00,840
  Oh, I have postponed this book and read. I have wanted to read it for a long time, but I have postponed it because I think the act itself is heavy.

214
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,840
  Be heavy and difficult and scary and hard. So I had to postpone it.

215
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:12,840
  But then I saw that this author will come out with a new book in September. That is about a character that I love.

216
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:24,840
  I'm talking about Stephen King and his outsider. I was told that I should not read outsider until I have read the Mercedes trilogy.

217
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:33,840
  Because this reveals, it spoils the trilogy. So then I went through the trilogy and I did that last year.

218
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:46,840
  And then I have taken on and read outsider. For outsiders, a little boy is horrible murdered in a very brutal and bestial way.

219
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:59,840
  And the city's star coach is accused. And then it turns out that people have seen him that time the boy is murdered.

220
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:09,840
  At the same time, his alibi is waterproof. And who happened? Supernatural touch on the whole, of course.

221
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:18,840
  I thought it was so hard to read. I think it is so hard to read when children and animals are ill. It's kind of the hardest thing to read about.

222
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:27,840
  Especially children I have to say. It's incredibly hard. So I have taken power to read it and God how happy I am that I did it for this one is so good.

223
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:37,840
  It's so good. It is typically decks. Typically thriller with a super -natural touch. And I love that. I love it.

224
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:49,840
  The end is fantastic. Maybe a little flat like that. The best thing about this is that a favorite character from the Mercedes trilogy comes and is in here.

225
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:59,840
  I love her. I love Holly. I'm not going to reveal. It's Holly. Okay sorry. And a whole book called Holly is coming out this fall.

226
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:08,840
  So you think I have to read this to be prepared this fall when it comes out. This one was great. Exciting. Bit incredibly unpleasant.

227
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:19,840
  But the characters are so damn credible. Everything is so credible. It's like I read about real people. I love it. I gave it strong four.

228
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:32,840
  It is thick but I did not experience it as superfluous. Nothing was superfluous, I can say. And in place number one we have world literature.

229
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:42,840
  I changed world literature I can say. I would go to Colombia but it didn't go so well. I didn't like that book so I paused that book.

230
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:54,840
  But I didn't go much anymore. I went to Argentina and I chose to read it. With that I feel that I am weak, I chose to read a short -life shortening of Mariana Enriquez.

231
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:07,840
  This is she who has written our part of the night. You who hang out here know that I pay tribute to it to the rail. I love that book.

232
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:19,840
  It was last year's absolute favorite. Both last year's absolute favorite but overall an incredibly strong reading experience for me.

233
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,840
  They were obviously curious about the author. Here we have her novelty collection which is translated into Swedish. I read it as an e-book.

234
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:37,840
  As it is with novelty collections. Some are better than others. More memorable. So it is with this one too. But I love every novel.

235
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:48,840
  I love what it gives me. It gives me so unpleasant. For all these novels, a magical realism/supernatural touch has on them.

236
00:22:48,840 --> 00:23:00,840
  But it is not straight out supernatural or straight out magical realism. It is this unpleasant that Enriquez is brilliant.

237
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:12,840
  She portrays this just writing about unpleasant situations. As a reader, this person knows this in each scene.

238
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:22,840
  I thought there are two three short stories in this short -term collection are cool reading experiences.

239
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:31,840
  This is the second work I read by Enriquez. I can say that this cool reading experience.

240
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,840
  Because she takes the temp on Argentina. These are well -critical short stories.

241
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:47,840
Mental health in Argentina during the 00s. And that's so good. I learn so much.

242
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,840
  I gave this strong four, almost four and a half actually. If not a fifth now that I think about it.

243
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:01,840
  So incredible, incredibly well written. Wow. I simply found a new favorite author.

244
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,840
  Now I will read everything she has written. In any case, those who have been translated into Swedish.

245
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:13,840
  It is only this and our part of the night that has been translated so far into Swedish. But I'll read everything.

246
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,840
  Oh god what good she is. So then, here we have them. The books I had to read in March.

247
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:27,840
  As you hear that my top three, or top four, I would actually say, were really the only ones I highly recommend.

248
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,840
  Everything else was very much. But this was done too.

249
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,840
  With that I have chosen a little at random, followed my feeling, the gut feeling.

250
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:45,840
  So I still feel that the lighthouse is two steps further away than it was in early March.

251
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,840
  But of course, I am very curious about what you think about my books that I have read.

252
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,840
  Some of those you haven't heard before or heard about, tell me in the comments field and we will hear there.

253
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Don't forget to give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel, if you don't already.

254
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,840
  See you next week. Farewell. Bye!
