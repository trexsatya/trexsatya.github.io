00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,756
Hello! My name is Julia Andersson-

2
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09.384
-And I study work science at Halmstad University.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,553
Right now I'm sitting in house S.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,264
I chose to read this program as it is one-

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17.517
-Bred education that provides many job opportunities.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,769
There are also great choices after graduation-

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,313
-So that you can work with a lot of different things.

8
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:26,860
The best thing about my program is that we read many different courses-

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,280
-If both people and theoretical things.

10
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,158
We read, among other things, law and financial

11
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,202
-What is very sought after knowledge in the labor market.

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,997
This is a whole new program at Halmstad University.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,415
It has been around before, but are now-

14
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,127
-More specialized and a little more niche in work science.

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47.630
In the third year we get the chance to choose intermediate-

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,718
-to study abroad, practice or choose your own courses so that man-

17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,763
-Can form the education a little according to how you want it yourself.

18
00:00:55,096 --> 00:01:00.018
In the future, I would have liked to work with recruitment or other HR issues-

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:05.231
-In that I like to work in groups and meeting new people.

20
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08.151
Something unique about this program is that man-

21
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,571
-Directly after graduation can be given a leading role.

22
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,784
One can become manager or leader directly, because it is something-

23
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,160
-We plug in to become.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,038
One tip is to be on the zero before school start-

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,708
-To you get to meet all the new friends with whom you should go to the same class.

26
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,921
Then it will not be as scary to start school later.
