1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
.........

2
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:23,602
My name is Joanna Lundin and working as

3
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:28,963
NPF educator at Källbrinksskolan in Huddinge.

4
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:31,967
And what I do, purely physically, is that I

5
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:34,293
wrists, coaches and educates students,

6
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:36,974
Parents and staff around NPF.

7
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:38,614
My name is Maria Koskinen and I am

8
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:40,962
Program manager here at the ESS high school,

9
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:43,035
on our social science program.

10
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:46,195
In my program responsibility I plan schedules,

11
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:49,636
service distribution, structures around meetings

12
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:52,893
and I am a link between students, teachers

13
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:54,593
And all staff and principals.

14
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:56,020
My name is Carina Backström and working as

15
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,890
Swedish teacher at high school.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,374
My name is Emelie Sköld, I'm a teacher at

17
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:04,744
The ESS high school in Swedish, and is also a mentor

18
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:06,084
in a grade one class.

19
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:10,804
The biggest challenge in working with

20
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,134
Pupils with NPF is about emptying one

21
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:14,754
on energy, that they are so intense.

22
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:19,264
It's all or nothing, in everything.

23
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:20,974
While it is a challenge,

24
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:23,534
that is both tough and positive, that they think

25
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:25,964
outside the box.
 That one all the time yourself

26
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:27,474
Must think outside the box.

27
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:32,344
We have to try to adapt as much as we can

28
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:35,044
after all of our students' needs and at the same time

29
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:39,634
Challenge, develop our students as much as possible.

30
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:42,344
And keep these two perspectives together

31
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:45,844
All the time, it's not always that simple.

32
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:53,306
Something that is important is that today's teachers are

33
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:58,256
Extremely flexible.
 One cannot do a planning

34
00:01:58,256 --> 00:02:02,476
And think that it should be followed to the point.

35
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:07,092
That's not the important thing.
 The important thing is to

36
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:09,662
Students come to learning.
 And maybe they were

37
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,762
Takes other ways than I had imagined.

38
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:15,592
But it does nothing, rather the opposite.

39
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:17,786
It is about activating them, that actually

40
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:20,376
Boll back, start discussions, get with

41
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:22,176
them in that "what do you want for something?"

42
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,706
and "What do you need?"
 For we are good at that

43
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:27,256
come up with solutions all the time, say that

44
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,636
"This is what to do".
 But that applies

45
00:02:28,636 --> 00:02:30,846
to get with the student, that the student himself feels

46
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:33,026
that “I have the opportunity to influence and I

47
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:34,086
gets listened to ”.

48
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,856
The good thing to think about with these students

49
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:40,456
is that they often have a great vulnerability from school,

50
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:44,136
That they may not have received the support they needed.

51
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:48,057
Therefore, it is important to catch them quickly.

52
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:50,177
And I think it's a lot about attitude,

53
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:52,087
That we believe in the students, that everyone can.

54
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:54,517
That regardless of the conditions, we find

55
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:56,837
tools that hopefully make everyone

56
00:02:56,837 --> 00:03:00,557
reaches in goal.
 And reach their own goals, above all.

57
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:04,683
Otherwise we here at school think of in our

58
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:06,323
response, it is not to sit and cave

59
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:08,563
In what doesn't work.
 Without looking at it

60
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,543
which is actually good, to work on the basis of pupils'

61
00:03:11,543 --> 00:03:15,543
needs and students' strengths.
 What is

62
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:18,133
Great, just when sitting in coach calls

63
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:20,253
with the students, is that they most often

64
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:23,823
Know themselves what they need.
 That i can do

65
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:27,433
is to help them formulate and present

66
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,903
That for the other college, "This needs the students".

67
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:33,921
At the beginning of the autumn term we always have one

68
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:37,731
In-calls, enrollment calls, where we almost

69
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:40,071
interviewing the student, about what it feels

70
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:42,881
That it needs.
 It may be about that

71
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,421
have to go out of the classroom shorter periods,

72
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:49,861
double sets of teaching materials, that one

73
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:51,521
want things to work with, with your hands

74
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:54,661
At the same time as you have a lesson.
 We'll find out

75
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,341
Very much through these in calls.

76
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,471
What conditions we have to work with

77
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:03,781
and how we can develop together,

78
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:04,971
Me and the student.

79
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,440
An important part of the environment, in terms of

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,053
Aids, we call our SOS boxes.

81
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:22,786
In it there are lots of tools for students who

82
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:24,456
Need different types of aids.

83
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:27,976
It may be that one needs to sit on a cushion like

84
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,356
moving litigant, or a stress ball that

85
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:37,916
Pill with when I go through something.

86
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,083
It may be about visualizing time by the fact that

87
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,653
use a clock, where I show that

88
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:47,013
"Now I'll talk for ten minutes, then you have to take a break."

89
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:49,473
And so we have furnished on a little

90
00:04:49,473 --> 00:04:51,413
different ways than we have done before.

91
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:55,373
There are pilates balls, standing tables, individual

92
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:59,373
booths to sit in, for example.
 And the most important

93
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:02,433
part, as the students think is the best,

94
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:05,423
These are our time-timers.
 A clear time tool

95
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:07,503
Which the students like very, very much.

96
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:10,823
For students with NPF it is important not to

97
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:14,363
have lots of distractors in the classroom, that it

98
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:18,963
there is a structure, that it is order and find out,

99
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:21,623
that not things lie in different places and

100
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,433
are hard to find.
 Without us trying to hold

101
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:26,433
A structure as clearly as possible.

102
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:29,683
We have home classrooms, we choose to students

103
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:31,623
may stay in a classroom and that the teachers

104
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,953
moves on instead.
 We have also done

105
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:36,223
A huge work during the summer where we have

106
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:39,283
removed student cabinets from the corridors and

107
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:42,103
Instead, chosen to have cabinets in the classrooms,

108
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:45,413
Just to save on the energy, to not the student

109
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:48,033
should go out, not remember which book they

110
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,073
Should pick up without getting back with the wrong book.

111
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:52,523
Without they have the books in the classroom so we

112
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:55,549
Easy to move on in teaching,

113
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:57,399
Although they do not have the book with them.

114
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,519
We also have a fixed structure in front of

115
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,889
the board in all classrooms, where we have the headlines

116
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,579
what lesson it is, what time the lesson is in progress,

117
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,999
when it is break, and what, how and

118
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,799
why.
 So we clearly write up

119
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,486
what to do, how to do, and why we should

120
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:22,236
do it.
 And so we have one last heading that

121
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,756
is "what should I do when I'm done?",

122
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,116
so that the student can continue to work,

123
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:29,256
Some are quickly ready.

124
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:34,006
But above all, I think the environment, I am.

125
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:38,538
I create the environment through my leadership,

126
00:06:38,538 --> 00:06:41,338
by being in the classroom.
 By the whole

127
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:45,768
Time with my way of being sets boundaries,

128
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:51,058
shows what is ok, dialogue, make it become

129
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:56,058
Lusty and fun.
 So the most important bit

130
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:57,768
In the learning environment, it is the teacher.

131
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:00,954
We have made a number of adjustments of it

132
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,034
physical learning environment as well, the one that one pure

133
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:06,234
Krassst can see, as part of our NPF fuse.

134
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:07,964
Things we've done is that we have big,

135
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:10,194
clear watches in the corridors and

136
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:12,064
in the classrooms for it to be easy to

137
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,304
Keep track of time.
 We have made sure it is

138
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,964
neutral and colors that are connected to

139
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:20,434
The school, so it should be calm impressions.

140
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:25,524
We have sofas in the corridors that are sound attenuated.

141
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:28,474
When one sits in there it is like a small

142
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,294
Koja, it's really nice to sit in there.

143
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:34,856
We have clear markings of where halls and

144
00:07:34,856 --> 00:07:37,066
Expedition is there so it should be easy to

145
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:38,806
Find for the students.

146
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,486
Often when talking about making adjustments

147
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:43,746
Do you think of everything you can't do,

148
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,146
and we have tried to turn it around and see what we have,

149
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,366
Which is positive.
 This is an old school

150
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,836
built in the 60s, with long corridors,

151
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,966
quite small classrooms, and there are none

152
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,966
Group room.
 But we have done as best we could

153
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:57,646
With what we actually have.
 And tried to see what

154
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,686
Is positive with our premises.
 The changes

155
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,336
We have done has not really cost anything.

156
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:03,486
It is about changing the way of thinking,

157
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:06,226
About knowledge and about response.

158
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,778
For these students it is extremely important

159
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:17,778
with structure.
 They need to know what

160
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:21,438
expected of them, what to do, when they are going to

161
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:24,648
Do it, and how to do it.
 So that you

162
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:27,838
have a clear agenda on the board, one has the time

163
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:30,428
for the whole lesson so everyone knows when starting

164
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:33,408
and ends, one has a clear start and one

165
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:38,868
Clear end to the lesson.
 And that I'm the one

166
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,516
that controls this structure, one might say

167
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:44,546
That I am the structure.
 I say “Welcome,

168
00:08:44,546 --> 00:08:47,796
be good to sit, close the toads,

169
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:52,539
Here I am, welcome to Swedish, today we will ...,

170
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,739
We start with ”, and so on.

171
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:59,659
"Now you are going to ..." that you are extremely clear with what

172
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:01,469
as expected of the students.

173
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:03,359
After all, all students feel good about it.

174
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:07,223
Structure is, as I said, very important for those

175
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:09,223
Here the students and we work with a

176
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:12,293
Color coding system here.
 That means we have

177
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:15,803
Color coded, for example, you have Swedish

178
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:19,463
so it is red on the schedule, and so you have a

179
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:23,113
red cover and a red sticker on it

180
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:26,063
Teaching materials used.
 So then they can just look;

181
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:29,063
"Red, then I bring the red with me".
 It demands

182
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:33,063
not so much, they don't have to waste energy

183
00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:37,131
On reading and looking, without they can only find it.

184
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:38,621
Very practical!

185
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,861
I try to create structure by using

186
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:44,741
PowerPoints that are clear, with which lesson

187
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,821
And where we are.

188
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:49,711
Clear start-up, clear end of the lesson-

189
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:53,021
much with the help of the structure we have on the board

190
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:56,381
But also checklists with what we will

191
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:59,811
do today, so they get the confirmation that

192
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:04,071
We have moved on.
 And time-timers, that

193
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,647
We decide that we should have a review in

194
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,127
Ten minutes and then I can't go on

195
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:12,197
Talk, but then it's time to move on.

196
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:14,177
So it is also part of our structure.

197
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:15,787
As for the teaching, it is

198
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:18,677
very important that when you have had a review,

199
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:21,117
Then I know which students may

200
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:24,277
Have lost focus.
 Directly up to them,

201
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,407
asks “are you with now, look here, we'll start here,

202
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:29,907
do this ". You might make special schedules for

203
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:33,057
Some students, "Do you know, do these three tasks now,

204
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:34,377
and when you're done

205
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,887
can you listen to a song, then you reached up

206
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,707
The hand I come and help you ”.

207
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:41,557
When students get longer jobs that maybe

208
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,907
should last for a while it is important to help

209
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:48,527
The student to stay focused all the way.
 That man

210
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:50,837
can do as an educator is partly that one has

211
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:55,197
reconciliations.
 They may work maybe two lessons,

212
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,707
then man gathered and has a reconciliation-

213
00:10:57,707 --> 00:10:59,557
"How's it going, how are you located, what do you need to think

214
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:03,997
on now? ”If they work independently you have

215
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,967
maybe reconciliation with a student- “Ok, you are

216
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:11,157
here, remove that and do this. "So that

217
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,859
one all the time is with them on the way to

218
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:18,879
the goal and all the time point to it as they have

219
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,219
succeeded with.

220
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:24,395
We try not to have homework in that sense.

221
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:26,615
It is clear that there are tasks that sometimes

222
00:11:26,615 --> 00:11:29,255
need to work with outside lesson time but

223
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,405
By the majority of occasions we try to see

224
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,325
to the fact that there is lesson time to work but

225
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:37,985
We also have the time of study as we know that many

226
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:41,195
Take advantage of.
 So the idea is that they should not

227
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:43,775
have to take home lots of school work.
 Not everyone has

228
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:47,245
the same conditions to plug at home.

229
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:51,005
Some need to rest and do something completely different

230
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:53,625
to recover for the next day.

231
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,779
I adapt my teaching by

232
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,009
try to be varied both on length and

233
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,109
on content.
 Review preferably no longer

234
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:05,029
than a quarter, many people can't listen more than that.

235
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,419
But also vary work tasks,

236
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:11,429
orally or in writing, group work or

237
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:14,039
Individual work.
 For it to fit like that

238
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,789
many as possible.

239
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:19,169
Usually hand out note support there

240
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:20,929
I have written fixed headlines on what we will

241
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:23,289
go through so that students can record

242
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:26,299
under those headings.

243
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,959
Audience copies for powerpoints.

244
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,609
But perhaps the most important thing is to get in

245
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:34,699
students' life world, to be able to vary

246
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,729
based on different things they have met in life

247
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:40,159
and can relate to which makes it a lot

248
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,619
Easier for them to understand different contexts.

249
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,999
How to do for a business to become

250
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:55,499
More NPF-adapted?
 It's a huge question

251
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:58,862
and important question, and a very important foundation

252
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:02,062
is that everyone has a knowledge base so that everyone

253
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:06,722
Throughout the organization should understand what, for example

254
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,049
NPF means.

255
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:10,639
What we do to npf-secure our school is

256
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,389
That we constantly have our NPF glasses on us.

257
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:15,929
It's about looking at the physical

258
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,289
the learning environment, how we post our lessons,

259
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:21,089
It is about organization, about response,

260
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:22,329
And it's about knowledge.
 I would

261
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:24,869
say is the basis of everything for through

262
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,459
knowledge you gain understanding, and otherwise it is

263
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,519
easy to do you to do lots of things without knowing

264
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,019
Why you do it.
 And then it is easy to

265
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,569
one ends with it too because one does not

266
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,649
Understand the purpose of that.
 So it's all about

267
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,369
That knowledge provides understanding.

268
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:39,049
Then the next step is what to do with it

269
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:43,619
Here the knowledge and it is the difficult part.

270
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:47,259
How to put up our structure, our schedule

271
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:52,519
and our entire arrangement at this school,

272
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,939
according to the needs of the students.

273
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:58,939
At our school we ensure the NPF knowledge

274
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,919
in the staff by having repeated

275
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:11,469
lectures, literature spreads, we encourage

276
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:17,459
everyone to attend courses and training and training and

277
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:21,439
In discussions this is something that whole

278
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,459
The time we bring.
 An important foundation.

279
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:28,179
The collegiate learning that we talk a lot about

280
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:33,629
in the school world, is very important.
 It is so

281
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,349
Development takes place at a school, I think.

282
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:40,119
We can bring in very professional lecturers but if

283
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:43,569
We then do not have the discussions in the college,

284
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:45,899
With each other, then it gives no outcome.

285
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,249
Because that's when we talk about how.
 "How will

286
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:51,949
I use this knowledge in the classroom

287
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:54,899
And in my response to the students? ”

288
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:00,199
Also be able to take up difficulties, “Now I have learned

289
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,549
me how to handle concentration difficulties,

290
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,449
But this student that I have in my class,

291
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,879
Nothing works.
 Whatever I do, I reach

292
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,929
not that student ". And we should be able to talk that

293
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,779
About and meet around.

294
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:19,269
Here at the ESS Gymnasium we work in Duo

295
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:21,929
meaning that we are always two teachers in

296
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,509
the classroom and through that I have learned

297
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:28,809
Very much about these students.
 We can

298
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:31,989
Always check ideas and find different solutions.

299
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:36,299
At this school I can get extremely good support

300
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,269
As for students with NPF.
 Partly I have

301
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:41,679
My team where we work a lot with this.

302
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,439
We talk all the time and help each other.

303
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:50,499
We support each other because it is sometimes tough.

304
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,329
Great school management, one can go in and piss

305
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:58,399
And get help.
 You can ask for guidance.

306
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,319
We have an NPF educator who can guide one.

307
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,759
The absolute most fun thing about my job that does

308
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,569
that I, sometimes when it is heavy or that

309
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:11,039
rains and i'm tired and can't, it

310
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,439
is still to get to school and meet

311
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,469
These amazing students.
 Get to work with them

312
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:20,469
and be part of their adult.

313
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:23,039
It makes me happy.

314
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,729
This is the most fun I know.
 I love

315
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,859
to see these students develop, love to

316
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:31,059
be allowed to join in and build up their

317
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:33,679
Self -confidence.
 I would not want to work

318
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,549
somewhere else than here.
