1
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.680
A first love meeting.

2
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.760
They will get married -

3
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.880
- But the future is not as light as they dream of.

4
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.000
We are heading into the time of the superpower.

5
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.520
Soon, small Sweden will become a powerful country in Europe.

6
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.480
Far from big politics, people are struggling in their ordinary lives.

7
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.640
They are the ones who will pay for the kings' successes on the battlefields.

8
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.000
And the price will be high.

9
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.320
This is the story of our country.

10
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.240
About the people and forces that shaped it-

11
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.320
- Endure from the ice age until our days.

12
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.200
This is the story of Sweden.

13
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.160
Gustav Vasa is dead.

14
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.040
His eldest son Erik will inherit the crown.

15
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.080
It is a kingdom in order Erik takes over.
 Gustav Vasa's rule was stable.

16
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.120
Skåne then belongs to Denmark, while large parts of Finland are Swedish.

17
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.880
The cities are quite small.
 We would probably perceive them as rural.

18
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.200
But Erik wants to compete and his kingdom with the royal houses in Europe.

19
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.040
There the kings have regent numbers, and Erik wants so too.

20
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.840
He turns to the history writing of his time.

21
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720
Erik has XIV as his regent number.

22
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.120
He has been inspired by this high number -

23
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.320
- Of Johannes Magnus's historical work about the kings in Svea and Göta Land.

24
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.520
With a high number Erik wants to show that his kingdom -

25
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.600
- Has a longer and more honorable story than it has.

26
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.720
Admittedly, several Swedish kings have been named Erik before Erik XIV -

27
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.760
- But not so many.

28
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.280
For the coronation, Erik XIV does not want his father's old royal crown.

29
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.760
He lets make a new, exclusive crown.

30
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.760
The crown was a so -called closed crown that went together in the middle.

31
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.080
An imperial crown, and something completely new in both Sweden and the Nordic countries.

32
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.560
For his coronation, Erik also allows a spiral.

33
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.480
An Apple.

34
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.360
And a national key.

35
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.080
The National Regalia has remained our national regalies right up to our time.

36
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.760
This was really a little ahead of the real superpower time.

37
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.200
It still shows Sweden as a new type of kingdom -

38
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.560
- As can compare themselves with other countries in Europe.

39
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.120
No one probably guesses that Sweden will be a great power in Europe.

40
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.200
But Erik XIV takes the first step in that direction.

41
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.240
During his first year as king, Erik sends troops to Reval-

42
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.640
- What today is Tallinn.

43
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.400
Reval then becomes Swedish.

44
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.800
It is an bloodless deal.
 Reval asks Sweden for help against Russia.

45
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.200
Erik accepts to become their protector.

46
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.560
It is the prelude to the expansion of the Great Power -

47
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.840
- Even if it was delayed before it started seriously.

48
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.240
Erik's time in power becomes difficult.

49
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.000
He has inherited the crown, but his brothers are not satisfied.

50
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.800
A power struggle between the Vasa sons Erik, Johan and Karl begin.

51
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.600
When Erik has been king for seven years–

52
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.920
- His brothers Johan and Karl make a coup.
 He is thrown into jail.

53
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.040
Eventually he dies in his captivity.

54
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.600
Johan takes over the throne after Erik, and calls himself Johan III.

55
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.640
He is married to Katarina Jagellonica, a Polish princess, now queen.

56
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.960
During Johan's time as King, he conquers Ingermanland.

57
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.360
It will make Sweden even bigger.

58
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.840
Another of Gustav Vasa's sons ensures that Sweden is growing inland.

59
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.520
Duke Karl has been given more or less free hands within his duke.

60
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.920
Karl exploits this, and builds up and makes the Duchy strong.

61
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.240
He builds a state in the state.

62
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.800
The duke reaches from Södermanland, to Närke, into Värmland.

63
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.160
Karl thinks that tax revenue is fundamental.

64
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.680
He wants to get more people into the Duchy.

65
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:07.000
He gets people from Finland, where there have been quite difficult times.

66
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.280
They get good agricultural land and opportunities in the duke.

67
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.240
They are called forest fins.
 They break land and populate forests in Sweden.

68
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.120
They are from Savolax in eastern Finland and are experts in burning.

69
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.560
The ash becomes nutritious and perfect to grow in.

70
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:06.840
The burning requires a lot of forest, so they populate large wilderness areas.

71
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.120
It can be said that Sweden is now growing within the country's borders.

72
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.800
From the 1570s, a period of movements and colonization-begins

73
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.320
- In the then Swedish Empire.

74
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.440
It is forest fins that move over to the Swedish side of the kingdom -

75
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.400
- To what came to be called Finnmarker and Finnish forests.

76
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.520
After cutting down the trees and burning up the rice -

77
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.640
- In the sister of the sweat, you are sparse in the hot ashes.

78
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.320
Several years have time to go before the harvest comes with the sweat mill.

79
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.440
But when it comes, it's a message.

80
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.960
Each grain you sow, can give a hundred new grains back.

81
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.240
The sweat also has a higher nutritional content than regular rye.

82
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.960
The porridge they eat is a forest Finnish porridge called motti.

83
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.640
It is a food tradition that has still lived today.

84
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.880
The forest finds come in waves, until the mid-17th century.

85
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.480
They populate large parts of the Swedish forests -

86
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.560
- And gives names to many places that still remain.

87
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:43.400
Karl is successful and a very powerful man in the late 16th century.

88
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:51.640
He is also a convinced Protestant and wants to remove all Catholic customs.

89
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.240
Someone who helps him with it is the new archbishop:

90
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:03.280
The very strict Ångermanlänningen Abraham Angermannus.

91
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:11.400
They both believe that the hard times of harvests that hit the wrong -

92
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.920
- Dreks on the sins of the people, and that the Swedes are not good Protestants.

93
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.120
So Angermannus is commissioned to investigate how the people take care of themselves.

94
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.880
Duke Karl gives Angermannus authority to visit people out in the parishes -

95
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.040
- So they become better Christian subjects of Protestant doctrine.

96
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.480
You want to get rid of the old Catholic customs, which still live in the villages.

97
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.160
The Archbishop is harsh, and issues severe punishment for sinners he meets.

98
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.240
Often it is about immorality.

99
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.560
The problem is how the people live.

100
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.040
It is a terrible immorality that they go to bed as unmarried.

101
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.720
It belongs to ancient Catholic tradition:

102
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.880
That you could go to bed as engaged.

103
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:18.640
The Protestants wanted to get rid of it.
 It was wrong, sinful, and teased God.

104
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.640
One of those convicted is the boy Lasse in Örtomta, Östergötland.

105
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.120
He has made three women pregnant and promised all three marriage.

106
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.800
Angermannus punishment becomes harsh.
 Lasse is convicted of hor.

107
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.600
The penalty will be 39 strokes with the rice.

108
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.120
Lasse in Herb Castle is just one example.
 Many are judged in this way.

109
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.600
Angermannus thus wanted to punish hard before God -

110
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.160
- The people who had then committed a crime against the law.

111
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.520
Lasse's punishment was probably awfully difficult to suffer.

112
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.240
There were no death penalties.
 It would be sarious, torment, send a signal.

113
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.600
They would not die.

114
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.440
After the punishment, Angermannus forces the sinner to get married.

115
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.280
The boy Lasse is sentenced to marry the first woman he made pregnant.

116
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.840
They are inserted into marriage.

117
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.880
That's what Angermannus wants - to safeguard marriage.

118
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.240
If they have committed these sins, it should be corrected.

119
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.600
But Angermannus must not last for so long.

120
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.880
His inspections arouse the anger of the people.

121
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.360
Duke Karl will have to stop him.

122
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.600
Over time, Karl becomes so powerful that he takes power over Sweden.

123
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:47.880
He takes the royal crown with force from his Catholic nephew Sigismund -

124
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.760
- He secures power with terror, and becomes King Karl IX.

125
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.200
He is king for seven years, before he dies and leaves behind the crown and three war -

126
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.360
- To his son Gustav II Adolf.

127
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.360
But Gustav Adolf is a teenager and needs help to control Sweden.

128
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.800
And he gets help - by Axel Oxenstierna.

129
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.600
Axel Oxenstierna is probably the official -

130
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.120
- As has the most power for the longest time in Sweden's history.

131
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.120
He sat as Chancellor for 42 years.

132
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.360
Until he resigns with death.

133
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.160
Many have called Axel Oxenstierna Sweden's foremost statesman.

134
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.680
He is formed, with a strong sense of organization.

135
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:56.480
He leads Sweden towards becoming a modern state.
 No easy task.

136
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:04.440
When Gustav II Adolf and Oxenstierna come to power, the money is over.

137
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.240
Government finances are abysmal and Sweden is at war.

138
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.000
A real Christian for the Swedes.

139
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:18.240
But the crises for something that changes the conditions for Sweden.

140
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.240
In order to pay debts to Denmark, new tax lengths are established.

141
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.640
It will be like nationwide census.

142
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.720
Everyone should be involved in paying.

143
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.480
When Gustav II Adolf and Oxenstierna now know how many people live in the country -

144
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.920
- It is easier to get an even and well -balanced tax flow.

145
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.560
And the money is of course used for the armies.

146
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.880
The young king and Axel Oxenstierna become a dynamic duo -

147
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.040
- As will make Sweden a military superpower.

148
00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.800
The armies are sent at war against Russia, weakened by internal political struggles.

149
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.280
And it's going well.
 The Swedes win the war.

150
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:12.240
In the peace agreement from 1617, the border Sweden - Russia is drawn further east.

151
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.800
Russia is excluded from the Baltic Sea.

152
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.800
It is Russia's temporary weakness that largely explains -

153
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:30.000
- Why Sweden could grow and become a great power around the Baltic Sea.

154
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:50.680
Although there are difficult times with war that cost a lot, everyday life goes on.

155
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.240
People dream about the future and they seek love.

156
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.120
The young people had their ways of meeting.

157
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:06.440
One custom that seems to have been practiced in the 17th century was the nightfall.

158
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.360
Night Freedom is a kind of dating, mainly in northern Sweden -

159
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.920
- There are young women and men to try to sleep next to each other.

160
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.560
There are guys of married age - 17, 18, 19 years.

161
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.280
They walk around the shock in the countryside and wake up girls of the same age.

162
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.880
The teenage daughters had their sleeping places in the outbuildings, in the ceiling, in the barns.

163
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.400
There they received the young guys.

164
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:51.160
The guys, they knocked on, and then maybe they sang a song -

165
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.280
- And noticed the woman that they wanted to split her bed during the night.

166
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.880
There are fixed frames around the nightfall.

167
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.600
The couple should be fully dressed and they must not touch each other.

168
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.920
We know that women got pregnant.
 One has fallen in love -

169
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.120
- And could not resist each other, and things have happened.

170
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:28.760
For the most part, the rules were kept.
 One reason why it survived.

171
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.160
After the nightfall, the young people can ask the parents if they are allowed to get married.

172
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.880
The parents were involved in this.

173
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:58.280
The young people in these areas can thus to some extent choose their own partner.

174
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.640
Sweden is deeply Christian at this time.
 Wedding is a big event.

175
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.920
Before the marriage, they belonged to the youth team as a maid or boy.

176
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.480
When you were admitted to marriage, you became a wife or master -

177
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.480
- And you got a completely different social position in the local community.

178
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:50.200
Marriage has previously often based on agreements between families.

179
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:55.200
Sex before marriage is pretty okay, only there is a promise that is fulfilled.

180
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.800
The church wants it away.

181
00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:03.480
Marriage should be a church matter, and sex must wait.

182
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.760
In order to emphasize the rules of not going to bed before marriage -

183
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:30.800
- Only fell the woman who was innocent at the wedding ceremony wearing the parish's bridal crown.

184
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.120
As a symbol of her honorability.

185
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.960
The bridal crowns could look different - beads, stones, gilded silver.

186
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.840
It was large and nice and expensive, and it was owned by the congregation.

187
00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:01.240
However, if a woman is not a virgin, she may not carry the bridal crown.

188
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:07.120
The message is clear: the people in Sweden should be guided by church and state -

189
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.080
- and not by lusts.

190
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:41.200
In Stockholm, Axel Oxenstierna builds a new order for Sweden.

191
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.120
During the first 10-15 years -

192
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.560
-Is Gustav Adolf for a long time out in war outside the country -

193
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.160
- While the Oxenstierna is mostly at home -

194
00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.280
–And is working on building up the management and the tax system -

195
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:07.000
- As is required for Sweden to be able to participate in the war -

196
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.120
–And send out 100,000 jacks -

197
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.880
–As a population of a little over a million people -

198
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.640
- During the 40 years that Oxenstierna is the Chancellor.

199
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.440
One of the things Axel Oxenstierna wants to get organized is the judiciary.

200
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:32.200
There was the problem that quite a lot was lawless country.

201
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.560
You did not really know which judgments and laws were applicable.

202
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.080
The national team was from the mid-1300s.

203
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.240
Several kings had tried to modernize it -

204
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.400
- But went into the wall with his attempts.

205
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.720
Then Oxenstierna does the beautiful -

206
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.240
- That instead he does the judicial system.

207
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:05.720
Instead of changing the laws, so he before Svea High Court -

208
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:11.320
- As can change judgments, and force the courts to redo trials.

209
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:17.160
In this way, you tighten up the judicial order.

210
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.840
Oxenstierna's reforms lay the foundation for today's courts -

211
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.440
- As now there is around the country.

212
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:38.240
Axel Oxenstierna is one of Sweden's most important statesmen of all time.

213
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:45.040
Before he dies, he lets this palace, near the castle in Stockholm.

214
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:53.000
He makes Stockholm a capital by changing the state administration.

215
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.280
In the past, everyone who worked for the king has followed him everywhere.

216
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.600
Oxenstierna decides that the administration stays in Stockholm -

217
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.360
- Wove where the king is.

218
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.960
Gustav II Adolf and Axel Oxenstierna wanted a Swedish capital -

219
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.120
- As could compete with other European countries.

220
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:23.360
Stockholm was made into a central city and was transformed into a modern metropolis.

221
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:35.880
But almost all Swedes live in the countryside in the early 17th century.

222
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.840
Sweden's population is now growing and is now approaching a million.

223
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.880
But even if many children are born, it is not risk -free.

224
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.960
/Tormented sound/

225
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:05.080
Births were one of the most risky elements in a woman's life.

226
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:12.040
For many women, childbirth also became the last thing they did.

227
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.800
/Child screams/

228
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.920
In general, no men were present in connection with births.

229
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:36.600
The women who assisted in the births, such as help women or earthmates -

230
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.920
- Had acquired their knowledge through practical experience.

231
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.320
Either that they had given birth to children -

232
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:48.080
- or that they had assisted in other births.

233
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.360
Fearing children not only meant a concern for the mother's life.

234
00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.720
Every fifth child at this time does not survive their first year.

235
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.920
Everywhere in Sweden, in the smallest parish there is a church.

236
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.360
The church plays a very important role in the lives of Swedes.

237
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.480
The church is central at this time and the priesthood has great power.

238
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.480
It is a duty to go to church on Sundays -

239
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.720
“But it is also true that most people want to go to church.

240
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:47.400
In the churches you not only meet God.
 There you also get to know everything important.

241
00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.920
In the church you can call for everything -

242
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.840
- From lost cows to deserted soldiers.

243
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.800
The priest does not just preach.

244
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.760
He will also keep a book on the parish's population.

245
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:15.680
And he has to help when choosing the men who can become soldiers.

246
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:21.400
To get soldiers to the wars, you start printing jacks.

247
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:29.200
The Riksdag makes the decisions - perhaps that every tenth man should become a soldier.

248
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.800
The priest ensures to establish lengths over who is available.

249
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:39.240
So you simply take every tenth man, and it is not voluntary.

250
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.080
Some may see the army as an alternative to a poor life -

251
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.760
- Or even as an honorable duty.

252
00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:56.560
But most people probably see it as a death sentence.

253
00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.560
At the beginning of the war, you choose the way you can save.

254
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:07.440
The poor, those who are not inherited or who are generally troublesome.

255
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.560
They would rather choose the one who had a small homemaker, than a big one.

256
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.320
They wanted to keep tax revenue as high as possible.

257
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:29.360
It was tried to make sure that the person who had only one son or boy was spared.

258
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.840
You would rather take families with many sons or boys.

259
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.880
But the longer the wars went on, and the more soldiers who died -

260
00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.720
- Desto was more difficult to keep on these principles.

261
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.840
Soon, they also printed house farmers, those who only had one boy or son.

262
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.840
More and more men disappeared to the war.

263
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.880
The view for those who were printed was very bad.

264
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.480
Many are brought out in the war, and very few return.

265
00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:02.680
About 85 % of those who were discharged in the war never returned home.

266
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.720
And people knew about that.

267
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.760
There are those who try to escape the printouts.

268
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.360
You could escape, but you could, too, if you had the opportunity -

269
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.320
- Get out a large amount of money to buy a replacement.

270
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.000
Others hurt themselves ...

271
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.800
... to avoid the printing.

272
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.920
But most people do not escape.

273
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.680
They are sent to the army or fleet.

274
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.800
Many end up on one of the nun's ships.

275
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.640
Although Sweden at this time is a corner in the north -

276
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.120
- Oxenstierna and Gustav II Adolf have completely different ambitions for the country.

277
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.200
Gustav II Adolf builds up a strong fleet.

278
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.160
One of the ships is a real boast - Vaasa.

279
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.720
The vase ship is a floating exhibition item -

280
00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.560
- For how Sweden wants to appear - powerful, warlike and dangerous.

281
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.440
At the top of Vasa's aft mirror, Gustav Adolf himself is depicted.

282
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.240
He holds out his arms, both holding them over and relying on -

283
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.160
- Elevated small figures that symbolize the Swedish people.

284
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.960
The message is clear:

285
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.960
Gustav Adolf is Sweden's rightful ruler, and has the people on his side.

286
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.280
Now it is empty on upper battery deck.

287
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.960
August 10, 1628 is full activity on board.

288
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.840
The crew has been brought to the day in honor with wives and children.

289
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.400
It is easy to imagine the excitement, enthusiasm, pride.

290
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.840
Around the ship, people are out in small boats to follow the maiden voyage.

291
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.400
But what they get to see is how throwing winds make the ship swing, more and more.

292
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.280
When water begins to rush in, the disaster is not held.

293
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:09.440
Vaasa drops after a journey of 1,300 m and about 30 people die.

294
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.200
The ship Vaasa then rests on the bottom for almost 333 years -

295
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:20.120
- Before it is rediscovered as an untouched treasure chest.

296
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.280
Vaasa is the world's best preserved 17th century ship.

297
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.800
It is a very lavish ship.

298
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.920
But it should be remembered that Vasa is not just built to fight.

299
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.200
The ship is an advertising player -

300
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:40.280
- This should show that Gustav Adolf is powerful, and that Sweden is rich.

301
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.440
But Vasa's sinking does not slow down the war plans.

302
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.600
New ships are being built, more soldiers are printed.

303
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:55.120
Just two years later, the king rises in Germany and interferes in the war.

304
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.240
Now Sweden will take a seat in the European arena.

305
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:08.280
Gustav II Adolf favored military solutions to political problems.

306
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:14.200
He meant that Sweden should be active, not let the enemy come in.

307
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:19.960
One should wage war in the field of enemy.

308
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.240
By this time, Sweden has become even greater.

309
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.200
Livland has been conquered from Poland-Liteuan.

310
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:33.280
For a few years, a coastal strip in Prussia will also be Swedish soil.

311
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.400
But now it is the 30-year war that applies, the great conflict of the 17th century.

312
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.160
Many European powers fought.

313
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:48.200
The conflict was about religion and politics, and was played on German soil.

314
00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.360
Before Gustav II Adolf leaves Sweden -

315
00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.280
- He farewell to his only child - Princess Kristina.

316
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.440
Like so many other children at this time, Kristina must never see her father.

317
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.920
Over 10,000 soldiers accompany Gustav II Adolf to Germany.

318
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.840
It is during the 17th century that Sweden becomes the land of the soldiers.

319
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.040
Before Sweden even entered the 30-year war, 50,000 soldiers have died-

320
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.200
- of a population of just under a million.

321
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.440
But most people do not die in battle.

322
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.240
Many of the newly printed end up in guard forces and garrisons.

323
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.920
There they encounter diseases, viruses, bacteria, which they have never met.

324
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.840
It is poor hygienic conditions and poor food.

325
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.120
It is more common to die in the war of diseases than to die in battle.

326
00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.480
But not just soldiers die.

327
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.440
So do kings.

328
00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:27.280
/Shooting and removing cries/

329
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:48.320
The Battle of Lützen in 1632 is perhaps Swedish history's most famous battle.

330
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.760
/Sounds of battles/

331
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.200
Gustav II Adolf was called "The Lion from the Nordic countries".

332
00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.680
German parents scared their children with stories about him.

333
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.920
But the Swedish king's path came to end here.

334
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.680
/A horse froze/

335
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:14.080
The battle has been going on for an hour when the Swedish attack stops.

336
00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.240
What is happening on the battlefield is that the Swedish side is pushed back.

337
00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.000
In the pressed situation, the king decides to do something drastic.

338
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.360
He goes to counter -attacks ...

339
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:39.480
... but becomes isolated with a minor strength.

340
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:47.040
So left, in the middle of the gunpowder and the fog, the king - is located

341
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.120
- In the tip of Småland's rider, without a backup.

342
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.440
And the enemy is everywhere.

343
00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.880
/A SHOT/

344
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:05.520
After two years of success in Germany, the victory train ends here.

345
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.880
On the battlefield at Lützen.

346
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.480
The lion from the Nordic countries is dead-

347
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:19.280
-And returns to Sweden from the 30-year war in a coffin.

348
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.040
Now Gustav II becomes Adolf's only child Kristina Queen in Sweden.

349
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.360
But she is only six years old, so Axel Oxenstierna takes the helm.

350
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.880
Sweden is governed by a guardianship with Axel Oxenstierna at the forefront.

351
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.680
He teaches both Kristina and cousin Karl Gustaf how to rule the country.

352
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.320
Something they will both benefit greatly in the future.

353
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.160
The wars do not end because the king is dead, on the contrary.

354
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:05.880
Sweden is at war almost the entire 17th century.
 It costs huge sums.

355
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.120
The Treasury is incredibly strained almost all the time.

356
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.320
You look for opportunities to find resources.

357
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.760
Oxenstierna is starting to control trade in northern Sweden.

358
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.840
Several new cities are founded to be able to withdraw more tariffs.

359
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.720
You do everything to utilize resources in the country.

360
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.240
In Falun there is an important source of income.

361
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:42.280
The copper mine in Falun was a very large source of income for the Treasury.

362
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.880
The income from copper production was the basis for -

363
00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:52.200
–That the Swedish Treasury could pay for the military apparatus -

364
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:57.680
- which was required for the conquests during the great power period.

365
00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.520
The copper mine is Sweden's largest workplace in the 17th century.

366
00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:08.680
During certain periods, 60 % of the world's copper production comes from Falun.

367
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.600
Swedish iron production is also important.

368
00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.960
Walloon immigrants from southern Belgium to work with Swedish iron.

369
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:26.520
They were not very many.
 About 400 families are expected.

370
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.840
The most famous Walloon is Louis De Geer.

371
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.080
He becomes the most successful industrial man of the Swedish great power.

372
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.720
He will play a role in Sweden's colonial history.

373
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:45.200
Now they want to increase Sweden's treasury by establishing colonies.

374
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.520
First, they try, without success, to create a colony in North America.

375
00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.720
Louis de Geer instead draws attention to Africa -

376
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:59.040
–And the trade in gold, sugar and slaves.

377
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:07.280
First you test with a pilot study, examines the potential in West Africa.

378
00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:15.000
It goes on to the Caribbean where you sell slaves with good advanced.

379
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.160
This leads to royal interest.

380
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.960
Queen Kristina approves that you form a Swedish Africa Company.

381
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.800
The Swedish Africa Company becomes an important economic player.

382
00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:47.040
Here, on the Gold Coast in Ghana, you open a Swedish trade colony.

383
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.400
From the beginning the fort was built -

384
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:55.440
- For trade in gold, textiles and ivory.

385
00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.080
But over time it began to be used to imprison slaves -

386
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:03.880
- Once they were shipped across the Atlantic.

387
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.200
In Sweden, slavery and slave trade have been banned for a long time.

388
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.040
But that does not apply here.

389
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.320
By extension, West Africa and all of Africa will be affected deeply -

390
00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:36.160
-of the trading networks that Europeans form during the 17th century.

391
00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:42.440
It breaks down local economics, and almost the entire social system of Africa.

392
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.880
How many slaves Swedish Africa Company deals with is uncertain.

393
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.080
It is usually said that these are about a thousand slaves.

394
00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.200
Outline those you have on their fort in West Africa.

395
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:59.280
Internationally, Sweden is a small player, but after all a player.

396
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.080
One of the greatest meanings that the Swedish Africa Company has -

397
00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.520
-Is to be involved in laying the foundation for the transatlantic slave trade -

398
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.920
-Which takes off properly during the 18th century.

399
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.160
The Swedes will not be long -lasting here.

400
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:23.040
After only 13 years, Sweden loses the colony in a war against Denmark.

401
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:36.960
This fort continues to be used for 150 years after the Swedes have left.

402
00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:43.440
It is being rebuilt on several rounds, but parts of it still remain today.

403
00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:51.200
When the transatlantic slave trade takes off and expands -

404
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.280
- This is deepened with the resources in the slave trade.

405
00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.440
One exits lots of abuse, starvation, diseases -

406
00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.960
- To be transported across the Atlantic.

407
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:09.560
A large proportion has passed away, many are labeled for life -

408
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.280
–And has entered a state of social death.

409
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.440
You are a property in someone else's ownership.

410
00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.600
Up to 200 men were held in here at a time.

411
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:42.760
It is difficult to convey in the picture how crowded it is with 200 people here.

412
00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.760
But that means 100 people in this part of the room.

413
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.240
It means 50 people here.

414
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.160
It means 25 people here.

415
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.760
This means that ten people need to fit on this surface.

416
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.360
Many who were imprisoned here already died before they had aboard the ships.

417
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.600
It was terrible scenes that took place.

418
00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.320
And Sweden was involved in the foundation for it all.

419
00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.200
That Sweden extends into the world to become economically stronger -

420
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.520
- There is no ordinary Swedes noticed.

421
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.240
On the contrary, life is hard.

422
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.120
Several years of misgrowth cause many to die.

423
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.680
At the same time as famine prevails in the country, Kristina will be crowned.

424
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:53.040
The throne she sits on when it happens is this - the silver throne.

425
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:59.840
The coronation took place in Stockholm, and not in Uppsala as traditionally.

426
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.640
Kristina wanted to be able to invite many foreign dignitaries -

427
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:13.320
- So they spread the word about this young queen who came to power.

428
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.200
When Kristina has become regent, the war ends -

429
00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.440
-Between Sweden and Denmark-Norway through the peace at Brömsebro.

430
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.560
Shortly thereafter, the 30-year war ends.

431
00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.720
This means that Sweden is getting bigger.

432
00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:39.120
Jämtland, Härjedalen, Gotland and Ösel are conquered from Denmark-Norway-

433
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.080
- And Halland becomes Swedish for some time.

434
00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.080
After the 30-year war, Sweden wins several land areas in Germany.

435
00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:57.240
But Sweden not only grows territorially during Kristina's time.

436
00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:03.480
She will mean a lot for the culture to grow and get more space.

437
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:10.000
The cultural expansion that started during Gustav II Adolf's time -

438
00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.400
- Intensified during Kristina's time.

439
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:21.200
With this she puts Sweden on the cultural map in Europe.

440
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.040
Kristina is a trained dancer.

441
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:35.360
She is happy to practice the court ballet of the time in pieces where she is the star.

442
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.440
The court ballets were virtually public documents.

443
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:47.200
At one point Kristina dances in the role of Diana-

444
00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.320
- The goddess of fun in Roman mythology.

445
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.240
This is to represent their decision not to marry.

446
00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:00.200
Today, it is common to have a press conference.

447
00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:06.240
But at that time Kristina chooses to dance her decision.

448
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:18.880
The National Council had complained to Queen Kristina that she should marry.

449
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.320
But she didn't want to.

450
00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:28.640
Instead, she manages to maneuver so that her cousin Karl Gustav -

451
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.000
–Seses to the throne followers.

452
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.000
One of those dancing with Kristina is Karl Gustav.

453
00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:44.120
He becomes the king of Sweden when Kristina suddenly announces -

454
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:50.520
- That she abdicates and resigns the crown, just four years after the coronation.

455
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.720
Kristina abdicates is a great scandal.

456
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:25.240
At this time you see royalty as raised, chosen by God.

457
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:29.720
So she goes against the fate that God has set out for her.

458
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:37.000
Even worse is that she, the daughter of the Protestants' great ruler - -

459
00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:42.720
- Evices to convert to Catholicism - the death enemy.

460
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.920
Kristina shocks the Swedes.
 Many people experience it as a betrayal.

461
00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:57.240
Axel Oxenstierna helps Kristina, but does not come to the ceremony.

462
00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:02.200
A short time later, he dies, 71 years old.

463
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:11.720
Now it is cousin Karl Gustav's turn to sit on the Swedish throne.

464
00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.720
With him begins a new period of war.

465
00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:21.880
War that draws on Sweden's map in a way that partly applies today.

466
00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:31.640
Directly when Karl X Gustav comes to power, he begins to plan war.

467
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:36.640
Oxenstierna had tried to pursue a moderate foreign policy -

468
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:42.520
- Where Sweden would be just great, without provoking the major powers.

469
00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:49.640
When he dies, Karl X Gustav strikes a bolder foreign policy -

470
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:55.200
- There he is not content with the Polish coast against the Baltic Sea -

471
00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.280
- The way goes in and tries to conquer the whole of Poland.

472
00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:05.600
But in the midst of ongoing war, Denmark explains war against Sweden.

473
00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.160
Karl X Gustav decides for a drastic maneuver -

474
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:16.520
- That goes to history and changes the future of Denmark and Sweden.

475
00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.640
He attacks Denmark from the south.

476
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:26.360
During the winter of 1658 he marches with his army into the country.

477
00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:34.440
But in order to succeed, the army must cross the frozen Danish sound.

478
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:40.280
The trains over big and little belt were extremely risky companies.

479
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.480
If the ice were to hold, it would be a huge success.

480
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:49.560
But if it were to burst, then the Swedes would be bad.

481
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:58.000
Not even during the cold 17th century could you certainly march over.

482
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.320
It may have happened every tenth or fifteen years.

483
00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.760
In the morning, Saturday, January 30, 1658–

484
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.480
- Rider Karl X Gustav out with his army over the ice.

485
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:16.240
The risky tactics succeed.

486
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.880
The Swedish army marches into Zealand.

487
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:24.000
As it approaches Copenhagen, the Danish king gives up -

488
00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.200
- And closes peace in Roskilde.

489
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.200
Sweden has won.

490
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:37.680
Sweden gets Skåne, Blekinge, Halland, Bohuslän, Trondheim and Bornholm.

491
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:43.960
And you have defeated Denmark.
 Denmark now does not have the upper hand in the Baltic Sea.

492
00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.800
Denmark has lost one third of its territory -

493
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.960
- And very fertile agricultural land.

494
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:56.880
So it is a disaster for Denmark, and success for Swedish.

495
00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:05.480
After the peace in Roskilde, Sweden has territories around the entire Baltic Sea.

496
00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:11.800
The little kingdom that Erik XIV took over in 1560-

497
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:15.120
- Has become a European great power.

498
00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:21.240
The expansion has taken place both within the country's borders and through conquests.

499
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.880
It went because they managed to create an effective state apparatus -

500
00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:30.680
- As can utilize the country's resources for the needs of the armed forces.

501
00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:36.360
But the political situation in Europe also comes into play.

502
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.280
That Sweden became a great power -

503
00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:45.400
—Berded that the other major countries were so weakened -

504
00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:51.400
- So there was a vacuum that Sweden could go into and fill in.

505
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.280
But it will change.

506
00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:02.040
The neighbors will be strong again and more wars are coming.

507
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.280
War that needs new soldiers.

508
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.840
Before Sweden's time as a great power is the end -

509
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.520
—The the country goes through some of the worst times the Swedes have been with –-

510
00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.680
- With witch hunts, starvation and plague.

511
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.280
And even more wars, which never seem to end.

512
00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:18.280
It will get worse before it gets better.

513
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.360
