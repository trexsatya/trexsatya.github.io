1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,040
Corona ...

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,920
... is not just illness.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,760
It is power play and big politics.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,400
Countries and holders who want to win at the expense of others.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,920
Åsa Larsson and Jack Werner started the "Viral Reviewer".

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,200
They run the source criticism - Sweden's national team in source criticism.

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,720
Now they and Edwin Safari do "Källkoll Corona".

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49.880
Russia and China, for example.

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,360
Serbian President kissed China's flag when Chinese doctors flew in.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05.600
And Russia sent the auxiliary package to Italy with "From Russia with Love".

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,360
There is more behind the sudden kindness.

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,880
With Trump as president of the United States, relations with the EU have deteriorated-

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,320
-So to the extent that Angela Merkel and Trump didn't even shook hands.

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,200
Can you shake hands?

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,960
Mr. President? Can you shake hands?

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,840
China has seen an opening when things are going badly between the US and the EU.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,200
And Russia has a rather crunchy relationship with the EU.

18
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,760
So it may seem like Russia and China beating on big-

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
- But it may not.

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,320
The magazine La Stampa received the information-

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57.960
-If 80 % of Russia's aid broadcast was meaningless.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02.240
All help from Russia or China is not meaningless.

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09.360
And that does not mean that the US and the EU do not do things just "for show".

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,160
But it shows that what the countries do have to do with politics.

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,120
For example, when I do this.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,560
But no!

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,360
Speaking of your extreme self-goodness, Jack-

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,520
-The I have seen some debate about Sweden's strategy.

29
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,920
So the rest of the world thinks we are crazy.

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,600
We can look at it, so I'll explain.

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,720
The politicians found in all countries-

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,720
-Want to prove to be actionable to their voters.

33
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,200
They want to be able to show what they did so that voters vote for them.

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,080
But Sweden has different things that come into play. Sweden has...

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,320
... perhaps the most fragile minority government.

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,240
In several countries, such as England, the political leaders have ...

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,760
They govern the majority of Parliament. They can run over the opponents.

38
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,480
They cannot do the Swedish government.

39
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,720
Then it is that Sweden has independent offices.

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,760
-Agencies. -Just.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,000
The intention is that the government should not in and poke in what they do.

42
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,760
This is not the case in all other countries.

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,720
Each section contains educational material at Urplay.se.

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,480
Search "Källkoll Corona" and select "Pedagogical Material".

45
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,240
Click on the worksheet.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,120
So here's a little neighbor.

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09.040
The government has various advisers who are directors general for authorities.

48
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,280
They give advice and recommendations and then the government should weigh everything together.

49
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,080
Then it can be a bit like this.

50
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,720
We say that the medicine here says:

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,680
"Lock them in each cave until September."

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,960
-Typically medical. -Sen maybe the economist says:

53
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,640
"No, then there will be financial crash."

54
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,480
Then the government must decide what to do.

55
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,760
They have listened to their advisors quite a lot.

56
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,240
They must stand for it before Parliament. They respond to the elected officials.

57
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,440
Now the government has listened particularly much to the Public Health Authority-

58
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,720
-As is responsible for this particular area.

59
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,520
They have been given quite a lot of responsibility.

60
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,560
They are not only responsible for infection protection, that there will be less infection-

61
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16.560
-Or also for us to feel better in the long term.

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,520
That we should feel better mentally, that children should not be deprived of their school-

63
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,840
-That women should not end up quarantine with violent men.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,720
We will feel good in ten years and not just when the Coronapandemia is over.

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,280
Sweden does both as other countries and definitely not as other countries.

66
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,320
It can open up that other countries may think of things about Sweden.

67
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,600
It may be more about the fact that they want to appear less crazy.

68
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,760
As Trump did when he said Sweden suffers severely in the Corona crisis.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
Sweden suffers very difficult.

70
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,520
Sweden makes this "flock".

71
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,480
Sweden's Foreign Minister opposed.

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,280
I'm not going to review Trump, but he has a factual error.

73
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,360
We do not have a strategy that is based on flock immunity.

74
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,480
State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell did not agree.

75
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,600
After all, all countries suffer during this.

76
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,680
Trump has a history of drastic statements about Sweden.

77
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,400
“Last Night in Sweden”

78
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,160
But it became a photo exhibition of it.

79
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,000
Sweden is often picked up as an example in other countries' debate.

80
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
They think we are extreme. It can be immigration.

81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,160
They can see us as a socialist and feminist paradise-

82
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,120
-And show pictures of latte dads. Some like it, others don't.

83
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,120
There are many fathers walking around with strollers.

84
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,200
What they are not interested in is the nuanced image of Sweden.

85
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,480
And speaking of shades, I just want to say that when Trump made the statement-

86
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:36,640
-I have I for myself that Sweden had Sweden 750 cases per million

87
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,200
-While the United States had 1,200 cases, something like that.

88
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,160
But now you do just that. Goes in and defends Sweden against the United States.

89
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52.640
It is not possible to know who has the worst, because everyone has it piss.

90
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,840
The situation develops and the figures are unreliable.

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00.640
No one can test their entire population-

92
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07.760
-And you have to test at the right time. It's just opinions.

93
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,240
It is very easy to go into this spin and think we and them.

94
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,360
It is so easy to become indent-

95
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,680
-And stand and think it's like a international match.

96
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,600
That's what politics does sometimes. Distract from the important.

97
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:34,640
Distracts is exactly what your conversation has done from what I should do.

98
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,520
Let's see. Yes!

99
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,400
Girl, whatever!

100
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,640
