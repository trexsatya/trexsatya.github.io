00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You, I say like this: Cheers the brother! -

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,192
Cheers, brother!

3
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:05.451
Bowl! - Good morning!

4
00:00:06,408 --> 00:00:07.773
Good morning!

5
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:10,826
Here's how: Liseberg turns 100 ...

6
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:14,136
... and they celebrate it by running a club carousel.

7
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:15,350
We are here at the premiere.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,873
Today plays Nause, some attractions are open-

9
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:20,447
-It's bars, it's music, it's age limit.

10
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:22.301
We must say this, it's big!

11
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:27,200
For the first time ever, Liseberg opens a nightclub in the area.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,846
You did it powerfully there.

13
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:29.951
We are first in place!

14
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:31,606
Yes! - You can fuck that.

15
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:33,390
I have my reporter on site!

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,514
Dududududu! - I'm a bit drunk...

17
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:42,957
We should not stick under the chair with taking any unit before or so ...

18
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:44,024
Well but we did.

19
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,912
We have our two friends with us too, the corne and Bissen.

20
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:50,975
They are here as a backup, bodyguard and backpack carrier for Niklas.

21
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,955
We will test Liseberg by nighttime. - Yes!

22
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:56.297
What happens at Liseberg at night? - What happens?

23
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:57.981
It's DJ's. - Is it DJ's?

24
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,374
It's bars. - Is it bars?

25
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:01.002
These are attractions. - Are these attractions?

26
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:02.987
It's oily lighting. - Is it good lighting?

27
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:06,377
These are good dancers. - Is it good looking ... dancers?

28
00:01:06,377 --> 00:01:08.314
And we're here. - We are here!

29
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:10,617
We'll test everything. Liseberg by night!

30
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:13,428
Bowl. Here we go!

31
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:22,502
We went in there.

32
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:28,220
And getting in here at night is almost a bit like Halloween at Liseberg though more alcohol.

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,650
And do you know what the fun is? Basketball and stuff is open!

34
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,331
Please, can't we drive one before? I promise I put it!
