1
00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:03,362
- She seems to like it!
 - Yes indeed!

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,340
There are monsters.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,299
You may say if it is scary.

4
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:14,417
Alma, I love you.

5
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,098
Hello Hello!

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,851
We are at Gröna Lund!

7
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:36,849
- We are entirely ourselves inside the amusement park.
 - All themselves.

8
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:41,155
It's so cool.
 It's so quiet, it's so quiet.

9
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:45,495
- (Alma) It's so ... oooh ... - It's a little mysterious almost.

10
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,042
It feels a bit jerky.
 All Jalusians are pulled out ...

11
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:52,620
(Alma) Oh, that little ... the thing.

12
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,045
It's completely empty, and it's just ... It's a little scary.

13
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:03,531
- No, it's pretty good!
 - Yes.
 This is going to be super fun.

14
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:09,270
The park will open, and then we will stay and go stuff.

15
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:19,303
So Gröna Lund let us in before opening, so we can experience the park "All Alone".

16
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:23,184
- Do you remember this?
 - (Alma) I do.

17
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:29,023
- It's like a ninjat temple.
 - (Alma) No.
 It's the ship.

18
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,860
- Oh, just that.
 - The ghost house.

19
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:40,805
- The first time Laura is on Grönan.
 She seems to like it!
 - (Axel) Yes, really!

20
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,505
(Axel) But corner, we are not completely alone.

21
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,639
- Hello Hello!
 - Hello Hello!

22
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:51,011
We are not completely alone - he is here.
 But just him.

23
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:55,828
He came from the ship ... He may be a ghost.

24
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,268
(Alma) oooh ...

25
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:01,777
Hose bells!
 Sh*t!

26
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:10,798
I have never traveled this huge roller coaster.

27
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,166
Jetline.

28
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:17,671
Alma, you have to go everything now, because you are over 140 cm.

29
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:22,124
Yes!
 I'm going to go this one!
 You-you-you!

30
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:26,858
Here they play music.

31
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:30,526
- Do you get a feeling?
 - Yes.

32
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:47,541
- Do you dance with the carriage?
 - Yes.
 I try to.

33
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:53,103
May I be allowed, Pipita?
 She dances with the pacifier.

34
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:57,848
Yes, she thought the pacifier was more fun.

35
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:13,685
- Here you will get, Björn.
 Pew, Pew, Pew!
 - (a siren -like sound is heard)

36
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:17,698
- What is the sound?
 - I do not know.

37
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:23,464
Was it ... some kind of monster that I have to shoot?

38
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,895
Where!

39
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:34,515
There are monsters.
 News of the year.

40
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:38,686
It is also the ride we will go first today.

41
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,021
Mom, it comes!

42
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:46,360
Actually type now, because they are starting to let in guests now, and ...

43
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:51,298
It will be you, me and Axel, behind the camera, who go.

44
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,334
Harry!
 He's over there.
 Come.

45
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:57,938
- You must not go monster.
 - No.

46
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:02,335
- Can you take care of Laurita-Pipita?
 - Okay.

47
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:10,256
We walk in the back road.

48
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:18,358
Oh, here is a lift.
 How nice.
 How secret it feels.

49
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:23,197
- (Alma) Yes.
 - (Harry) as the worst action ...

50
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,834
- (Axel) Oh, I think I take the stairs.
 - Well, what?

51
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:31,839
It's so crowded.
 Can I fit?
 Okay, nice.

52
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,676
- Are you nervous, Alma?
 - Little, yes.

53
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:38,846
I feel I know too little about monsters.

54
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,149
I just know that it goes down into the underworld, and up, and like ...

55
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,853
Well, I thought you meant you know too little about real monsters.

56
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:49,356
No ... yes, maybe I do.

57
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:55,863
- I was very surprised that it was so quiet.
 - Yes.

58
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:06,309
(Joanna) Oh, wow!
 Check...

59
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:14,112
(Harry) Oh, oh, oh ...

60
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:15,849
- Hello!
 - Hello, welcome here!

61
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:20,315
- (Axel) Thanks!
 - (Joanna) What a nice entrance!

62
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:27,497
You may say if it is scary, and if I would dare next year.

63
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:31,254
- We promise.
 - mm, promise.

64
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,805
Here we go!

65
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:43,176
- It feels scary to start with the worst.
 - (Joanna) but then you have done it then.

66
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:48,949
- Yes, then I don't have to do it again.
 - Then everything else will feel like a children's game.

67
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:53,757
- Yes.
 Although I am a child, so ... - that's true.

68
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,981
- No, no, no ... now I don't want this.
 - Yes.

69
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:02,529
- I repent.
 - It will go well, Alma.

70
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:06,867
- Oh, now the floor disappears.
 - Oh!
 The floor ...

71
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:11,505
- Oh, what have we done?
 What have we done?
 - Stop!

72
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:15,008
Why are we doing this?

73
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:26,787
- (Axel) Why are we doing this, Alma?
 - I do not know!

74
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,442
- Alma, remember to smile at the camera!
 - Hello!

75
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,034
(Everyone screams)

76
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:48,521
(Alma) Help !!!

77
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:58,085
(Axel) oh my good!

78
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:05,170
This one was great fun after all!

79
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:08,195
Oh my God!

80
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:13,326
- I'm completely unheated.
 - It was so good!

81
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,842
My mouth ...

82
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:21,174
I'm in shock!

83
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:25,712
- So, that one was a little too much for my taste.
 - It was so good!

84
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:28,081
- Yes!
 - They love it.

85
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,618
I love it!
 "I Love You, Monster!"

86
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:35,722
- Do you think Harry dares to go it next year?
 - Yes!
 Obviously I dare it!

87
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,430
I actually think so, because it is very lovely.
 But I don't think he will be 140 next year.

88
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,363
- I am convinced.
 - But he is type 130 now.

89
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,356
Yes.
 1 cm a month.
 It is quiet.

90
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:52,139
Everything for monsters!
 But really - recommended!
 I thought it was very wonderful!

91
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:56,506
Yes, it was fun.
 A little too much for my taste only.

92
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,012
- You feel a little bad.
 - Yes, a little bad.

93
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:04,319
Now the green is open.
 Now Harry will be able to decide what to do next.

94
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,854
  We will go the funny house, the funny house!

95
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:14,194
Okay.
 It will be difficult to bring the trolley.
 I stay out here with Laura, you have to go yourself.

96
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:16,311
- Okay!
 - Here we go!

97
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:14,017
  In Believe in Can Fly, in Believe in Can Touch the Sky!

98
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,716
You won!

99
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,631
Nice work!

100
00:09:46,393 --> 00:09:48,938
Looks like the worst bazook!

101
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,217
My hair after all the rides ...

102
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:14,147
- Shall I help you?
 - No, I'll look like this.
 Everyone knows that I have traveled carousels.

103
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,149
Now we fill up a bit.

104
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:21,135
Laura with milk, the kids with Harry's big win!

105
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:23,623
Hello, show it.
 How cool?!

106
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,158
Huge thing.

107
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:29,696
So, this is the first time someone in our family has wins one there.

108
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:33,500
- It's been my dream since I was little.
 - Mine as well.

109
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:37,225
Harry, you have fulfilled my and dad's dream.
 Good work!

110
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:42,008
- What has been the most fun to go, then?
 - Monster.

111
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,611
- The broom.
 - Monster.

112
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:47,474
The monster master.

113
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:53,019
I like that wild mouse.
 You just fly around, it's so hard in the suspension.

114
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,290
It's such an old classic.
 You sit in a trolley that is on top of the track.

115
00:10:57,462 --> 00:11:00,860
It feels a bit scary, like you should roll off.

116
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,393
Oh, now it's over, Laura.

117
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,032
Yes, now it's over.
 Now it's over.

118
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,256
Now it ended.

119
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:13,192
(Harry) She just: "What do you say?!"

120
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:18,178
I usually say it every time she drank up for her to understand.

121
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:25,200
Now we will go and go the love tunnel, and then maybe Laura can also join!

122
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,689
Oh, oh ... Oh, what exciting, Laura!

123
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,859
Oh ... check, huh.

124
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:35,862
Oh, you hardly see you.
 So there!

125
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,601
Where do we go somewhere?

126
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,163
Have you seen, Laura?

127
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:01,521
How does it feel, Laura?

128
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:06,417
Was it exciting?
 Was it fun?

129
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:35,376
- Was it good?
 - Yes.

130
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:47,700
- Laura fell asleep when we cooked dinner.
 - Yes.
 She was completely exhausted by the love tunnel.

131
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:52,203
- But did she like it?
 - Yes indeed.
 I think so.

132
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:59,602
And I think she fell very in love with me.
 In any case, I fell very in love with her.

133
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:04,495
Harry, is it fortunate that we are not here at Halloween?
 With Laura.

134
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,990
Then Pipita would be scared.

135
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:09,337
- Do you think so?
 - Yes.

136
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:12,276
I really think that too.

137
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:17,367
I think it is great that we are here when the weather is more beautiful, and a little nicer.

138
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:18,745
Yes.

139
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:26,005
When we went in the Lustiga house, Harry was very scared that murderer clowns come.

140
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:30,343
It is only on Halloween that there are killer clowns in the uneasy house.

141
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,254
That is fortunate.

142
00:13:38,892 --> 00:13:43,856
Harry, you are at Gröna Lund and can ride lots of carousels ...

143
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,000
But that was still quite fun.

144
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:53,366
- I want to test free fall.
 - Are you sure about that?

145
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:57,337
- Absolutely safe.
 - Then I think we go!
 Ding, ding!

146
00:13:57,557 --> 00:14:03,009
- Are you going to take the tilt?
 - Tilt?
 Oh!
 I have never driven it.

147
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:08,348
So ... yeah!
 Should I do that first ...?

148
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:13,286
- Do you know what "tilt" means?
 - Yes, that you go up and then turn down.

149
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,521
Oh, what scary!
 Do I dare?

150
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:23,496
I won't go.
 And you're too short, Harry.
 Did you want to go?

151
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,366
- Yes of course!
 - Are you kidding?!

152
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,001
No.

153
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:33,473
Oh, now someone wakes up here.
 What did you take for a little powernap?

154
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:37,009
Hello.
 Hello!

155
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,559
Yes, but you run two, then.
 We wait down here.

156
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,582
(An employee) ... at 100 km/h.

157
00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:52,091
- Oooh ... 100 km/h ... - Was it a joke?

158
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:56,195
... on the way down, then.
 It goes up slowly and is quite kind.

159
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:59,132
Where ... was it a joke?

160
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,852
The worst thing is that it will feel like we are about to hit that house.

161
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,505
We just passed a small house.

162
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,742
- But check how beautiful it is.
 - It's very nice.

163
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,422
Now they go up.

164
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:16,702
(Joanna) It's so high.

165
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,285
Can I get off?

166
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:26,292
Oh, J*clear.
 Oh, how loud.
 How high up we are going.
 So high I don't remember ...

167
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,035
No, but five!
 No, but fuck how loud it got!

168
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,299
No, I wasn't prepared for this.
 Alma, what have we done?

169
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:39,172
Alma, this wasn't fun at all!
 Alma!
 Why did we do this?!

170
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,583
- I do not know!
 - Alma, I love you.

171
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,984
(CRY)

172
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:42,001
So ... Free fall was so scary.
 So, I still tremble.
 I'm shaking.

173
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,003
Was it worse than monsters?

174
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,740
Yes, it was actually worse than monsters.
 Monster was fun, in a way.

175
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:50,376
Free fall was not fun.
 It was just scary.

176
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,513
- It's just death contempt.
 - Adrenaline rush 2000.

177
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,750
Yes.
 But it's funny.
 I like it.

178
00:16:57,937 --> 00:17:00,786
What a thing ... Green Lund on weekdays.

179
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,790
There was no more than 10 minutes queue on a single ride.

180
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,853
No.

181
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:09,054
A hot tip.
 They are open for a while.

182
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,533
Thanks for watching this video!

183
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,505
- Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.
 - Most thumbs up!

184
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,842
Comment, ask questions and have a great time until we see you next time.

185
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:26,315
- See you!
 - Bye!
