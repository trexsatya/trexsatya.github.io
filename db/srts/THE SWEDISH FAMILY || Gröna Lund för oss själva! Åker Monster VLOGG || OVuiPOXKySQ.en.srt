1
00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:03,362
- She seems to like it!
- Yes!

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,340
That's Monster.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,299
Tell me if it's scary.

4
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:14,417
Alma, I love you.

5
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,098
Hey, hey!

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,851
We are at Gröna Lund!

7
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:36,849
- We are all alone in the amusement park.
- All alone.

8
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:41,155
It's so cool.
It's so quiet, it's so calm.

9
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:45,495
- It's so...
- It's almost a bit mysterious.

10
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,042
It feels a little scary.
All the shutters are closed...

11
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:52,620
Oh, that little... thing.

12
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,045
It's completely empty,
and it's a little scary.

13
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:03,531
- No, it's super cool!
- Yes. This will be super fun.

14
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:09,270
The park will open in a bit,
and we will still be here and ride stuff.

15
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:19,303
Gröna Lund let us in before it opened,
so that we get to experience the park all alone.

16
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:23,184
- Remember this one?
- I do.

17
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:29,023
- It's like a ninja temple.
- No. It's The Ship.

18
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,860
- Oh, right.
- The haunted house.

19
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:40,805
- It's Laura's first time at "Grönan". She seems to like it!
- She really does!

20
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,505
You guys, we're not completely alone.

21
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,639
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

22
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:51,011
We're not completely alone - he is here.
But only he.

23
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:56,782
He came from The Ship...
maybe he's a ghost.

24
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:01,527
Slingshots!

25
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:10,798
I've never ridden
this huge roller-coaster.

26
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,166
Jetline.

27
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:17,777
Alma, you can go on all the rides
now that you're over 140 cm. (4 ft. 7 in.)

28
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:22,124
Yes! I'm going to ride this one!

29
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:26,858
Here they're playing music.

30
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:30,526
- Do you get feeling?
- Yes.

31
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:47,541
- Are you dancing with the stroller?
- Yes. I'm trying.

32
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:53,103
Shall we dance, Pipita?
She's dancing with her pacifier.

33
00:02:53,398 --> 00:02:57,848
She thinks that
the pacifier is more fun.

34
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:11,823
Here's what you get, bear.

35
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:17,993
- What's that sound?
- I don't know.

36
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:23,464
Was it... some kind of monster
that I have to shoot?

37
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,895
There!

38
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:34,515
This is Monster,
the new ride of 2021.

39
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:38,686
It's also our first ride of the day.

40
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,021
Mommy, it's coming!

41
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:46,360
Now, actually.
They're letting guests in now, and...

42
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:51,298
You, me, and Axel, behind the camera,
are going to ride it.

43
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,334
Harry! Come.

44
00:03:54,565 --> 00:04:00,340
You're not allowed to ride Monster.
Can you take care of Laurita-Pipita?

45
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,402
Okay.

46
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:11,551
We enter through the exit.

47
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:18,358
Oh, there's an elevator here. Good.
It feels so secretive.

48
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:23,197
Yeah. Like an action...

49
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,834
- Oh, I think I'll take the stairs.
- Why?

50
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:31,839
It's so cramped. Is there room?
Okay, nice.

51
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,676
- Are you nervous, Alma?
- A little.

52
00:04:35,844 --> 00:04:42,149
I feel that I know too little about Monster.
All I know is that it goes underground, and up, and...

53
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:49,086
- Oh, I thought you meant real monsters.
- No... Well, maybe that too.

54
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:55,344
- I was very surprised that it was so quiet.
- Yes.

55
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:06,309
Oh, wow! Look...

56
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:14,112
Oohweee...

57
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:15,849
- Hey!
- Welcome!

58
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:20,020
- Thank you!
- What a nice entrance!

59
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:27,497
You have to tell me if it's scary,
and if I would dare to ride it next year.

60
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:32,162
- We promise.
- Mm, promise.

61
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,805
Let's go!

62
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:43,176
- It feels scary to start with the worst one.
- But then you've done it.

63
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:48,949
- Yes, then I don't have to do it again.
- Everything else will feel like child's play.

64
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:53,757
- Yes. I am a child, though, so...
- That's true.

65
00:05:55,735 --> 00:06:00,914
No, no, no... Now I don't want this.
I regret my decision.

66
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:02,529
It'll be fine, Alma.

67
00:06:02,757 --> 00:06:06,583
- The floor is disappearing.
- Oh, the floor...

68
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:11,195
- Oh, what have we done?
- Stop it!

69
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,858
Why are we doing this?

70
00:06:22,764 --> 00:06:26,787
- Why are we doing this, Alma?
- I don't know!

71
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,442
Alma, remember to
smile at the camera!

72
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:48,521
HELP!!!

73
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:05,170
That was so fun!

74
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:13,326
- I'm not warmed-up at all.
- It was so good!

75
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:16,842
My mouth...

76
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:21,293
I'm in shock!

77
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:25,897
- That one was a bit too much for my taste.
- It was so good!

78
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:28,081
- Yes!
- They love it.

79
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,618
I love it! 
"I love you, Monster!"

80
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:35,722
- Do you think Harry will dare to ride it next year?
- Yes! Of course I will!

81
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,430
I actually think so, it's a really nice ride.
However, I don't think you'll be 140 cm. next year.
(4 ft. 7 in.)

82
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,363
- I'm convinced he will be.
- He's about 130 cm. now. (4 ft. 3 in.)

83
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,602
- 1 cm. per month. No problem.
- Everything for Monster!

84
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:56,506
- I recommend it. It was so nice!
- Yes, it was fun. Just a bit too much for my taste.

85
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,012
- You're a little nauseous.
- A little.

86
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:04,319
Now the park is open for guests.
Harry will get to decide what we'll do next.

87
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,854
To the Fun House, we go!

88
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:14,194
Okay. That'd be difficult with the stroller,
so I'll stay out here with Laura. You guys go alone.

89
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:16,311
- Okay!
- Let's go!

90
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:14,017
♪ I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky ♪

91
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,716
You won!

92
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,631
Nice job!

93
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:48,938
It looks like a bazooka!

94
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,512
My hair after all the rides...

95
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:14,147
- Shall I help you?
- No, I'll have to look like this. They know I've been on rides.

96
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,149
We are having a snack.

97
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:21,135
Laura is drinking some milk,
and the kids are eating Harry's big win!

98
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:23,623
Show it off. How cool?!

99
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,158
A huge deal.

100
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:29,696
This is the first time
one in our family wins one of those.

101
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:33,500
- It's been my dream since I was a child.
- Mine too.

102
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:37,225
Harry, you've fulfilled
my and daddy's dream. Good job!

103
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:42,008
- Which ride was the most fun?
- Monster.

104
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,611
- The Broomstick.
- Monster.

105
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:47,474
The Monster Broomstick.

106
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:53,019
I like the Wild Mouse.
You just fly around, it's so jerky.

107
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,290
It's a classic ride
where you sit in a cart on top of the rails.

108
00:10:57,462 --> 00:11:01,027
I think it's scary.
It feels like you're going to fall off.

109
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,393
It's finished, Laura.

110
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,032
Now it's empty.

111
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,256
All done.

112
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:13,192
She's like:
"What are you saying?"

113
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:18,344
I say that every time she's finished the bottle,
so that she understands.

114
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:25,018
Now we will ride the Tunnel of Love.
Laura might also get to ride it!

115
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,689
Oh, oh...
Oh, how exciting, Laura!

116
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:35,862
Wow... look.
Oops, they can barely see you.

117
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:41,601
Where are we going?

118
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,163
Look, Laura.

119
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:01,521
How does it feel, Laura?

120
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:06,553
Was it exciting?
Was it fun?

121
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:35,376
- Was it good?
- Yes.

122
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:47,700
- Laura fell asleep when we ate dinner.
- She got exhausted from the Tunnel of Love.

123
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:52,203
- Did she like it?
- Yes, indeed. I think so.

124
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:59,602
I think she fell very much in love with me.
I fell very much in love with her, at least.

125
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:04,495
Harry. Good thing we're not here
on Halloween, right? With Laura.

126
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,990
Pipita would be scared.

127
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:09,337
- You think so?
- Yes.

128
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:12,276
I definitely think so too.

129
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:17,367
It's so nice that we are here
when the weather is nicer, and it's a bit kinder.

130
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:18,745
Yes.

131
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:26,005
When we were in the Fun House, Harry was so scared
that there would be killer clowns in there.

132
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:30,724
No, that's only on Halloween.

133
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:43,927
Harry, you're at an amusement park
and can go on a bunch of rides...

134
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,000
That was pretty fun, though.

135
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:53,366
- I want to try the Giant Drop.
- Are you sure?

136
00:13:53,555 --> 00:13:57,337
- Absolutely sure.
- Let's do it!

137
00:13:57,557 --> 00:14:03,009
- Will you go on Tilt?
- Tilt? Oh! I've never done that one.

138
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:08,348
I mean...
Do I ride that one before...?

139
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:13,286
- Do you know what "tilt" means?
- You go up, and then it tilts you forward.

140
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,521
Scary! Do I dare?

141
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:23,496
I will not ride it, and you're too short, Harry.
Would you have wanted to ride it?

142
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,366
- Yes, of course!
- Are you kidding?

143
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,001
No.

144
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:33,473
Oh, somebody's waking up.
Did you take a little power nap?

145
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:37,009
Hello. Hi!

146
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:42,014
You two go,
we will wait down here.

147
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,354
...at 100 km/h. (62 mph)

148
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:52,091
- 100 km/h...
- Was that a joke?

149
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:56,195
...on the way down.
The way up is pretty slow and kind.

150
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:59,132
Was... was that a joke?

151
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:05,171
The worst part is that it will feel like
we are about to hit that little house.

152
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:08,674
- But look how beautiful it is.
- It's very nice.

153
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:12,422
They're going up now.

154
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:16,702
It's so high.

155
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,285
Can I get off?

156
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:26,292
Oh, dang. Oh, it's so high.
I don't remember it going this high.

157
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,035
Oh, no...
We are so high up now.

158
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,299
I wasn't prepared for this.
Alma, what have we done?

159
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:39,172
Alma, this wasn't fun at all.
Alma! Why did we do this?!

160
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:44,172
- I don't know!
- Alma, I love you.

161
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:42,001
I mean... the Giant Drop was so scary.
I'm still trembling. I'm shaking.

162
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,003
Was it worse than Monster?

163

Yes, it was actually worse than Monster.
Monster was fun, in a way. This one wasn't fun - just scary.

164
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,513
- It's just contempt for death.
- Adrenaline rush 2000.

165
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,750
Yes. But it's fun. I like it.

166
00:16:57,937 --> 00:17:04,790
What a thing... "Gröna Lund" on weekdays.
Not a single ride had more than a 10 minute line.

167
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,853
No.

168
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:09,054
A hot tip.
They're open for a while longer.

169
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,533
Thank you for watching this video!

170
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,505

- Mostly thumbs up!

171
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,842

172
