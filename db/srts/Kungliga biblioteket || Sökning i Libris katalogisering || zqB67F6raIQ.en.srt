1
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
We will go through the search function in Libris cataloging. We will look at the search box,

2
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:20,480
How to define the search and sorting of the hit list. The search box is included

3
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,624
Wherever you are in the tool. With the shortcut alt + s you come to Search.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,024
You can search directly in the search box. You can also delineate your search in different ways.

5
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,376
As a default, the search is canceled at the instance.

6
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,728
This corresponds to searching for editions or similar.

7
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
You can change the boundary to works, agent, concept or all.

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,660
Since we have not yet started working with works as our own entities

9
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56.820
If you do not get many hits when you search for works.

10
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00.672
As a default, the search is also set to free text.

11
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07.328
You can then define further here by selecting ISBN, ISSN or Main title.

12
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
If you delineate to ISBN, you can search for ISBN with or without a hyphen.

13
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,408
If you search for ISBN as a free text, search without a hyphen.

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,504
You can also click Search in the main menu.

15
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:31,392
Then you come to a view where you can search in Libris or other sources.

16
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38.048
It is important to always seek carefully in Libris first to be sure that you do not create duplicates.

17
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,680
If you do not find what you are looking for in Libris, you can move on to other sources.

18
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:49,056
Here you can search other databases and import an entry.

19
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52.640
See the movie "Search in other sources" for more information.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,736
We are testing to do a search in Libris.

21
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04.416
I search for the hypnotist of Lars Kepler.

22
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:13,632
You can delimit with different filters that you see in the left menu.

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,240
For example, I choose to delineate on work type text

24
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:23,360
And on publishing year 2009.

25
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,620
Then we see that the hit list became much shorter. You can remove the filters by clicking the cross.

26
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,920
You can also sort the hit list.

27
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,584
Sorting is set to relevance as a default and one can also choose

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,448
Main title, release year or last updated.

29
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,080
I choose to sort on release year (oldest first).

30
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01.504
The hit list can also be set to detailed view, as here, or on compact view.

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05.240
There are more opportunities to make your search more detailed.

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,200
