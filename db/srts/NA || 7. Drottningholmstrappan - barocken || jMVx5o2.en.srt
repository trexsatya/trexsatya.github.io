1
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.640
Art - or weirdness.

2
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.560
Sweden's art history is part of the huge story of our country.

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.120
We will with some impacts show art-

4
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.600
- As depicts changes and creation power.

5
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.640
When Drottningholm Castle began to be built in the 1660s-

6
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.920
- Sweden was a European superpower.

7
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.880
Extra care was placed on the part that connects the lower and upstairs:

8
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.960
The stairwell.

9
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.600
Here, architect Nicodemus Tessin created the older something brand new.

10
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.000
A large symmetrical representative stairwell -

11
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.160
–A parade room which is also actually a bit of a program statement -

12
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.480
- And sometimes used for dinners and parties.

13
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.800
If we look here we discover -

14
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.760
- The statues turn their backs on us standing on the stairs.

15
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.120
Everyone turns towards the center.
 It is so-

16
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.160
- That there is no one where you see the entire stairwell.

17
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.320
You are supposed to move - as one of the explanatory models for the Baroque:

18
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.160
You are constantly moving, constantly participating in the artwork.

19
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.320
Sweden also wanted to claim -

20
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.560
- With the great nations in artistic terms.

21
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.160
The stairwell is one of the monuments where you get inspiration from Italy -

22
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.000
- And to some extent from France.

23
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.800
A monastery in Venice is the biggest source of inspiration for the architect.

24
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.960
Up here is a large painting on canvas by David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl -

25
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.160
-which was the dominant painter at the court from the 1660s onwards.

26
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.280
It represents two antique gods, Apollo and Minerva.

27
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.360
They raise Hedvig Eleonora's name cipher in a warehouse wreath up against eternity.

28
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.960
David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl is the celebrity of the time.

29
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.760
A superstar who has been on a educational trip to the continent.

30
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.400
He is an early PR maker, with the mission to serve power.

31
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.720
As he himself has expressed in any of his writings is his task -

32
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.880
- Painting the fame of the high authority.

33
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.680
His biggest task is to portray the Swedish royal power -

34
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.880
- And to do it in a symbolic allegorical way.

35
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.880
The picture of Karl XI in the Battle of Lund 1676–

36
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.400
-Is at first glance realistic.
 Tabs, gunpowder and blood splashes.

37
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.480
But the king is still set alongside the hit.

38
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.280
The king becomes without supernatural attributes the inaccessible hero god.

39
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.440
The unrelenting winner.

40
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.320
What Ehrenstrahl paints expresses the political situation in Sweden -

41
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.960
- And the needs that the royal family has at the time.

42
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.880
Time is the empire.
 A Sweden that extends beyond the Baltic Sea -

43
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.200
- And has colonial claims in the north as well.

44
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.320
Land is taken into possession.
 Cultural heritage is plundered.

45
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.440
I.a.
 Gift drums are brought to museums south - where many remained.

46
00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.120
But the royal ideal at the time was taken from the continent -

47
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.440
–And was characterized by the hungry - the baroque.

48
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.160
Drottningholm is at the forefront.

49
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.840
This is the purely Baroque's major breakthrough in Sweden.

50
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.880
Here, architecture, painting, and sculpture.

51
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.440
And maybe there were members from the court chapel -

52
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.040
- Which stood for the music.

53
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.480
People are also part of the composition.

54
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.200
You participate as a spectator in the event going on in the stairwell.

55
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.280
Here we see Diana Ross.

56
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.040
