1
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,900
Hey!
 Tjena and welcome again.

2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,120
Now it's been a while.
 Yes now it has been a few months.

3
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,100
In terms of design, it is finished and assembled.

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,100
Now it is the most small adjustments and brackets to be done.

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,460
In a few days it will be disassembled completely.

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,880
Then I start with the frame and arrange it and it should be foiled.

7
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,260
Then it should be picked up and foiled, painted and polished.

8
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,940
-The should have no color huh?
 No.

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,380
Everything that is in aluminum should be polished.
 It will probably go to some autosol.

10
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,800
If it becomes autosol, I have tried slightly different means but have not decided yet.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,540
-What are there for other means?
 It has come a lot new to aluminum.

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,220
Autosol has come with 2 new ones and I have only tested one so far.

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,560
There is one that is only for aluminum and should test it with.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,780
There are other means that you use that act as a wax.

15
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,580
There are 2-3 different brands on the market but I have not been able to try anything yet.

16
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,140
-There's happened to some time since last time.
 Yes rims and tires are in place and so did the whole car.

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,140
The tires I have offended myself down here.
 I bought iron so I could squeeze them.

18
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,920
Both front and rear tires have inner hose and I get punctured along the road ...

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,900
... then spare wheels are not enough, but you have to change the inner hose.

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,340
And then I have to know if it is possible to push the tire or not and I have practiced all 4 tires.

21
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,960
-And now the grill is ready.
 Yes, I have roughly polished to see all the bumps.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,020
If you feel like this, it feels uneven.

23
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,340
I will smooth more but now I know what is visible and not visible.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:23,580
I have made some covers to sit on the inside of the frame.

25
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,440
These are these.
 -And you have pressed this?

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,040
Yes and it should sit 2 screwed here.

27
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,060
It is to cover the ugly.

28
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,560
The plastic foil goes around the edge here.

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,760
Because I will foil the frame ...

30
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,220
... it is difficult to foil the inside and get it neat.

31
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,540
Then it is enough if I form up to the edge.

32
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,540
Then cover the cover.

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,440
-Is the engines ready?
 No it just sits ...

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,440
... the crankshaft in so they are empty internally.

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,760
I have finished all the covers.

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,720
-Yeah, they're done.
 Yes on both sides.

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,860
Look what a good thing!
 There will be some inspection hatches.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,380
It will be polished and painted with cast paint.

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,440
It should look like you see the engine block.

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,940
-What are you holding up?
 It's an old whistle I've had lying to a motorcycle.

41
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,500
It must be cut and extended.

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,080
Or I take an old trombone.

43
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,200
After all, they are so long and are supposed to sit here.

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,060
-How should you be able to squeeze it?

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,000
There must be 2 plates that squeeze and be regulated with a pedal inside the car.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,960
-Hahaha!

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,240
-Ope!

48
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,620
Then I get an electric whistle as a complement.
 A truck driver I think does not hear this.

49
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,580
-The inspection doors are they riveted or screwed?

50
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,440
They are screwed.
 There are small screws here.

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,200
Then you come in ... I'll have ..

52
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,920
I can't fit the oil filter because it sits here normally.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,180
I have a help frame that holds the engines together.

54
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,200
Filter is placed here behind instead.

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,660
If you want to change filters, you can remove the cover.

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,940
Behind this hatch you see the joint between the engines.

57
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,780
Even when setting the ignition on the engines.

58
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,460
Distributers are behind here.

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,300
-How often will you use this?

60
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,080
I drive as much as the other cars, it is 600 miles a year

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,620
-Oops.

62
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,020
If it doesn't work, I put it in a barn where no one can see it.

63
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,560
It should work otherwise it is not fun.
 It is pointless to have a car standing.

64
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,020
I want to be able to drive to Stockholm, NorrtÃ¤lje on a meeting and home.

65
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,420
-What are you putting on now?
 These are the oil filling pipes.

66
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,900
It's a bit tight.

67
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,540
It will be the first and second engine and here you fill the oil.

68
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,440
So I don't have to remove the entire valve cover.

69
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,900
When I change oil I will have a small gap here.

70
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,460
Where I can stick down a vacuum hose and soak up the oil.

71
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,160
Also put an oil stick in.

72
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,500
-Will the cooler hose leave?

73
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,580
These brass pipes that will be taped with black fabric tape and sit so.

74
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,580
And an angle in here.

75
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:54,060
I don't want the blue silicone so I tape so it looks like an old fabric hose.

76
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,135
-Hard system is clear.
 Yes it is fully welded and suspended.

77
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,260
It is not silent but sits with feathers.
 -Yes that yes.

78
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,700
It is stretched so that it can move.

79
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,920
Stainless steel has the ability to widen when it is hot and cold.

80
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,520
I think it bursts if I have it silent screwed.

81
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,860
It is easy to just loosen the springs and be able to loosen the entire exhaust system.

82
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,140
And three carburetors and they were not last.
 Yes 3 pcs.

83
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Original carburetor that has been renovated.
 Almost everything on the inside is new.

84
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,600
The screws are also new in stainless steel.

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,480
I have rationalized away the choke.
 This is never used in Sweden in the summer.

86
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,440
I never drive in the winter with this car.

87
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,640
-How should you be able to get carburetors to be sync?

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,100
They do not have to be synced because the carburetor in the middle feeds both engines.

89
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,300
Both engines have the same structure and the same compression and camshafts.

90
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,215
That carburetor controls both engines.

91
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,240
During normal driving, only the carburetor in the middle is connected.

92
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,720
When you gas on when overtaking, the other carburetors open.

93
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,400
There will be an exchange here.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
It is also own manufacturing.

95
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,920
-Everything is well made on this one.

96
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,600
I can adjust here when I want the other carburetors to open.

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,480
If I want them to open earlier, I can move the pin there.

98
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,600
Then it opens already here.

99
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,920
The most important thing is that when driving at 100-110km/h that the carburetor is set correctly.

100
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,200
It is own implementation here.
 It is a piece of leather that I have shrunk.

101
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,660
I got the funnel -shaped and squeezed it between two trays.

102
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,260
And made this brass ring so it gets air tight.

103
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,260
It is the details that do it.
 -It really is.

104
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,480
If you want to be won I have made a gap here.

105
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,360
There should be a cable in this hole that is controlled with a lever from the inside.

106
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,560
And it opens that way.
 -Of course!

107
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,220
We'll see if it works because it can leak a little.

108
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,520
There will be stainless steel feathers.
 These are just ordinary Biltema feathers.

109
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,240
-In terms of body it is clear.
 Yes doors and seats are cut.

110
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,260
I have done grid templates and most of the fitting is done.

111
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,800
-What is it for boxes?
 -It's not going to be glass?

112
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,380
Well there will be slats.
 That I will cut myself.

113
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,160
As I have to cast them into the frame before I sit there.

114
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,260
That's because I've done the template so I know it fits then.

115
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:45,160
Later on, the lamps are finished with 50 mm lens effort from an MC.

116
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,640
It is whole and dipped beam and is mounted with 2 screws so you can adjust.

117
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,540
Never have to adjust the lantern, but you do it internally.

118
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,660
And there is an LED strip as parking light.

119
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,380
-How does it look at the back?

120
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,800
For last time, "we" or you because I have nothing to do with this building.

121
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,020
We can take inside.
 I have finished the partition towards the foam.

122
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:16,420
The chairs are cut and fitted.
 What is missing is attachment and screw them.

123
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,440
Pedals and pedal racks are also completed.

124
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,320
And the steering wheel I have fully welded so it should hold.

125
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,620
Is there a wooden floor in here?
 Yes.

126
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,580
I should not use this floor, but I have only used it as a template.

127
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,360
Just so I know how the pedals will end up and how the seat should sit.

128
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,560
Exactly the accelerator, it is important to have the right support against the foot.

129
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,300
If you want to drive for 5-6 hours, it will be difficult if you have the wrong driving position.

130
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,020
Right now, the accelerator is straight above the cardan tunnel.

131
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,980
Yes, but usually you sit a little oblique with your foot.

132
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,700
Here the heel ends up and if you brake you just move over the foot.

133
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,760
It doesn't get that far on the pedal.

134
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,420
There is no oil in but this one is connected.

135
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,480
And here is full gas.

136
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,660
-When will it get there?

137
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,700
I'll just buy a regular tachometer that I attach to the back.

138
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,000
And a pointer from a mora clock ...

139
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,500
... a little bigger as an arrow and old numbers as it was on watches before scaled up to 6.

140
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,780
And some lamps at the bottom for charging temp etc.

141
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,640
Should you have any speedometer?
 No, there will be GPS instead.

142
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,680
I don't need any speedometer in this car.

143
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,675
And GPS you have with you so I can drive after it.

144
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,700
-The steering wheel was a boat knob did you say?
 It is fully welded in the joints.

145
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,120
It was badly done for a boat you do not have to make an effort when you swing.

146
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,640
Now I have fully welded it for safety.

147
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,220
The whole steering wheel is in aluminum.

148
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,620
Since then I have made the decor in brass.

149
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,340
-I haven't seen any name on it.

150
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:12,680
It's going on and should ... would cast first ...

151
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,500
... and put on the back but I have regretted it.

152
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,120
It will be in the valve cover instead.

153
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,820
It will be written here.
 So you only use plain salt water.

154
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,520
Mask and switch on a car battery.

155
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,860
Plus here and minus you dip in the water.

156
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,635
Here it has become a good edge.

157
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,740
It's only 20 minutes.
 It is a very significant edge.

158
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,380
The text should be polished but the frame around.

159
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,540
-What should it be hot?
 Uh, Decimo Segundo.

160
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,240
It's Portuguese.

161
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,580
In the past, they always named their cars in the United States.

162
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,260
It was Spanish or Portuguese.

163
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,760
Decimo Segundo means twelve.

164
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,480
It seems more complicated than it is.
 Those who translate it on the mobile will probably be snooped.

165
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,240
Back here I have made all the moldings.

166
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,980
And where the light and a fuel cap should sit.

167
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,540
The tank is mounted right below.

168
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,780
-And all the moldings are tuned?

169
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,620
Yes but they are loose so far but know that they fit.

170
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,300
I have made the suspension to the rear exhaust system that is suspended with 2 feathers.

171
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,160
And there is thermal insulation in between.

172
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,100
Stainless steel moves a lot so it can't be fixed so it can slip a little.

173
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,960
It was sick near the wheel.
 Yes it should be corrected.

174
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,340
I have to put a spacer in between so I get the wheel 1.5 cm.

175
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:01,200
It does not get that hot as it is silencer insulation.

176
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,720
So it insulates the heat with.

177
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,120
What is left to construct is a handbrake.

178
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,020
I have not decided yet and I will have a foot brake or a long lever.

179
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,000
It's good to have an emergency brake.

180
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,260
-Now I'll wage further we'll be visible again soon.
 We'll do that.

181
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,140
Bye!
 Hello!
