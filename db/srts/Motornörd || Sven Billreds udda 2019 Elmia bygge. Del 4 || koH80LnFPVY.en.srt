00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,900
Hey! Tjena and welcome again.

2
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,120
Now it's been a while. Yes now it has been a few months.

3
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,100
In terms of design, it is finished and assembled.

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,100
Now it is the most small adjustments and brackets to be done.

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,460
In a few days it will be disassembled completely.

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,880
Then I start with the frame and arrange it and it should be foiled.

7
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,260
Then it should be picked up and foiled, painted and polished.

8
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,940
-The should have no color huh? No.

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,380
Everything that is in aluminum should be polished. It will probably go to some autosol.

10
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08.800
If it becomes autosol, I have tried slightly different means but have not decided yet.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,540
-What are there for other means? It has come a lot new to aluminum.

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,220
Autosol has come with 2 new ones and I have only tested one so far.

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,560
There is one that is only for aluminum and should test it with.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,780
There are other means that you use that act as a wax.

15
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,580
There are 2-3 different brands on the market but I have not been able to try anything yet.

16
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,140
-There's happened to some time since last time. Yes rims and tires are in place and so did the whole car.

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,140
The tires I have offended myself down here. I bought iron so I could squeeze them.

18
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,920
Both front and rear tires have inner hose and I get punctured along the road ...

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,900
... then spare wheels are not enough, but you have to change the inner hose.

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,340
And then I have to know if it is possible to push the tire or not and I have practiced all 4 tires.

21
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,960
-And now the grill is ready. Yes, I have roughly polished to see all the bumps.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12.020
If you feel like this, it feels uneven.

23
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,340
I will smooth more but now I know what is visible and not visible.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:23,580
I have made some covers to sit on the inside of the frame.

25
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,440
These are these. -And you have pressed this?

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,040
Yes and it should sit 2 screwed here.

27
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,060
It is to cover the ugly.

28
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38.560
The plastic foil goes around the edge here.

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,760
Because I will foil the frame ...

30
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,220
... it is difficult to foil the inside and get it neat.

31
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,540
Then it is enough if I form up to the edge.

32
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,540
Then cover the cover.

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,440
-Is the engines ready? No it just sits ...

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02.440
... the crankshaft in so they are empty internally.

35
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,760
I have finished all the covers.

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08.720
-Yeah, they're done. Yes on both sides.

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,860
Look what a good thing! There will be some inspection hatches.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,380
It will be polished and painted with cast paint.

39
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,440
It should look like you see the engine block.

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,940
-What are you holding up? It's an old whistle I've had lying to a motorcycle.

41
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,500
It must be cut and extended.

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,080
Or I take an old trombone.

43
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,200
After all, they are so long and are supposed to sit here.

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,060
-How should you be able to squeeze it?

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,000
There must be 2 plates that squeeze and be regulated with a pedal inside the car.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,960
-Hahaha!

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,240
-Ope!

48
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00.620
Then I get an electric whistle as a complement. A truck driver I think does not hear this.

49
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,580
-The inspection doors are they riveted or screwed?

50
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09.440
They are screwed. There are small screws here.

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,200
Then you come in ... I'll have ..

52
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,920
I can't fit the oil filter because it sits here normally.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,180
I have a help frame that holds the engines together.

54
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,200
Filter is placed here behind instead.

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,660
If you want to change filters, you can remove the cover.

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,940
Behind this hatch you see the joint between the engines.

57
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,780
Even when setting the ignition on the engines.

58
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,460
Distributers are behind here.

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,300
-How often will you use this?

60
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,080
I drive as much as the other cars, it is 600 miles a year

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,620
-Oops.
