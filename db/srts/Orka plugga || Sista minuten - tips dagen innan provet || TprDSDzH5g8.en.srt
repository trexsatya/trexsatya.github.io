1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
You need to plug in all evening.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,280
Start by thinking about how you can make the evening as good as possible.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,840
How do you plug best?
 Alone or with someone?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,120
Do you want someone to interrogate after a while?

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,080
Where are you plugging the best?
 Find the optimal place-

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,920
-When you can concentrate and do not have to be disturbed.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,400
Do you like to sit at a desk or in bed?

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,280
You decide.
 Make it a little extra cozy around you.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,320
You should still sit there for a while.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,680
Eat something before you start, but also make sure you have snacks ready.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,240
You will need to replenish with energy.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,520
Do you like to have music?

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,280
Throw together a simple plug playlist and put it on repeat.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,640
See the evening as a race.
 When it is over, you are in goal.

15
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,600
Try to find small ways that can facilitate.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Something to drink or eat and a cozy place-

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,120
-Can make it feel a little easier.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Maybe it's good to tell everyone that you should plug.

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,760
Then the family stays away and the friends know why you don't answer.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,320
Put the mobile on aircraft mode.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,680
If you need your computer, block pages that you usually visit-

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
-But that you don't use.

23
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,800
Plug in short passes and take breaks.

24
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,360
You only have tonight, so there will be a little more passports than usual.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,320
But you fix that.

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,680
Write down things that you don't understand.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,440
Save them and ask someone else to explain it to you-

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,600
-Or try to google for a good explanation.
 But was source -critical.

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,280
A lot of text?
 Write your own summaries.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,520
It is perfect to read through at breakfast or on the bus.

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,880
Use the breaks the same day the sample is.

32
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,280
Give yourself a reward when the evening is over.

33
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,840
Maybe you get your mobile back or that you bought some candy?

34
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,840
Prioritize sleep.
 Don't sit up all night.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,520
To get the best conditions for remembering, the brain needs sleep.

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,880
Then it sorts away noise and unnecessary information.

37
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,640
Sleep deprivation just makes it harder-

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
-Remember everything you plugged in the night before.

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,560
Don't forget the breakfast.

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Is the test in the afternoon?
 Don't skip lunch.

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,480
You need the energy.

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,240
If you have kept up with the lessons, you can usually more than you think.

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,600
You fix this.
