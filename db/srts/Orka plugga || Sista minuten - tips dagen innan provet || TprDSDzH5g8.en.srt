1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,080
Put off studying 
until the day before the test?

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,840
Here are some last-minute tips

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,120
You'll be studying the whole evening.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,280
Start by thinking, what do you need 
to make the best out of the evening?

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,840
How do you study best? 
Alone or in company?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,120
Do you want someone to test you 
after a while?

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,080
Where do you study best? 
Find your ideal place.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Somewhere you can focus 
and won't be bothered.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,400
Do you prefer a desk 
or your bed, perhaps?

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,280
You decide. It might be worth 
making it that little bit extra cosy.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,320
You're going to be there for a while.

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,680
Eat something before you start, 
but make sure to have some snacks.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,240
You'll need some extra energy 
during the evening.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,520
Do you like listening to music?

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,280
Throw together a quick study playlist 
and put it on repeat.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,640
Treat the evening as a race. 
When it's over, you've reached goal.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,600
Try to find ways to make it easier.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
Something nice to drink or eat 
and a cosy place to study

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,120
might make it feel a bit easier.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,640
ELIMINATE DISTRACTIONS

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,800
It might be a good idea to tell everyone 
that you're studying.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,760
Your family might stay away, and your 
friends will know why you're not replying.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,320
Put your phone in flight mode 
while you're studying.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,680
If you need to use a computer, 
block sites that you normally visit,

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
that you won't need during the evening.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
THE STUDYING

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,800
Study in short bursts and take breaks.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,360
Since you only have one evening, 
there might be quite many sessions.

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,320
But you can handle it.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,680
Take notes of things 
that you don't understand.

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,440
Save them, and ask someone else 
to explain when you get a chance,

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,600
or try googling for a good explanation. 
But remember to be critical of sources.

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,280
A lot of text? Write your own summaries.

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,520
They're great for revising over breakfast 
or on the bus to school.

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,880
And use the breaks 
on the day of the test.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,280
Give yourself a reward 
at the end of the night.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,840
Maybe you finally get your phone back, 
or perhaps you bought some sweets.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
ENERGY

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,840
Prioritise sleep. Don't stay up all night.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,520
In order to best remember what 
we've learned, our brains need sleep.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,880
That's when noise and 
unnecessary information is cleared out.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,640
A lack of sleep will only make it harder

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
to remember what you learned 
the night before.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,560
Don't forget breakfast,

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,120
and if the test is in the afternoon, 
don't skip lunch.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,480
You'll need the energy.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Remember, if you paid attention in class, 
you often know more than you think.

48
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,600
You can do it.
