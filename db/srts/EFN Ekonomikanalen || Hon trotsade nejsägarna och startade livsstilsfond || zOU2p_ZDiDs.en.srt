1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,040
The most important thing I've learned is not to listen to no-sayers.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,840
The more no you get, the more triggered man-

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,280
-To prove that you can really deliver.
 So I feel.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,440
-It has been successful so far.
 -Yes, quite.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,600
Therese Nyrén had a good and safe job at Bank-

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,320
-When she chose to resign and start her own.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,480
Since 2021 she runs Lucy Global Fund-

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,080
-A fund that invests in luxury and lifestyle brands-

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,800
-Som Hermès, Moncler, Fenix Outdoor and Ferrari.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,520
How did you dare?

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,400
I had a pretty good, well-paid job in asset management and advisory-

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,960
-And started looking at a portfolio that I thought was exciting.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,240
I met many entrepreneurs and then I thought, "If they can, then I can."

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,720
At first I thought about advising it, but then there was a woman who told me:

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,080
"Shouldn't you start funds, then?"
 Then I thought, "Yes, I will."
 And so I did.

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,320
-Did you encounter any resistance?
 -Jajamän.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,600
I have done that right from the start.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,360
Many have said, "Should you really start a foundation? It's so hard."

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,960
But I feel that the more they say it is not possible, the more triggered I have become.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,480
So I've just been driving.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,760
-Is it hard?
 -Yes, but pretty ...

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,800
Then it is important to have the right people around themselves.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,920
I have been working for a long time in the industry so it's great fun-

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
-To get to manage a fund that you are interested in.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,280
I love this.
 It's really fun.

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,520
The idea of a lifestyle fund is according to Therese Nyrén-

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,080
-Th the one who bets money in well-known and strong brands that one thinks-

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,320
-So feel greater security and enthusiasm for their investment.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
After a tough first year the fund has the past year had-

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,400
-A eight percentage points greater increase than the Dow Jones World Index.

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,560
I think this went well.
 We are up about 20 % this year.

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,120
We have managed relatively well.

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Would you have done something different if you had to change anything?

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,880
No.
 Maybe I would have started a little earlier.

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,520
On the other hand I have long experience now-

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,960
-So I think it feels great that we started when we did.
