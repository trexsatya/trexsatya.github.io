1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,180
How do you know this will work over the main?

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:04,079
I do not know.

3
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:05.539
That's the fun.

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,670
The exciting thing is that so far away from my comfort zone

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,770
As possible I want to be.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,149
I'm going to build a camper and do it with a different approach.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,869
Like to be a little inventor and generally crazy

8
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:24,739
So I've gone all in on crazy ideas.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,729
Hello Hello.

10
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:27,510
Hello.

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,350
How's it going?

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,949
It is just fine.

13
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:31,680
You look a little half the tire.

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,069
Yes, many hours.

15
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,750
We are starting to approach May 1st now.

16
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:36,750
Your deadline.

17
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:40,220
Yes, it does not appear to be able to hold.

18
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:44,040
Not so unexpected actually, because you have a lot to do.

19
00:00:44,139 --> 00:00:48,090
But all construction pulls over budget and pulls over time

20
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,349
Is well the standard problem that everyone has.

21
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:53.060
But what is it wrong?

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,210
What is it that does not lock?

23
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58.849
I have actually figured out why I have felt stressed.

24
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,330
I can't shower here.

25
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,250
That's the problem.

26
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,150
I have three days here so I go to Värnamo, showers,

27
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,250
Changes clothes and fetches more stuff and goes back.

28
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:17,279
My weeks rush until I realized that it is not three days at one week seven.

29
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,010
So I have three days here.

30
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,120
A day in Värnamo, three days here one in Värnamo which feels

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,220
Like one weeks, much faster goes.

32
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,470
So that's why I have felt so stressed

33
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:29,430
to get started with it.

34
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:35,059
Now I have calm down and it has made that May 1 Deadline

35
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,790
I iron or I move on without it that has

36
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48.230
strolled is when you have no control over the situation

37
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,330
Yourself longer without being dependent on others.

38
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:56,300
So then it becomes that stuff takes longer and promises that is not held

39
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:58,870
And things disappear and so on.

40
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,050
It has been a bit messy now.

41
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,150
What are you waiting for then?

42
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07.830
The boxes under the stomach of the truck are on order.

43
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:13,899
They have had another supplier but I have waited four months for

44
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,399
And leave them in the knit and I have been allowed to order them again.

45
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,669
I have ordered stuff that has disappeared to the freight forwarding company

46
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27.513
slopes it away and it's handmade special stuff

47
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:31,648
It takes an eternity before I get new etc.

48
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:32,849
But how are things going for you?

49
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,539
How far have you come?

50
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,119
It's fine.

51
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,699
I have been in a phase when there is a lot that happens

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,239
But nothing that is visible.

53
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,860
When people are curious so I don't have that much to show off

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,869
Without it, it has a lot of finery and behind the scenes that need to be fixed.

55
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:52,289
Are you done with the garage?

56
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:55.857
Not finished but it just starts to become more useful.

57
00:02:55,857 --> 00:03:02,380
You will get shelf systems and that bit in the form of LED strippers is in place,

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05.414
But you will get a little workbench type

59
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:07,520
And shelf systems that we will build.

60
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:10,009
But should the bikes be hung up or?

61
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,899
Yeah, I will fix that so they don't crash

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,729
And gases and brakes. But it will fit.

63
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,729
You are the first thing I see in the ceiling here.

64
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,879
Have you received these panels or what they are called.

65
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:25,380
LED panels or skylights.

66
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:28,789
They have finally appeared now. I've been waiting for them.

67
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:31,455
I have three pieces here in the corridor

68
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:35,710
Do I have six pieces above the table

69
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,290
and now on Monday the electrician will come and we will plug them

70
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,929
Unscrew and make it more complete.

71
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:48,110
It will be a big case forward for the real ones.

72
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:51,429
Looks good and then has cupboards that you have put there.

73
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,149
Got those in place so they are ready.

74
00:03:56,289 --> 00:04:00,350
And the next step is that I will have the surface layer

75
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:09.410
all below 90 centimeters will be micro concrete that gets a feeling of concrete doors

76
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:15,970
And even down here so it is a company from Värnamo

77
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,940
coming on Tuesday.

78
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,170
And put it on the wall upwards.

79
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,630
Exactly! There will be two main themes.

80
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,429
You have 3D cork, anything over 90 and concrete that is below 90

81
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:36,000
And then all horizontal surfaces become three millimeters of powder covers.

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,720
So here comes the plate and it will be good

83
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,579
And also the sink and everything else that is horizontal.

84
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,739
There are also other things you have done here. Electricity in the ceiling.

85
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:48,929
Is that the roof. Is on we pull.

86
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:49,949
And the camera?

87
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:54,790
Exactly. I have gained both GoPro and the camera.

88
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:58,690
And set up four surveillance cameras.

89
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01.149
There you have the GoPro'n and the surveillance camera.

90
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02.880
So much will be seen by them.

91
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,979
Unfortunately there was no white front to order,

92
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09.196
But I have to accept the black part.

93
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:15,910
It is thus a digital device that connects the four images.

94
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,350
Here all 4 are drawn to the same picture.

95
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,200
The solar panels are in place, they are mounted and drawn in,

96
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:30,559
The electricity is withdrawn into the truck.

97
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,450
There I wait for the electrician to connect the zeal to the electrical system.

98
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,589
But mechanically they sit in place and everything is clear there.

99
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,699
It is moving forward, it is moving forward.

100
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,250
Electricity company that I work with.

101
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,089
They like odd projects but i think they've taken water

102
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,000
over the head for they have had long discussions here

103
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,169
and we have agreed that I may write on a piece of paper

104
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:59,850
with that they are not responsible for electrical safety

105
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03.151
Because there is nothing like that.

106
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07.739
Is correct or there are no real rules on how to do it.

107
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:10,389
Just such a simple thing as grounding.

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,850
If you have a vehicle you get it in the chassis.

109
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,889
It's no wonder.

110
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:24,323
But we will have CE outlets

111
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:30,209
Blue contacts I have at campsites.

112
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,855
Can't remember what they are called. CE outlets I think ...

113
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,399
What happens when you connect to the electricity at the campsite?

114
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:43,649
You have a local soil where you plug it in, then the campsite soil takes over.

115
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:49,320
What happens to the solar panels when they are connected to the earth?

116
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:52,399
One must have a switch that breaks the solar panels

117
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,470
and one can move over the earth from the local earth

118
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59.440
To the campsite's soil.

119
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,470
There are many such strange questions that they have not been to before.

120
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:08.309
We have googled a lot and find some different solutions.

121
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,709
They push the boundaries.

122
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:17,440
Yes, and my project at the company where there is the most discussion

123
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,389
Around it is my shower.

124
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,489
They don't like the shower.

125
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:24,890
They have a nickname of what they call the death shower.

126
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,989
So I hope the "famous last words" I hope they don't get it right.

127
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:34,369
But they are not completely satisfied with what I want to do there.

128
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,459
It is a hybrid solution between recycling shows regular shower

129
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,559
And it stands out a little.

130
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:44,480
You can shower with rubber boots on. Lol! just.

131
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,509
You have dressed everything here now.

132
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:50,259
All gaps and boxes are largely done.

133
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:53,790
Yes, what will be when you get the 3D cork

134
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,950
is that it becomes more uniform.

135
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00.320
But the door to the pantry is not clearly obviously.

136
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,359
But when you get everything in place you have.

137
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:11,369
You have everything you need so it is available,

138
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,470
But it's hidden.

139
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:16,239
Spice shelf and knife shelf.

140
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,609
Is there under the junk basket.

141
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,419
You have to learn your own limitations.

142
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,470
And I've done a lot of stuff before.

143
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,589
But this project has been difficult

144
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35.549
For a different reason and that is why I am an engineer.

145
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,179
Come on and bring out all the solutions is the light part,

146
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,430
But I'm not a carpenter.

147
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,230
I have neither resources, knowledge nor equipment for it.

148
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:53,170
So in my head, the quality level is not what I want to be

149
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,770
Without doing as best I can.

150
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,869
It will be good enough.

151
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00.440
But I am more engineer than a furniture carpenter I have discovered.

152
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:06,000
This is the kitchen table. It is perfectly fixed.

153
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09.670
Nothing you move on but it should be stable and permanent.

154
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:15,780
To it I have a 43 inch screen so it folds out

155
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:23,882
screen and then you have it in front of you and behind

156
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,780
the computer on the wall.

157
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:30,909
Then you create a workspace where you sit and work.

158
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35.540
But if you get guests

159
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,475
Well cables in the way ...

160
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,200
If you get guests you want to remove the screen.

161
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:50,892
Then instead you fold out there you get a bench

162
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:56,969
Most of the time I will be myself then I have dining table and work area.

163
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,719
Just such a thing. Materials cannot be taken in.

164
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,960
The next thing that has been so frustrating that nothing has built in here

165
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,780
Has been in real plywood but it is the construction plywood

166
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,760
that has to make concrete castings.

167
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,440
That is what is available.

168
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,489
They are oblique and wind and large holes in all this.

169
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,931
Regular carpentry plywood is not available

170
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,430
And the prices we should not talk about.

171
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,479
The absurd is that it has not been easy to get hold

172
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,020
in the right material for construction.

173
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:37,260
The seat bench will of course be dressed and then I will

174
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:40,010
Have the same wooden floor as I have.

175
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:44,570
On it I will have on that bit that you go up it to bed

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,550
so it will be floors similar there will be dressed

177
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,719
But the bench is uploadable.

178
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,899
The idea is that in here I will have my charging station

179
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,390
for cameras and drones and other things so it will be

180
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:03,380
Filled with charging options.

181
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,479
In the bathroom then?

182
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07.647
It is connected and drawn.

183
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12.559
But that said, I don't have the surface layers ready but it is

184
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,659
The next step after this.

185
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,250
What is the surface layer to use here?

186
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:18,920
You will not use cork.

187
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,210
No, without a regular wet room mat only.

188
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,700
I will make it easy for wet room mat.

189
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,920
But that is the big thing now that I have on order

190
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,940
is very much plate to order.

191
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,880
It is the slide system for the wardrobe.

192
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,640
I have forgotten them to order so they have made me delay again.

193
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:48,020
But I want to get the wardrobe fast as the eye.

194
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:52,679
In order to get the closet in I will also mount the front door

195
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:56,670
and these are the last two major buildings

196
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00.820
which is left before you can start making the fin.

197
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:05,159
After all, the truck has three recessed LED lights

198
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09.060
which I will reuse two of them.

199
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,080
This one will be covered by the slide part to the closet,

200
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,990
But the one over the bed and the one in the middle of the truck

201
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:21,489
Will I reuse, I watched Youtube.

202
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:28,340
The submarines have red light so as not to

203
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Destroy the darkness.

204
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,320
Then you can get it that you need to go to the toilet at night

205
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,479
And so you don't want to sabotage the darkness.

206
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,869
So we will have the red recessed with red LED lighting on.

207
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,190
And the batteries have not mounted because the boxes are missing.

208
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:50,559
Exactly, they also wait for and are it card houses

209
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:51,920
So it is something that is delayed.

210
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,900
It affects so many other steps so it applies

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,720
to have many parallel projects running at the same time

212
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,830
So you don't get standing anywhere.

213
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,580
But the most frustrating is, as I said now, I am not controlling over time

214
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,599
You yourself are dependent on others and then it is not as easy to.

215
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:14,050
Plan as tough as I did.

216
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,150
Especially not with my three weeks three days.

217
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:19,559
Now calling people and wants help and so I discovered

218
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:21,659
That it was Sunday today.

219
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,969
I forget days.

220
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,099
Fiberglass spoiler over the cab.

221
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:31,789
I will build my latest toy that I got yesterday.

222
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,490
This is Star-Link that is SpaceX satellite

223
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,590
Based Internet systems.

224
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,989
It is quite unusual so far and they are.

225
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:48,919
Around the equator, the many satellites have postponed.

226
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:52,440
But the farther north you get, the more sparse it becomes.

227
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55.859
Officially, I don't think you can order it in Sweden.

228
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,239
However, you have the cells going up to a certain level

229
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,150
And of a little bad luck with the timing.

230
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08.890
The last cell ends between Ljungby and Värnamo

231
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12.409
So I miss it with one and a half two miles about.

232
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,239
So what I did was I borrowed an address

233
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:22,020
For a kindergarten in Ljungby, so that is my service address.

234
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:25,159
Then I had another delivery address so I got it home

235
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:28,260
So it doesn't work here in the garage.

236
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:32,869
But it works in Ljungby and from Ljungby and the rest of Europe.

237
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,289
But right here it doesn't work so long.

238
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,020
Elon Musk owns both companies and it has nothing with Tesla

239
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:41,300
Without it, SpaceX is.

240
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,450
The second space company that today has 2300 satellites

241
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:49,170
that has postponed.

242
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,669
It covers the whole earth so you can have high -speed internet on.

243
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,299
In the middle of the Pacific Ocean or in the Sahara Desert.

244
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,490
This is what they are now using during the war in Ukraine as well.

245
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,740
Exactly. That's what is the really big thing.

246
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08.739
Because it has been because the United States has had it now for just over a year

247
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:11,340
or one and a half years where there was a good while

248
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,020
And then they release it to more and more countries

249
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,230
And they basically have switches.

250
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,880
So they decide that from now on, it applies to Sweden

251
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:21,619
And now it applies to Ukraine.

252
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,820
What was the big thing about Ukraine is that they have started roaming

253
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:33,869
And Roaming does what all of us motorhome owners have longed for.

254
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:36,669
It makes that instead of becoming a stationary on a cell

255
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:39,260
So you have the opportunity to go around with it.

256
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:45.309
This one comes with three -foot and it has motorized

257
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:48,340
that optimizes the angle and everything to the satellites.

258
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:53,510
But on Youtube I have seen a lot that do tests, stealing it

259
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:56,090
And just mount the firm pointing straight up.

260
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,770
And does it go as I hope they do, then it is perfect

261
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:03,200
Because then I will fold it directly into the spoiler.

262
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:08,690
But I also want to see how much difference it will be at the download speed.

263
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,559
Is it negligible then I will stel operate it

264
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:12,780
and has a great impact.

265
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,260
So when I drive loosely with my foot.

266
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,700
You know this should work in the main.

267
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,680
But I don't know.

268
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,140
That's the fun.

269
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:25,910
The exciting thing is to go out on areas that are not so far away

270
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,420
From my comfort zone as possible and that is the goal.

271
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,960
To test all the crazy ideas I had in my head

272
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,780
And it pulls to its tip.

273
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,340
Some work and some do not work, then you learn.

274
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Have you set any new deadline now, right? How do you think now?

275
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:45,590
No hard deadline but just continue at the pace that I do

276
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,610
And then it must take the time it takes.

277
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,520
And I think that sounds really good.

278
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:55,010
I also have another philosophy.

279
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,900
I will not make the final finish, type paint inside cabinets and such things.

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,520
I will leave that completely.

281
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:05,400
Because in the same way as in a house that never gets finished

282
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,670
As one is doing and stuffing with, everything comes

283
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,989
What I can move on or shoot on.

284
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,959
It will do during the journey instead. So I have like mini projects

285
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,439
Which I can grab when I feel it. Rainy days.

286
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:24,219
When it is rainy and windy then you stand in there and paint?

287
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,160
Exactly, some things that I will take with me on the trip.

288
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:30,780
It won't be so fun to sleep in it then.

289
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,380
You have to be a morning girl and then you have to be out for the rest of the day.

290
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,859
So when it doesn't rain, then you have to do it. So it must be.

291
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,019
It is great to see that it is moving forward here.

292
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,089
It is making progress.

293
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:46,280
Next time we see I have much more surface layer in place

294
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,680
So it will look like it has happened much more outside it.

295
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,099
Good luck and fight for now!

296
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,270
Thanks, now it's the final sprint.

297
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:57,199
See you! Hello!
