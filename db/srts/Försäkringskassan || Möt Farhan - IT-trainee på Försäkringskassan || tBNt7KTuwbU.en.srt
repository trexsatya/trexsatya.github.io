00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,920
My name is Farhan and read software technology at the university.

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,519
Now I work as an IT trainee here at Försäkringskassan,

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,960
And this is my first job after education.

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,519
I looked at several different jobs,

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,800
But I chose this because my opportunities to develop were great.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,840
When people are told that I work at the Social Insurance Office

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,559
So they directly believe that I'm a manager,

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
So I can explain that I work with system development.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,320
Many people get curious about what I do and it's really fun.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,280
It is quite a lot to learn as new technology, how to work in the teams

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,719
And how the IT systems work.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,079
But I am very interested in system development and think it is exciting tasks,

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,400
And when it is exciting, it is easy to go to work.

14
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,320
What surprised me in the beginning is that the Social Insurance Office is so great

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,119
And have so much technology.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,679
That is why it is important to be good at problem solution and be able to collaborate with others.

17
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,800
We usually work in teams and therefore it is important to understand each other,

18
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,079
And what is good is that everyone within the teams tries to help all the time.

19
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,519
If you are interested in IT, there is always a job here that fits.
