Student life in Halmstad. Student David tells.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
David is my name and plugs the nursing program.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,467
Right now I am on the western beach.

4
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:16,567
My favorite place on campus is in the R-house, in the health lab.

5
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:19,633
Although it is mostly for nursing students-

6
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,067
-And other programs such as PIM (Psychology Specialization Sports and Exercise).

7
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:27,933
It is very cozy in there, there is your own kitchen.

8
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:30,500
It is very large and many places to plug in.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,533
This is where I am most right now.

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,500
It is very beautiful down here.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,700
There are many places to run and exercise, many places to hang out.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,900
I love being down here in Halmstad.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,267
It is a fun city and easy to get to know new people everywhere.

14
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:49,600
There are so few living here, so it will be most students.

15
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:54,300
You can get to know people from sports centers to different-

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,267
-The training facilities to meet people on the beaches.

17
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,933
It is very beautiful down here.

18
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,100
Many my friends have plugged down here-

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,900
-And they have said that Halmstad is a good plug city.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,200
There are so many fun things to do, such as various events.

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,467
It's also a little warmer down here, a little more open.

22
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,700
Easy to get a home, I thought.

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,500
It was just to come down here and start hanging out.
