00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.377
Hello and welcome to BB Linköping's large lecture "to give birth".

2
00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:15.008
You are all here to listen, because you have one thing in common:

3
00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:19.753
That you are expecting children.
 First, second, third or even the fourth child.

4
00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:21.038
What do we know.

5
00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:26.536
This lecture replaces the actual lecture

6
00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.450
we have, normally, a few times each semester,

7
00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:31.531
Up on the US in Linköping.

8
00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:37.032
Since we have a pandemic, we can use this agent.

9
00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:43.937
We will not go into anything around the coronary restrictions

10
00:00:44.332 --> 00:00:48.080
Because they change often, sometimes from day to day.

11
00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:53.581
We may refer to the region's guidelines and the Public Health Authority.

12
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:59.552
My name is Lina Broberg and I work as a midwife at the birth in Linköping.

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.587
My name is Caroline Lorentzon.
 I also work at the birth and BB.

14
00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.486
Today's agenda you see here:

15
00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:16.916
We were going to tell you how we work at the birth

16
00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:20.896
Who works with us and how we work together.

17
00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:25.288
We will also talk about how you can prepare for your birth.

18
00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:29.779
And what happens when you come to us at birth.

19
00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:34.482
We go through the different stages of the delivery.

20
00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:38.905
The focus will be on the normal delivery process.

21
00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:44.560
But we will also talk a little about when the process deviates from normal.

22
00:01:45.277 --> 00:01:50.114
At the end we talk about pain and pain relief,

23
00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:53.984
Both non -medical and medical.

24
00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:00.944
This is what our entrance looks like.

25
00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:07.715
We are located next to the emergency room and recommend that you take "outside".

26
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.425
That you are not trying to find yourself in the culvert

27
00:02:11.747 --> 00:02:15.035
Without the signs for the birth and the emergency room.

28
00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:17.472
Then you arrive at this door.

29
00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:22.083
Often it is open, so when you arrive you can try to move a little in the door.

30
00:02:22.794 --> 00:02:24.696
Is it open is it just to step in

31
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:28.033
And take the elevator up to plan 12. There we are.

32
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.817
In the evenings, nights and weekends, the door is locked.

33
00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:35.074
Then there is a door phone you can call on

34
00:02:36.893 --> 00:02:40.004
Then we let you in and you go up to level 12.

35
00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:48.520
The blue arrow you see there will illustrate one of our parking lots

36
00:02:48.843 --> 00:02:52.744
Just outside the entrance.
 There you can stand for 30 minutes.

37
00:02:53.171 --> 00:02:54.751
Then you need to move the car.

38
00:02:55.076 --> 00:02:59.320
Either to the parking garage at the northern entrance

39
00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:02.102
Or to the large parking lot at the southern entrance.

40
00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:06.929
The red arrow points to the entrance that was in the picture before.

41
00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:14.769
This is what it looks like when you come to plan 12 and into the department.

42
00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:19.311
Unfortunately there are not always two happy midwives and wait

43
00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:20.624
In the hall, when you come.

44
00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:28.295
But at the frosted glass on the box, the coordinator has its small hold

45
00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:30.712
And she usually sits in the booth.

46
00:03:31.298 --> 00:03:33.792
Unless otherwise our expedition is just inside

47
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:38.406
And we always move around the entrance so we are aware of when you arrive.

48
00:03:42.568 --> 00:03:47.800
When you come to us at birth, you are the focus.

49
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.921
All our work;
 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, is about you.

50
00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:01.436
About you as future parents and about the child.

51
00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:03.554
You are the focus.

52
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:09.446
Around you are a whole team of professional people

53
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.463
where there are mainly midwives you will meet-

54
00:04:16.994 --> 00:04:22.313
nurses.
 We have many very good, experienced nurses-

55
00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:28.935
With us, who gives you good advice and good support.

56
00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:34.971
We have a very professional medical group with us as well.

57
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.983
It is not always possible to see a doctor when giving birth.

58
00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:46.371
Sometimes you meet one or two midwives, no doctor.

59
00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.033
It is perfectly normal.

60
00:04:48.296 --> 00:04:51.321
Sometimes a doctor needs to be switched on

61
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:56.754
To discuss how your childbirth progresses.

62
00:04:58.034 --> 00:05:01.296
There's don't have to be any dangerous or 'danger and travel'

63
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:04.155
Without that, we work in the team at BB Linköping.

64
00:05:05.824 --> 00:05:10.690
Since we are a university hospital, we often have students with us.

65
00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:17.787
Then it is mainly midwife students but also prospective doctors.

66
00:05:18.615 --> 00:05:23.352
These midwife students are all nurses at the bottom

67
00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:28.166
And have usually worked for at least one year in healthcare.

68
00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:29.912
Often longer than that.

69
00:05:32.618 --> 00:05:37.376
We can really strike a blow to have midwife students with them.

70
00:05:37.627 --> 00:05:40.107
There will be another aspect in the whole

71
00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:44.256
And another person who is there just for you, during childbirth.

72
00:05:45.124 --> 00:05:50.628
However, it is always a responsible midwife who makes a decision, together with you.

73
00:05:50.954 --> 00:05:57.410
The medical decisions are made by doctors and midwives.
 Not by students.

74
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:05.185
There are many around you even if they are not visible in the hall, but in the background.

75
00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:11.354
The medical candidates with us go their last semester

76
00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:14.586
before they go out into the actual professional life.

77
00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:19.991
So there are also experienced, future colleagues, you meet.

78
00:06:20.288 --> 00:06:23.112
But of course it is always voluntary.

79
00:06:23.437 --> 00:06:27.424
You have to choose whether you want to bring a student with you or not.

80
00:06:27.737 --> 00:06:30.096
But we can recommend it.

81
00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:35.072
It is usually very appreciated to have a person as support and help

82
00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.126
during his childbirth.

83
00:06:39.447 --> 00:06:42.936
Here you see a picture of how we work in our team,

84
00:06:43.351 --> 00:06:45.313
Outside the delivery room.

85
00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:49.794
In the picture we have a doctor and four midwives.

86
00:06:50.263 --> 00:06:52.778
Sometimes it may be that the birth stops.

87
00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:57.681
Maybe the child has set a little different in the pelvis.

88
00:06:58.486 --> 00:07:01.623
It may be a reason why we need to discuss

89
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.744
How we can move on, how does this child stand.

90
00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:09.888
That we need to share each other's advice, tips and our skills.

91
00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:12.864
This is nothing secret for you

92
00:07:13.114 --> 00:07:17.447
But sometimes it gets a little easier for us to go out of the hall and talk to each other-

93
00:07:18.196 --> 00:07:21.019
then to come in to you and give the suggestion-

94
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.967
How can we continue to work during childbirth.

95
00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:29.199
But as I said: all the time we work together in the department.

96
00:07:29.551 --> 00:07:33.087
Although it is a midwife and a nurse

97
00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:35.158
that is responsible for your birth-

98
00:07:35.353 --> 00:07:38.718
are we all involved in all births-

99
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:41.025
And in several decisions as well.

100
00:07:42.486 --> 00:07:45.921
We will go ahead and talk about how we work at childbirth.

101
00:07:46.554 --> 00:07:49.466
On each workout there is a coordinator.

102
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:57.210
The coordinator is a used midwife who has a supervisory role.

103
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.752
One of her main tasks is to answer the phone when you call.

104
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:07.304
Telephone counseling is a big part of her job.

105
00:08:07.929 --> 00:08:10.855
She has a coordinating feature

106
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.914
and distributes the women who are going to feed-

107
00:08:15.092 --> 00:08:18.653
on the midwives who work on the passport, and the nurses.

108
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.095
Then we collaborate with a number of other clinics.

109
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:31.273
First and foremost, the neonatal department right next to the delivery department.

110
00:08:31.618 --> 00:08:36.313
So we have both physically close there but also a close collaboration with Neo.

111
00:08:37.644 --> 00:08:40.996
It could be a baby as one even before the birth

112
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.257
Know will need to be observed or cared for at NEO after childbirth.

113
00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:50.841
But there may also be children who after childbirth

114
00:08:51.046 --> 00:08:53.533
showing signs that they need some extra care-

115
00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:58.319
or observed, a few hours or day on neo.

116
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:02.933
And the children where one already knows they need to get

117
00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:07.587
Care at Neo.
 It may be children born prematurely for example-

118
00:09:08.112 --> 00:09:11.935
or where one looks at the surveillance during the final stage of the birth-

119
00:09:12.173 --> 00:09:14.215
That here support and assistance will probably be needed.

120
00:09:15.017 --> 00:09:18.085
We call the neoteam as we call it-

121
00:09:19.603 --> 00:09:22.689
in different situations during childbirth.

122
00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:24.680
For example, if it becomes a suction clock

123
00:09:24.973 --> 00:09:29.984
There are always staff from Neo outside the hall, in case they are needed.

124
00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:33.167
Most often they are not needed but can turn around and go from there

125
00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:36.720
When the baby is out.
 But we want them to be in place.

126
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.952
In addition to Neo, we cooperate a lot with the anesthetists.

127
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:46.652
Partly it is those responsible for pain relief or anesthesia

128
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.530
If it would be such as man-

129
00:09:48.707 --> 00:09:52.687
For some reason needs surgery during or after their birth.

130
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:58.906
It is also those who put back anesthesia if you want it when you are going to give birth to your child.

131
00:10:00.447 --> 00:10:03.860
We want you to know that they always do their utmost

132
00:10:04.128 --> 00:10:07.703
to get as fast as possible but sometimes they are busy-

133
00:10:08.238 --> 00:10:13.520
on surgery, IVA or the emergency room.

134
00:10:13.793 --> 00:10:15.750
Then it may take before they arrive.

135
00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:19.252
But their goal is to get as fast as possible.

136
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:26.850
We also collaborate with other hospitals, mainly the Vrinevis Hospital in Norrköping.

137
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.863
It may be that we are full of us or for some reason

138
00:10:32.105 --> 00:10:35.520
Can't receive you, when you call the birth.

139
00:10:36.025 --> 00:10:38.928
Then we sometimes need to refer to another hospital.

140
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:44.535
In the first place, it is Norrköping we refer to because it is closest.

141
00:10:45.993 --> 00:10:50.139
Those in Norrköping have access to your medical records, just like us.

142
00:10:50.594 --> 00:10:58.008
They can read about how your pregnancy has been and if you made any wishes there.

143
00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:04.943
When we refer there, we do it for you.

144
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.641
In order for you to receive the best possible care.

145
00:11:07.955 --> 00:11:10.702
That there should be a midwife, nurse and doctor

146
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.003
Who has the opportunity to receive you and give you support when giving birth to your child.

147
00:11:18.105 --> 00:11:24.045
We know that there is a concern many people carry with them before childbirth.

148
00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:27.135
A concern about being referred to another hospital.

149
00:11:27.455 --> 00:11:31.376
It's not often, but it happens.
 And it will be good anyway.

150
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.192
Collaborates we also do with women's health

151
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.223
when it comes to controls and such during your pregnancy.

152
00:11:43.184 --> 00:11:45.153
Education, it says.

153
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.124
We attend continuous education, we who work as midwives,

154
00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:53.711
Nurses and doctors in the team that Lina talked about.

155
00:11:54.466 --> 00:11:57.718
We have exercises where we train together

156
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.914
in situations that do not arise so often-

157
00:12:01.761 --> 00:12:05.975
But as we need to be good at, be able to act fast, once it happens.

158
00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:13.066
There we have continuous exercises and training situations.

159
00:12:13.657 --> 00:12:18.282
Maybe you want to give some examples of some exercises we have

160
00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:22.563
We train partly on seat deliveries, for example.

161
00:12:22.962 --> 00:12:24.938
It is not very common but it sometimes happens.

162
00:12:25.195 --> 00:12:27.771
Then we get to practice dolls, pelvis and

163
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.399
The various handles used in a seat delivery.

164
00:12:33.415 --> 00:12:36.083
Same with suction clock.
 We also train that.

165
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.879
And children's exercises, where we practice taking care of children who

166
00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:44.930
Not so good at childbirth.
 That needs a little extra-

167
00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:48.245
Breathing support, for example, when they come out.

168
00:12:49.402 --> 00:12:52.880
As Lina said before we are a university hospital

169
00:12:53.492 --> 00:12:58.298
Which means that it is conducted, more or less, always research there.

170
00:12:58.735 --> 00:13:04.344
It may be that you, during your stay, be asked if you want to participate in a study.

171
00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:06.980
You may have already received that question from women's health

172
00:13:07.243 --> 00:13:09.797
And are included in a study already when you come to us.

173
00:13:10.454 --> 00:13:11.729
This is obviously voluntary.

174
00:13:11.986 --> 00:13:16.759
Even if you have accepted a study, you can choose to cancel at any time.

175
00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:29.931
When you call the birth, it is always the coordinator who answers.

176
00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:33.675
It is an experienced midwife who has worked many years

177
00:13:33.909 --> 00:13:35.339
in childbirth care.

178
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:43.082
We work three shifts on childbirth.
 Morning, afternoon, evening or night.

179
00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:47.926
Then you change the coordinator on the three shift.

180
00:13:49.048 --> 00:13:54.059
Many times when you call us you get to talk to the same person.

181
00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:58.513
We feel that you often think it is a security.

182
00:13:58.947 --> 00:14:04.664
You first call maybe eight in the morning and then Sofia answers on the phone

183
00:14:05.468 --> 00:14:09.038
When you call next time at ten o'clock, Sofia will also answer.

184
00:14:09.407 --> 00:14:11.765
Then you don't have to pull your entire story once again

185
00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.823
Without knowing that you are there and what you have talked about before.

186
00:14:16.128 --> 00:14:21.360
Of course, you always record what the discussion has been about.

187
00:14:21.775 --> 00:14:24.991
It may feel a little nice for you to hear the same voice.

188
00:14:25.319 --> 00:14:28.577
It is our experience and the feedback we usually get.

189
00:14:29.929 --> 00:14:32.109
When to call the birth

190
00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:37.658
You should call when you suspect that the birth has started.

191
00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:41.673
For example through pain, if the water has gone or

192
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:47.955
If you get a bleeding.
 Or if you feel insecure about these aspects.

193
00:14:48.356 --> 00:14:52.033
Sometimes, when you expect your first child, it's not always easy to know,

194
00:14:52.407 --> 00:14:54.207
How is it when the water goes

195
00:14:54.757 --> 00:14:56.256
You have not been involved before.

196
00:14:56.553 --> 00:14:58.796
You don't really know how much water it will come.

197
00:14:59.108 --> 00:15:01.433
Or how much is a bleeding

198
00:15:01.756 --> 00:15:07.639
Is it a little pink on the toilet paper or as a menstrual bleeding

199
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.577
Then you call and balls with us.

200
00:15:12.163 --> 00:15:15.969
If one has questions one does not consider as emergency

201
00:15:16.318 --> 00:15:21.775
Without thinking it could wait a bit ...

202
00:15:22.568 --> 00:15:25.815
We understand that it is difficult to decide for you who are sitting there at home

203
00:15:26.237 --> 00:15:30.497
But if you think there is not something that needs to be checked right here and now-

204
00:15:30.843 --> 00:15:34.057
If we are happy to refer you to call women's health.

205
00:15:34.693 --> 00:15:37.021
We know it can be a little difficult to get hold of them.

206
00:15:37.284 --> 00:15:41.975
We also recommend going into "my healthcare contacts" via 1177.

207
00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:46.216
There you can write a message.
 Then the staff at the Women's Health

208
00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:48.587
Reply within a couple of days.

209
00:15:52.861 --> 00:15:58.883
We always want you to call the birth before you arrive.

210
00:15:59.256 --> 00:16:03.128
Even if you feel confident that now the birth has started,

211
00:16:03.422 --> 00:16:07.421
Now I have painful pain, at fairly dense intervals,

212
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:11.487
I feel confident about this.
 Maybe you are a childbirth, have children before.

213
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.847
We still want you to call this phone number

214
00:16:16.486 --> 00:16:19.835
In order for us to receive you in the very best way, when you come.

215
00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:25.830
We want you to receive good care and a nice response.

216
00:16:26.172 --> 00:16:29.413
We increase the conditions for it if we know you are on the way.

217
00:16:31.233 --> 00:16:35.472
The phone number you see here: Feel free to put it in your phones

218
00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:37.373
So that you have it available.

219
00:16:38.347 --> 00:16:40.579
Preparation for childbirth.

220
00:16:40.885 --> 00:16:43.299
How can you prepare for you to give birth to children,

221
00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:45.513
No matter what child in the order it is

222
00:16:46.091 --> 00:16:52.025
We have lined up some different circles about how to do

223
00:16:52.287 --> 00:16:55.239
In order to feel mentally and perhaps physically report-

224
00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:57.264
Before the upcoming birth.

225
00:16:57.764 --> 00:17:02.705
What we think is the most important thing is what is the greatest highlighted:

226
00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:06.120
The parent support we offer you here and now.

227
00:17:06.643 --> 00:17:09.018
Just by listening to Caroline and me today

228
00:17:09.252 --> 00:17:17.142
Have you come a pretty good bit on the "birth preparation road".

229
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:21.566
However, you should not feel that you must know this.

230
00:17:21.807 --> 00:17:25.391
That it is a test, an exam, you should go through.

231
00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:28.805
This is some advice and support.

232
00:17:29.068 --> 00:17:34.700
That there is little in mind about how a birth can go.

233
00:17:36.103 --> 00:17:38.638
A little what might be good to know.

234
00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:43.571
But you should not split up that this is exactly how it will be.

235
00:17:43.841 --> 00:17:46.157
That this is how I should have it

236
00:17:46.434 --> 00:17:50.520
Without having a thought about "How would I wish it will be?"-

237
00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:52.755
but still have an open mind-

238
00:17:53.002 --> 00:17:55.646
About that it may not be exactly as I expected.

239
00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:58.409
It might be something else.
 But it can also be good.

240
00:18:00.102 --> 00:18:03.327
Positive role models, we have also written.

241
00:18:03.804 --> 00:18:10.814
When you are pregnant you often get a lot of stories from loved ones,

242
00:18:11.721 --> 00:18:13.804
workmates and neighbor.

243
00:18:14.109 --> 00:18:17.452
They would like to tell you what it was like when they were going to give birth to children.

244
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.071
Try to sell a little there.

245
00:18:20.943 --> 00:18:24.199
Is it that you get "horror stories"

246
00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:28.599
Is it totally okay to say: No thanks!
 I'm not so interested in listening.

247
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.912
It makes me scared, or worried.

248
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.375
Collect your great experiences instead.
 It strengthens you more than listening to

249
00:18:38.688 --> 00:18:42.996
The single, scary and dramatic stories.

250
00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:46.600
So, positive role models are great.

251
00:18:47.675 --> 00:18:51.121
Packing the bag can be a preparation.

252
00:18:51.536 --> 00:18:54.816
Then you can think: What should I pack what should I have with me?

253
00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:56.583
We don't go into that much on it,

254
00:18:56.825 --> 00:19:00.873
What to bring with you for childbirth.

255
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.536
We will talk a little about food and drink

256
00:19:04.113 --> 00:19:05.690
And such things.

257
00:19:06.168 --> 00:19:08.352
Caroline will go into it.

258
00:19:08.604 --> 00:19:11.102
And the most basic stuff will be there.

259
00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:17.917
Binds to mom, diapers for baby, towel, panties to mom

260
00:19:18.167 --> 00:19:22.545
And night shirt.

261
00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:27.390
It will be there, the most basic.

262
00:19:27.687 --> 00:19:31.360
You can give birth to children without even having a bag, believe me.

263
00:19:33.179 --> 00:19:36.749
Physical preparation.
 What can you do then

264
00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:42.952
You really have to live based on what you feel good about.

265
00:19:43.352 --> 00:19:50.576
Are you a woman who feels good about exercising, run several workouts a week

266
00:19:50.865 --> 00:19:56.135
And feel both physically and mentally good about exercising, then you should do it.

267
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.271
Are you the type that is not so physically active

268
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.996
Do you continue to live as you always do.

269
00:20:05.616 --> 00:20:09.066
It is clear that it is good to keep going during pregnancy

270
00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:10.925
But it is always in life.

271
00:20:11.152 --> 00:20:16.189
Imagine living, based on the way that suits you

272
00:20:16.432 --> 00:20:17.792
And as you feel good about.

273
00:20:18.371 --> 00:20:22.851
Then there are activities you can exercise,

274
00:20:23.152 --> 00:20:24.886
that are pregnancy -related,

275
00:20:25.238 --> 00:20:29.633
For example, pregnancy yoga or water gym for pregnant women.

276
00:20:30.694 --> 00:20:37.069
If you want to do that, it is great, but do what you feel good about.

277
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.151
You will pass this birth

278
00:20:39.463 --> 00:20:43.760
Even if you have not trained four workouts per week during pregnancy.

279
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.000
You have that ability anyway.

280
00:20:48.797 --> 00:20:51.340
The mental preparation.

281
00:20:51.647 --> 00:20:56.968
Allow yourself to go down in turns during the end of pregnancy.

282
00:20:57.234 --> 00:21:02.142
This is totally okay not to “drive on” in life

283
00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:07.128
With 110 percent beer all the time until the day you are going to give birth to children.

284
00:21:09.796 --> 00:21:12.202
"Boa" a little at home.

285
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:19.075
Maybe prepare some food boxes, bed the baby bed ...

286
00:21:19.798 --> 00:21:25.239
Take it easy.
 Get the power and energy for the revolving that will happen.

287
00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:29.785
Both the birth, but above all what comes then.
 To become a parent.

288
00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:33.032
So allow yourself to take it easy.

289
00:21:34.664 --> 00:21:35.956
Social Media.

290
00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:40.566
We are overwhelmed by information in all possible channels.

291
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.928
There we think: Read with critical eyes, choose what you read.

292
00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:54.894
If you move on to different literature, or online: critical thinking

293
00:21:55.345 --> 00:22:02.830
And mainly use materials written by the profession.

294
00:22:03.205 --> 00:22:05.294
There are very nice and good books

295
00:22:05.587 --> 00:22:09.403
Which is written by midwives, and for which we can strike a blow.

296
00:22:11.266 --> 00:22:15.463
If we move on, there is also at 1177,

297
00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:20.626
The care guide, a lot of information about pregnancy and childbirth,

298
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:25.057
Which we can really hit a blow for, so use it.

299
00:22:26.004 --> 00:22:28.748
What happens then when you come in to us at the birth

300
00:22:29.774 --> 00:22:34.376
Whatever you are looking for, if you get into a check

301
00:22:34.715 --> 00:22:39.199
or if the painters have started, or the water gone-

302
00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:42.754
and one has come into an active birth work-

303
00:22:43.236 --> 00:22:47.649
We almost always start taking blood pressure, urine tests and weight.

304
00:22:47.938 --> 00:22:50.680
Just as you have done on women's health during pregnancy

305
00:22:51.056 --> 00:22:52.212
And for the same reason.

306
00:22:53.444 --> 00:22:56.277
Then we also want to switch on a CTG,

307
00:22:56.542 --> 00:23:00.207
a fetal monitoring to see how the baby has it in the stomach

308
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.488
And also how much contractions come.

309
00:23:04.411 --> 00:23:11.015
In the top, a little choppy, curve of the picture you see the baby's heart sound.

310
00:23:11.445 --> 00:23:14.006
The lower, black, with tops and valleys

311
00:23:14.295 --> 00:23:18.634
are contractions that come, disappear and come again.

312
00:23:20.553 --> 00:23:22.938
This is what it looks like when you connect the curve.

313
00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:26.704
The lower box records the baby's heart sound

314
00:23:27.016 --> 00:23:30.490
And the upper detects when the uterus becomes hard.

315
00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:34.333
Then there will be a pressure against the box that is recorded as

316
00:23:34.802 --> 00:23:40.344
A "bun" on the screen.
 We attach them with elastic bands.

317
00:23:40.702 --> 00:23:42.839
The boxes are often allowed to lie with a little while

318
00:23:43.096 --> 00:23:46.625
Or walk around a bit in the room.
 Sitting up usually works too.

319
00:23:46.883 --> 00:23:50.699
But that we get a good first registration of the baby.

320
00:23:50.981 --> 00:23:55.592
They last for about 2030 minutes so we can judge how the baby is doing.

321
00:23:55.998 --> 00:24:00.409
Is it difficult to get in touch with the child, if you want to wander around the room

322
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:05.265
Maybe we need to ask you to be in bed for the first 20-30 minutes.

323
00:24:06.889 --> 00:24:13.132
It is important to point out about surveillance, CTG as it is called

324
00:24:13.399 --> 00:24:16.515
That sometimes we slip a little and say that we should "run a curve".

325
00:24:16.873 --> 00:24:19.943
This means that you do a CTG monitoring on the child.

326
00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:23.705
It is our responsibility, not yours.

327
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.335
That responsibility we take

328
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:30.872
Even when we midwives are not with you, we see this surveillance

329
00:24:31.213 --> 00:24:35.057
At different parts of the birth, so that is our responsibility.

330
00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:39.187
Don't be afraid if surveillance would disappear for short periods.

331
00:24:39.468 --> 00:24:42.926
Then it is often the case that the baby moves, it becomes a little "gap contact".

332
00:24:43.231 --> 00:24:44.762
But, as I said, that is our responsibility.

333
00:24:45.325 --> 00:24:48.640
You have a screen inside the hall that you see all the time.

334
00:24:48.907 --> 00:24:50.492
The one we showed earlier.

335
00:24:51.446 --> 00:24:53.117
But that is our responsibility, absolutely.

336
00:24:55.233 --> 00:24:58.073
Once we have taken these first checks

337
00:24:58.461 --> 00:25:02.585
We usually also want to do a vaginal examination.

338
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:07.864
This means that the midwife feels with her fingers on the uterus.

339
00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:12.451
I thought I would start by telling you about the uterus.

340
00:25:12.705 --> 00:25:14.343
What it is we feel.

341
00:25:16.475 --> 00:25:22.201
At the end of pregnancy, before the woman gets contractions, or the water goes;

342
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.400
Before she starts getting into the delivery work

343
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:31.215
Often the uterus is quite "immature".
 Especially when you are expecting your first child.

344
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.255
This means that it is about three to four centimeters long.

345
00:25:37.018 --> 00:25:41.372
That it is stuck in its consistency.
 A bit like feeling a nose tip.

346
00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:45.481
It is located backward, against the woman's rectum,

347
00:25:45.754 --> 00:25:48.833
So it can be a little difficult for us to reach when we investigate.

348
00:25:49.036 --> 00:25:51.501
It may be that one needs to be in a gyn

349
00:25:51.642 --> 00:25:53.467
or that one needs to put something under the butt-

350
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.040
So you get a different angle on the pelvis and get a little easier.

351
00:25:58.292 --> 00:26:01.329
It's closed.
 It is closed to the baby.

352
00:26:02.713 --> 00:26:05.725
At the end of pregnancy, when the birth begins approaching,

353
00:26:05.933 --> 00:26:09.345
Things start to happen to the uterus.

354
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.724
It begins to soften and gradually shortened.

355
00:26:16.361 --> 00:26:20.635
We look at the picture to at the bottom, where the baby has the head

356
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.579
is that like a little cervix,

357
00:26:26.624 --> 00:26:30.088
that illustrates the uterus.
 It gets shorter and shorter,

358
00:26:30.362 --> 00:26:36.738
is directed more forward, toward the slide opening where the baby is to pass out

359
00:26:37.073 --> 00:26:39.930
And eventually begins to open up.

360
00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:46.105
Inside the uterus, in the "channel", there is often a lot of mucus.

361
00:26:46.372 --> 00:26:48.143
It's the mucus.

362
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.883
It can start dropping a little there at the end.

363
00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.660
It can happen for a few weeks, or a few days, before childbirth.

364
00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.112
There may be a lot of mucus at once or a little at a time.

365
00:27:01.725 --> 00:27:05.730
The mucus itself itself are not very interested in

366
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:09.504
Just because it can release a few weeks before the baby is coming.

367
00:27:10.076 --> 00:27:15.187
You do not need to call for that reason, just in terms of the mucus.

368
00:27:15.654 --> 00:27:20.970
It can be a little blood, a little brownish fresh blood coming.

369
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.529
Once we have done the vaginal examination, known on the uterus,

370
00:27:26.763 --> 00:27:31.013
And together with the other parameters: how you feel, by the way,

371
00:27:31.228 --> 00:27:34.463
How your controls are located, how much pain you have,

372
00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:41.146
How you feel, how you handle the painters we make an assessment.

373
00:27:41.563 --> 00:27:44.928
Partly where you are in your childbirth work

374
00:27:45.444 --> 00:27:49.224
But also if the best for you is to get help with some pain relief-

375
00:27:49.936 --> 00:27:54.115
And go home again.
 Or if you are going to stay, and give birth to children.

376
00:27:57.557 --> 00:28:01.763
It is not entirely unusual, when waiting for your first child

377
00:28:02.012 --> 00:28:06.481
that you get into a check and have to go home again.

378
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:10.065
The birth has not really started but it is difficult to decide for yourself

379
00:28:10.316 --> 00:28:13.496
And it's hard to decide for us, on the phone, too.

380
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:19.367
Don't see it as a defeat.
 The first child is very common.

381
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:24.537
Your time is coming.
 When you will remain at birth.

382
00:28:25.717 --> 00:28:31.556
The latency phase, we will come in now.
 It is the first part of the birth

383
00:28:32.078 --> 00:28:39.418
Where the uterus is "mature".
 It is shortened and it starts to open.

384
00:28:40.239 --> 00:28:42.863
The latency stage can take time.

385
00:28:43.369 --> 00:28:48.448
Like all stages during childbirth, each stage is very individual.

386
00:28:48.859 --> 00:28:52.600
Some women do not know the latency stage very much.

387
00:28:52.877 --> 00:28:55.784
They get a struck a established work fairly

388
00:28:56.036 --> 00:28:59.428
with painful contractions that increase in strength,

389
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.895
While other women have a long latency spoon.

390
00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:06.510
One day, several days.

391
00:29:08.464 --> 00:29:12.274
Some women have a few hours and then come into active work.

392
00:29:12.457 --> 00:29:14.015
So it is very individual.

393
00:29:14.314 --> 00:29:18.090
You should be prepared for it to, and have to take time.

394
00:29:18.608 --> 00:29:21.254
There is no part of the birth we can skip.

395
00:29:21.503 --> 00:29:24.055
It is there, and it needs to be there.

396
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:33.616
During this phase, we recommend that you try to rest, eat and drink.

397
00:29:34.551 --> 00:29:39.167
Do not think that you should "get started" the work, run in stairs.

398
00:29:39.813 --> 00:29:43.275
If you can rest, be in bed or sofa, then you are.

399
00:29:43.577 --> 00:29:48.975
It doesn't feel good to lie down, and you want to go or sit so do it.

400
00:29:49.647 --> 00:29:52.490
Do what feels best in that phase.

401
00:29:54.135 --> 00:30:00.880
Pain relief, in the form of bath, shower or heat pillow

402
00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:06.512
Usually work great in this phase, and even paracetamol,

403
00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:09.554
Alvedon or panodil.

404
00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:12.903
You can take that, based on what is on the packaging.

405
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:14.624
It works great when you are pregnant.

406
00:30:15.775 --> 00:30:21.833
What you need most at this stage is patience.
 Because it may take time.

407
00:30:27.847 --> 00:30:29.649
The active stage:

408
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.517
It is not infrequently as both women and men call us

409
00:30:35.129 --> 00:30:38.462
And asks: I know what stage we are in.

410
00:30:38.645 --> 00:30:42.045
Are we in the latency or active stage

411
00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:46.754
It doesn't matter that much, because we don't always know either.

412
00:30:47.024 --> 00:30:49.375
When it goes from one to the other.

413
00:30:49.665 --> 00:30:55.509
What is important is how to manage the painters at home.

414
00:30:55.796 --> 00:31:00.960
When you can't handle them at home anymore, you should be with us, if you want to.

415
00:31:04.187 --> 00:31:09.067
Each birth takes time, and is unique.

416
00:31:09.578 --> 00:31:13.671
It's nothing strange if the birth takes 24 hours

417
00:31:13.893 --> 00:31:15.993
from the fact that the painters start, until the baby is out-

418
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.688
When you expect your first child.

419
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.604
Just as Caroline said: Patience, Patience, Patience ...

420
00:31:24.948 --> 00:31:29.261
Allow yourself to set aside this time for childbirth.

421
00:31:29.502 --> 00:31:30.991
Don't stress it.

422
00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:35.597
It must take time.
 That's how it is, physiological.

423
00:31:38.197 --> 00:31:42.077
When you are in the latency stage, it can of course be difficult to determine;

424
00:31:42.319 --> 00:31:47.889
Am I in it or not?, at least am the primary rest.

425
00:31:48.233 --> 00:31:52.150
You can't, like Caroline, said "go" a birth.

426
00:31:52.357 --> 00:31:54.993
It is hormones that control not activity.

427
00:31:55.636 --> 00:32:00.602
But as the birth progresses and the painters become denser, denser

428
00:32:00.798 --> 00:32:04.409
and more and more painful one can expect to

429
00:32:04.652 --> 00:32:07.791
that the birth has entered an active stage.

430
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.271
Then there is little difference.

431
00:32:10.529 --> 00:32:17.079
Then it is good to try to get up.
 To be in an upright position from time to time.

432
00:32:17.297 --> 00:32:20.767
To try to move, in a different way.

433
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.040
Many times, at this stage, you are with us at the birth.

434
00:32:25.262 --> 00:32:28.095
Then we can give you support, advice and tips.

435
00:32:28.327 --> 00:32:33.952
Sometimes, even, we have to "whip" you to be more active.

436
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.871
Some women think it is very nice to be able to lie down in bed all the time

437
00:32:38.085 --> 00:32:42.851
And you can do that.
 As long as the birth is moving forward.

438
00:32:43.359 --> 00:32:46.920
But many times you need to be in a little more movement.

439
00:32:47.483 --> 00:32:53.770
We will look at some pictures based on slightly different positions.

440
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.829
We have a colleague who can illustrate it.

441
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.118
Here our colleague sits on a so -called "birth pallet".

442
00:33:02.993 --> 00:33:06.457
When you sit on it you can have your partner,

443
00:33:06.622 --> 00:33:10.065
Or his support person, behind him that you can lean on.

444
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.875
Then you are in an upright position.

445
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.329
The baby is given the opportunity to penetrate the pelvis,

446
00:33:16.582 --> 00:33:20.679
Press the cervix so that it opens more easily.

447
00:33:21.453 --> 00:33:26.791
If you sit then you often have partners close, giving love and closeness

448
00:33:27.062 --> 00:33:33.624
which also releases oxytocin, "vicinity"- and "feed the child hormone"-

449
00:33:33.996 --> 00:33:38.255
Which gives you many times more effective pain.

450
00:33:39.093 --> 00:33:40.264
You can try it.

451
00:33:40.796 --> 00:33:43.072
You can also feed on it.
 -Absolutely.

452
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.777
This is why it is shaped a bit like a horseshoe,

453
00:33:45.976 --> 00:33:48.393
So that the baby can have room to get out there.

454
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.814
Then we have the pilates ball that you can also sit on.

455
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.807
You can sit like this, like our colleague.

456
00:33:57.992 --> 00:34:03.983
You can also sit so that you can lean your hands against the bed for example.

457
00:34:04.293 --> 00:34:07.589
Then you can sit and rest between the painters.

458
00:34:08.992 --> 00:34:12.120
Some think it is a bit wobbly in the beginning when you sit on it.

459
00:34:12.525 --> 00:34:15.732
Then we, or partner, can sit on a chair behind

460
00:34:15.947 --> 00:34:19.472
and hold the hips, to stabilize a little at first-

461
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.287
so that one does not sit and tense —

462
00:34:21.791 --> 00:34:27.855
Without trying to sit with the shoulders far down and be as relaxed as you can in the pelvis.

463
00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:31.087
Feel free to roll with your hips while sitting on the ball.

464
00:34:31.778 --> 00:34:34.534
This is not something you need to remember.

465
00:34:34.844 --> 00:34:40.390
We will help, guide and show you when you are with us.

466
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:48.488
In the next picture we have a "walking table".
 It is usually very popular.

467
00:34:48.906 --> 00:34:54.129
Many who want to stand, think it is nice to have something to rest against.

468
00:34:55.093 --> 00:35:00.072
As you can see, our colleague is steadily standing with both feet in the floor.

469
00:35:01.387 --> 00:35:04.832
Many times when one gets hurt, in other situations in life

470
00:35:05.237 --> 00:35:08.213
If you want to stand on your toes.
 One spans the buttocks,

471
00:35:08.446 --> 00:35:10.952
the abdomen and the whole body.

472
00:35:11.265 --> 00:35:17.332
If you stand with your feet firmly in the floor, you will not be excited.

473
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.611
Feel free

474
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.400
And wiggle your hips even there, just like when sitting on the ball.

475
00:35:26.814 --> 00:35:28.824
Here you can also give birth to children.
 Standing.

476
00:35:29.014 --> 00:35:32.656
If the baby is doing well, and you are doing well, you can stand up and feed.

477
00:35:32.845 --> 00:35:35.359
There is no problem whatsoever.

478
00:35:35.843 --> 00:35:41.200
But we show, and we help you, to vary position.

479
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:44.758
You might start with one, then you take the next ...

480
00:35:45.123 --> 00:35:50.233
... then you go back to the ball.
 You can hold on for hours, change position.

481
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:53.447
Then of course you have to rest as well.

482
00:35:53.674 --> 00:35:58.352
You are not bad because you lie down in bed from time to time.

483
00:35:58.816 --> 00:36:02.103
It should, and can definitely do.

484
00:36:02.468 --> 00:36:08.271
We help you, and alternating positions we think can suit you best.

485
00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:15.374
Then we have a picture of a delivery room.

486
00:36:15.804 --> 00:36:21.169
Here we have canceled all the different tools;

487
00:36:21.366 --> 00:36:24.237
Ball, walking table, delivery pallet, sacco bag.

488
00:36:24.478 --> 00:36:28.456
In the background you see the door to the bathroom.

489
00:36:28.665 --> 00:36:31.698
We have sitting baths in most of our rooms.

490
00:36:33.455 --> 00:36:35.627
This is what a delivery room looks like.

491
00:36:36.416 --> 00:36:40.263
In all rooms there is a shower, even where there is no bathtub.

492
00:36:40.517 --> 00:36:44.031
Possibility of heat and water is available in all rooms.

493
00:36:48.939 --> 00:36:51.511
Breathing and relaxation.

494
00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:55.402
Just like being active during childbirth

495
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:59.199
The relaxation is also very important.

496
00:36:59.465 --> 00:37:03.447
That you try to relax between the painters.

497
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:08.493
You will have more breaks than pain during the entire delivery process.

498
00:37:09.017 --> 00:37:12.466
It can be good to have it as a small mantra.

499
00:37:12.718 --> 00:37:15.098
That when it is tough, think:

500
00:37:15.364 --> 00:37:19.223
"I soon have a break, it is longer than the pain".

501
00:37:19.638 --> 00:37:23.751
That you try to allow yourself to rest.

502
00:37:24.095 --> 00:37:27.903
You may need some support and help from your partner in it:

503
00:37:28.594 --> 00:37:33.093
Now is the break.
 We try to fold down the shoulders.

504
00:37:33.299 --> 00:37:35.724
Exhale the last evil

505
00:37:36.896 --> 00:37:38.890
Cut your eyes.

506
00:37:39.187 --> 00:37:41.897
And go down in turns between the painters.

507
00:37:42.242 --> 00:37:46.707
All this is easier said than done.
 But that you try not to be:

508
00:37:47.036 --> 00:37:50.763
"Now there is a pain ... and it will do a huge pain ...".

509
00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:55.070
That one is not up in turns in between but allows yourself to go down

510
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.287
between the painters.
 We help you with that.

511
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.207
To breathe during childbirth.

512
00:38:02.556 --> 00:38:04.806
We do breathe, whether we want to or not.

513
00:38:05.856 --> 00:38:09.480
Many times you hear: Breathe breath!
 Breathe...

514
00:38:09.702 --> 00:38:12.546
... during childbirth.
 Yes, breathe it we do

515
00:38:12.822 --> 00:38:15.368
But it's a bit about how to breathe.

516
00:38:16.308 --> 00:38:21.111
In the 70s, when I was born, my mother attended a psychoprophylaxis course.

517
00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:24.560
Then they were told to breathe right in the right way during childbirth

518
00:38:24.763 --> 00:38:26.461
Will you feed painlessly.

519
00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:31.076
As a result, quite a few women in the 70s felt unsuccessful.

520
00:38:31.289 --> 00:38:35.953
They felt that: "It did really well, then I must have breathed wrong".

521
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.527
Really we don't say now.

522
00:38:39.441 --> 00:38:43.734
However, breathing is a good tool during childbirth.

523
00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:48.160
To try to breathe with long, deep breaths

524
00:38:48.501 --> 00:38:51.649
in through the nose, out through the mouth.

525
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.774
To try to relax even when it hurts.

526
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.220
Feel free to try it at home.

527
00:39:06.486 --> 00:39:08.886
There is an endless amount of different

528
00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.458
respiratory courses and yoga courses and “Five without fear”-

529
00:39:13.731 --> 00:39:18.206
on the web, which you can take part in.
 See if you find something that fits you-

530
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:24.046
As a tool to be able to face the pain during childbirth.

531
00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.624
Partner Support & amp;
 Strengthen, it says.

532
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:37.535
In the picture we see a woman who is in an active work

533
00:39:37.945 --> 00:39:42.264
and with the help of his partner who both support and strengthen her-

534
00:39:42.726 --> 00:39:46.366
Physically, but also by being there.

535
00:39:46.599 --> 00:39:50.296
Maybe say these words you have trained together before

536
00:39:50.586 --> 00:39:54.683
Help find back to that quiet breathing.

537
00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:59.207
To help to see that now it is rest and not pain.

538
00:39:59.743 --> 00:40:02.976
That you have trained on these things together

539
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:06.033
Can be very useful during the course of childbirth.

540
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:14.628
As far as partners are concerned, many people come to us and do not know what they are expected to do.

541
00:40:15.399 --> 00:40:19.063
One feels powerless that the one you love is in so hurt

542
00:40:19.284 --> 00:40:24.200
and not be able to do anything to relieve.
 But there is a lot you can do.

543
00:40:24.678 --> 00:40:29.200
Partly by just being there, in the room.
 Sit next to, hold a hand ...

544
00:40:29.423 --> 00:40:32.705
... though not holding a hand when it doesn't fit.

545
00:40:34.424 --> 00:40:36.680
It may be to give massage.

546
00:40:37.031 --> 00:40:41.920
Touch and proximity release, as Lina said, oxytocin and makes

547
00:40:42.964 --> 00:40:47.015
The woman's body can cause childbirth to move forward.

548
00:40:51.025 --> 00:40:54.185
Massage can also mean a little less comfortable massage.

549
00:40:54.363 --> 00:41:01.575
That you push in the back or hold pretty hard on the woman's hips

550
00:41:01.732 --> 00:41:05.000
When the painters arrive.
 It can mean very different things.

551
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:12.048
Maybe you put on the playlist that you have done during pregnancy.

552
00:41:12.549 --> 00:41:15.594
Or produce the birth letter that you have written together.

553
00:41:16.344 --> 00:41:20.944
Maybe during some parts of the birth for your woman's action a bit.

554
00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:27.392
If these are questions you have been thinking about at home that she can't handle, or setting

555
00:41:27.731 --> 00:41:31.887
But as you who are at the birth know is important to her.

556
00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:39.233
Energy and diet are also a very important part during childbirth.

557
00:41:39.491 --> 00:41:43.543
Not just during the latency stage when you are at home trying to fill up

558
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.152
with energy and rest, but also during the active part of childbirth.

559
00:41:48.543 --> 00:41:51.224
You have to think a little that it is like a marathon

560
00:41:51.504 --> 00:41:56.366
As you both should perform in different ways, where you need energy.

561
00:41:57.594 --> 00:42:01.888
We have everything with us at childbirth when it comes to the woman.

562
00:42:02.506 --> 00:42:08.962
There is juice, juice, yogurt, smoothies and so on.

563
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:13.832
There is also food if you stay with us

564
00:42:14.153 --> 00:42:17.072
At a stage where food is a good idea.

565
00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:20.632
Often you are not so hungry for meat and potatoes when giving birth to children.

566
00:42:21.946 --> 00:42:25.945
As a partner you need to bring what you want.

567
00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:31.136
Snacks or maybe some food boxes.
 Coffee and tea are with us.

568
00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:36.088
What you need to take with you is what you think you should use

569
00:42:36.404 --> 00:42:40.508
on childbirth.
 It's not so easy to know how long you should be there.

570
00:42:40.905 --> 00:42:46.217
At BB there is no way to heat or store food.

571
00:42:46.705 --> 00:42:52.638
There you get, as a partner or accompanying food and drink, as the woman.

572
00:42:54.178 --> 00:42:57.400
It may change but we mention it so you don't

573
00:42:57.802 --> 00:43:01.637
Bring ten food boxes, which you can throw when you come to us.

574
00:43:04.855 --> 00:43:12.056
So there our family kitchen looks.
 There is micro, fridge and such.

575
00:43:12.329 --> 00:43:14.702
You may of course sit out here and eat if you want

576
00:43:14.929 --> 00:43:19.671
But also bring your food box to your woman and be there.

577
00:43:21.967 --> 00:43:26.504
Now we will quickly jump on to the end of the birth.

578
00:43:27.356 --> 00:43:30.694
It starts at the penetration phase.

579
00:43:30.917 --> 00:43:36.439
It is when the uterus has opened up

580
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:42.765
The more than ten centimeters.
 Then the child's head should penetrate your pelvis.

581
00:43:43.254 --> 00:43:47.503
It is the penetration phase, the final stage of childbirth.

582
00:43:48.449 --> 00:43:52.102
Many times you can think that: Now it is open ten centimeters,

583
00:43:52.343 --> 00:43:55.552
Now comes the child.
 Now it's finished.

584
00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:58.280
It's not always so.

585
00:43:58.972 --> 00:44:01.927
Many times it may be a few hours left

586
00:44:02.141 --> 00:44:05.311
To make the child penetrate your pelvis.

587
00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:09.246
It is perfectly normal.
 Especially when you are expecting your first child.

588
00:44:10.036 --> 00:44:16.100
To get the child to penetrate, you can alternate positions.

589
00:44:17.345 --> 00:44:23.774
The pictures contain a variety of positions you can be in, at this stage.

590
00:44:25.165 --> 00:44:28.383
I will not tell you about every position.

591
00:44:28.602 --> 00:44:33.726
Even there, at the birth, we will give you tips and advice.

592
00:44:35.531 --> 00:44:43.152
These pictures also sit up in all the delivery rooms

593
00:44:44.212 --> 00:44:47.507
With us at BB Linköping, so you can look, if you want it.

594
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:54.536
Do you have a strong desire to be in a special position when the child is born

595
00:44:55.029 --> 00:44:59.310
Do you tell us.
 Then we can help you get there-

596
00:44:59.514 --> 00:45:02.458
At the last stage, when the child really is going out.

597
00:45:04.851 --> 00:45:10.304
However, it is difficult to decide before exactly how you want it.

598
00:45:10.467 --> 00:45:17.868
But if you have a thought and desire, then give it to us, we help you with it.

599
00:45:18.946 --> 00:45:22.808
As long as you feel good and the child is doing well

600
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.821
Can you actually give birth in any position.

601
00:45:26.149 --> 00:45:29.556
It is only the imagination that makes it.

602
00:45:32.518 --> 00:45:37.404
There are infinitely many opportunities to give birth to their child.

603
00:45:40.327 --> 00:45:44.320
The last part of the birth is the crime stage.

604
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:50.440
Some women may feel scared and worried about this last part

605
00:45:51.478 --> 00:45:55.572
But what I want you to bring with you is also that many women-

606
00:45:55.782 --> 00:45:59.150
Think it can be nice in a way.

607
00:45:59.692 --> 00:46:04.207
During the opening phase and the penetration phase

608
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:11.359
Should you deal with every pain.
 One should breathe, try to relax off-

609
00:46:11.925 --> 00:46:15.166
And more receive what happens in the body.

610
00:46:15.561 --> 00:46:18.273
In the coastal phase it becomes a bit in a different way.

611
00:46:18.488 --> 00:46:24.707
You should suddenly start helping, pressing.
 It can be experienced nicely.

612
00:46:25.713 --> 00:46:29.760
You feel that things happen, that the baby is coming further and further down.

613
00:46:31.691 --> 00:46:34.500
It is very different for different women,

614
00:46:34.724 --> 00:46:37.702
How clearly the coastal stage is.

615
00:46:38.062 --> 00:46:43.880
The pressure one feels at the end, that the child's head pushes down, under pain

616
00:46:44.432 --> 00:46:48.214
Become more and more intense, more tangible.

617
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:53.258
Many times it goes into the fact that the woman feels she wants to

618
00:46:53.515 --> 00:46:57.265
help press.
 It becomes like a crystreflex-

619
00:46:57.453 --> 00:46:59.064
which you can't control.

620
00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:07.526
The body takes over a bit.
 You can accompany the reflex.

621
00:47:08.148 --> 00:47:11.064
Just as Lina has said, we are here with you.

622
00:47:11.314 --> 00:47:14.394
You are not alone in the room at this stage,

623
00:47:14.661 --> 00:47:18.080
When the baby is to give birth and the woman starts to cruise.

624
00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.853
We are there to support and guide.

625
00:47:21.132 --> 00:47:24.910
Then applies exactly the same as before during childbirth

626
00:47:25.185 --> 00:47:30.152
That there is always a break after the painters, even in the crime.

627
00:47:30.605 --> 00:47:34.128
It is important to find the rest there, upload for the next pain.

628
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.343
Perineal protection is there.

629
00:47:38.553 --> 00:47:43.424
It is something we practice and keep on all women who are going to give birth.

630
00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.040
We will use either a hot towel

631
00:47:47.246 --> 00:47:50.144
Or a glove that we have filled with hot water.

632
00:47:51.098 --> 00:47:54.070
Many times it is perceived as a little pain relief.

633
00:47:54.301 --> 00:47:57.447
It may be a little easier to dare to press, to cruise

634
00:47:57.663 --> 00:48:01.112
When you have something that resists.
 Don't you like it,

635
00:48:01.446 --> 00:48:04.135
You think it hurts, or is uncomfortable then you tell.

636
00:48:04.336 --> 00:48:07.202
You may want to tell us a little about what perineal protection is

637
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:15.333
When giving birth to children there is a risk of getting bursts

638
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.640
Especially when the baby's head is to be born.

639
00:48:21.061 --> 00:48:25.059
Then the midwife, with one hand over perineum, holds

640
00:48:25.237 --> 00:48:31.346
The middle yard between the anus and the vagina.
 And even a hand on the baby's head

641
00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.391
To be able to feel what pressure the baby will-

642
00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.429
And maybe be able to slow down a little if it goes a little too fast.

643
00:48:38.722 --> 00:48:45.872
It is in the middle yard that the towel or hot glove is placed.

644
00:48:47.944 --> 00:48:52.403
Another part of perineal protection is the communication in the final stage.

645
00:48:52.941 --> 00:48:56.745
That the midwife has a clear communication with the one to give birth

646
00:48:57.489 --> 00:49:02.831
And guides, even with her words, how the woman should handle the last painters.

647
00:49:03.261 --> 00:49:07.715
To press a little gently or may not push at all

648
00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.304
Although that's the only thing you want to do in that spoon-

649
00:49:11.733 --> 00:49:16.006
So that the baby is born, just when the head comes.

650
00:49:17.826 --> 00:49:21.816
Sometimes the head comes out first and then the pain ends.

651
00:49:22.705 --> 00:49:26.255
Then you have to rest, wait for the next pain to come

652
00:49:26.464 --> 00:49:30.542
And the baby is born.
 It is no wonder if it is so.

653
00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:39.245
What also happens in the last part, in the crown phase

654
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.862
is that the woman often cries, cries and thinks that nothing happens

655
00:49:44.029 --> 00:49:46.407
One starts to wonder: do you see any of the head

656
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.963
Often we do not do it at the beginning of the coastal stage.

657
00:49:49.134 --> 00:49:51.087
It takes a little while.

658
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.503
Partly to get the technology, how to print,

659
00:49:54.652 --> 00:49:57.100
But also to dare to press and listen to the body.

660
00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:02.415
But the longer we get in the spoon the more server the midwife

661
00:50:02.551 --> 00:50:04.312
and the nurse the baby's head.

662
00:50:04.992 --> 00:50:10.173
Then they are a little tricky.
 The head slides back a bit between the painters.

663
00:50:10.682 --> 00:50:13.499
There is a purpose for it.
 It should go a little slow.

664
00:50:13.724 --> 00:50:16.219
The tissue should be stretched.

665
00:50:17.865 --> 00:50:21.074
It is not uncommon, when giving birth to your first child,

666
00:50:21.287 --> 00:50:23.410
That it can take one to two hours to cruise.

667
00:50:24.293 --> 00:50:26.312
It is perfectly normal.

668
00:50:26.712 --> 00:50:31.064
It can go faster than that hour but also take longer.

669
00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:35.841
Even in this situation, you may need to change position.

670
00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:39.783
You might start to cruise in some position and feel that I don't get it.

671
00:50:40.007 --> 00:50:41.981
I don't get any power when I lie like this, on the side.

672
00:50:42.215 --> 00:50:45.890
You have to try it out, to the position you enjoy in well

673
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:50.509
and a position where the midwife has good supervision over your middle-yard-

674
00:50:50.978 --> 00:50:53.178
and can help you in the best way.

675
00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:56.442
Something we often get to us too

676
00:50:57.528 --> 00:51:01.076
During both pregnancy and childbirth, when talking about this stage-

677
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.116
is that they are so afraid that stool will come.

678
00:51:06.953 --> 00:51:08.833
It will.

679
00:51:09.388 --> 00:51:13.984
It is the same muscles that control the cruising, in the vagina

680
00:51:14.211 --> 00:51:17.343
Which also controls the cruising when going to the toilet and poop.

681
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:21.263
If you crawl with the vagina, you also crush with the tail.

682
00:51:21.428 --> 00:51:23.041
Then there will be some stool.

683
00:51:23.409 --> 00:51:27.055
We try not to do any big deal.

684
00:51:27.259 --> 00:51:28.651
We wipe it away and throw it.

685
00:51:29.448 --> 00:51:33.496
Try not to think so much about it.
 It will come.

686
00:51:34.605 --> 00:51:38.970
Rather, think it's good.
 If there is a little stool, you crush correctly.

687
00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.342
Then things happen too

688
00:51:41.794 --> 00:51:46.927
The crazy thing you can do is to excite, to try to hold it.

689
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:51.881
Then the baby does not come down either.
 Then you squeeze the baby as well.

690
00:51:54.454 --> 00:51:58.866
Energy can also be a thing in this last stage.

691
00:51:59.512 --> 00:52:03.712
You feel that I will not be able to cruise the child.

692
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.583
Often you have a long work work behind it.

693
00:52:06.762 --> 00:52:09.915
One has run a large part of the "marathon",

694
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.967
Is on the rally and feels pretty end.

695
00:52:13.593 --> 00:52:16.005
We know, from experience, that you can cope.

696
00:52:17.928 --> 00:52:20.836
In some strange way, both the woman and the partner get,

697
00:52:21.034 --> 00:52:24.258
or the relative who is with, energy at the end

698
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.584
Because you know the baby is soon here.

699
00:52:26.928 --> 00:52:29.412
Even then we will help.

700
00:52:29.585 --> 00:52:34.068
Take some juice, a little dextrosol, some juice or whatever it might be

701
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.629
So that you can cope with the last bit.

702
00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:40.657
You as a partner are very important even at this stage.

703
00:52:41.056 --> 00:52:44.175
That you are with your woman in this and pepper her.

704
00:52:44.538 --> 00:52:49.926
That you can cope with this last bit even if you are very tired yourself.

705
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.394
You lift her by saying she's strong,

706
00:52:53.547 --> 00:52:55.390
That she is the best.
 That she can handle this.

707
00:52:55.782 --> 00:52:58.304
You don't help her as much if you say that

708
00:52:58.484 --> 00:53:02.714
You understand that she is very tired, how should you be able to cope?
 I see that you are tired.

709
00:53:03.567 --> 00:53:06.897
Try to turn it around instead, to “Now we're at the end”,

710
00:53:07.132 --> 00:53:09.992
That she can cope, that she can, that you do this together.

711
00:53:10.175 --> 00:53:11.859
That you will soon be able to meet your baby.

712
00:53:12.091 --> 00:53:14.288
Lift her in this

713
00:53:14.548 --> 00:53:15.588
Very important.

714
00:53:17.688 --> 00:53:22.603
After the birth of the child there will happen some things in the room

715
00:53:22.833 --> 00:53:25.935
which we midwives and nurses do.

716
00:53:26.358 --> 00:53:30.744
You may not notice some of the stuff that happens.

717
00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.271
You get the baby up on your chest or stomach

718
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.367
And often has full focus on the little creature.

719
00:53:41.243 --> 00:53:46.616
We have as a routine to take samples in the umbilical cord when the baby is newborn.

720
00:53:47.804 --> 00:53:50.958
The samples can give us important information

721
00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.743
If it is a baby that is a bit taken when it comes out,

722
00:53:54.978 --> 00:53:58.545
Which doesn't really get started screaming and breathing as we wish.

723
00:53:59.063 --> 00:54:02.412
Then the samples tell us how the baby has had

724
00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.680
The last time in the stomach, during childbirth.

725
00:54:05.063 --> 00:54:07.672
It can help us interpret a little

726
00:54:07.993 --> 00:54:11.264
Why the baby doesn't really feel as we wish.

727
00:54:13.562 --> 00:54:15.569
It also stands.

728
00:54:17.038 --> 00:54:20.254
We always practice late naveling,

729
00:54:20.439 --> 00:54:23.752
which means we let the umbilical cord pulse fully

730
00:54:23.898 --> 00:54:24.839
before we cut it.

731
00:54:25.457 --> 00:54:28.786
We always offer the partner, or the one at the birth

732
00:54:29.055 --> 00:54:32.632
to cut the umbilical cord.
 And that's not a must.

733
00:54:32.898 --> 00:54:35.520
If you feel that you do not want, it is totally okay.

734
00:54:35.692 --> 00:54:40.010
Or if the woman wants to cut it herself it goes great.
 Otherwise we do.

735
00:54:42.286 --> 00:54:46.850
Many times it becomes so that the placenta is born

736
00:54:47.013 --> 00:54:49.281
Before we cut the umbilical cord.

737
00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.732
Then we cut the umbilical cord afterwards.

738
00:54:53.967 --> 00:54:56.040
Rupture and suturing.

739
00:54:56.983 --> 00:55:00.591
As we mentioned before, this with perineal protection

740
00:55:01.736 --> 00:55:05.519
If you often break, you get a rupture when giving birth,

741
00:55:05.699 --> 00:55:09.246
Above all, his first child.
 Then it is very common.

742
00:55:09.817 --> 00:55:13.813
We are good at looking for ruptures.

743
00:55:14.477 --> 00:55:16.497
We investigate very carefully afterwards.

744
00:55:16.711 --> 00:55:20.460
Of course one gets anesthesia as a woman

745
00:55:20.648 --> 00:55:22.312
Before we have to investigate-

746
00:55:22.669 --> 00:55:26.240
And even though we need to suture what has been broken.

747
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:28.975
There is a lot of stunning to get.

748
00:55:29.209 --> 00:55:34.144
It is difficult to stun away the fact that we need to be there with our fingers

749
00:55:34.324 --> 00:55:38.325
and investigate afterwards.
 But it should not hurt.

750
00:55:40.501 --> 00:55:45.031
It may also take some time.
 Exactly for the reason that we are careful.

751
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.174
Often we bring in a colleague, so that we assess the rupture together.

752
00:55:48.402 --> 00:55:50.818
It may also be that a doctor comes in and peek.

753
00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:54.555
We use ultrasound sometimes too

754
00:55:55.074 --> 00:55:57.648
To be able to look properly which muscles are-

755
00:55:57.782 --> 00:55:59.890
engaged in the rupture.

756
00:56:00.213 --> 00:56:03.180
Then it can be a bit trixical to sew it yourself.

757
00:56:03.409 --> 00:56:06.933
It can be good to be two midwives to look a little better.

758
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.655
It often takes some time, because we want it to be good.

759
00:56:11.608 --> 00:56:15.048
Then you may not have a lot of patience with it, as a woman.

760
00:56:15.247 --> 00:56:18.751
But it is important that it takes some time and that it will be good.

761
00:56:19.322 --> 00:56:23.238
While we investigate and possibly sew

762
00:56:23.472 --> 00:56:27.528
Located the baby, usually with the mother, on the mother's stomach or breast.

763
00:56:28.058 --> 00:56:29.327
Skin against skin.

764
00:56:30.247 --> 00:56:36.024
We advocate skin to skin even if you have not intended to breastfeed your child

765
00:56:36.208 --> 00:56:39.047
Is it very important to have the baby close, skin against skin.

766
00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:44.127
When they are newborn, there is a lot to learn just when they come out.

767
00:56:44.317 --> 00:56:49.016
They should learn to breathe themselves, keep their blood sugar

768
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.152
And learn to keep warm so that they do not sink in temperature.

769
00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:56.393
And skin against skin promotes this process

770
00:56:56.571 --> 00:56:59.089
Both in terms of breathing, temp and blood sugar.

771
00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:04.899
It also promotes breastfeeding in a very good way.

772
00:57:05.406 --> 00:57:08.955
Is it that you have planned to breastfeed your child

773
00:57:09.111 --> 00:57:12.725
so it might be desirable to get to a first breastfeed-

774
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:15.551
Sometime during the first hours after childbirth.

775
00:57:15.875 --> 00:57:19.840
That the baby may be at the chest.
 Look and lick,

776
00:57:20.033 --> 00:57:22.732
Eventually get a while.
 And start sucking.

777
00:57:23.498 --> 00:57:27.417
Often the babies are spiked for the first few hours after childbirth

778
00:57:27.865 --> 00:57:30.493
then to get a little tired and want to sleep-

779
00:57:30.986 --> 00:57:33.053
Almost most of the first 24 hours.

780
00:57:33.382 --> 00:57:37.705
Not without exception.
 There are always spike babies who do not want to sleep.

781
00:57:38.486 --> 00:57:42.391
But the idea is that you should get a little break and be able to recover.

782
00:57:44.518 --> 00:57:52.480
Skin against skin: it must not be the mother child lies with

783
00:57:53.871 --> 00:57:57.826
There are reasons why the child cannot be with the mother

784
00:57:58.048 --> 00:58:00.838
can it always lie skin to skin of the other parent-

785
00:58:01.053 --> 00:58:03.575
in such cases.
 It also goes great.

786
00:58:03.896 --> 00:58:07.128
Or with the person who is present during childbirth, of course.

787
00:58:07.348 --> 00:58:11.414
Here is a picture of a father who cuts the umbilical cord.

788
00:58:13.759 --> 00:58:19.586
Then comes a target image.
 "Congratulations" you get

789
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:24.949
When the birth is over, the placenta is out-

790
00:58:25.175 --> 00:58:32.761
And a possible rupture is sutured.
 You should land, enjoy and get in your energy.

791
00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:40.127
We move on to some other situations at the birth,

792
00:58:40.332 --> 00:58:44.418
that has nothing to do with the birth.

793
00:58:45.739 --> 00:58:47.896
For example, water discharge.

794
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:53.631
Sometime during childbirth or pregnancy, the water will go.

795
00:58:54.079 --> 00:58:57.721
For some, the water goes far too early in pregnancy.

796
00:58:57.928 --> 00:59:01.015
For some, it is a start to childbirth.

797
00:59:01.352 --> 00:59:03.852
For some, the water goes during childbirth

798
00:59:04.111 --> 00:59:05.770
and for some do not go the water all-

799
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.949
Without the child is born throughout the membranes.

800
00:59:08.172 --> 00:59:10.786
Once the child comes out, take holes in the membranes.

801
00:59:11.036 --> 00:59:13.360
It is very unusual, but it happens.

802
00:59:14.982 --> 00:59:18.453
If the water goes when you are at home, we want you to call us.

803
00:59:19.164 --> 00:59:22.620
It is about half a liter of water you have

804
00:59:23.141 --> 00:59:26.234
And new water is formed all the time.
 So when the water has gone-

805
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.541
Will it continue to run.
 It never gets dry in there.

806
00:59:29.678 --> 00:59:32.247
New water is constantly formed.

807
00:59:34.162 --> 00:59:38.400
We understand that one can be a little unsure whether the water has gone or not,

808
00:59:38.522 --> 00:59:41.832
But many times when the water goes you notice it.

809
00:59:42.035 --> 00:59:45.808
It flows along the legs and often becomes a pool on the floor.

810
00:59:46.012 --> 00:59:47.510
It is so much water.

811
00:59:47.792 --> 00:59:50.521
Imagine you would pour out half a liter of fluid on the floor,

812
00:59:50.705 --> 00:59:53.610
Then you see it.
 Of course, there are exceptions.

813
00:59:54.083 --> 00:59:58.151
Do you feel uncertain about it, or when you think the water has gone

814
00:59:58.329 --> 01:00:02.056
How to call us.
 We set different control questions-

815
01:00:02.533 --> 01:00:04.533
And balls back and forth.

816
01:00:04.943 --> 01:00:08.415
Is it that we find that it is probably the water that has gone,

817
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.653
Everything is perfectly normal and you are in full pregnancy,

818
01:00:12.796 --> 01:00:15.193
that is, after week 37 plus zero

819
01:00:15.718 --> 01:00:20.341
Can you wait up to 14 hours before you get in for control.

820
01:00:21.158 --> 01:00:24.143
Why do we do so why shouldn't you come in at once?

821
01:00:24.674 --> 01:00:27.240
It is therefore that many times when the water has gone

822
01:00:27.501 --> 01:00:31.991
Setting the delivery painting is soon after that.

823
01:00:32.516 --> 01:00:34.109
Not always, but quite often.

824
01:00:34.675 --> 01:00:36.943
Is it then to get into a check

825
01:00:37.102 --> 01:00:40.667
At once after the water has gone, you come to us,

826
01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.800
Make a check and have to go home again.

827
01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:45.640
Just until you get home, the painters may start.

828
01:00:45.997 --> 01:00:47.494
Then you have to go in again.

829
01:00:47.838 --> 01:00:51.526
Therefore, we will say that you can wait up to 14 hours.

830
01:00:51.946 --> 01:00:55.880
You will have a time to get to us on a check.

831
01:00:56.216 --> 01:00:58.783
We check how you and the child feel.

832
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.320
Is it that the water would be discolored in some way,

833
01:01:04.539 --> 01:01:09.520
green or brown or sole blood in it

834
01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:13.111
Then we will take you in for a check earlier.

835
01:01:13.768 --> 01:01:17.554
But "normal colored";
 translucent, light pink

836
01:01:17.773 --> 01:01:21.336
Or apricot colored is perfectly normal.
 Then you can stay at home.

837
01:01:25.174 --> 01:01:30.641
Prematurity is when giving birth to your child prematurely,

838
01:01:30.902 --> 01:01:33.055
before week 37 plus zero.

839
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:40.503
If you get pain before week 37 plus zero, you should be a little faster to call.

840
01:01:41.685 --> 01:01:45.375
Are you are very early in your pregnancy and start to get childbirth pain

841
01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.840
Alternatively that the water has gone we can sometimes be able to stop the birth-

842
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.112
so that the baby is allowed to stay for a while in the stomach-

843
01:01:54.565 --> 01:01:57.298
If we believe it is far too early.

844
01:01:57.784 --> 01:02:01.104
You can be a little faster to call if you feel insecure.

845
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.191
Then we have the opposite relationship, which is a prolonged pregnancy.

846
01:02:06.782 --> 01:02:12.973
This is when you go over week 41 with us.

847
01:02:13.827 --> 01:02:18.834
There are a few different ways of thinking about it.

848
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.612
In Linköping we judge that no women should go so far

849
01:02:24.827 --> 01:02:28.343
Like week 42 plus zero when the child is out.

850
01:02:29.098 --> 01:02:32.170
There are different risk factors you are looking at

851
01:02:32.326 --> 01:02:35.471
Debuging you and your pregnancy, on maternity care-

852
01:02:35.799 --> 01:02:43.049
And judges when is "last day" for you to get started in pain work.

853
01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:46.043
Then maybe you have to start the birth

854
01:02:46.293 --> 01:02:49.223
If you have not started spontaneously before then.

855
01:02:50.477 --> 01:02:54.327
It is something you do with you on maternity care with you.

856
01:02:54.843 --> 01:02:58.490
Some women need to come on an extra visit

857
01:02:58.764 --> 01:03:01.916
To us at the birth, and you get to see a doctor.

858
01:03:02.303 --> 01:03:04.880
It is a so-called "week 41 control"-

859
01:03:05.487 --> 01:03:08.526
where you assess when you can start the birth-

860
01:03:08.636 --> 01:03:12.327
And sometimes you can judge how to start it.

861
01:03:13.172 --> 01:03:15.808
But it is very individual.
 One is allowed to start from

862
01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:18.527
How it's just for you.
 When it is mode.

863
01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.904
We have start -ups at birth every day.

864
01:03:24.949 --> 01:03:28.959
What we want to send with you if it is so that you get started

865
01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:34.311
is to be patient there too.
 Expect several days with us.

866
01:03:34.713 --> 01:03:36.713
We are there and "poke a little on nature".

867
01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.759
Your body has not understood that it will get started with its own pain work.

868
01:03:41.079 --> 01:03:45.475
Then you have to have some patience, to make it understand that now is the time to give birth.

869
01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:50.712
What also becomes, at a start is that the entire latency phase

870
01:03:50.853 --> 01:03:54.162
happens with us at the birth instead of at home,

871
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:58.219
Where you might shower and bathe, wander around a bit and eat and drink.

872
01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.575
You can do that with us instead.

873
01:04:01.282 --> 01:04:05.329
And then it can be experienced even longer than if you had been home.

874
01:04:07.439 --> 01:04:08.912
Turning the child.

875
01:04:09.393 --> 01:04:14.127
Sometimes you have a small kid who chooses to lie down with the tail down

876
01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:18.567
instead of with your head down.
 Then you are offered a turn-

877
01:04:18.748 --> 01:04:21.445
Around week 35, 36.

878
01:04:22.212 --> 01:04:26.422
Then you start by making an ultrasound to see that the child is normal sized

879
01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:30.248
And that the placenta has the features it needs.

880
01:04:30.878 --> 01:04:35.943
Do you see that everything looks normal you have to come to us a definite day

881
01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.575
And you try to get the child to turn.

882
01:04:40.194 --> 01:04:45.348
Then you start with a CTG monitoring, which we talked about before.

883
01:04:46.018 --> 01:04:51.711
You get a cannula in the arm, with drugs that make you relax.

884
01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:56.744
When done, a doctor will try to get the child to

885
01:04:56.926 --> 01:05:03.257
do like a small volt.
 From outside, on your stomach, have their hands-

886
01:05:03.528 --> 01:05:07.681
And get the child to turn.
 From the tail, to the head down.

887
01:05:09.026 --> 01:05:10.839
It should not hurt

888
01:05:11.292 --> 01:05:14.577
But it is clear that it is uncomfortable when you are there and "provokes".

889
01:05:15.807 --> 01:05:18.192
What many women think is very uncomfortable

890
01:05:18.316 --> 01:05:23.057
is that you "pull against the skin" on you, on your stomach.

891
01:05:23.761 --> 01:05:27.952
But it is you who controls.
 If you say stop, now I need a break.

892
01:05:28.187 --> 01:05:30.905
Now I can't do anymore.
 Then it's a stop.

893
01:05:32.025 --> 01:05:37.548
But turns are very common.
 We do that basically every day.

894
01:05:38.343 --> 01:05:42.450
About 60 percent of all turnaround attempts we make, we succeed.

895
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.279
To turn down, from seat to a head.

896
01:05:47.198 --> 01:05:51.402
The times we do not succeed you have two options.

897
01:05:51.533 --> 01:05:54.795
To give birth to his child with planned Caesarean section

898
01:05:55.506 --> 01:05:59.880
Or to give birth to his child in the seat.

899
01:06:00.819 --> 01:06:05.752
Then you also have to make an ultrasound to check the size of the child.

900
01:06:06.319 --> 01:06:09.415
One also makes a pelvic X -ray on you

901
01:06:09.541 --> 01:06:11.887
To see that you have enough pelvic-

902
01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.231
To be able to raise this child.

903
01:06:14.841 --> 01:06:19.447
If you meet these criteria and then get started in pain work,

904
01:06:19.568 --> 01:06:24.552
That you do not get started, there are no increased risks in giving birth to a child in the seat.

905
01:06:26.226 --> 01:06:31.812
However, one should feel safe with it, as a birth.
 It is very important.

906
01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:35.234
But we have good experience of seating.

907
01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.909
Otherwise, we would not have offered it with us.

908
01:06:39.638 --> 01:06:42.176
So you can do that, in such cases.

909
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:44.928
Otherwise, it will be a planned caesarean section.

910
01:06:45.148 --> 01:06:48.912
In Östergötland, all planned caesarean sections are carried out in Norrköping.

911
01:06:49.545 --> 01:06:52.951
We must go into deviating birth process.

912
01:06:53.612 --> 01:06:59.652
Suction clock, it stands at the top.
 Surely most people have heard of this.

913
01:07:00.573 --> 01:07:02.093
It can feel a little scary.

914
01:07:03.084 --> 01:07:07.393
Many women, and partners, express a certain fear of suction clock.

915
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:16.681
In some cases a suction clock is needed, it is an aid we can take to

916
01:07:17.735 --> 01:07:20.040
to help the baby to be born.

917
01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:23.335
We see a suction clock in the picture.

918
01:07:23.926 --> 01:07:26.719
It's like a small suction.

919
01:07:27.205 --> 01:07:29.790
One creates a vacuum using a small device

920
01:07:30.017 --> 01:07:35.165
that is rolled into the room.
 You attach the cup to the baby's head.

921
01:07:36.558 --> 01:07:42.446
In order to use a suction clock, the cervix needs to be completely open.

922
01:07:42.722 --> 01:07:46.536
The baby needs to have come down the last bit in the birth canal

923
01:07:46.846 --> 01:07:49.446
And have set up, in a good way.

924
01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:55.659
It is also the case that the woman needs to help cruise.

925
01:07:55.824 --> 01:07:59.326
It's not just that we come and pull out the baby.

926
01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:03.572
When the woman has a pain, she cries just as before.

927
01:08:04.196 --> 01:08:08.063
A doctor helps with the suction clock,

928
01:08:08.359 --> 01:08:12.652
Pulls it, and helps the baby a little further.

929
01:08:13.976 --> 01:08:17.538
The reason why a suction clock may be needed

930
01:08:17.858 --> 01:08:22.192
may be that the uterus who worked for many, many hours-

931
01:08:22.318 --> 01:08:27.644
starting to get tired, the woman is tired, the painters are not that effective-

932
01:08:27.849 --> 01:08:31.295
which we believe they need to be.

933
01:08:31.469 --> 01:08:38.325
But the baby seems to be doing well in there.
 It is the uterus who can't really cope.

934
01:08:38.457 --> 01:08:40.477
Then you may need to help with a suction clock.

935
01:08:41.143 --> 01:08:44.332
It may also be that the baby signals

936
01:08:44.458 --> 01:08:48.781
With the help of the CTG with which we monitor the child, and interpret,

937
01:08:49.216 --> 01:08:53.107
or with the help of blood tests that we can take from the baby's head

938
01:08:54.354 --> 01:08:57.827
That it feels bad in the stomach and needs to come out.

939
01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:02.575
We then judge that the mother cannot cruise the child

940
01:09:03.845 --> 01:09:09.008
As fast as the child needs to be born, you can take the help of a suction clock.

941
01:09:10.176 --> 01:09:14.725
Of course, you get information in the meantime, and before this.

942
01:09:14.868 --> 01:09:16.907
We talk about it afterwards too.

943
01:09:17.509 --> 01:09:20.707
But important to know is that the woman is active in this process,

944
01:09:20.876 --> 01:09:23.141
Am himself with and crawl out his child.

945
01:09:23.525 --> 01:09:28.246
Many times you can help the baby down, almost all the way out.

946
01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:33.344
Then you can let go of the clock and the mother is allowed to cruise the child the last bit.

947
01:09:34.864 --> 01:09:39.533
Good to know is that there is always an extra midwife in the room

948
01:09:40.107 --> 01:09:43.978
In this situation, and maybe more staff otherwise.

949
01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.766
Maybe a nurse.
 So there may be some more people in the room

950
01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:50.411
Just when putting the suction clock.

951
01:09:51.138 --> 01:09:53.440
As we said earlier we always call

952
01:09:53.767 --> 01:09:58.217
to the neonatal staff, a pediatrician, nurse and nurse.

953
01:09:58.396 --> 01:10:02.161
Staff from Neo are always in our children's room nearby

954
01:10:02.768 --> 01:10:05.105
If they had to help the baby a little.

955
01:10:07.055 --> 01:10:08.395
Something else about suction clock

956
01:10:08.873 --> 01:10:12.467
No.
 I think you got what we want.

957
01:10:12.817 --> 01:10:14.392
Sphincter rupture.

958
01:10:15.371 --> 01:10:20.543
An Sphincter rupture means that the woman has received a

959
01:10:20.656 --> 01:10:26.096
that engages someone, or both, of the rectum muscles, the Sfinktrar-

960
01:10:26.364 --> 01:10:28.560
As we have, around the rectum.

961
01:10:29.046 --> 01:10:33.348
There is an external sphincter that we call external sphincter.

962
01:10:33.505 --> 01:10:36.577
Then there is an internal, internal, sphincter muscle.

963
01:10:37.616 --> 01:10:39.656
When giving birth to children and gets a greater rupture

964
01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:45.759
Could it be that either, or both, these muscles break.

965
01:10:46.322 --> 01:10:49.155
Partly, or completely, when you give birth to children.

966
01:10:50.072 --> 01:10:54.608
Should it occur, it is a doctor who sews the ruptures.

967
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:56.407
It is done on surgery.

968
01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.083
Often the woman is anesthetized for a while or gets some kind of pain relief

969
01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:08.328
And maybe get a little sedated, so this should be manageable for you.

970
01:11:09.378 --> 01:11:12.750
The good thing about sewing the ruptures and that they are sewn on surgery

971
01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:18.009
is that there are better conditions for the person who is going to sew the rupture.

972
01:11:18.557 --> 01:11:23.112
Good lighting, and operating staff who can help.

973
01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:28.355
And better opportunity for pain relief and anesthesia for you.

974
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.244
Have you received a greater rupture when giving birth to children

975
01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.241
You are followed up more carefully even after childbirth.

976
01:11:36.758 --> 01:11:40.213
Of course, you get information at the birth and BB.

977
01:11:40.944 --> 01:11:43.033
Both in writing and orally.

978
01:11:43.462 --> 01:11:46.607
You will also be followed during the first year after childbirth

979
01:11:46.964 --> 01:11:49.807
To see how the rupture heals and how you feel.

980
01:11:51.199 --> 01:11:52.434
Bleeding.

981
01:11:53.095 --> 01:11:57.264
All women who give birth to children bleed, more or less.

982
01:11:58.686 --> 01:12:03.935
Up to a liter we think is a normal bleeding.

983
01:12:04.326 --> 01:12:08.272
It does not mean that we are waiting until it has soaked a liter.

984
01:12:08.412 --> 01:12:11.870
Notices the midwife that it bleeds on a little

985
01:12:11.972 --> 01:12:16.016
There are different things we do to try to stop the bleeding.

986
01:12:18.318 --> 01:12:21.929
A liter of extra blood approximately, based on how big one is,

987
01:12:22.079 --> 01:12:25.112
you gather during pregnancy to be able to ha-

988
01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.951
Reserves to be able to bleed when giving birth to children.

989
01:12:30.521 --> 01:12:34.532
If one suffers a large bleeding,

990
01:12:34.755 --> 01:12:41.106
it may siva at a slow pace but if it eventually becomes a larger amount

991
01:12:41.565 --> 01:12:44.455
Are there drugs we can give.

992
01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:48.032
We also need to squeeze and press your uterus,

993
01:12:48.196 --> 01:12:51.263
Feel that it contracts properly after childbirth.

994
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:55.943
More people can also come into the room and help.

995
01:12:56.498 --> 01:12:59.650
They give drugs and squeeze on the stomach.

996
01:13:00.457 --> 01:13:05.532
In some cases, the woman is bleeding very and fast after childbirth.

997
01:13:05.962 --> 01:13:08.864
Then there are always a lot of people in the room.

998
01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:13.544
In such situations we have no opportunity to inform you there and then

999
01:13:13.692 --> 01:13:15.434
What happens and what we do.

1000
01:13:15.793 --> 01:13:18.711
It is such a situation that we talked about earlier,

1001
01:13:18.914 --> 01:13:20.790
which we practice and practice before.

1002
01:13:21.002 --> 01:13:23.595
We have to act fast to stop the bleeding.

1003
01:13:25.516 --> 01:13:29.286
There are a few different reasons for bleeding after childbirth.

1004
01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:32.280
It may be that the placenta does not come off.

1005
01:13:32.436 --> 01:13:36.598
We get into it, that the placenta does not release

1006
01:13:36.988 --> 01:13:39.805
And that the uterus then cannot contract properly.

1007
01:13:40.423 --> 01:13:43.010
There may be other reasons why the uterus is not really

1008
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.982
Man can contract after childbirth.

1009
01:13:45.483 --> 01:13:52.073
It may be a rupture you have received, a vessel that has broken, which bleeds.

1010
01:13:53.348 --> 01:13:54.913
It can be difficult to stop.

1011
01:13:57.425 --> 01:13:59.593
When the placenta does not loosen:

1012
01:14:00.986 --> 01:14:06.188
What we do to get it out is to help with oxytocin,

1013
01:14:06.338 --> 01:14:10.240
The hormone one has had full of in the body during childbirth

1014
01:14:10.357 --> 01:14:12.984
And still rushing around the body when giving birth to children.

1015
01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.668
But you may need some extra oxytocin to help the placenta to release,

1016
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:21.247
And the uterus to contract, to reduce the risk of a large bleeding.

1017
01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:24.992
Is it that it is difficult to get out the placenta

1018
01:14:25.089 --> 01:14:28.121
Do we have some tips and tricks to add.

1019
01:14:28.275 --> 01:14:30.912
One can gently pull a little in the umbilical cord

1020
01:14:31.064 --> 01:14:34.167
And hold over your stomach to lead out the placenta.

1021
01:14:35.144 --> 01:14:38.127
But does not work it you need to go to surgery

1022
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:40.775
And get help taking out the placenta.

1023
01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:48.975
Then a obstetrician does it, through the vagina.

1024
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:54.327
So it is not something you cut out through the stomach, but through the vagina.

1025
01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:56.466
Then you get anesthetized for a while.

1026
01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:02.585
One could technically do it at a delivery room,

1027
01:15:02.809 --> 01:15:06.887
But it is too painful.
 You need to be anesthetized.

1028
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.865
That is why you come over to surgery.

1029
01:15:10.946 --> 01:15:14.871
It can go a bit quickly.
 You feel that now it is a bit in a hurry.

1030
01:15:15.232 --> 01:15:19.360
Even if it does not bleed, there is an increased risk of it starting to do so

1031
01:15:19.588 --> 01:15:20.789
If the placenta is stuck.

1032
01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.640
Often it goes to surgery fairly quickly once the decision is made.

1033
01:15:26.776 --> 01:15:30.511
It's not after a few hours.

1034
01:15:31.642 --> 01:15:33.592
Children who feel bad at birth.

1035
01:15:33.944 --> 01:15:38.096
Sometimes we have seen, via the CTG or lactate,

1036
01:15:38.235 --> 01:15:40.559
Once you have taken a sample of the baby and seen that it

1037
01:15:40.965 --> 01:15:45.792
Shows signs of a little oxygen deficiency in the last stage of childbirth.

1038
01:15:46.825 --> 01:15:52.535
Then we can take the help of a suction clock for the baby to be born a little faster.

1039
01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:56.992
Then we always take the help of the neo staff who are in place.

1040
01:15:57.945 --> 01:16:03.344
What happens inside the hall is that the one who has been your responsible midwife

1041
01:16:03.431 --> 01:16:08.640
During childbirth always stays with the woman who has given birth, inside the hall.

1042
01:16:08.752 --> 01:16:11.815
There will be another midwife and helps the baby out

1043
01:16:12.615 --> 01:16:17.200
to a "children's table", children's room, which we have with us at birth.

1044
01:16:17.898 --> 01:16:22.007
There will be a picture here on the child's table itself

1045
01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:28.893
With all the equipment around.
 The staff is from the neonatal department.

1046
01:16:31.776 --> 01:16:33.976
Neo, as I said, is wall to wall with us.

1047
01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:36.825
They are quickly in place about a baby

1048
01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:40.358
Need some extra support and care after childbirth.

1049
01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:47.375
We would like partners or relatives to accompany the baby out

1050
01:16:47.946 --> 01:16:53.763
And is with the baby at the children's table while staff stay with the mother.

1051
01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.766
Many times when you need to take the baby out to the team that stands waiting for

1052
01:17:00.181 --> 01:17:05.088
Will the baby return to the birth mother pretty soon.

1053
01:17:05.973 --> 01:17:11.434
Only everything has stabilized.
 It is by far the most common.

1054
01:17:12.906 --> 01:17:17.469
Sometimes they already scream on the way out but one may still want to go out

1055
01:17:17.602 --> 01:17:22.552
And observe the baby for a short while, then go back to mom.

1056
01:17:25.759 --> 01:17:29.125
There are other birth proceedings as well

1057
01:17:29.247 --> 01:17:33.814
which abandon the most common, the most normal.

1058
01:17:34.393 --> 01:17:36.049
Settlement.

1059
01:17:36.623 --> 01:17:38.804
I went into it a bit before.

1060
01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:44.128
That one must "qualify" in order to give birth to your child in the seat.

1061
01:17:44.762 --> 01:17:49.864
Have you done that, and meet all the criteria we talked about before

1062
01:17:50.044 --> 01:17:51.693
Can you give birth to your child in the seat.

1063
01:17:52.994 --> 01:17:55.775
Once you get started in a birth work

1064
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.080
must the birth proceed normally all the time,

1065
01:18:00.622 --> 01:18:03.669
Because you can't put a suction clock on a seat.

1066
01:18:03.787 --> 01:18:07.160
You can only put a suction clock on a head, not on a tail.

1067
01:18:07.426 --> 01:18:10.975
The birth must move forward as we expect, all the time.

1068
01:18:11.671 --> 01:18:15.663
When it's time to give birth, when one starts to cruise

1069
01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:18.478
Will there be some more people in the hall.

1070
01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:22.348
Just like what we talked about before, when putting a suction clock

1071
01:18:22.443 --> 01:18:24.920
So we call some extra staff.

1072
01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:28.736
It is always a doctor with, and an extra midwife.

1073
01:18:28.939 --> 01:18:30.988
Possibly an extra nurse.

1074
01:18:31.309 --> 01:18:35.630
But we try to keep the environment calm and sensed

1075
01:18:36.138 --> 01:18:39.375
So that it should be as calm and safe for you as we can.

1076
01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.112
But a little more staff is required.

1077
01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.567
It is the same in twin delivery.

1078
01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.166
In case of triple loss, when waiting for three children

1079
01:18:50.464 --> 01:18:52.864
You give birth with the help of Caesarean section.

1080
01:18:53.658 --> 01:18:59.175
It is not possible to keep track of all three, during a work work.

1081
01:18:59.405 --> 01:19:03.502
Who has these heart sounds and who has these?
 And these?

1082
01:19:04.032 --> 01:19:08.203
We believe that it is safer to give birth to Caesarean section.

1083
01:19:09.626 --> 01:19:12.847
Twin delivery, where you can give birth vaginally.

1084
01:19:13.651 --> 01:19:16.815
A little depending on how the children are placed in the stomach.

1085
01:19:17.264 --> 01:19:22.855
Whether they lie with head or tail downwards, or across.

1086
01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:28.333
It is an individual assessment with the help of ultrasound and maternal care.

1087
01:19:30.276 --> 01:19:35.255
But even there, when the children are to come out and one starts to cruise

1088
01:19:35.573 --> 01:19:41.456
there will be more people inside the hall, such as at a suction clock or seat.

1089
01:19:43.319 --> 01:19:48.051
Sometimes the birth must be terminated with the help of Caesarean section.

1090
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.752
It is for the reasons that Caroline talked about,

1091
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:57.142
With suction clock.
 Either it is that mom or child is not feeling well

1092
01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:02.735
Or that the birth does not go forward.
 It has stalled.

1093
01:20:03.108 --> 01:20:05.843
Then you have to end it in one way or another.

1094
01:20:06.688 --> 01:20:10.935
There are three different types of caesarean sections.

1095
01:20:11.132 --> 01:20:14.514
One is planned, when one knows that

1096
01:20:14.675 --> 01:20:17.167
This mother should give birth to her child with the help of Caesarean section.

1097
01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.054
They usually happen in Norrköping, as we said.

1098
01:20:20.901 --> 01:20:23.306
Then there is acute caesarean section.

1099
01:20:23.453 --> 01:20:27.311
Most caesarean sections are really that happen to us.

1100
01:20:27.582 --> 01:20:30.360
And that is when you are in an active birth work

1101
01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:35.655
and one must end the birth, during an active birth work-

1102
01:20:36.208 --> 01:20:37.965
And that you then end with Caesarean section.

1103
01:20:38.497 --> 01:20:40.792
It sounds pretty dramatic when saying urgently

1104
01:20:40.933 --> 01:20:44.791
But it may be that it is judged that the birth should end in two hours.

1105
01:20:46.143 --> 01:20:49.607
Then there is the last, immediately Caesarean section.

1106
01:20:49.889 --> 01:20:52.995
You must have the baby out now.

1107
01:20:54.214 --> 01:20:56.512
Then you want it to go really fast.

1108
01:20:56.669 --> 01:21:00.175
That the baby should be out within ten minutes.
 And then it goes away.

1109
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.252
The caesarean sections do not take place at the birth.

1110
01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.327
They take place in the operating department, which is wall to wall with us.

1111
01:21:10.371 --> 01:21:13.143
It is quick to move over there.

1112
01:21:13.628 --> 01:21:16.400
When you get there, there is a lot of staff there too.

1113
01:21:17.166 --> 01:21:21.861
It is one, or usually two, obstetricians, midwives,

1114
01:21:22.237 --> 01:21:25.728
nurse from the birth, pediatrician team

1115
01:21:25.963 --> 01:21:29.735
and the entire operation team with operating nurses,

1116
01:21:30.001 --> 01:21:36.369
Anesthetist, anesthesia nurses.
 So there are a lot of people in there.

1117
01:21:36.938 --> 01:21:39.202
You should not be afraid of that.
 It is a security.

1118
01:21:39.366 --> 01:21:44.805
Everyone has their own specific, extremely important, tasks.

1119
01:21:45.119 --> 01:21:50.161
The tasks are to make it safe, safe and good for you.

1120
01:21:53.429 --> 01:21:56.484
Here, too, we are careful to try to give you

1121
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.680
As much information as we can.

1122
01:21:59.079 --> 01:22:05.922
In the extremely acute situations, the information can fall a bit.

1123
01:22:08.195 --> 01:22:11.272
We have to do what we do, practically.

1124
01:22:11.671 --> 01:22:15.432
But we have a very important task.
 It is to catch you afterwards

1125
01:22:15.543 --> 01:22:18.641
And explain many, many times what happened.

1126
01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:20.516
And why happened

1127
01:22:21.366 --> 01:22:28.144
We catch you up, in the occasional occasions we don't really have time for the information

1128
01:22:30.056 --> 01:22:34.019
Then we have come to the last part of the lecture,

1129
01:22:34.168 --> 01:22:36.822
Which will be about pain relief.

1130
01:22:37.938 --> 01:22:43.552
I will start by reading a text written by Gudrun Abascal, about pain:

1131
01:22:44.586 --> 01:22:47.975
"Birth pain can be seen as an expression of the body's knowledge".

1132
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:50.167
"It tells us what is going on in the body"

1133
01:22:50.293 --> 01:22:53.415
"and tells us that something meaningful is happening".

1134
01:22:53.839 --> 01:22:55.519
"A child is to be born".

1135
01:22:57.736 --> 01:23:03.046
Just as this text describes, it hurts to give birth to children.

1136
01:23:03.466 --> 01:23:07.070
The pain is there, and is part of giving birth to children.

1137
01:23:07.374 --> 01:23:08.374
And that's an important part.

1138
01:23:09.349 --> 01:23:13.656
Just as the text describes, something is happening in the body.

1139
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:16.738
It gives us a warning that now there is something going on.

1140
01:23:18.178 --> 01:23:24.105
One of the purposes may be to get to a safe and secure place

1141
01:23:24.286 --> 01:23:25.720
when giving birth to your child.

1142
01:23:25.915 --> 01:23:30.056
You should not hux flux give birth to children at ICA Maxi's parking.

1143
01:23:30.208 --> 01:23:32.519
It wouldn't have been good for her mother or baby.

1144
01:23:33.049 --> 01:23:36.752
This shows to us that something important is happening.

1145
01:23:39.112 --> 01:23:44.055
The pain;
 It is important that you think that it is not dangerous.

1146
01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:50.348
It will not hurt you or your baby, but it is there.

1147
01:23:53.435 --> 01:23:58.907
What we can do is relieve the pain but we can't remove it

1148
01:23:59.049 --> 01:24:02.760
Or the fact that you feel something is happening in your body.

1149
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.640
That it presses, sore or molar.

1150
01:24:07.891 --> 01:24:10.643
Although there is much we can do to relieve.

1151
01:24:11.456 --> 01:24:14.522
It is important to know, as Lina has said before,

1152
01:24:14.685 --> 01:24:20.251
That there is always a break, and it will be longer than the pain.

1153
01:24:21.123 --> 01:24:24.405
When you have the worst, you know that soon the pain with you.

1154
01:24:24.628 --> 01:24:25.628
There will be a break.

1155
01:24:26.175 --> 01:24:30.248
Trying to find, and "catch", the break we will help you with.

1156
01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:34.511
And catch you back in the rest between the painters.

1157
01:24:35.874 --> 01:24:39.553
The painting pain is a transient pain.

1158
01:24:39.834 --> 01:24:42.064
It goes over when the baby is out.

1159
01:24:42.557 --> 01:24:45.421
Then you can be tender and tired

1160
01:24:46.063 --> 01:24:49.405
But the very pain of the body working,

1161
01:24:49.572 --> 01:24:54.680
and the delivery pain from pain disappears when the baby comes out

1162
01:24:55.605 --> 01:24:57.218
Pain relief, as I said.

1163
01:24:57.323 --> 01:25:00.344
There are things we can do to relieve the pain

1164
01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:01.826
And as you can do at home.

1165
01:25:02.778 --> 01:25:08.645
Tactile massage we have talked a little about, touch and release of hormones.

1166
01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.840
It may be the pressure on the hips that we talked about

1167
01:25:14.981 --> 01:25:18.319
Which can feel nice in some stages of childbirth.

1168
01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:25.191
Tens, it says.
 You have probably heard of that.

1169
01:25:25.322 --> 01:25:29.761
It is a tool one can use in other pain conditions,

1170
01:25:29.883 --> 01:25:31.234
Not just when giving birth to children.

1171
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:34.747
It stands for "Transutan electrical nerve stimulation".

1172
01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:41.975
This device can advantageously be used if you have pain especially in the back.

1173
01:25:42.086 --> 01:25:43.617
Far down in the lumbar spine.

1174
01:25:44.179 --> 01:25:47.541
We do not recommend that you put the plates on your stomach

1175
01:25:48.745 --> 01:25:50.390
Without using them on their backs.

1176
01:25:51.046 --> 01:25:56.120
For those of you who don't know, a tendon is connected to two tiles-

1177
01:25:56.218 --> 01:25:58.839
As you attach where the pain is located.

1178
01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:07.497
Then the "nerve stimulation" is sent that blocks the brain's pain receptors.

1179
01:26:07.935 --> 01:26:09.822
It can have a pain -relieving effect.

1180
01:26:10.494 --> 01:26:14.409
Tens can work best in the latency stage

1181
01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.701
or at the beginning of the active stage in childbirth.

1182
01:26:19.915 --> 01:26:22.985
We have a tendon with us that you are very happy to borrow-

1183
01:26:23.267 --> 01:26:25.087
If you are interested in this.

1184
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.638
It can be a little tricky if you

1185
01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:30.774
Never seen a TENS apparatus before, to get the technology.

1186
01:26:31.074 --> 01:26:34.563
Are you a little interested in tens, or have tried it before

1187
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.461
and seemed to have worked well-

1188
01:26:37.538 --> 01:26:40.719
So we recommend that you rent an apparatus during pregnancy-

1189
01:26:40.834 --> 01:26:43.826
So that you can look and fiddle a little with it before.

1190
01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.957
And also have the opportunity to use it in the latency stage,

1191
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:52.463
If you are at home at that stage, to get the greatest effect of it.

1192
01:26:53.787 --> 01:27:00.300
Sterile quads are a somewhat disputed pain relief method.

1193
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.798
Some women think it works great.

1194
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:05.533
And some women cannot imagine

1195
01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.666
How to want more pain when you already have pain.

1196
01:27:09.086 --> 01:27:12.464
It hurts quite to get the sterile quad.

1197
01:27:13.011 --> 01:27:16.901
This means that you inject some sterile water

1198
01:27:17.096 --> 01:27:21.422
Just below the skin, where you have the most pain.

1199
01:27:21.821 --> 01:27:26.253
It can be on the back, stomach or down towards the groin;

1200
01:27:26.397 --> 01:27:29.280
A pain that does not really let go of between the painters.

1201
01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:31.854
Then it can work well with sterile quads.

1202
01:27:32.587 --> 01:27:36.611
We are usually two midwives who put these at the same time

1203
01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:40.055
And we do it when the woman has a pain.

1204
01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.566
Often in four places, we inject some water.

1205
01:27:45.011 --> 01:27:48.476
This can work great a few hours

1206
01:27:48.610 --> 01:27:54.094
Then you may need to fill up, because the body absorbs the sterile water.

1207
01:27:55.662 --> 01:28:00.766
We have talked about warmth, and shower and bath.

1208
01:28:01.212 --> 01:28:02.671
Curaax, it says.

1209
01:28:03.747 --> 01:28:06.895
There are heat pads that we have at birth;

1210
01:28:07.183 --> 01:28:12.390
A pillow we fill with water.
 It becomes like a jelly -like mass in.

1211
01:28:12.539 --> 01:28:14.705
It can be heated several times in the microwave.

1212
01:28:15.521 --> 01:28:17.254
Ask us very well.

1213
01:28:17.837 --> 01:28:19.800
You can never ask for that many times

1214
01:28:19.909 --> 01:28:22.581
Without asking us, if you want that pillow heated.

1215
01:28:23.152 --> 01:28:28.184
You can advantageously use your own heat pads and rice bags at home

1216
01:28:28.599 --> 01:28:32.852
During the latency phase, but you do not have to bring them to the birth.

1217
01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:37.054
For hygiene reasons, we cannot warm them with us.

1218
01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:41.082
Save them at home and you will get a heat pillow with us when you arrive.

1219
01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.106
Water delivery, it is at the bottom.

1220
01:28:46.606 --> 01:28:51.384
We are happy to assist in water delivery with us.

1221
01:28:51.598 --> 01:28:57.353
Unfortunately the bathtub we have not so adapted to give birth to children in

1222
01:28:57.534 --> 01:29:01.809
So it is not recommended, if it doesn't just happen to be so.

1223
01:29:02.341 --> 01:29:05.183
But if you are interested in water delivery

1224
01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:09.053
So talk to your midwife at the Women's Health around this-

1225
01:29:09.144 --> 01:29:12.009
and get information about how you can go about

1226
01:29:12.153 --> 01:29:14.552
To rent a pool.
 That's what one can do,

1227
01:29:14.703 --> 01:29:17.176
Rent a pool and take us with us.

1228
01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:20.992
Then we more than happy at the birth itself

1229
01:29:21.154 --> 01:29:22.734
in water, if you wish.

1230
01:29:23.098 --> 01:29:29.743
There are also some criteria we want you to fulfill

1231
01:29:30.758 --> 01:29:35.047
For it to be judged to be safe with a delivery in water.

1232
01:29:35.641 --> 01:29:39.832
You will also talk about that, with your midwife.

1233
01:29:43.427 --> 01:29:47.035
Then we move on, to the medical pain relief.

1234
01:29:48.265 --> 01:29:54.295
The foundation can be paracetamol, ie Panodil, or Alvedon.

1235
01:29:54.518 --> 01:29:56.930
As Caroline talked about before

1236
01:29:57.177 --> 01:30:01.287
you can take it, when you are at home and in the latency stage.

1237
01:30:02.033 --> 01:30:05.561
Then it is a gram every six hours, as it says on the package.

1238
01:30:05.735 --> 01:30:07.743
Just follow the instructions.

1239
01:30:08.170 --> 01:30:13.110
It is great to use at home, so very much like it.

1240
01:30:14.972 --> 01:30:16.666
When you come to us and notice that

1241
01:30:16.775 --> 01:30:19.623
Now this type of pain relief does not help anymore,

1242
01:30:19.712 --> 01:30:22.893
The non -medical that Caroline talked about.

1243
01:30:23.022 --> 01:30:26.765
Or with panodil, one feels this is doing too bad

1244
01:30:26.874 --> 01:30:29.464
And I want something more that can relieve.

1245
01:30:30.146 --> 01:30:34.152
Then you can, for example, start with a tablet called Citodon.

1246
01:30:34.336 --> 01:30:37.855
It's like a mixture between paracetamol, panodil

1247
01:30:38.007 --> 01:30:40.904
And a slightly lighter morphine preparation can be said.

1248
01:30:41.681 --> 01:30:46.048
It is completely harmless if one takes single doses

1249
01:30:46.172 --> 01:30:48.319
during pregnancy or childbirth.

1250
01:30:48.899 --> 01:30:51.120
Only one is absolutely no danger.

1251
01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.815
We have also started more and more with oxynorm

1252
01:30:54.916 --> 01:31:00.207
Like pain relief in the early stage, the latency stage.

1253
01:31:00.566 --> 01:31:03.699
So you can also encounter it if you get into latency phase

1254
01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:05.965
and need some pain relief, that you get a tablet-

1255
01:31:06.442 --> 01:31:12.720
which is a morphine tablet, fast -acting but short -acting.
 It can help.

1256
01:31:13.823 --> 01:31:16.378
It usually works pretty well,

1257
01:31:16.713 --> 01:31:20.631
When you come in to us.
 If one is in the latency stage

1258
01:31:20.801 --> 01:31:23.618
But it is so painful that one is unable to be at home-

1259
01:31:23.773 --> 01:31:28.139
It usually works quite well with citodon or morphine.

1260
01:31:28.303 --> 01:31:31.004
Either in tablet form or as a syringe.

1261
01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:34.607
If you want to get the syringe, you have to stay with us.

1262
01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:38.307
Then you can't go home again but be with us and sleep.

1263
01:31:39.831 --> 01:31:42.944
Nitrous oxide knows a lot of people.

1264
01:31:43.074 --> 01:31:46.927
It is a very common pain relief method.

1265
01:31:48.028 --> 01:31:50.530
I should not say that everyone uses it, because so it is not

1266
01:31:50.633 --> 01:31:54.638
But very many, during childbirth itself.

1267
01:31:55.864 --> 01:32:01.169
The nitrous oxide provides a short -term intoxication.

1268
01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:04.377
You get a little ... happy.

1269
01:32:04.525 --> 01:32:06.744
A little happy, and a little dizzy.

1270
01:32:07.198 --> 01:32:11.528
Some are very afraid to take it because they think they should feel bad.

1271
01:32:11.648 --> 01:32:14.480
Many times it is not the nitrous oxide that you feel bad about.

1272
01:32:14.582 --> 01:32:17.006
It is the delivery work that you feel bad about.

1273
01:32:17.382 --> 01:32:20.091
But one derives it to the nitrous oxide to

1274
01:32:20.781 --> 01:32:24.600
You start with the nitrous oxide because you are at that stage when you still start to feel bad.

1275
01:32:25.858 --> 01:32:28.268
The nitrous oxide can be set to different levels.

1276
01:32:28.417 --> 01:32:29.854
We can raise and lower.

1277
01:32:30.097 --> 01:32:34.434
If you think you get too strong a rush or need a little more.

1278
01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.694
The nitrous oxide is a bit of technology, how to do it.

1279
01:32:40.975 --> 01:32:42.630
We will tell you that.

1280
01:32:42.741 --> 01:32:44.994
We will not just give you a nitrous oxide mask and say:

1281
01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:47.881
"Here you go".
 We will tell you exactly how to do.

1282
01:32:50.002 --> 01:32:53.072
Another pain relief method used quite a lot,

1283
01:32:53.287 --> 01:32:56.424
Especially at firstborns here in Linköping

1284
01:32:56.534 --> 01:32:58.924
Is EDA, back anesthesia.

1285
01:32:59.713 --> 01:33:04.800
It is an anesthetic form that is very effective during the opening phase.

1286
01:33:05.487 --> 01:33:08.921
It is an anesthetist who builds it.

1287
01:33:09.570 --> 01:33:12.842
It goes so that you can sit on the bedside

1288
01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.816
Alternatively lie on the page.

1289
01:33:15.302 --> 01:33:19.231
The anesthetist washing his back sterile,

1290
01:33:19.849 --> 01:33:23.095
Gives local anesthesia first, in the skin.

1291
01:33:23.205 --> 01:33:27.232
Local anesthesia is like any other syringes, you feel when laid.

1292
01:33:27.537 --> 01:33:32.954
But it is a short -term pain, a stick in the back.

1293
01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:39.209
When it is laid, you insert a hose between two vertebrae.

1294
01:33:39.889 --> 01:33:43.215
This hose then gets connected to a small pump

1295
01:33:43.398 --> 01:33:45.560
which you attach to your patient shirt.

1296
01:33:45.985 --> 01:33:53.317
It is continuously pumped in pain relief drugs, as long as you need it.

1297
01:33:54.331 --> 01:33:59.178
Sometimes you need to fill the pump with a little extra

1298
01:33:59.368 --> 01:34:01.858
Pain relief, if you get a pain break.

1299
01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.208
It is important to think here too that it is pain -relieving drugs.

1300
01:34:07.340 --> 01:34:10.170
It doesn't remove everything.
 You will above all feel

1301
01:34:10.623 --> 01:34:16.073
The pressure downwards, towards the vagina and tail, when the child is pressing down.

1302
01:34:16.369 --> 01:34:19.995
It is not possible to stun away with a back anesthesia.

1303
01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.894
Is it something you want to add?
 -No.

1304
01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.880
Then there is something called PCB.

1305
01:34:28.176 --> 01:34:32.895
It is when you put a local anesthesia in the uterus itself.

1306
01:34:33.505 --> 01:34:37.191
One of our doctors puts it and then stunning

1307
01:34:37.398 --> 01:34:39.904
in four places in the uterus.

1308
01:34:40.209 --> 01:34:42.386
It's like a dentist anesthesia you might say.

1309
01:34:42.603 --> 01:34:46.184
Instead of putting it in your mouth, put it in the mother.

1310
01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:49.132
It helps a couple of hours.

1311
01:34:49.961 --> 01:34:53.917
It can be good to use if one is a nursery

1312
01:34:54.116 --> 01:34:58.383
And you know that the birth is probably going faster this time.

1313
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:02.872
You may not have time to get any effect from the back anesthesia.

1314
01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:05.843
Then this may be preferable in such cases.

1315
01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.791
Then there is PDB, pelvic floor anesthesia

1316
01:35:11.951 --> 01:35:14.438
Where you stuck the pelvic floor.

1317
01:35:14.582 --> 01:35:19.326
Pelvic floor, the slide opening could be said

1318
01:35:19.533 --> 01:35:21.955
And the middle yard, one stays.

1319
01:35:22.618 --> 01:35:25.829
There you have pain when you start cruising.

1320
01:35:26.329 --> 01:35:29.350
During the opening phase and the penetration phase

1321
01:35:29.517 --> 01:35:34.345
Is it more that you have stomach pain, back, hips, thighs and buttocks.

1322
01:35:34.463 --> 01:35:36.838
Then it is not in the vagina itself you are in pain.

1323
01:35:37.612 --> 01:35:40.592
In the final stage, that pain is coming.

1324
01:35:40.834 --> 01:35:43.383
Then one can stun the pelvic floor

1325
01:35:43.781 --> 01:35:45.736
using a syringe.

1326
01:35:45.863 --> 01:35:48.334
One puts a syringe on one side of the vagina,

1327
01:35:48.561 --> 01:35:51.746
Inside the vagina, and a syringe on the other side.

1328
01:35:53.636 --> 01:35:56.530
If you think this pain is absolutely unbearable

1329
01:35:56.733 --> 01:35:58.941
And painful, we help you with it.

1330
01:36:00.774 --> 01:36:04.514
Just like with everything we've talked about today

1331
01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:09.720
regarding pain relief, positions,

1332
01:36:11.793 --> 01:36:17.087
How to give birth to your child, so try not to decide so much here and now.

1333
01:36:17.665 --> 01:36:21.415
See this as a suggestion, that this can be.

1334
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:24.664
And so we talk more about it when you come to us

1335
01:36:24.827 --> 01:36:26.440
And it's time to give birth to your child.

1336
01:36:26.823 --> 01:36:29.960
What we return to all the time is that you will have breaks

1337
01:36:30.085 --> 01:36:32.742
between your aches, and we will be able to talk to each other,

1338
01:36:33.047 --> 01:36:37.032
to communicate.
 It is so important and we want it so much.

1339
01:36:37.196 --> 01:36:40.527
Our wish is for you to get such a good

1340
01:36:40.622 --> 01:36:44.279
childbirth experience that is possible to give you.

1341
01:36:44.819 --> 01:36:49.965
We must do everything to be able to satisfy your wishes.

1342
01:36:52.018 --> 01:36:56.068
We want to say thank you and this moment.

1343
01:36:57.448 --> 01:37:00.430
Welcome to come and give birth to us.

1344
01:37:00.867 --> 01:37:04.468
Maybe we'll see you, who knows

1345
01:37:05.062 --> 01:37:08.408
As last words, do you want to flag

1346
01:37:08.682 --> 01:37:13.591
Yes for our Instagram, "BBLINKOPING".
 Feel free to go in there and have a look.

1347
01:37:13.973 --> 01:37:18.584
It is a blissful mix, of both a little more educational

1348
01:37:20.562 --> 01:37:24.118
pictures and texts, but also some birth stories-

1349
01:37:24.296 --> 01:37:28.151
And some pictures from our everyday lives.
 A day at work for us.

1350
01:37:28.453 --> 01:37:30.062
You can really go in and look.

1351
01:37:31.094 --> 01:37:33.621
Thank you for this moment.
 -Thank you for listening.
