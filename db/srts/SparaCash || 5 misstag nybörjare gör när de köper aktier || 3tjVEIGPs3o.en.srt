1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,760
Something I come across are many beginners who are unsure when to buy and sell stocks.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,080
Before you buy your first shares, it can be good that you know common mistakes

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
as many others do, including me!

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,900
These are 5 common mistakes that beginners make when buying stocks for the first time.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Hi, my name is Marcus Lindblad and I run SparaCash.se

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,360
You are probably a beginner and want to get started and buy and sell stocks.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,300
I do not want you to make the same leap as many others actually do.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,860
I'm listening to a podcast called AvanzaPodden (very good podcast)

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,140
AvanzaPodden has a facebook group where I asked the question

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
what are the common mistakes when buying stocks

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,680
If you want to read more tips about mistakes, I link to the thread below

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,260
I have also made a post about it on SparaCash.se which you can also read

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,140
so the question I asked was: What are the biggest mistakes you made when you started investing?

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,100
1. To have the wrong brokerage class (courtageklass) and to get a loss immediately when buying the stock

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,760
When you buy shares, there is something called brokerage

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,820
Brokerage is the fee for when you buy a share

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,180
You also pay brokerage when you sell a share, ie a sales fee.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,380
When you register on, for example, Avanza or Nordnet

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,760
Then you get to choose which brokerage class you want to be in

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,520
The first common mistake beginners make is to choose the wrong brokerage class

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,680
When they buy shares for the first time, they do not think that it costs a fee to buy shares

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,680
and this purchase fee can be so large that it eats up a large part of your investment

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:57,900
So let's say you invest SEK 1,000, then it's stupid to pay SEK 30 in brokerage (purchase fee)

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,560
When you become a new customer at Avanza, you get SEK 50,000

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,880
and up to SEK 80,000 on Nordnet to buy shares for no brokerage at all

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,980
The brokerage class is important, make sure you have the right brokerage class before you buy and sell shares.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,280
Mistake number 2 is to buy a company of hope.

28
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,560
For example, pharmaceutical companies, cancer research, and similar stocks that make new issues after new issues.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,640
This simply means that many of these companies can be found out through share groups on Facebook and the like

30
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,340
There are often quite hyped companies that may not even make a profit

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,640
suit yourself for them, it is quite easy to burn yourself on such stocks

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,580
It is simply believed that they should make one completely magically rich or the like

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,000
Beware of them, wait a bit until you get more meat on your bones by buying shares before you go into them.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,920
If it is the case that you choose to buy a research company or something else

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,580
go in with a very small amount that you can afford to lose because you can very easily burn yourself on them

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,240
k3. Trade with leverage too early before you understand how it works.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,500
I have done this and this is how I lost two months' salary at a very young age.

38
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,540
When I was 19 years old, I did this, and that was right after taking the student

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:28,120
Then it hurts quite hard to lose two months' salary on trying to trade and play some kind of guru

40
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,660
Trading with leverage means that you trade with borrowed money

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,160
Let's say you buy a leverage product such as Bull OMX x15

42
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,280
Bull means that you believe in rise and bear means that you believe in decline

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,600
Let's say then that you buy a Bull OMX x15

44
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,660
Then you think OMX will go up

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,540
and is it the case that OMX goes up 1% then you earn 15% (in x15)

46
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,760
BUT! if it is the case that what you invest in goes down -1%

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,760
then your position will instead go down -15%!

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,020
so it is a lever, so there will be a greater effect upwards or downwards

49
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,840
so I want to give you a big warning finger for that

50
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,540
another mistake that Andreas Hansson has suggested

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,720
and that is not having the patience to keep the good companies you have actually managed to buy

52
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,000
this is something that I personally recognize myself in very much

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,300
when you have bought a share and it is going well, dare to keep it then

54
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,040
Many people want to sell a stock straight away if it goes down a little bit.

55
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,440
Think long term. How long do you want to own this stock? How long do you want to invest this money?

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,760
This is a lesson that many beginners will learn that they take home the profits crazy too soon.

57
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,940
Not having the patience to ride the train.

58
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Do you feel that you want to sell and take home some profit in a share?

59
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,660
Then instead think about whether you should sell half of your investment

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,760
or if you are just going to sell your investment and keep the return you received on the shares.

61
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,420
5. Play with money you need or plan to use soon.

62
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,260
that one does not think long-term.

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's say that it's money you need in a short time and you just want to quickly make it increase in value

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,280
let's say you need to buy a car within a month or so.

65
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,800
you may then think that you can make the money increase in value by investing it in stocks or something similar.

66
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,620
But you have to take care of it because it's easy to get burned and lose that money

67
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,220
when dealing with this type of trade

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,840
Do not try to make your money grow incredibly fast in order to

69
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,020
because it goes incredibly fast in stocks and that is the danger, that you can lose money in a very short time.

70
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,720
by believing that you can speculate in the right direction

71
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
so stay away from it :)

72
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,300
So many of these mistakes I also recognize myself in

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,760
I want you to read through the mistakes carefully if you are a beginner in stocks

74
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:04,280
Take it a little careful. Do not be afraid to dare to invest but be a little careful about -how much- you invest.

75
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,180
It is important that you do not postpone your investments either

76
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,960
Take a small amount that you invest each month

77
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,980
If you do not feel that you are a typical active investor, then choose funds instead of investing in shares.

78
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,280
These were a couple of common beginner mistakes that most people have made

79
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,820
