1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,760
Something I come across is many beginners who are uncertain when buying and selling shares.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,080
Before you buy your first shares, it might be good that you know common mistakes

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
Like many others do, including me!

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,900
These are 5 common mistakes that beginners make when buying shares for the first time.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Hi, my name is Marcus Lindblad and I am the one who runs sparecash.se

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,360
You are probably a beginner and want to get started and buy and sell shares.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,300
I don't want you to do the same slant as many others actually do.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,860
I listen to a podcast called Avanzapodden (very good podcast)

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,140
Avanzapodden has a Facebook group where I asked the question

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
What the usual mistakes are when buying stocks

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,680
If you want to read more tips on mistakes, I link to the thread below

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,260
I have also made a post about it at sparecash.se that you can also read

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,140
So the question I asked was: What are the biggest mistakes you made when you started investing?

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,100
1. Having the wrong brokerage class and that you go back already at a purchase

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,760
When you buy shares there is something called brokerage

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,820
Debtage is the fee for when you buy a share

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,180
You also pay commission when you sell a share, ie a sales fee.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,380
When you register on, for example, Avanza or Nordnet

19
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,760
Then you get to choose which brokerage class you want to lie in

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,520
First common mistake beginners make is that they choose the wrong commerce class

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,680
When they buy shares for the first time, they do not think that it costs a fee to buy shares

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,680
and this purchase fee can be so large that it eats up a large part of your investment

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:57,900
So let's say you invest SEK 1,000, then it is stupid to pay SEK 30 in brokerage (purchase fee)

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,560
When you become a new customer at Avanza you get SEK 50,000

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,880
and up to SEK 80,000 on Nordnet to buy shares for completely without commission

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,980
The commission class is important, make sure you have the right commission class before you buy and sell shares.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,280
Mistake number 2 is to buy hope companies.

28
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,560
For example, pharmaceutical companies, cancer research, and similar shares that make a new share issue after new share issue.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,640
It simply means that many of these companies can find out through share groups on Facebook and similar

30
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,340
It is often quite a hawd company that may not even go with profit

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,640
Watching you for them, it's pretty easy to burn on such shares

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,580
It is simply believed that they should make a completely magically rich or similar

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,000
Beware of them, wait a bit until you get more meat on your legs by buying shares before going into them.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,920
If it is so that you choose to buy a research company or other

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,580
Go in with a very small sum that you can afford to lose because you can very easily burn yourself on them

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,240
K3.
 Shop with leverage on tok too early before you understand how it works.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,500
I have done this and that is how I lost two monthly salaries at a very young age.

38
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,540
When I was 19 years old I did this, and it was just after taking the student

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:28,120
Then it stings pretty hard to lose two monthly salaries on trying to trade: a and play some kind of guru

40
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,660
Trading with leverage means shopping with borrowed money

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,160
Let's say you buy a leverage product such as Bull OMX X15

42
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,280
Bull means that you believe in the rise and Bear means that you believe in the decline

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,600
Let say then you buy a Bull OMX X15

44
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,660
Then you think OMX should go up

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,540
and is it that OMX goes up 1% then you earn 15% (I.O.M. X15)

46
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,760
BUT!
 If it is so that you invest yesterday -1%

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,760
Then your position will go down -15%instead!

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,020
so it is a lever, thus it becomes a greater effect upward or downward

49
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,840
So I want to give you a big warning finger for that

50
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,540
Another mistake that Andreas Hansson has tips on

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,720
and it is not to be patient to keep the good companies you actually managed to buy

52
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,000
This is something that I recognize myself in very much

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,300
When you bought a share and it goes well, dare to keep it then

54
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,040
Don't be such that if it goes down a bit, want to take home the profit

55
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,440
Think of long term.
 How long do you want to own this share?
 How long do you want to invest this money?

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,760
This is a lesson that many beginners learn that they take home the profits too soon.

57
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,940
Not to be patient to go by train.

58
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Do you feel that you want to sell and take home some profit in a share?

59
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,660
Then think about whether you are going to sell half of your investment

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Or if you just have to sell your investment and keep the return on the shares.

61
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,420
5. Play with money you need or intend to use shortly.

62
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,260
That you do not think long term.

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's say it's money you need shortly and you just want them to rapidly increase in value

64
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,280
Let's say you need to buy a car within a month.

65
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,800
You may then think that you can get the money to increase in value by investing them in shares or something similar.

66
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,620
But you should be suitable for it because it is easy to burn and lose that money

67
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,220
When you are in the process of this type of trade

68
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,840
Do not try to make your money grow incredibly fast in order to

69
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:44,020
Because it goes incredibly fast in shares and that is what the danger is that you can lose money in a very short time.

70
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,720
By believing that you can speculate in the right direction

71
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
So stay away :)

72
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,300
So quite a few of these mistakes I also recognize myself in

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,760
I want you to read through mistakes carefully if it is so that you are a beginner on shares

74
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:04,280
Take it a little gently.
 Don't be afraid to dare to invest but be a little careful about - how much - you invest.

75
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,180
It is important that you do not postpone your investments either

76
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,960
Take a small sum that you invest each month

77
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,980
If you do not feel that you are a typical active investor, then choose funds instead of investing in shares.

78
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,280
This was a couple of common beginner misses that most people have made

79
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,820
