1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,000
The question is not why I chose to become an officer.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06.440
The question is why I remain as an officer.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09.640
It is because it is a varied profession.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,640
I've been on a squad for ten years.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13.560
I've been in the staff for six months.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,080
That's what is a bit funny about the Armed Forces, it's open.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,760
You have the opportunity to focus on several different levels.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,280
We want good managers. Then we have to give each other constructive feedback.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,480
It is quite good at the Armed Forces.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,320
Exercise is an important part, this is where we get wrong.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,000
When it comes to the sharp part

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,400
Internationally and nationally that we should do right.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,200
My name is Sofia and serve as a staff officer at Livgardet.
