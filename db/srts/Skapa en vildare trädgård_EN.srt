1
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:09,320
As much as every third species of wild bees are threatened in Sweden.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,375
It looks about as bad for many other pollinating insects.

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:17,304
So what can you do? Well, you can grow plants that they like-

4
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:20,300
-and that we'll talk about here from the botanical garden-

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,776
-To together with Lina Herbertsson, who is pollination scientist-

6
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:26,665
-And Julia Borg, who is the curator of the Botanical Garden.

7
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:28,951
-Welcome. -Thanks so much.

8
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,752
And welcome to you who listen. There have been several questions in advance-

9
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:35,804
-while we'll do our best to answer-

10
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:39,487
-And it is also possible to ask questions during the broadcast.

11
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:44,312
We hope to catch up with as many as possible, but we start with those who have come in-

12
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:49,554
-But first of all, we will sort out one and the other about pollinators.

13
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:53,649
After all, not everyone is threatened the same way, right?

14
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:57,383
No, that's right. The honey bee is what we talk mostly —-

15
00:00:57,383 --> 00:01:03,494
-And that is often allowed to symbolize endangered species when there are different reports.

16
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,692
The honey bee is not a threatened species, but it is much like livestock.

17
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:13,081
In Sweden they live above all in the hive

18
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,391
-Where we have them to harvest honey.

19
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,748
There are also dark soil moods, which have increased very much-

20
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:21,696
-In Sweden over the past 100 years.

21
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:24,894
Okay, so there are many like ...

22
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:29,315
In the past, many reports came that it was Tambin that disappeared-

23
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,220
-But that's not true?

24
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,847
What happened was not that Tambina disappeared-

25
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:39,800
-Os whole communities could collapse-

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,094
-And it was mainly in the United States that it happened.

27
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:47,863
This is partly due to the use of neonicotinoids-

28
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:52,800
-while is a pesticide that has been used very-

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,067
-But that is being phased out.

30
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:58,959
In the EU, most of the substances have disappeared.

31
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,713
Okay, so even in the US, the situation is starting to be under control?

32
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:07,697
Yes, and if we talk about diversity then you should remember to mention-

33
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:11,407
-The honey bee is not naturally occurring in the USA-

34
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:16,233
-Why it has brought the Europeans brought with it, and it could have-

35
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:19,991
-A quite serious negative impact on wild pollinators there.

36
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:25,078
If you think about which plants to choose.

37
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,697
How to think if you want to benefit those who are threatened?

38
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:32,086
You can start, then you can fill in.

39
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,880
I think above all that one should look at what is found-

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,233
-For if you think of those who are threatened, you want the wild diversity.

41
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:43,535
The threatened species have been here for a long time-

42
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:47,844
-And is often dependent on plants found here naturally.

43
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:52,932
If you work in your own garden then maybe you don't want to do if it-

44
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:57,400
-To a meadow or natural pasture land.

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,104
You rarely have cows in your garden.

46
00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:04,040
You may not want to do the whole, but what you can do-

47
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,067
-Is that if one mow the lawn a little more rarely-

48
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:12,210
-So often brown and white clover.

49
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:17,511
They start blooming already after one or two weeks-

50
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:21,551
-and then you can see that there will be a lot of bumblebees and other small creeps-

51
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,667
-and eat from them.

52
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:26,937
So you can put away the lawnmower to late summer?

53
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:30,762
If you want a lawn, then you can look to-

54
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:33,413
-That this is allowed to bloom in it.

55
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,523
The lawn does not have to be this short.

56
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:44,278
Then you can try to build a meadow-like place in the garden-

57
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:47,100
-and then you should not cut it on the whole season-

58
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,667
-What you mow it at the end of summer or at the beginning of autumn-

59
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,908
-And remove the grass when cut.

60
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:57,797
There will be two different types of habitation then, the wild-flowering, nitrogen-rich lawn-

61
00:03:57,797 --> 00:04:01,384
-And then the meadow land that you have to work a little more with?

62
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,384
Yes.

63
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:06,583
There maybe you can have some red clover.

64
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,305
It is a little too high to have in the lawn-

65
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:11,495
-But it is liked by many.

66
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,971
In both cases, domestic plants apply.

67
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,836
Julia, how do you know if a plant is domestic?

68
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:22,344
It is a great question, because it is not so easy to know.

69
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:26,955
A good thing you need is a really good flora-

70
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:30,939
-When Lina has included here.

71
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:36,265
In a good flora so you can look up a plant-

72
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:40,900
-And you can read whether it is a resident or not.

73
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,828
For example, if it says it is distorted or naturalized-

74
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:50,600
-To you know that it is very likely to have escaped from our gardeners

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,533
-or otherwise lost in nature.

76
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:57,667
Then it is not a resident, and sometimes it stands from which land-

77
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:01,508
-or part of the world it comes from, so a flora is completely indispensable.

78
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:06,437
If one does not have a flora, or are out and do not bring it-

79
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:10,444
-But you have the mobile phone with you, there is a great website-

80
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,762
-which is called Swedish cultural plant database.

81
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:15,302
It is only called a shade.

82
00:05:15,302 --> 00:05:19,952
There one can search, and enter the plant name-

83
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,587
-and so you get information, and there also stands-

84
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:25,802
-If it is a resident in Sweden.

85
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:28,972
It is as Lina said that the domestic plants-

86
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:34,167
-Haves developed for thousands of years with all other living around us-

87
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,531
-So they have a completely different context.

88
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:45,270
Then there are many garden plants that can cause nectar and pollen-

89
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,532
-But in order for the insects to be able to fulfill their entire life cycler-

90
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:54,393
-So the domestic plants that are important for, for example, larvae.

91
00:05:54,393 --> 00:05:56,824
You know that more.

92
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:02,031
By getting that kind of diversity, you make a great effort.

93
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,991
Can you see the difference between garden plants and domestic plants?

94
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,904
There are those who are so refined.

95
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:11,769
Yes, if you look at ...

96
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,094
For example, if you look at this peony-

97
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:21,523
-The has double petals, and there are many petals.

98
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:24,531
It is a typical sign that it is refined-

99
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:28,872
-and it does not have insects so much pleasure.

100
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:34,033
Often it is the stamens who have been converted to petals-

101
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,167
-For purely genetically, it's not a big step-

102
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:41,190
-To go from stamens to petals.

103
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:45,897
It is the same with roses and other plants with double petals.

104
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:48,467
Then you know that it is refined.

105
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:51,233
Then there are also processed domestic species-

106
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:57,202
-But you want to help the insects, you should not plant more of them.

107
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,066
Now I get a bad conscience, because I have lots.

108
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:06,272
You should not have that, and it is an important thing to think about-

109
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:09,423
-That you have them do not destroy the insects.

110
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:13,161
What destroys the insects is if you do not have the others.

111
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:18,167
We should not remove what we have because we think it is nice.

112
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,733
I personally think that the very finest is like this here-

113
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,667
-But I'm a little colored by my interest.

114
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:28,778
If you like this, you can have it-

115
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,992
-And you should also make sure there are some bluebells-

116
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,968
-As is also very nice.

117
00:07:33,968 --> 00:07:39,198
The bluebell was voted to Sweden's national flower last year-

118
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:43,357
-And I think most people think that bluebells are very nice.

119
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:47,067
It can try to have it, and even give room for the other-

120
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:52,487
-For example in the lawn or in a part of the garden where you do not go.

121
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:58,633
You can try to work with both and, for the garden is a place for recreation-

122
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,395
-Where you want to enjoy being.

123
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:05,067
One can have both parts, but one can try to be cared for

124
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,003
-For invasive plants.

125
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:12,203
They do no harm in the garden, but if they come out from the garden-

126
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:15,576
-The there are many who can put it out there.

127
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:18,877
We will return to it, and there have come some questions-

128
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:22,233
-But first a question with two different variants.

129
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:26,130
It is, if we back down, to Tambin versus wild bees.

130
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,867
Can you say they compete with each other-

131
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:32,133
-Or do they strengthen biodiversity?

132
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,975
We may be able to see some beekeepers that withered.

133
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,221
How to think there?

134
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:42,504
I think it is important that you distinguish between different things you want to do.

135
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:47,956
The one ... now it sounds, should we take a break while we wait for it?

136
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:55,495
Now I don't have to try to overwhelm it.

137
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:59,122
It is important to distinguish between different goals.

138
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,661
One goal is that we want to preserve the diversity of plants.

139
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:08,604
Then there is another goal that is the diversity of wild bees.

140
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:13,469
In these two goals, I would say that honey bina-

141
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,985
-has probably no positive impact, but rather there is a risk-

142
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:19,763
-That they have a negative impact.

143
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:26,100
Honeybees can pollinate wild plants-

144
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,233
-But those who risk being without pollinators-

145
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,765
-Not those pollinated by honey bees.

146
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:37,828
Since the honey bee is common, it is not a problem.

147
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:43,185
However, the honey bee can contribute pollination-

148
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:47,749
-For example, fruit trees, bushes and other things you want in your garden.

149
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:51,090
You can get honey if you are a beekeeper.

150
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:56,638
There are many reasons to be beekeepers and have honeybin-

151
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,612
-But one should be aware that there is a risk-

152
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,867
-That they compete out the wild bees.

153
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:07,233
We have seen when we have looked at hops in flowering agricultural landscap-

154
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:12,923
-and more flowering agricultural landscapes, so it has become significantly fewer-

155
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:16,508
-wilded bumblebees in the places where one has put out honeybin-

156
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:19,316
-If it's flower.

157
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:22,233
But we don't really know where the limit goes-

158
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:27,376
-or what determines when competition arises.

159
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:32,033
You should also know that competition is not something new that came with honey bees

160
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:38,557
-Or competition is a naturally occurring phenomenon in ecology.

161
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:42,053
That there is competition is not necessarily negative-

162
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:46,418
-But when the competition makes them push away ...

163
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:49,100
There is a risk, and a little more knowledge is needed-

164
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,733
-To you possibly set a goal in how many cups to exist-

165
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,241
-or a roof ...

166
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:57,638
We don't know exactly where the limit goes-

167
00:10:57,638 --> 00:11:02,471
-But one should be aware that there may be 100,000 bees in a cup-

168
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:06,333
-And then you can understand that there is a risk that the flowers will end.

169
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,500
Make sure there are not too many cups, and plenty of flowers-

170
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,833
-So I don't think honey bees are a big problem.

171
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,825
We have a specific question here, someone is wondering about Kärringstand.

172
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:22,873
A small yellow flower is that?

173
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:29,921
Is it good for diversity, wild bees and other pollinating insects?

174
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:35,549
Yes it is. It is a plant that many different insects think-

175
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,588
-and especially butterflies.

176
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:43,469
I think Kärringstand is worthy of the most butterfly species in Sweden.

177
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:48,467
It is absolutely good, so you like it then it is top-

178
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,069
-Plant it in the garden.

179
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,244
I'll probably do that too.

180
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,720
It is also great for many bumblebees.

181
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:59,510
There is someone who wonders if suggestions for appropriate hedge-

182
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,288
-What can benefit pollinators.

183
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:05,122
There are many different plants-

184
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:08,566
-So it depends a little on how high hedges you want to have-

185
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:12,519
-And whether or not to choose a domestic species.

186
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,884
If you think of the domestic plants, which benefit the Swedish diversity-

187
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:24,360
-So you can think of, for example, mulberry or oxel-

188
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:27,203
-What both bloom.

189
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:32,550
Hawthorn is a beautiful hedge if you can live with all the tags.

190
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,685
-So for small birds, I think? -Yes, it gives berries too.

191
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:40,367
You can also imagine, if you don't need a very high hedge-

192
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:45,335
-Oland token, which has yellow flowers and blooms all summer.

193
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:49,367
-You can also have it as a hedge. -There were several good examples.

194
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:54,137
Someone wants tips on how to benefit both the pollinators and the kitchen-

195
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:57,057
-So kitchen plants, we suppose they mean.

196
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:05,011
In order to have pollinators in their garden one must benefit them-

197
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:10,114
-and that in turn benefits most of the crops that we grow-

198
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:13,035
-for the vast majority of vegetables, fruits and berries-

199
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:15,217
-As insect pollinators.

200
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:19,455
For example, if you grow blueberries, you need to bumblebee-

201
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:25,050
-And growing pumpkin, you would like to have bees.

202
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,248
For the strawberries, which bloom and ripen now-

203
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:31,899
-Is solitary bees completely indispensable.

204
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:39,439
I think of all herbs, which are often wreath-flowered-

205
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:43,986
-For example, oregano or royal mint which is the domestic.

206
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:47,486
Thyme is also great.

207
00:13:47,486 --> 00:13:51,264
Mints and chives.

208
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,677
All this is, as you say, insect pollinated.

209
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:59,400
Then you can, if you are interested and want to dig a little deeper-

210
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,200
-and want to grow new plants that one has not had before-

211
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,833
-So there is very good literature about wild edible plants ...

212
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,341
... if you want to experiment. -You can search for that word?

213
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:14,595
Yes, you can do that, and there are different books.

214
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:20,460
It has become a bit hot, that you should use more ...

215
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:27,190
Frame onions is one of the more common wild plants that have come in the cry.

216
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,675
-Whots are very beautiful. -Yes indeed.

217
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:34,167
All efforts that one makes to benefit pollinating insects in the garden-

218
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,698
-Has also an opportunity to benefit the kitchen.

219
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:41,033
We have built a small sand bed just below the apple tree.

220
00:14:41,033 --> 00:14:45,025
-What do you mean by sand bed? -We have excavated the lawn ...

221
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:49,406
... and filled it with sand, and planted sandy plants there.

222
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:53,733
We did this two years ago, and this year is the first year-

223
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,130
-Then I've seen there are bees there.

224
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,433
-So they live there? -Yes exactly.

225
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,751
The vast majority of solitaires ...

226
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:06,505
You often make a bi -hotel with questionable importance to the bees.

227
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,616
Above all, it is uncertain whether the threatened species-

228
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,981
-Should want to live in bamboo.

229
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:16,227
You can often get ordinary species to live there, and it can be ball-

230
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:18,727
-And good for pollination in the garden.

231
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:22,886
For example, red walls that pollinate strawberries.

232
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:28,473
But the vast majority live in the ground-

233
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:32,362
-And then they would like to have lightly excavated and sandy soil.

234
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:36,179
So we have dug out, it should be sandy and sunny-

235
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:41,290
-And so we put some sandneys and other nice ones that bloom there.

236
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:45,862
Of course, we hope that they will pollinate our apple trees.

237
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,862
-Have have you seen that they have moved in? -Yes, this year I have seen that they moved in.

238
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:52,973
-Is it hole in the sand? -No, you have to sit there and watch.

239
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:55,504
That's what is so amazing with wild bin-

240
00:15:55,504 --> 00:16:00,000
-for when you do these measures, you start to look for them-

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,881
-And you see that they might be there from the beginning.

242
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,184
They do not buzz as much as bumblebees.

243
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:13,914
Bumblebees are wild in most cases, but they are very much noticeable-

244
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:18,136
-And honey bees are not wild either, but they also buzz a lot.

245
00:16:18,136 --> 00:16:22,374
Many of the solitary bees are quite small and anonymous-

246
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:25,750
-So you have to wait for them to come, and keep your eyes open.

247
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,267
An ignorant person I might have thought that there were flower flies.

248
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:34,283
-They are a bit similar. -I probably don't think so.

249
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:37,394
They move in a different way, and are a little more like this ...

250
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:43,210
-You have to put you and watch. -It was a good tip, to dig out a bit.

251
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,633
So wide and depth?

252
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:51,062
We dug so deeply, and so deep in another part.

253
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:56,094
-50/50 soil and sand? -Yes, a little mixed.

254
00:16:56,094 --> 00:17:00,205
Most often it is about as much variation as possible-

255
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:02,300
-So it will be good for as many people as possible.

256
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,625
Exactly, I think that is an important point-

257
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,094
-That it should look different.

258
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:12,333
One often has a lawn throughout the garden-

259
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,214
-And some bushes planted around.

260
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:20,127
You need more variety, and let it be a little more wild-grown-

261
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,373
-Th then comes a great variety of both plants and animals.

262
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:30,341
Many people want tips on plants, and you can refer to the flora.

263
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,333
At the same time, it is good for some.

264
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:36,587
We have mentioned bluebell and girlfriend, but you also have some.

265
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:39,400
Is there something that you can show-

266
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:44,090
-which could also be appropriate to have in the garden, and that benefits diversity?

267
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:48,394
Yes, what should we start with?

268
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:53,584
We can start with goat-zeal-

269
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:57,121
-As you can definitely have in the discount.

270
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:03,263
It is closely related to Kärring tooth, and is appreciated by many pollinators.

271
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:07,446
-In all cases those who have a little longer heavy. -Who have longer tongue?

272
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:12,509
We can look here. Now I take from Botaniskan's property ...

273
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:16,978
Here you see that the flower is quite deep-

274
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:20,628
-So you have to have a long tongue to reach all the way down here.

275
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:25,200
-What animals have long tongue? Or animals ... -Yes, they are animals. Bumblebees.

276
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,700
There are long -heavy bumblebees.

277
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:33,501
The most long -heavy bumblebee we have in Skåne is the garden bump.

278
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:35,220
I got some brain drops there.

279
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:41,513
There are also short-heavy bumblebees, who like to bite holes here-

280
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:44,863
-In deep flowers, and then they drink nectar down here.

281
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,799
They are nectar thieves, which do not pollinate the flower?

282
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,759
No, but they don't do any harm-

283
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,434
-So you don't have to be sorry if it happens-

284
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:57,688
-Out only fascinated over nature's wonders.

285
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:02,648
Butterflies also have long tongues, so they like deep flowers.

286
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,386
Should we take an example of one that does not have such deep flower?

287
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,379
Blood root.

288
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,545
It has a lot of pollen.

289
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:21,767
It gives pollen to the insects that collect it.

290
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:25,949
After all, pollen gives protein to the insects.

291
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:31,200
-You can have as a ground cover. -It's the best thing in the diet circle for them?

292
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,160
The nectar and the quick sugar ...

293
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,208
It is needed both.

294
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:42,065
If they had only invested in protein, they would not have been able to fly.

295
00:19:42,896 --> 00:19:46,567
We know that a lot of energy is needed to leave the earth.

296
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:49,844
It is just like the aircraft using a lot of resources-

297
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:53,352
-And it also makes insects when they fly around.

298
00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:57,011
They must have a lot of sugar to fill that need.

299
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:01,590
Not many of the insects of the insects need pollen?

300
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,654
Well, pollen is important as they grow.

301
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:10,193
They need protein as they grow, especially the bees' larvae-

302
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:13,373
-Rechaver a lot of protein.

303
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:15,913
Everyone needs protein, but just pollen ...

304
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:22,500
Many springs feed their larvae with other larvae-

305
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,238
-or spiders, or anything else containing a lot of protein.

306
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:28,828
But bees larvae only eat pollen.

307
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:32,900
-What was this name now? -Blood root.

308
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,333
I think we can mention Gullviva. It is not with, because it has bloomed over-

309
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,254
-But it is a fantastic plant in many ways-

310
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:44,651
-And it is very beautiful and appreciated in gardens.

311
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:50,556
It may be a good thing to think about, to have flowering all season-

312
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:53,033
-And then Gullviva is one of the previous ones.

313
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:56,557
So you don't have all the flowering in the middle of summer, but ...

314
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:59,819
I have grown from seeds, it is great.

315
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:08,847
Here is another plant that is easy for many insects to land on.

316
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:12,433
It is completely open, unlike the goat-zeal-

317
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:16,069
-Where they have to dive down, so they can land on this one.

318
00:21:16,069 --> 00:21:19,204
I don't know how appreciated it is of bees and bumblebees.

319
00:21:19,204 --> 00:21:24,552
I know it can be used, but I've seen it used few times.

320
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:32,273
I think i've seen bumblebees use dog breeding as many times-

321
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:33,701
-and dog switching is a grass.

322
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:38,645
I would not say that it is giant poppis-

323
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,907
-But it has a value.

324
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:44,900
Then one should not forget to think of the diversity-

325
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,162
-for there are many species that do not pollinate-

326
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:54,313
-But that is still going to be, and is part of the natural diversity.

327
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,281
There are still many species that are linked to the particular parsonage.

328
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:01,305
We may have forgotten to say that this is a parsonage.

329
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:03,733
It is important for diversity-

330
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:07,194
-An if it is not the bees and the favorite of the bumblebees.

331
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,174
But it is definitely a good plant.

332
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:14,817
We can take one more, then we move on to more questions.

333
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:18,777
-Do we take it, or it? -You can choose that.

334
00:22:18,777 --> 00:22:20,865
We take it, and we will take the other later.

335
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,672
-What is this one for something? -It's summer fiber.

336
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:28,633
It looks a little weed-like, and resembles dandelion

337
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:33,570
-When you just see the leaves, but then get these nice flowers.

338
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:39,105
It is also a plant that many different insects appreciate.

339
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:42,946
Here is even a small beetle-

340
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,796
-and something else green, which I don't know what it is.

341
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:52,819
Fibles are generally something that many insects enjoy.

342
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:55,994
Gray-fibble is one that one often gets up in lawn-

343
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:58,161
-and they like when it's short cut.

344
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:02,645
Then you can't cut too often, because then you cut the flowers.

345
00:23:02,645 --> 00:23:09,121
I think it should be nutrient-poor, and rather short-cut-

346
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,990
-So they can still bloom.

347
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:15,958
It looks like a smoother variant of dandelions.

348
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:20,395
The gray fibers are so low, and I think they are very fine-

349
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:22,061
-and they really don't see ...

350
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:26,462
Should you stop fertilizing your lawn?

351
00:23:26,462 --> 00:23:30,001
I'm not sure they require it to be nutrient-

352
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:34,684
-But the places where I know they are growing, it is relatively nutritious.

353
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:38,667
I know there are other fiblies coming pretty early-

354
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:44,611
-What can handle nutritious lawn if you just let it grow.

355
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:50,516
There are many species of fibers, and they probably have slightly different needs.

356
00:23:50,873 --> 00:23:53,278
So if you see these, you can leave them.

357
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,087
Here comes another question from a person who has-

358
00:23:57,087 --> 00:24:02,075
-A sunny raised corner dominated by lupin-

359
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:04,948
-Akleja and evergreen.

360
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:11,242
It borders on a nature reserve, and the person wants to remove the lupines.

361
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:15,003
What should she do with this bit of garden?

362
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:17,360
Could it be better for the bees than it is today?

363
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:20,686
Yes, of course it can be better.

364
00:24:20,686 --> 00:24:26,615
Many different plants are always good, which we have been in.

365
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:32,800
-Do you have anything special? -Start digging the lupines.

366
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,014
It's not as difficult as many people think.

367
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:38,400
I dug them away with my mother, and it required an effort a year-

368
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,533
-I came back a month later, and a year later-

369
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:46,989
-The I did a follow -up of it, and now I don't think there are lupines.

370
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:53,000
I think it's worth acting before they have been able to spread-

371
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,389
-And it is so close to a nature reserve then it really is a position to remove them-

372
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:01,100
-For the invasive plants are not a problem in gardens.

373
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,433
The problem is when they spread to nature-

374
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:06,952
-And no one takes care of it, and they destroy.

375
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,182
Lupines I had definitely taken away

376
00:25:10,182 --> 00:25:12,698
-Th then I would probably have removed the winter green too-

377
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:16,944
-For they are also problematic.

378
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:20,372
It is difficult for other plants to get up as long as they are left.

379
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:24,475
-Winter green and lupines. -Yes, and they are at risk ...

380
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:28,841
Now we have not talked about it, but a risk classification has been made

381
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:33,380
-As introduced species in Sweden, and the winter green is one of de-

382
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,539
-while is problematic.

383
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:38,349
It is a paradox, for garden enthusiasts want to ha-

384
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:41,888
-fine ground cover that can handle in all mod-

385
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,952
-And then you realize that they might be a little too good.

386
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:50,581
This brown herb also manages in most situations.

387
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:52,999
White clover too.

388
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:57,491
I agree, it can be problematic in some cases.

389
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:00,079
The difference between brown and winter green-

390
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,306
-Is that the winter green is there all year.

391
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:09,303
I had tried to get rid of the two, and then the question is ...

392
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,996
Aklejan is not domestic, but it is very fine-

393
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:18,195
-And it's pretty tough and durable, so it may be worth having a little left.

394
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:21,733
The question is whether it is possible to do any meadow vegetation there-

395
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:25,194
-Th then it could have been valuable to try with-

396
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:28,622
-But if there is a lot of lupine then they have probably been able to fertilize the ground there-

397
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:32,337
-And then maybe it's easier to ... -They take nitrogen from the air.

398
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:34,646
-It's what is problematic with them. -Exactly.

399
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:39,146
So you might think about turning it into a king's coin.

400
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:42,686
We have that at home, there is no room for much else-

401
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:48,043
-But it is nice when it blooms and it is very butterfly-

402
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:52,995
-humlehans, a lot of different small creeps-

403
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:57,202
-And bonnet and other things that I think are nice.

404
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,003
Is organic farming better for pollinators?

405
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:12,400
There is one who has told us about a cultivation landscape that the person has.

406
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't read the whole question, but can you see any difference there-

407
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,519
-If you use toxins or not?

408
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,781
It's not just the poisons.

409
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:25,138
-The control can damage insects. -Is if they are allowed?

410
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:30,067
Yes, there are pesticides designed to kill insect-

411
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:34,289
-And then they often kill pollinating insects.

412
00:27:34,733 --> 00:27:38,551
But it is not only the problem, but it is also that we use-

413
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:41,305
-The pesticides that remove the flowering weeds.

414
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:47,603
Since we have access to artificial fertilizers, we do not need to grow so much clover-

415
00:27:47,603 --> 00:27:50,992
Otherwise clover can fix nitrogen from the air-

416
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:54,698
-To to enrich the ground with nitrogen-

417
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:57,074
-So that you can grow there, and get better harvester-

418
00:27:57,074 --> 00:28:00,963
-and then they have a particularly important meaning-

419
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:03,185
-When you can't use artificial fertilizers.

420
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:12,053
If you grow more pea plants and clover they are more food for the pollinators.

421
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:16,869
So did you want to see more of that even in conventional agriculture?

422
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:21,361
Yes, and one must not necessarily grow organic-

423
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:27,100
-To it will be good for the insects, but to use more of pea plant-

424
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,897
-while, bloom.

425
00:28:28,897 --> 00:28:33,587
Sometimes you grow clover, but cut it before it can flower-

426
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,905
-And then Klövern has a fairly limited value for the pollinators.

427
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:41,484
-So clover is one of several pea plants? -Yes exactly.

428
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:45,967
Can you get municipal gardeners-

429
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:50,411
-To invest more in plants for endangered pollinators?

430
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:54,693
That thing with threatened pollinators can be a bit tricky-

431
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:59,621
-For most often they depend on plants found only in a certain environmental-

432
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:03,852
-And it is not certain that that environment is in the city.

433
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:08,677
I believe that one should think more generally in favoring the diversity-

434
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:10,423
-and think a little wider.

435
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:15,860
In this way one can do a lot to benefit pollinating insect-

436
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,050
-And other insects and spiders.

437
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,558
But how to ...

438
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:24,931
It is about both knowledge and tradition-

439
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:28,455
-When we need to change in some way.

440
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:31,439
I think it is happening.

441
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:35,633
I don't know if it is Dave Goulson, who is a scientist ...

442
00:29:35,633 --> 00:29:39,348
He has written some books that have become very popular-

443
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:42,927
-which is about bumblebees and the like, so I think he has sown a seed

444
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:47,649
-And the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation has run a campaign for the bees.

445
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:51,419
There are many who are in the process of, and I think many such things-

446
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:56,000
-Have made there an increased interest and consciousness-

447
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,533
-and I feel that people more often hear from themselves-

448
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,859
-And says they want to make an effort.

449
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:07,216
It may be some garden engineer or landscape architect-

450
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:13,232
-whow want some more meat on the legs and do something that is good and right-

451
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:16,562
-If you want to benefit biodiversity.

452
00:30:16,562 --> 00:30:22,109
I also have a feeling that there are more and more people who interest sig-

453
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:26,672
-And you want more than just the nectar -rich plants.

454
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:30,656
You want to take it a step further, and think ...

455
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:35,172
As we have been in, if you think it is for the aesthetic-

456
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:39,664
-The I imagine that the preferences change.

457
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:41,902
-It's a little interesting in itself. -Exactly.

458
00:30:43,148 --> 00:30:46,863
There are several who wonder about this with sand bed.

459
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:49,641
We showed with hands, but how deep it should be-

460
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,680
-If you intend to build one?

461
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:55,982
They dig much so deep.

462
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:59,196
-Unchy three inches? -Yes.

463
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,846
It should be so deeply, but everything doesn't have to be sand-

464
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:07,807
-What should be the Locker land, which is easily excavated but at the same time stable.

465
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:12,053
It must not be like on a sandy beach, where the sand is completely loose.

466
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:16,093
There they cannot dig and build nests, but they should be able to dig walking-

467
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:18,483
-As still well, it consists quite well.

468
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:21,896
You may not even have to dig.

469
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:25,801
We were digging because we wanted to get rid of cherries that grew there before-

470
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:28,523
-To we would rather have a ...

471
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:32,428
-You have cherries there? -Yes, exactly, should we talk about it later?

472
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:34,460
You can talk a little about it now.

473
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,533
We did not want to get out of all the cherries from the garden-

474
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:43,669
-For even though it is an introduced plant, it has been here for a very long time.

475
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:48,367
Not long enough for insects to evolve with it-

476
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,597
-But there are many solitar bees who like it-

477
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:54,510
-And it is very beautiful when it gets flower.

478
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,597
We fight against it in some places, and in other places it gets flower.

479
00:31:58,597 --> 00:32:03,073
You can make nice bouquets of cherries instead of bridal veil.

480
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:06,065
I think you can think about that, especially if you have ...

481
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:10,375
Now you had picked this beautiful but quite useless-

482
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,526
-Ur biological diversity point of view.

483
00:32:12,526 --> 00:32:15,153
They can become a very nice bouquet together-

484
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:18,534
-and I think you can open up for the opportunity-

485
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:21,605
-No let some weeds be left.

486
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:25,271
You can have them for different things, and you can eat this too.

487
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:29,883
-In the beginning is it best then? -Yes, but if you pick it all season ...

488
00:32:29,883 --> 00:32:33,740
... then it continues to get new, nice and dilute leaves.

489
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:40,494
You mentioned Sandnejlika, can you give more examples of sandy plants?

490
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,335
Thyme.

491
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:46,581
-What is there more for some ... -Sand lily.

492
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:53,483
I would say this, it's a very good book if you want to ...

493
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:57,697
The Flora of the Nordic countries, can you search for sandy plants there?

494
00:32:57,697 --> 00:33:00,380
Otherwise, there will be a lot to read.

495
00:33:00,932 --> 00:33:05,496
You can find those who start on the "sand" in the register.

496
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:08,940
-Many starts on "sand". -It's a good tip.

497
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,633
Then you get ...

498
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,290
Is there any other place where one can find-

499
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:16,829
-specific sandy plants?

500
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,290
You might be able to think about stone party plants.

501
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,122
-Can you do it? -Perhaps.

502
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:24,315
But then you get into a lot that is not domestic.

503
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:28,132
You may have to be so interested that you sit and browse a little ...

504
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:32,894
You have mentioned a few, so there is something to start with.

505
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:39,438
You have been into the fact that the distribution between processed and domestic plants-

506
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:43,296
-Not have to be 100 % domestic in order for it to be any point-

507
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:46,494
-Why it's just that you have the domestic too.

508
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:55,167
Are seed bags that you can get from SNF good?

509
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:56,802
I don't know what SNF is.

510
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:59,500
The old abbreviation of the Swedish Nature Conservation Association.

511
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,675
Now they are only called the Nature Conservation Association.

512
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:06,341
I have not checked what the seed bags contain.

513
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:10,984
I don't know either, but one could start from-

514
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:14,150
-To if they come from the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation then think ...

515
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,253
I dare not swear on it.

516
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:20,992
How can you think if you want to buy seeds from domestic plants?

517
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:25,317
You can pick seeds, but then maybe you have to take a course first.

518
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,182
But if you want to buy them?

519
00:34:27,992 --> 00:34:35,531
There is a company that sells Swedish domestic wild plants.

520
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:39,054
You can google it, "domestic plants seeds".

521
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:41,134
If you google it, but it will be.

522
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:47,594
Yes, but there are many different ones that may say "wild plants" and similar-

523
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:49,729
-But there is a company that sells ...

524
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,579
You have to google it so that we do not happen to advertise.

525
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:56,793
I myself have believed that a plant has been wild, and then understood-

526
00:34:56,793 --> 00:35:00,167
-That it has not been natural, and you might think it is ...

527
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:04,651
Then it is important to think about why you do it-

528
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:10,927
-For if you do it in your own garden, you can buy seed bags or plants.

529
00:35:10,927 --> 00:35:14,276
They also sell ready -made plants that we have used in our research.

530
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,749
You can do that, but if you are going to take this out on a large scale-

531
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:25,900
-So you have to think a little more, because even if it is Swedish origin-

532
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,789
-So it's a pretty narrow genetic origin.

533
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:33,051
If everyone orders from a small seed company ...

534
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:38,007
It is an aspect of multifaceted on a deeper plane as well?

535
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:42,872
Precisely, because if we talk about the value of plants for the polliners-

536
00:35:42,872 --> 00:35:49,669
-So they do not care if the plants come from Småland, Skåne or Lapland.

537
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:55,098
But if one should instead think about the conservation of-

538
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:59,280
-the genetic plant diversity, which is also important to preserve-

539
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,566
-So maybe you have to work a little more locally.

540
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:08,201
Maybe we should explain a little more why diversity is so important.

541
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:11,867
I usually compare with us people, which is a species-

542
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:15,621
-and we look different, and we work slightly different-

543
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:19,684
-and in the same way one needs to preserve the genetic diversity-

544
00:36:19,684 --> 00:36:21,637
-In each plant species as well.

545
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:26,890
Some may be more adapted to grow in a particular position-

546
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:31,692
-or is more dry-resistant, while someone else is more resistant-

547
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:35,081
-mot a fungal disease or virus.

548
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:40,073
This is the diversity we need to preserve for the future.

549
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:46,375
That is what will be the future, and that evolution works with here and now.

550
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:51,684
A plant that comes from a particular environment is perhaps better adapted to it-

551
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:56,335
-An if you take seeds of the same plant from a completely different part of the country.

552
00:36:56,867 --> 00:37:01,533
So it's still good to buy seeds, but you might be able to do both?

553
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:05,771
Yes, and the important thing is to distinguish between garden business-

554
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:08,025
-and outside gardens.

555
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:12,486
In gardens it is no problem if you test a little different things-

556
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:15,978
-But if you think you should do it large scale ...

557
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:22,954
... thus municipal initiatives or large grasslands to be made om-

558
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:27,888
-So it is much better to contact someone who takes care of a local meadow.

559
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:30,531
Ask to get hay of them when they hit it.

560
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:33,634
Place the hay on a tarpaulin and allow it to dry.

561
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:38,031
You may need to dry it under roof.

562
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:40,633
Then you shake it out, and then you have a good foundation-

563
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:46,133
-To start a local meadow.

564
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:49,078
It is much better to work where you stand.

565
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:52,483
If someone who listens is working on this, is this a advice from you?

566
00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:54,990
-Yes. -There are several who wonder here.

567
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,379
Are there wild bees in northern Sweden?

568
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:03,808
Yes, but the honey bee is not like a wild species in northern Sweden.

569
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:05,832
It is the yours by ...

570
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:08,292
It has existed as a wild species in southern Sweden?

571
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:14,141
-I thought it came from Asia? -There are honey bees in Asia too.

572
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:18,840
It is from there the honeybean genus, apis, will-

573
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,570
-Then there is a European honey bee that we use in hive

574
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,610
-and so there is a Nordic honey bee, which is a subspecies-

575
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:30,681
-which is adapted to our Nordic conditions.

576
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:36,359
It has not occurred naturally throughout our country.

577
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,450
I don't know if you know exactly north border-

578
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,069
-But I would think it's around the Dalälven.

579
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,363
Is it more vulnerable to be a beekeeper?

580
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,601
It sounds like a greater risk to the biological diversity-

581
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:49,381
-Having bees in Norrland.

582
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:52,373
I think it's a bigger risk, so there ...

583
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:57,760
What I said before about honey bees applies to southern Sweden.

584
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,791
I dare not comment on what it is like in northern Sweden.

585
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:03,498
There is probably a greater risk of competing wild ...

586
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:06,172
Is it the same wild bees in northern Sweden as here?

587
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:08,347
No, that's not really it.

588
00:39:09,418 --> 00:39:13,387
There is Polar Humla ...

589
00:39:14,471 --> 00:39:16,907
I'm bad at this-

590
00:39:16,907 --> 00:39:19,987
-I have been up there and looked at hops once.

591
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:22,939
Alphumla, I think maybe.

592
00:39:22,939 --> 00:39:27,844
I can't their name, tundrahumla there is someone named.

593
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:32,605
Polar Humla? Now I am unsure, but there is also up there.

594
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:35,090
Where do hops and bees sleep?

595
00:39:36,113 --> 00:39:39,486
-Blue bells are there any who sleep in. -They sleep in bluebells?

596
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:41,280
Some sleep in bluebells.

597
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:44,383
Red walls usually sleep in hole-

598
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:49,645
-They type of holes they build in to their kids.

599
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:53,248
I don't know if they sleep or just rest.

600
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:58,344
They can't close their eyes with their eyes, and just like flies-

601
00:39:58,344 --> 00:40:02,272
-So they have facet eyes.

602
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:08,629
I don't know if they sleep or just shut down their business.

603
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,895
"We live in the countryside" ...

604
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,998
How can they think to benefit diversity?

605
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:25,442
It is a little different from urban cultivation, but it is probably the same tip there-

606
00:40:25,442 --> 00:40:29,831
-To you bring in what is in the environment naturally?

607
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:33,600
Yes exactly, and you were in.

608
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,333
If you just have it in your garden, it doesn't matter that much.

609
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:41,754
Then you do not have to think so much, but you live next to a nature reserve-

610
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:46,135
-while the other family or couple made-

611
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:52,635
-So you have to think a little more, and beware of those who can spread-

612
00:40:52,635 --> 00:40:54,183
-Ot from the garden.

613
00:40:54,786 --> 00:41:00,302
Otherwise you can mix the domestic plants with the favorites you have-

614
00:41:00,302 --> 00:41:04,476
If they are steady, for many are designed to be ...

615
00:41:04,476 --> 00:41:08,452
-You have to think about that too. -They don't have to be at the same discount.

616
00:41:08,452 --> 00:41:11,095
You can distinguish them in the garden.

617
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:14,040
I think everyone who has a lawn-

618
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,365
-Can let a piece of the lawn be a meadow.

619
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:22,389
It could either be ... a lawn is nutritious

620
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:27,063
-and it does not immediately get a meadow with fine meadow plants-

621
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:31,921
-For they assume a nutrient -poor land.

622
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:35,642
It is a larger project to build such a meadow ...

623
00:41:35,642 --> 00:41:40,079
You don't have to despair if you have a bold clay soil under-

624
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,888
-On then there may be others like ...

625
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:47,150
Then, for example, brown or bluebell can come.

626
00:41:47,865 --> 00:41:52,200
White clover, priest collar and other fine plants-

627
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,390
-Wom appears in the lawn if you just leave it.

628
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:58,430
-This I think you can test. -Or mercury.

629
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,914
Mercury can come.

630
00:42:02,914 --> 00:42:05,271
Yes, there is that too.

631
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:11,545
What about different sedums, from the aspect pollination plants?

632
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:13,196
I think they are pretty good.

633
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:17,942
They give more nectar than you think, given that there are so small flowers.

634
00:42:17,942 --> 00:42:21,696
-Sedum are they thick leafy? -Yes, fat buds.

635
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:26,354
Large fat bud, yellow fat and many others as well.

636
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:34,592
Moose grass, which is often found in ditches, is it good for pollinators?

637
00:42:34,592 --> 00:42:37,196
-They are big, and turn white. -I would believe it.

638
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:42,283
It blooms vigorously, and is domestic.

639
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:48,672
Sometimes it may be a problem that it grows in old mower-

640
00:42:48,672 --> 00:42:51,386
-and perhaps competing out what is to be there-

641
00:42:51,386 --> 00:42:57,100
-But then this is not where it should be, but elsewhere.

642
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,854
I think that one might want to choose the plants-

643
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:05,049
— as most insects like, but it is also important to have plants-

644
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:08,065
-Som maybe just a few pollinators want.

645
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:12,334
So none of the insect -pollinated plants are wrong to have, on the contrary.

646
00:43:12,334 --> 00:43:17,922
I think that everything of domestic is good to have in the garden.

647
00:43:17,922 --> 00:43:21,485
Just choose and choose from what you like.

648
00:43:25,207 --> 00:43:29,009
"I have a summer cottage site at a lake where we have planted meadow land."

649
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:33,707
"I was going to make a discount there, what flowers for insects fit in zone 5?"

650
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:35,456
Maybe it's hard to answer?

651
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:38,451
-I don't know where zone 5 is. -It's far up.

652
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:41,800
Yes, it is difficult to respond specifically to it.

653
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,197
Then maybe you should look in the flora where there are distribution maps-

654
00:43:46,197 --> 00:43:48,100
-And see what is happy there.

655
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,665
Then you can see, and search for ...

656
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:54,998
You often talk about plant zones.

657
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:59,767
It also depends on whether it is a protected and sunny location in the garden-

658
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:02,616
-or if it is a vulnerable position where it blows a lot.

659
00:44:02,616 --> 00:44:04,330
What was she ...

660
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:09,029
They have a discount on a lake.

661
00:44:09,029 --> 00:44:12,560
But it sounds like there is a lot to choose from.

662
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,719
Yes, and it was a bit unclear, were there wild plants they wanted?

663
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,587
I think they want that because it benefits pollinators.

664
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:26,880
I dare not say which ones are wild and fit in a discount in zone 5.

665
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,051
No, okay.

666
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:37,035
There is one that has bird networks over strawberries in pallet collars. Is it stupid?

667
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:40,638
It does not belong to the subject, but if you have something to say?

668
00:44:40,638 --> 00:44:44,408
I don't think it's stupid, because that's probably the blue nets-

669
00:44:44,408 --> 00:44:47,054
-What should protect the strawberries?

670
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:49,498
I have also posted it this past week.

671
00:44:49,498 --> 00:44:53,300
I had intended to paint red stones, and so the birds would learn-

672
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,609
-They they should not eat the red in strawberry-

673
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:59,609
-But someone still learned that they can eat it.

674
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:02,569
I don't know who it is, so I tried to post it.

675
00:45:03,077 --> 00:45:07,387
What I have seen, the insects fly down anyway-

676
00:45:07,387 --> 00:45:11,160
-But I haven't put it on until now that the strawberries started to mature-

677
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,342
-And then there are not much flowers left.

678
00:45:13,788 --> 00:45:17,638
I don't know if they asked if the birds got stuck, but it's ...

679
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:19,400
Well, it was about birds?

680
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,876
What to think about, and now we go away a little from the subject-

681
00:45:23,876 --> 00:45:27,597
-But this is also important because we talk about the wild diversity-

682
00:45:27,597 --> 00:45:31,565
-and hedgehogs are an important part of the wild diversity-

683
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:33,827
-and they have decreased a lot.

684
00:45:34,558 --> 00:45:37,820
Hedgehogs may risk getting stuck in such a net-

685
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,899
-So you have nets so it should be stuck properly-

686
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:43,971
-And you should check it often enough.

687
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:46,217
I had not left such a net ...

688
00:45:46,217 --> 00:45:50,066
You may have strawberries in a solder, and there are not the hedgehogs.

689
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:52,907
Hedgehogs can probably climb up there too-

690
00:45:53,232 --> 00:45:58,050
-And so I think there are many who grow strawberries on flat ground as well.

691
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,502
If you use such a network then one should be careful-

692
00:46:01,502 --> 00:46:06,264
-To not animals can get stuck, but the insects are no risk.

693
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:10,507
Then we will see if it has come in ...

694
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:22,267
If one has a lawn with a lot of moss that one wants to do to a meadow-

695
00:46:22,267 --> 00:46:26,140
-Is something special to think about then, or is it just to throw out the seeds?

696
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,707
-I's not really? -No.

697
00:46:28,707 --> 00:46:33,754
If there is grass left, it is difficult to build a meadow based on it.

698
00:46:33,754 --> 00:46:36,367
One can let it grow, as we talked about the before-

699
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:39,651
-But if you want a real classic meadow-

700
00:46:39,651 --> 00:46:43,897
-This you have to remove the top soil layer completely.

701
00:46:43,897 --> 00:46:48,016
It depends on where you are somewhere, because in some places ...

702
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:51,683
For example, our neighbor has a very nutrient-poor lawn-

703
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,389
-Where the grass does not get very high.

704
00:46:55,453 --> 00:46:57,746
There had been no problem-

705
00:46:57,746 --> 00:47:02,492
-But if you have moss, you have to tear it off.

706
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:06,580
Yes, and so there, because then you have to wear soil quite easily.

707
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,738
That's good.

708
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:11,564
Then I don't know why it's moss there.

709
00:47:11,564 --> 00:47:14,064
I'm not very good on lawns.

710
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:19,267
It may be that it is shady, then you should think about which seeds you sow-

711
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:21,148
-and that they can withstand shade.

712
00:47:21,148 --> 00:47:23,997
There are different types of shadows and soil-

713
00:47:23,997 --> 00:47:27,830
-S then maybe lime does matter ...

714
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:32,667
A wise key rule can be-

715
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:39,810
-while you try to find seeds around, because you collect in the immediate area-

716
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:44,048
-So there is a greater chance that it is suitable for the ground you have.

717
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:46,492
If it is shady then you can look in the shade.

718
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:50,167
It is not as difficult as many may think-

719
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,937
-Collecting seeds yourself.

720
00:47:51,937 --> 00:47:56,698
It's easy for those of you who know, I found tuber bell-

721
00:47:56,698 --> 00:47:59,365
-and they look like a blue clock reason.

722
00:47:59,365 --> 00:48:02,921
-You have to know what it is you gather. -Yes, you have to do that.

723
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,651
You should be absolutely sure what you gather, and check in a flora.

724
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:09,960
You risk picking something that is protected-

725
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:15,700
-And you may not collect its seeds at all, but on roadside and road branches for example.

726
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:17,511
You can...

727
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:24,067
This by getting some seeds or hay of any-

728
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,622
-Is a pretty good way around it, because then maybe you can-

729
00:48:27,622 --> 00:48:32,495
-Lite threatened plants on the purchase, which you must not go out and collect.

730
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:38,924
You can also buy from the company selling seeds-

731
00:48:38,924 --> 00:48:40,559
-and test it.

732
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:47,686
They also have different seed mixtures for, for example, moisture or shade.

733
00:48:51,225 --> 00:48:54,804
There has been a comment, but you have already said what you were thinking about-

734
00:48:54,804 --> 00:48:58,653
-If beekeepers in southern Sweden can pose a threat to pollinators.

735
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:05,900
-It's no more aspect of that? -I don't know how big the problem is.

736
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,956
One should keep in mind that honey bees have been here for a long time-

737
00:49:08,956 --> 00:49:11,933
-So what has changed is that we today have less flowers-

738
00:49:11,933 --> 00:49:15,211
-and higher densities of honey bees.

739
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:20,306
Normally you can't have so many nests in one place-

740
00:49:20,306 --> 00:49:22,858
-As you can today, when they live in beehives.

741
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:27,231
So the conditions have changed, but the species we have in southern Sweden-

742
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:29,564
-Shey manage to coexist with honey bees.

743
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:33,405
Otherwise, they would not have been here, because there have been honey bees for so long.

744
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,533
How do you best cut a meadow? Should you go with Lie as before?

745
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:47,771
The best thing is late summer when it starts to seed off-

746
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:49,707
-But how to do?

747
00:49:50,048 --> 00:49:55,239
At the ecology house they have cut with edge mowers in the past-

748
00:49:55,239 --> 00:50:00,152
-But now it is usually a mower guild, and then they beat with scythe.

749
00:50:00,152 --> 00:50:02,905
But it is mostly a romantic thing, do you have to go with scythe?

750
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:06,016
One must not do that, the important thing is that it is cut down-

751
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:08,445
-In the end of the season, and that it may seed off

752
00:50:08,445 --> 00:50:12,540
-But then moved away before the industry has returned to the ground.

753
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:17,294
The lean earth becomes more diversity, because there they can do here?

754
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:19,278
There will be less competition.

755
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:22,310
It might be good to mention-

756
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:29,167
-that in a nitrogen-rich soil so some plants grow very fast-

757
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:32,698
-And they take over, and there is no space for the others.

758
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:37,071
If you have a nitrogenous soil instead, they grow slowly-

759
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:39,540
-And then it can fit a lot more.

760
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,492
That is why we biologists and ecologists want nutrient-poor ground-

761
00:50:43,492 --> 00:50:47,405
-In the place of nutritious land, while farmers want nutritious ground-

762
00:50:47,405 --> 00:50:48,960
-Then you can produce more.

763
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,444
In a garden you want both and, because you want both diversity

764
00:50:52,444 --> 00:50:54,651
-and some vegetable cultivation.

765
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,008
Then you can put over the grass clip on the vegetable cultivation-

766
00:50:58,008 --> 00:51:00,294
-So it gets more nutrition.

767
00:51:00,782 --> 00:51:05,742
We'll tie the bag together and finish, but I thought ...

768
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:10,767
You often have a small garden, and many want to make efforts-

769
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:13,219
-And farmers need to focus on cultivation.

770
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:17,667
Who will get to the diversity on a larger plane?

771
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:19,175
How to think there?

772
00:51:20,032 --> 00:51:24,000
It is probably not wrong to start with yourself.

773
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,325
Many have garden and live in the city-

774
00:51:26,325 --> 00:51:30,048
-But there is very little insects in cities-

775
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:34,261
-So even if you only have one balcony it can help-

776
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:37,523
-That you choose domestic plants there.

777
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:41,507
Do they find here? After all, it is far for them to fly.

778
00:51:41,507 --> 00:51:45,666
-I think they find the plants. -After a while.

779
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:48,174
They have good sense of smell?

780
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:51,285
It depends on which ...

781
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:57,063
Those who live here, for example, have all this below.

782
00:51:58,388 --> 00:52:02,158
I believe that continuity is important, and that one looks to-

783
00:52:02,158 --> 00:52:05,904
-Do when there is something in one place, there may be there for quite long-

784
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:08,293
-for sooner or later the species are spreading-

785
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:10,269
-and then it can show up ...

786
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:12,578
-Patience. -Yes exactly.

787
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:18,764
There may be large landowners who can also think about this.

788
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:25,097
Then we also have agricultural support designed by elected politicians-

789
00:52:25,716 --> 00:52:29,629
-So it is also about how to choose to push their politicians-

790
00:52:29,629 --> 00:52:32,391
-Or where you choose to cast your vote.

791
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:36,894
Do you have any message that you want to convey here?

792
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:43,942
I think that as a gardener and private person-

793
00:52:43,942 --> 00:52:48,481
-Not should make it a whole science, but you should make it easy.

794
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:54,275
After all, it is not wrong to have these exotic plants-

795
00:52:54,275 --> 00:52:58,029
-or a seed mixture that you do not know where it comes from.

796
00:52:58,029 --> 00:53:01,854
-You can start, so it will be fun. -I feel hopeful about this.

797
00:53:01,854 --> 00:53:05,322
So I don't have to have a bad conscience for my roses at home?

798
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:06,322
No.

799
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:09,901
I also think it is important to give yourself permission-

800
00:53:09,901 --> 00:53:11,846
-to relax in the garden.

801
00:53:11,846 --> 00:53:15,067
That one does not need to mow the lawn so often-

802
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,686
-or clear away all flowering weeds.

803
00:53:17,686 --> 00:53:20,067
Take a cup of coffee, their down-

804
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:24,702
-And enjoy the little insects that you haven't noticed before.

805
00:53:25,797 --> 00:53:27,987
It sounds inspiring, I think.

806
00:53:27,987 --> 00:53:31,067
Thank you so much, and thank you to you who have listened.

807
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:36,357
