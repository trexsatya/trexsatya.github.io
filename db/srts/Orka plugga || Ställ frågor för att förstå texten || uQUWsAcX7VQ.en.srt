00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,920
One way to remember what you
read is to ask question to the text.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,760
Questions such as: "When?" "How?"
"Where?" "Who?" and "Why?"

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,640
When was the Renaissance?
How often is there an EU election?

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,040
Why is sleep so important? Tell
yourself that you want to know more.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,400
Be curious about what happens next
and what you will learn later on.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,240
When you ask questions to the text,
you use your knowledge:

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,120
There is a period called the
Renaissance. The EU has elections.

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,920
And that you have to sleep.
By constantly asking questions-

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,120
-the brain keeps working,
and what you read sticks more easily.
