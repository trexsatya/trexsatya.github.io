1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,280
A house with minimal impact on environment and climate-

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,920
-Built inside a glass house on a height in the forest near Lake VÃ¤nern beach.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,080
Could it be an example of the accommodation of the future?

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,800
At least it believes Anders Solvarm, whose natural villa has built the house.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,400
Now we are in a wooden house, you might say.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,280
We try to build with materials that store carbon dioxide.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,080
Wood sucks the carbon dioxide in the air and then it is stored.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,680
Actually, it is a regular residential building that we move in.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,960
But when you go out into this space-

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,320
-Between outdoors and residential part, you end up in a garden.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,040
Electricity and heat come from the sun during the summer.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,480
In winter, batteries are recharged using biodiesel.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,400
There is no connection to the mains.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,880
The water comes from its own well.
 From the drain, fertilizer is extracted to the cultivation-

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,440
-Or which is found in the greenhouse that surrounds the residential part.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,920
We have got started and sown some autumn sowing here.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,840
The idea is that it will come up kale, spinach and salad which is a bit winter resistant.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:27,160
It must stand here so you have a salad buffet in winter.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,640
You live in a way a little grand in the food that you pick.

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,360
Does this part never need to be heated?
 Not even winter time?
 Is it enough with the sun?

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,200
Now only single glass in the greenhouse is unheated.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,440
It is important, otherwise it would be a huge energy pay.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,000
We only warm up the housing part.
 The point of so that the more durable varieties-

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,320
-As they can tolerate a little frost.
 There will be a little frost here in the winter.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,040
It's just a single glass.
 It rains, snows or never blows.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,280
But it gets cool and cold in winter.

27
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,520
Not as cold as outside, but it can be minus degrees.

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,160
Almost SEK 8 million costs it for those who want to put the mittens on the house-

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,680
-As is currently out for sale.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,600
The economy is that you do not receive any invoice.

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,640
So the house costs nothing, besides having to buy some firewood in winter-

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,160
-and some biodiesel to charge your batteries.

33
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,560
Extremely low operating costs.
 In a longer perspective, it is often the large cost of the house.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,280
Maintenance and operating costs are very small.

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,200
It is an expensive investment that pays off in the longer term.

36
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,480
It warms in winter, but doesn't it get very hot in the summer?

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,200
Yes, it will be.
 That's all worried about.

38
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,320
Yes, it will be, but we have a small system for it.

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,040
The most important thing is that there are gaps in the ceiling that open.

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,960
Warm air rises upwards.
 As long as it is cooler on the outside-

41
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,880
-Is it quite easy to cool down your greenhouse.

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,560
When the really hot, hot summer days-

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,320
-We need to have shade.
 Here we stand under a small shadow wall.

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,800
The best shade is obtained when the wine has grown up.

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,400
The wine is going up here.
 In addition to the leaves giving shadow-

46
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,520
-So they transpire.
 They are eating water vapor.

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,920
Then the temperature is lowered in the air.
 Energy goes to evaporate.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,040
Perspire.
 It's kind of like when we sweat.

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,080
Then the temperature is lowered.

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,920
Shade, plants and ventilation, then it will be nice.
