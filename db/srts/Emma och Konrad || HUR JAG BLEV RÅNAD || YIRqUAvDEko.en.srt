00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:09.440
Hello! Today we're doing a Story Time about this crazy thing I encountered.


2
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:19.380
You guys encouraged me to tell this scary and crazy experience.


3
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.340
I just started my first year in high school, about 5 months in cause we had winter jackets.


4
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.100
It's not summer it's kinda dark at 9-10 PM.


5
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.820
Me and my friend Tim was in Ã…kersberga (Swedish suburb in Stockholm)


6
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.240
We just had recorded a music video for school for Britney's Toxic.


7
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.680
Pretty random but my classmates choose the song.


8
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.040
The shoot when really well, our mood was on top. "We're getting an A+" we we're thinking.


9
00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.700
When we arrive to the station next train leaves in 30 minutes, which kinda sucked.


10
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.620
It's a very boring and plain station, there's like 5-6 other people on the platform to our right.


11
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.560
It's not very crowded in other words.


12
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.060
It's two guys in their 20s and some older people about ten meters from us.


13
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.860
Tim light's a cigarett and we're trying to kill time.


14
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.880
Out of nowhere a guy comes up to us.


15
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.160
"Hey can I get a cigarett?"


16
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.100
Tim pulls upp his cigarett pack.


17
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.720
It's pretty usual that smokers ask each other for smokes, I think to myself.


18
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.140
Right when Tim hand is stretched out with the smoke package.


19
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.180
BAM!


20
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.240
He grabs his arm and twist's it.


21
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.180
Men and Tim is like "WHAT, WTF ARE YOU DOING?"


22
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.560
Right when we're shouting two other guys comes up behind us.


23
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.680
One guy rip's the cigaretts's out of Tim's hand


24
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.640
The other guy pushes me away from Tim.


25
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.080
In this moment...I get really shocked.


26
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.760
This stuff doesn't happen to you open on a train station.


27
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.640
It's such a crazy thing to go down.


28
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.080
Right away I'm starting to move back to Tim.


29
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.460
Two guys a wrestling Tim.


30
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.220
As soon as the third guy sees me walking towards Tim again.


31
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.760
He grabs me here (showing where), and throws me into a waiting booth.


32
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.360
A waiting booth with a bench and walls around it to protect from the wind in metal.


33
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.740
I remember the pain I felt when I hit the metal wall.


34
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.920
When I open my eye's again.


35
00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.900
The two guys are standing 10-20 centimeters from my face.


36
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.940
Now i'm super scared.


37
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.480
I panic.


38
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.380
I feel my pulse raising.


39
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.660
I feel empty.


40
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.320
I see the two guys trying to talk to me in someway very aggressively.


41
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.080
But I can't hear a thing.


42
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.200
Everything is going in slow motion in my head.


43
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.680
Suddenly...the silence breaks and I hear a tinnitus sound in my head.


44
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.880
I just got struck right over my ear.


45
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.000
It's like I'm waking up from the panic.


46
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.000
Now I finally hear what they're saying to me.


47
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.040
I hear..


48
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.580
"This is a robbery".


49
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.980
Then I feel something something sharp against my throat. Really uncomfortable.


50
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.180
Then I see a kitchen knife, which the guy in the gray hoodie puled out.


51
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.180
It's shifting between a few centimeters and touching my throat.


52
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.420
He repets himself saying: "This is a robbery".


53
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.080
"Give me your phone".


54
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.760
My brain collapses.


55
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.800
The only thing I want to do..


56
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.480
Is to give this guy my phone..


57
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.620
But my body..


58
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.060
Doesn't want to move how much I wanted it too..


59
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.660
I wanted to dig through my pockets.


60
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.720
My muscles and arms doesn't connect.


61
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.380
I see how the guys get's angrier and angrier.


62
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.200
Cause I don't answer them or do anything. I'm just standing there frozen.


63
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.980
It's like being trapped inside your own body.


64
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.960
Then I get woken up from this state with a punch in my stomach.


65
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.860
I remember loosing my breath and starting to cough.


66
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.600
It really hurts.


67
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.160
My brain is such a mess right now.


68
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.800
I'm starting frantically going through all my own pockets.


69
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.620
In reality I always have my phone in my right pocket.


70
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.260
But right now I have no idea where it is.


71
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.180
After I've gone through all of my pockets..


72
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.000
I give them my phone, keys and bus ticket.


73
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.840
He took my phone and shoved the rest to the ground.


74
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.380
I see my friend laying down on the ground...coughing.


75
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.380
The two guys starts moving towards him.


76
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.680
The only thing I want to do..


77
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.620
..is to drag them away from Tim.


78
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.320
Now it's 3 v 1.


79
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.440
I only got one thought in my head..


80
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.900
..what if we DIE now?


81
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.960
I might never meet..


82
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.720
..my lovely mom again,


83
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.000
My family.


84
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.180
My cat.


85
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.160
Or Tim.


86
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.440
I can't move.


87
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.060
I stand there frozen in a spot.


88
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.320
Nothing works or responds.


89
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.700
After a while.


90
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.880
They drag Tim up on his feet.


91
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.320
Puts him next to me.


92
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.200
They start debating whether to steal our jackets or not.


93
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.420
I feel so humiliated.


94
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.400
They end up laughing at us.


95
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.080
The brand on our jackets isn't fine enough for them.


96
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.260
We both had jackets from a pretty common sports store.


97
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.500
So humiliating.


98
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.640
They just robbed us and now they're laughing at us.


99
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.540
Fuc*ing pricks.


100
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.800
The guy in the gray hoodie approaches me.


101
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.860
I can see him holding the knife in the pocket.


102
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.480
He says:


103
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.240
Don't tell anybody.


104
00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.480
We got our eyes on you.


105
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.400
Don't call the police.


106
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.320
Don't do anything.


107
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.020
We have somebody watching you on the station.


108
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.520
Just go home.


109
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.100
He says ice cold.


110
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.680
Then they starting to leave like nothing happened.


111
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.840
They disappear around a corner.


112
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.780
I feel such a relief.
