6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,960
Now let's get going with this video

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,080
Buying shares is pretty easy

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,920
I would almost say it is easier today to buy shares than to go to Ica and buy snickers.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
So why do you want to own shares?

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Well, that's partly to make money.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,640
When you buy shares you buy part of a company.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,680
What this means is that you actually have the right to influence this company.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,760
You thus own a small part of the company and thus become a shareholder.

14
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,800
When you are a shareholder you have the right to receive a portion of the profits that this company makes.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,160
Not all companies distribute their profits

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,080
But many of them do, especially the larger, more stable companies.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,280
So every year or every quarter you can see their profits

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,960
That may increase over time

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,240
That will make you more money over time as the company makes more profit

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,400
So over time you can make quite a lot of money investing in stocks

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,880
Another benefit is that over time as the company makes more money

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,520
So hopefully the price of the shares will increase

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,880
So when it's time to sell, you sell with a pretty big profit, and there you can make money, too.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Smart eh? (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,040
This is one of the advantages of buying shares.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
There are also disadvantages to buying shares

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Keep in mind that it is a pretty high risk

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,680
So there is a chance that you will lose money as well

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,200
If so, you do not really know what type of stock you are buying

30
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,280
Among other things, the company can go bankrupt, and then you can lose your entire investment

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,480
It may not be likely that the company will go bankrupt, but there is still a chance, think about it!

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,160
When you invest in shares, it goes up pretty quickly, and down pretty quickly.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
It is high risk as I said, so keep in mind that you can lose money pretty quickly.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,200
It was a little short on stocks, so I think we will jump into the next topic to take us one step closer to how to buy stocks

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,600
And the next step to buy shares is to have an account.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
You must therefore have a bank account on which you can buy shares.

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,360
And what I recommend is that you have an account at Avanza Bank, or Nordnet Bank.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,360
There are two stock brokers that are focused on buying and selling shares

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
And makes it pretty easy for you to trade shares through

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,000
These two brokers make it free for you to buy shares on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,320
So if you are a new customer you can trade shares without a commission up to SEK 50,000 versus SEK 80,000.

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
When you are a new customer, completely free of charge.

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,040
However, be aware that this is about shares on the Stockholm Stock Exchange

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,280
Check which list the stock is listed on

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Before you buy your shares for the first time.

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,880
So it really is free of charge without this commission fee.

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,280
Once you have registered an account to buy and sell shares at such a bank

48
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Yes, then you are ready for the next step!

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,720
Now that you have an account registered with an online broker

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,480
it's time for the next step - and it's opening a tax scale.

51
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
Thus, a small box in which to store your shares or funds.

52
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,760
When you register with Avanza or Nordnet, it is almost always the case that a Share &amp; Fund account is opened

53
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,680
And it is the usual traditional type where you estimate 30% on the profit.

54
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,080
You will also be asked if you want to open an investment savings account or capital insurance.

55
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,680
The most common thing today when trading Swedish shares is that you have them in an investment savings account.

56
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,320
Is it that you want to know more about how these different account types work,

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,400
So I link to an article below on SparaCash that easily explains the difference between these three.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,120
But in this guide I recommend that you use an ISK. Now we move on to the next step.

59
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,360
Find Shares - Which stock should you buy?

60
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,100
After all, you have to make an active choice for the type of stock you are interested in buying.

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
And then you might be thinking

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
Should I have Swedish shares?

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,240
US stocks?

64
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,160
Dividend Stocks?

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,840
Investment company shares?

66
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,640
And it's pretty hard to know

67
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,800
There are a bunch of different stocks. 
It is quite difficult to choose which type of shares to hold.

68
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,000
Avanza and Nordnet have different stock lists

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
So you can filter out and check

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
And think about which stock suits you well

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,840
For example, you can filter by how many people own this stock

72
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,660
Or, how good the share has been for 3 months, 3 years or other.

73
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,480
And there you can then make a choice yourself.

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,020
Based on which stock you are interested in.

75
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,460
What I usually advise beginners about is to buy investment companies.

76
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,040
It is a company that in turn invests in other companies.

77
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,880
Examples of two common investment companies are Investor and Industrivärden.

78
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,960
Is it that you do not feel ready to buy shares? It's totally calm!

79
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,340
Then you might be able to read a book about stocks instead, and start by buying a fund instead.

80
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,760
Once you decide which stock to buy

81
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,560
Then also think about, how long should you own the share?

82
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,120
When should you choose to sell this stock?

83
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,840
Or should you own the stock all the time, ie for life?

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's up to you to decide!

85
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,580
Now it's time for us to buy shares!

86
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,180
So I was going to show you how it goes ;-)

87
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,220
If you are not already a customer at Avanza, there is a link below

88
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,120
you can click on Avanza and register.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Then you just have to honk and drive.

90
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,520
So now we jump into how to buy shares on Avanza

91
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,520
So I'll start by logging in and clicking here on the search box

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,200
Then I search for a share that I have which is Plejd.

93
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,040
Then we click on Plejd, so

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,960
Then we press Buy.

95
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,920
Now I show the simplified purchase box on the computer of a share.

96
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
So if you click on settings here

97
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,120
Then you see that you can choose a simplified view or a standard view.

98
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,260
But now I think we will start with the simpler stock view of how to buy and we will go through it

99
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
First you have an account

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,160
It is therefore which (share) account you want to buy shares on.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,960
Here you get up, for example your regular AF account which we see here at the bottom.

102
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Or your investment savings account, if you don't have one then open one.

103
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,440
Or a capital insurance.

104
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,480
I choose to buy shares in my long-term investment savings account

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,640
Here I already see how many shares I have in this account

106
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,160
And then you see your average price, ie your purchase price.

107
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,080
If you do not already have the share, it will only say Number in the account: 0

108
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,240
In amount, you enter how much you want to buy shares for.

109
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,800
In my case we say SEK 100.

110
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,280
What Avanza does then is that in Number it automatically fills in

111
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,680
How many shares you can afford to buy, for the amount you have entered.

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
In the former field.

113
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,840
And it also pre-fills what it costs to buy the shares

114
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,840
Yes, a share is currently priced at Pledge 72.20.

115
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,160
As it has pre-filled here

116
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,080
From SEK 100 for which I wanted to buy shares, it has automatically counted down to SEK 72.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,680
Now I see here that I had order terms opened

118
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
and it's something we can remove

119
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,560
To buy these shares, I just press buy.

120
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:35,960
I find it rather ironic that I make the same mistake that I myself have talked about NOT doing.

121
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,600
If you know what a mistake it is I make a comment below 🤦

122
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,920
There they went through and I have now bought 1 share in Plejd.

123
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,080
If we scroll down, we see here during the End of the Day

124
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,000
That we have bought shares in Plejd.

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,740
It was no more difficult than that

126
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Awesome, now I've shown you how to buy shares

127
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
So now it's up to you to have patience

128
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Keep in mind that stocks have a high risk

129
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
So think about how long you will own them

130
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
And it is recommended that you have shares for at least 3-5 years

131
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Or that you see it as a savings horizon to

132
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,440
Money you invest in shares is money you should manage to be without for 3-5 years at least.

133
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,520
Think about it, keep in mind that it will swing a lot. It goes up a lot and it goes down a lot.

134
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,880
So be patient now that you have these shares.

135
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,120
