1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,352
The best thing about reading the PIKA program is that you get in a sports class.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,800
I have grown a lot as a person by being able to become friends with and spend time with other elite athletes his has

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,620
Similar ambition and similar lifestyle like me.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,920
Pika - professional sports career and working life, 180 credits

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,080
Pika - an education for you who are elite athletes - regardless of sports

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,700
Jesper Littorin is my name, I go professional sports career and working life and I play golf.

7
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,880
The best thing about studying with other athletes is that we get to learn things from each other.

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,580
Even though we are doing different sports, still very much similarities are

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01.020
Especially the mental part is very similar in all sports,

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,140
And it is above all what we learn from each other.

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07.840
My name is Tobias Tisell and plugged the Pika program at Halmstad University

12
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,656
With a focus on Golf here on the elite environment.

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,700
Today I have stopped playing golf and working as a project coordinator at

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,840
Corporate incubator high five in Halmstad.

15
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,944
The courses on the Pika program have helped me very much in my working life around that

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,300
put a structure in everyday life around my work, set goals

17
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,020
Be able to adapt very much to the rest of the environment in the workplace.

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,860
Generally speaking, the courses have helped to create strategies, think step ahead,

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,080
Which is very common as an athlete and sports woman.

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,680
My name is Alice Andersson and I am a road cyclist and read last year on the Pika program.

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,480
I started reading on the Pika program because I am an elite athlete

22
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01.440
and I was looking for any employment that I could have in combination with my elite sports

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,260
Which was still fun and felt evolving.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,000
So when I heard about the Pika program here in Halmstad, I was super tagged.

25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,820
I did not know that you could read sports science at the university level

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,860
So when I heard about it, I felt it suited me perfectly.

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,780
The students have access to three elite environments: golf, table tennis and equestrian sports.

28
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,940
It is good to have an elite environment in golf is to

29
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,400
We get about the conditions we need to be able to develop and succeed.

30
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,080
There are not many places that exist here in Halmstad.

31
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,940
Then we also have access to the gym here at the university and it is fantastic that we get it

32
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,120
There is everything we need to be able to develop physically.

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,180
My name is Michaela Karlsson and I have studied a spike and I graduated this summer.

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,500
After my education, I got a position as a writer at the Swedish Table Tennis Association,

35
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,360
And also a very honorable role as the league captain for the youngest girls.

36
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,860
I learned a lot about not just ..

37
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,500
... psychology or nutrition without i learned a lot about myself as a person

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,400
And it has developed me and I am very grateful that I was studying at college,

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,240
And that I am there as I am today.

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,680
If I am not doing golf so I will probably keep up with something in sports,

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,200
And then this is a fantastic education to have in the back.
