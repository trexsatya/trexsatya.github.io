MotornÃ¶rd = Engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,440
Sven Billred odd project. 
PART 2.

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,540
Vetlanda Sweden, September 2018.

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,300
-I'm back!
We will follow this project until it is done.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,835
It's all the way up to Elmia 2019.
Yes.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:38,080
-The car should be ready before Easter, right?
Fortunately easter is late next year.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,460
It's late April so there are many months left.

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,700
It have been progress since last time.
Yes.

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,720
I have to get the body done.
I've started here.

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,600
These plates and trunk cover are finished.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,460
The shape is done but it needs some small adjustments.

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,720
It is a little wavy after the English wheel.

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,260
It should be straightened up and smoothed out
with body file before starting to grind.

14
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,300
I also made the trims which
should sit over the joints.

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,000
This is a front trim, here.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,380
I have had to shape it a bit since
so the convertible fit.

17
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,500
So I've had to lower it a bit.

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:32,360
This trim is dimensionally customized.
It sits so tight that it can hardly be removed.

19
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,480
There is a screw mount in the front.

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,560
So you attach it there and also at the back.

21
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,600
The trim is fixed like this and then
it is angled in place at the front edge.

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,040
From the beginning, this is a Volvo 123 (Amazon) trim.

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,535
Which I have to fix because
it has been bent in all directions.

24
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,360
I heated up the trim and stretched it
out so it gets perfectly straight.

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,220
Then I have to weld this one 
so it got something to attach to.

26
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,175
It can be tricky since
it is thin material in stainless steel.

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,380
It works if you are careful.

28
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,280
It's the same kind of trim but I have
narrowed to make it pointed.

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,280
And get another shape at the bottom.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,840
I have done this since the joint is much more pointed.
Otherwise there would be a gap in between.

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,960
Now I've made the trim a little narrower.

32
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,920
The width up here is the same.
The trim then becomes narrower all the way down.

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,660
It fits very well.
-Yes, very good fit!

34
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,320
-How have you manage to do all this?
Long nights hahah..or late nights.

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,560
-It must be more than 4 hours a day, right?
On weekends there will be more, there may be...

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,060
...up to 24 hours on a weekend.

37
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,380
It all depends on how many others
activities I have to go to.

38
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:04,060
-You've dressed the whole rear end!
Actually it went better than expected.

39
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,640
-This was just paper last time I was here?
Yes it was cardboard.

40
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,880
Since then I have completed the inner frame.

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,160
I finished it first then I painted the frame.

42
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,320
Then you template the frame and cut the metal.

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,380
It will be a long piece of sheet metal.
This sheet has been curved in one piece.

44
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,820
And here is the joint.

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,300
It's not so easy when you're alone and going
curve such a long sheet in the English wheel.

46
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,040
Don't have any friends?
Yes, but they don't like to work.

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,300
They are mostly here to watch.
-It's like me then ... Yepp.

48
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,640
You reinforce by adding one
angular profile along the entire frame.

49
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:59,160
I attach the plate with welding rods so I get 
stiffness so I can roll the metal sheet back and forth.

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,220
When I start rolling the sheet it becomes stiffer.

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,820
Then everything should fit.
Everything is handmade around all the rim.

52
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,180
It can't be done with a machine
so then it have to be done with a hammer.

53
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,775
-Wow, what a job!

54
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,940
-The difficult thing is to make two equal sides.
Making one is easier but the other must be the same.

55
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,520
I do not build this body like other car builders do.

56
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:34,080
They build fish skeletons in wood with wooden boards
and then the sheet molds after that.

57
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,680
Then you can place the metal against
the mold and check if it fits.

58
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,380
I don't like working with wood...

59
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,800
I rather do this and measure until it gets right.

60
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,760
It may take longer but it does not matter.

61
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,080
Then I do not have to make a skeleton in wood.

62
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,360
Then have to have pretty good eye measurements.
It was a carpenter who once said...

63
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,060
...a little oblique is not easy as long as you do not see it.

64
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,300
Would it be that it differs a few millimeters
here and there it doesn't matter if nobody sees it.

65
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,660
It has nothing to do with the
construction if it gets little wrong.

66
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,020
I think that's a bit charming for then
you see that it is handmade.

67
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,720
If I would crash with this car, 
you can't buy spare parts they have to be manufactured.

68
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,360
The lock for the trunk is here on the inside.

69
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,500
It sits here.

70
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,760
Now there is a spring here but it will not
be needed when there is a rubber strip here.

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,460
Then the trunk will then open automatically.

72
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:59,380
Possibly there will be gas pistons
or a lock in a fixed position.

73
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,720
It works pretty well.

74
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,420
- Absolutely crazy what a job you have done!
It's a lot of millimeter fit.

75
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:15,140
You have done this too.
Yes it is the platform against the frame

76
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:23,240
Since the frame swings like this
it would have been difficult to get to the line.

77
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,260
Then this line had continued down then up.

78
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,120
Then I thought it was nicer to
put in a piece and get a straight line.

79
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,060
Which is in line with this line.

80
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,180
Then five more of these are added.

81
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,160
All the way down.

82
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,220
We have previously seen a template in cardboard.

83
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,520
These are made of stainless steel and
I have welded the end together.

84
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,540
I will glue the screws to the back.

85
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,920
Which is cut into the holes and screwed into place.

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:08,400
Here on the edge a friend has made small brass hats that will...

87
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,775
...be glued so it looks like a brass cut.

88
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Like this one but they
others are too small for my lathe.

89
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,440
They are made in an automatic lathe instead.

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,340
At the next phase it is...

91
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,040
...the doors and the torpedo.

92
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,940
The torpedo is just a basic construction so far.

93
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,135
Here, reinforcement beams should be put down like this.

94
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,060
In a potential collision with a
deer, elk or a passenger car.

95
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,780
It should be a support up here.
So it can be folded down.

96
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,060
And don't come along then I should be safe.

97
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,380
I have made a door template.
I'll bend the sheet metal around.

98
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:01,200
So I get a light bend that goes
along with the torpedo around here.

99
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,640
The sheet from the torpedo will be curved
and then the sheet parts meet around here.

100
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,940
The door will follow the line and then down.

101
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,880
The second sheet part will be aligned with the door.

102
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,240
The shape continues up to the dashboard
all the way to the other door.

103
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,560
The whole curve on the torpedo
will be handmade.

104
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,980
I have made a special tool.

105
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,020
I pin it on the metal piece.
and start shaping.

106
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,180
I've knotted it so it attaches
on the metal sheet and not slip away.

107
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,620
The length I have to adjust as you can
make a turn without it getting angular.

108
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,660
We do this instead.

109
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,520
Attach it.

110
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,780
Like this.

111
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,400
Then you have to tap the last.

112
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,840
Also bend with a pair of pliers.

113
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,820
Then you get the right rounding and then
you can move the pliers afterwards.

114
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,780
Then it will be the same rounding all the way.

115
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,920
It will bend slightly so it goes all the way.

116
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,540
Then it becomes a soft line all the way.

117
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,740
-How thick is the aluminum?
2 millimeters.

118
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,620
It is semi-hard aluminum.
I don't want too soft for then...

119
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,180
...then there will be no hardness in it
and then it expands too much.

120
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,700
-Now we have a sound that has made a comeback.
Now it sounds again.

121
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,560
The fluorescent lamp sound also 
wants to be included in the film.

122
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,060
Yes the fluorescent lamp lives its own life in the garage.
-Yes it's quiet then it starts to creak.

123
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,820
When it comes to interior I have
made a chair to begin with.

124
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
To see if it will fit.

125
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,380
It is a prototype that should be cut down
so it is easier to step in and out.

126
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Then make another chair.
This is the padding that will be used.

127
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,460
It won't look like this
it will be covered in black leather.

128
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,240
Also leather around the edges.

129
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,100
A bit of the aluminum will be visible
because I want some of the raw material left.

130
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,840
A wall must be manufactured behind the seats.
And the wall will bend as much as the body.

131
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,400
Here there will be a couple of speakers.
I don't know I can hear anything but we will see.

132
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,660
I hope the car will be quiet anyway.

133
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,500
In the middle there will be a podium for the gear lever.

134
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,300
- Should the gear lever be high or low?
It will be very low.

135
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,220
It is a control from a boat.

136
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
It is probably from the 1920s.

137
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,340
I don't really know what it has been
to but some kind of controls for a boat.

138
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,440
This control should be gear shift.
-It'll be an automatic gearbox, right?

139
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,020
The second slider will
open and close the exhaust control.

140
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,900
And it should sit here.

141
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,100
This piece I will not do anything with.
It should look old.

142
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,720
However, I'll make a cover here.

143
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,680
I will try to get hold of a carpet.

144
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,840
And it should be rough in the material.
A bit like a doormat.

145
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,600
A copy of the headlights.

146
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,820
Yes we've seen them, 
Where should you place them?

147
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,620
They should sit here.

148
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,620
It gets in between the trims.

149
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:45,540
Then I will also add a reflex.
Have not decided if it should be lowered.

150
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,260
Make a recess and get this in.

151
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,380
Or if I hang the reflex under.
We have to wait and see.

152
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,140
-Where should you put the petrol tank?

153
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,580
Under this plate.

154
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:07,660
Then it will be built so that
it will follow this line.

155
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,560
The idea is to follow this line along the frame.

156
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,960
You should not see that it is a tank without it
it should look like the body continues underneath.

157
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,720
-Is the idea going from side to side?
Yes it goes inside of the frame.

158
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,360
And the idea will extend over here.

159
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,800
-Where should the fuel lid sit?
It will sit here.

160
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,200
It will be an old model with a quick opening.

161
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,960
-How big is the fuel tank?
About 67 liters.

162
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,620
About 67 liters?
Yes according to my calculations.

163
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,300
The goal is at least 65 liters
and then I can drive about 400 km.

164
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,900
The car will consume more than 1 liter
the every 10 km I can guarantee.

165
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,940
Well an inline 12 I'll guess consume more than a liter.
Yes.

166
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,020
Then it depends on the gearing you have on the rear axle
and how big the wheels it is and how easily it rolls.

167
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,340
This car will not have as much resistance.

168
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,960
It is a fairly small and narrow body.

169
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,380
The air resistance will be quite
small so I don't think it will be that much.

170
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,920
Next time you come I hope so
the torpedo and the doors are done.

171
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,680
-It feels like you want to continue to work?
Yes there are things to do.

172
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,240
-Then they have to wait for the next episode.
You're welcome!

173
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,540
See ya!
Bye.
