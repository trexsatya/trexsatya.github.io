1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,300
-Now i am back!
 We will be able to follow this entire project.

2
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,835
Until Elmia it is intended.
 Yes.

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:38,080
-The car should be ready at Easter, huh?
 And Easter is since next year thank goodness.

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,460
It is the end of April so there are many months left.

5
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,700
It has happened a little neighbor since last time.
 Yes some.

6
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,720
I have to get the body ready.
 I've started here.

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,600
These plates and this door are done.

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,460
The foundation is clear but it must be directed.

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,720
It is a bit wavy after the English wheel.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,260
It should be directed and smoothed out with armored file before starting to grind.

11
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,300
I have also made the moldings that will sit over the joints.

12
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a front list, here.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,380
I have had to shape it a bit because the convertible to lie against.

14
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,500
So I've had to lower it a bit.

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:32,360
This list is measured adapted.
 It sits so tight so it can hardly be removed.

16
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,480
There is a screw bracket at the forefront.

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,560
So you attach it there and also to the back.

18
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,600
The strip is attached like this and then it is angled in place at the forefront.

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,040
From the beginning, this is a Volvo Amazon List.

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,535
As I have been directed because it has been bent in all directions.

21
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,360
Then I have heated the strip and stretch it out so it becomes completely straight.

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,220
Then you have to weld this one so it has something to attach in.

23
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,175
It can be tricky as it is thin material in stainless steel.

24
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,380
It goes well if you are careful.

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,280
It is the same type of strip but I have narrowed it so it gets pointed.

26
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,280
And got another shape at the bottom.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,840
I have done this because the joint is much more pointed.
 Then there had been air in between.

28
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,960
Now I have made the list a little narrower.

29
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,920
The width up here is the same.
 The strip then becomes narrower all the way down.

30
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,660
It sits well and it is a good fit.
 -Very good fit!

31
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,320
-How have you got all this?
 Long nights hahah..or late evenings.

32
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,560
-It must be more than 4 hours a day?
 On weekends it gets more, it can be ...

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,060
... up to 24 hours on a weekend.

34
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,380
It all depends on how many other activities I have to go on.

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:04,060
-You have dressed the entire rear!
 Well it went better than expected actually.

36
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,640
-This was paper last time I was here?
 Yes it was cardboard.

37
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,880
Since then I have finished the inner frame.

38
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,160
I finished it only then the painting I frame.

39
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,320
Then you template the frame and cut a plate.

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,380
It will be a long plate.
 This plate has been elected in one piece.

41
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,820
And here is the cormorant.

42
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,300
It is not so easy when you are alone and should roll such a long plate in the English wheel.

43
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,040
Do not have friends who show up here?
 Yes, but they don't like to work.

44
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,300
They are mostly here to watch.
 -It's like me then ... yes.

45
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,640
You reinforce by adding an angle profile at the whole frame.

46
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:59,160
I attach the plate with welding bars so I get stiffness in the plate so I can roll the plate back and forth.

47
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,220
When I start rolling the plate, it becomes stiffer.

48
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,820
Then everything should be fitted.
 Everything is hand -knocked around all falsaries.

49
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,180
It is not possible to do with a machine so it is the hammer that applies.

50
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,775
-What job!

51
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,940
-The difficult is to make two equal sides.
 Making one is easier but the other must be equal.

52
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,520
I do not build this body that other car builders do.

53
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:34,080
They build fish skeletons in wood with wooden boards and then shape the plate after that.

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,680
Then you can oppose the plate and check that it fits.

55
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,380
I don't like working with wood ...

56
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,800
Then I would rather do this and template until it gets right.

57
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,760
It may take longer but it doesn't matter.

58
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,080
Then I do not have to make a skeleton in wood.

59
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,360
Then must have pretty good eye measurements.
 It was a carpenter who once said ...

60
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,060
... a little oblique is not easy as long as you don't see it.

61
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,300
Should it be that it differs a few millimeters here and there it does not matter if no one sees it.

62
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,660
It has nothing to do with the construction if it gets a little wrong.

63
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,020
I think that is a little charming because then you see that it is handmade.

64
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,720
Should you collide with this car, you have to make the parts because they cannot be purchased.

65
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,360
The lock to the door sits here on the inside.

66
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,500
It's sitting here.

67
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,760
Now there is a spring here but it will not be needed when there is a rubber list here.

68
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,460
Then the door springs automatically.

69
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:59,380
Possibly there will be gas pistons or if there is to be a lock in a fixed position.

70
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,720
It works amazingly well.

71
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,420
-Shelt crazy what a job!
 There is a lot of millimeter fit.

72
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:15,140
-This you have done this too.
 Yes it is the bottom plate against the frame

73
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:23,240
Since the frame swings like this, it would have been difficult to get to the line.

74
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,260
If this line had continued down.

75
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,120
Then I thought it was nicer to put in a bit and get a straight line.

76
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,060
Which is consistent with this line.

77
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,180
Then there are 5 of these that reinforce.

78
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,160
All the way down.

79
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,220
We have previously seen a template in cardboard.

80
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,520
These are made of stainless steel and I have welded the end together.

81
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,540
I will glue screws on the back.

82
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,920
Which is worn into the holes and screwed up.

83
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:08,400
Here on the edge, a friend has made small brass hats coming ...

84
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,775
... glued so it looks like a brass knit.

85
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Much like this but the others are too small for my lathe.

86
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,440
They are made in an automatic lap instead.

87
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,340
In the next stage it is ...

88
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,040
... the doors and torpedo.

89
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,940
The torpedo is just a basic construction so far.

90
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,135
Here, reinforcement beams should be put down like this.

91
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,060
So we a possible crash with a deer, moose or a passenger car.

92
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,780
So it should be a support up here.
 So it can be folded down.

93
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,060
And don't go along so you sit safely.

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,380
For the doors I have made a template.
 I will knock the plate around.

95
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:01,200
So I get a swing that goes together with the torpedo something here.

96
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,640
The plate from the torpedo will be curved and then the plates meet about here.

97
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,940
The door will follow the line and then down.

98
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,880
The other plate will be in line with the door.

99
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,240
The shape continues up in the dashboard all the way away to the other door.

100
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,560
The entire rounding on the torpedo will be hand -knocked.

101
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,980
I have made a special tool.

102
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,020
I squeeze it on the plate and knock around.

103
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,180
I have grooved it so it attaches to the plate and does not slip away.

104
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,620
The length I have adapting so you can make a turn without it getting angular.

105
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,660
We do this instead.

106
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,520
Attach this one.

107
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,780
That's how.

108
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,400
Then you have to knock the last one.

109
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,840
Also bend with a pliers.

110
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,820
Then you get the right round and then you have to move the pliers each after.

111
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,780
Then it will be the same rounding all the way.

112
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,920
It will be bent a little so it goes in all the way.

113
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,540
Then it becomes a soft line all the way.

114
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,740
-How thick is the aluminum?
 2 millimeters.

115
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,620
It is semi -hard aluminum.
 I don't want too soft for then ...

116
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,180
... then there will be no hardness in it and then it widens too much.

117
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,700
-Now we have a sound that made a comeback.
 Now it sounds again.

118
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,560
The fluorescent lamp also wants to be included in film.

119
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,060
Yes the fluorescent lamp lives its own life in the garage.
 -Yes it is quiet then it starts to crack.

120
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,820
When it comes to the interior, I have made a chair to begin with.

121
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,820
To see what can fit.

122
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,380
It is a prototype to be cut down so it becomes easier to step in and out.

123
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Then make one to a chair.
 This is the padding that will be used.

124
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,460
It will not look like this but will be in black leather.

125
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,240
Even leather here that will go around the edge.

126
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,100
A little of the aluminum will be visible because I want to share the raw material left.

127
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,840
A wall will be manufactured behind the chairs.
 And the wall will swing as much as the body.

128
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,400
Here there will be a couple of speakers.
 If it is possible to hear over the main but we will see.

129
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,660
I hope the car gets quiet anyway.

130
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,500
In the middle there should be a podium for the gear lever.

131
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,300
-Should the gear lever be high or low?
 It gets very low.

132
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,220
It is a control from a boat.

133
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
It is probably from the 1920s.

134
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,340
I don't really know what it has been, but some kind of control for a boat.

135
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,440
This control should be gear lever.
 -It will be an automatic box, huh?

136
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,020
The second slider will be to open and close the exhaust control.

137
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,900
And it should sit here.

138
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,100
I will not do anything about this.
 It should look old.

139
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,720
However, I will make a cover here.

140
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,680
I'll try to get hold of a rug.

141
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,840
And it should be rough in the material.
 A bit like a doormat.

142
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,600
A copy of the front lamps.

143
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,820
-Yes have we seen but what should they sit?

144
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,620
They should sit here.

145
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,620
It will be in between the moldings.

146
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:45,540
Then I will also put a reflex.
 Have not decided if it should be lowered.

147
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,260
Make a recess and get this in.

148
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,380
Or if I hang reflex underneath.
 We'll see how I do.

149
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,140
-Where are you thinking of putting the tank?

150
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,580
It may be under this sheet metal.

151
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:07,660
Then it will be built so that it will follow this line.

152
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,560
The idea should follow this line below the frame.

153
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,960
You should not see that it is a tank but that it should look like the body continues under.

154
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,720
-Is the thought from side to side?
 Yes it goes inside the frame.

155
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,360
And the idea will extend here.

156
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,800
-Where should the fuel cap sit?
 It will sit here.

157
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,200
It will be an old model with a quick opening.

158
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,960
-How big is the idea?
 About 67 liters.

159
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,620
About 67 liters?
 Yes according to my calculations.

160
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,300
I bet on at least 65 liters and then I can drive about 40 miles.

161
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,900
The car will pull more than 1 liter mile I can guarantee.

162
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,940
Well, a straight 12a drinks more than a liter.
 Yes.

163
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,020
Then it depends on the gear you have on rear axle and how big wheels it is and how easily it rolls.

164
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,340
This car will not have such great resistance.

165
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,960
It's a pretty small and narrow body.

166
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,380
The air resistance will be quite small so I don't think it will be so dangerous.

167
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,920
Next time you come, I hope the torpedo and doors have started.

168
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,680
-It feels like you want to work on?
 Yes there are some things to do.

169
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,240
-Then they have to wait for the next section.
 You're welcome!

170
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,540
See you!
 Bye.
