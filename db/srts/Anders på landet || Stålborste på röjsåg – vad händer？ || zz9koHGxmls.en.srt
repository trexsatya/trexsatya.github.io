00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,400
There are many different tools you can connect to a clearing saw

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,740
and today I thought I'd try one like this.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:17,260
It is a steel brush that must be connected to the trimmer and what do you use it for?

4
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,940
Well, to clear slabs and paving

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,580
that have become overgrown with grass and moss.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,820
Here in front of my house, I have exactly that.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,340
It was paved many years ago and over time, grass and moss have

8
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,860
slowly worked their way up and taken over, so now it's on the border.

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,220
It's like a cross between lawn and paving.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,440
But will see if this steel brush works.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,340
You have to think about a few security requirements.

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,000
It says a maximum of 10,000 revolutions per minute, and

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,820
you won't reach that when it comes to the clearing saw.

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,780
And then: use eye protection.

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,700
It feels quite natural too.

16
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,540
You don't want a loose wire to fly off and get stuck in the wrong place.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,740
Start by switching to the right gear.

18
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,540
This would fit and use for the

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,380
protection you have for saw blades and grass blades.

20
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,240
But I'm putting on the guard that's for the trimmer line because I suspect

21
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,720
there's going to be some stuff going around with this.

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,660
The next step is to rake the paving as much as possible

23
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,620
and remove as much rock as possible, so I suspect it

24
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:56,020
will splash this unit down and then Happi can go in.

25
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,180
This is not an activity that you do

26
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,540
together with the dog, but she has to wait while I do this.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,280
This is my first time trying

28
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,500
this so hopefully it goes as intended.

29
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,040
Here we go!

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,880
Yes, it was definitely a dirty job.

31
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,780
Perhaps it should have been done before there was so much soil on top.

32
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,740
But now I've moved on, so I'll take and rake away and sweep and see the result.

33
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,780
I'm guessing that maybe one more round is needed, but pretty promising.

34
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I had a problem. I didn't really know.

35
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,380
Because when this paving has gone this far,

36
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:08,400
you don't know how big the paving is, but think that the edges only had soil.

37
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,240
But then you start shoveling a little, or

38
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:17,900
brushing and then it turns out that there is stone underneath as well.

39
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,260
But like I said, it's not easy.

40
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,640
Now we will see the result soon.

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,980
Far from perfect, but 90% better anyway

42
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,520
I'd say.

43
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
Had I had the waters -

44
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,380
I haven't put the water on yet -

45
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,300
as there is still a risk of frost.

46
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,380
So I had gone over this with the high pressure after.

47
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,140
But how it turns out will come up on

48
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,860
my Instagram, once it has some water on this too.

49
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,820
Then maybe a little post-work is required.

50
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,440
It's hard to see in this cloud of dust that

51
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,300
you work in, but this is how it worked anyway.

52
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,660
You can see more videos about clearing saws here if you are interested.

53
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,840
Thanks for watching! See you again soon.
