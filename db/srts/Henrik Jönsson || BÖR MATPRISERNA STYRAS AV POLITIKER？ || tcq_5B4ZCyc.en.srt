1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
We'll have porridge for the whole family. And sandwiches with whey cheese or liverwurst.


2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:14.080
Food prices are skyrocketing and more and more people are demanding that the government stop the price increases.


3
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.280
Porridge, gruel, yoghurt.


4
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.160
Why are food prices increasing more in Sweden than in the rest of the Nordics?


5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.040
Chocolate milk or eggs for breakfast.


6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:37.040
Can politicians really control food prices? And what happens to an economy that sidelines the free market?


7
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.840
I address these questions in this week's chronicle about 


8
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.840
FOOD PRICES


9
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.640
A proper, nutritionally calculated, breakfast. 
- That sounds awkward.

HENRIK JÖNSSON'S
WEEKLY CHRONICLE


15
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.040
I have a plan.


16
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.240
The character "Sickan" in the crime comedy "The Jönsson Gang" always has a plan.


17
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.580
It's a brilliant plan Sickan, brilliant.


18
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:09.580
As with all grandiose plans, however, the gang's hopes usually come to nothing, with hilarious and disastrous consequences.


19
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:24.260
What have turned out significantly less hilarious, but all the more disastrous, are all of history's attempts to plan the economy.


20
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.640
From the totalitarian command economies behind the Iron Curtain to Venezuela's populist self-mutilating policies,


21
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:45.740
all attempts at state control over the economy have invariably ended in rationing, poverty and economic collapse.


22
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:53.740
It is therefore alarming that the effects of the war economy is once again giving rise to populist demands


23
00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.240
for exactly this type of economic self-destruction in Sweden.


24
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.740
However, it is easy to understand why these extreme ideas are being discussed again,


25
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:14.440
because both inflation and higher prices are currently hitting households hard all across Europe.


26
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:25.440
Milk and eggs 31 percent, bread 20 percent, vegetables 18.5 percent and meat 17.5 percent.


27
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:35.540
Meanwhile, food prices are increasing faster than the inflation, and they are also somewhat higher in Sweden than in our neighboring countries.


28
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.740
We do have high inflation, but food prices have increased almost twice as much.


29
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:51.740
This situation now leads conspiratorial socialists to the conclusion that Sweden's food market is a dysfunctional oligopoly


30
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.440
that must be regulated for the public good.


31
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:05.940
Three companies, who are, in practice, setting the prices. This is something that has very bad effects for ordinary families with children.


32
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.040
Swedish grocery retail is thus dominated by three major players, namely ICA, Coop and Axfood.


33
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.640
A so-called oligopoly market, i.e. three companies own 90 percent of the market.


34
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.420
The Left Party imagines that these perceived problems can be corrected by threatening with political regulations


35
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.220
to force price regulations on food.


36
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.480
One could imagine telling these companies that if we do not reach an agreement,


37
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.460
we are prepared to act politically in different ways.


38
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.220
It does suggest that we need to bring them into a room and talk to them


39
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.620
and discuss how they can stop these price increases.


40
00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:00.520
This intervention is supposed to help the people, fight an unhealthy market and push back inflation


41
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.120
in one swift, hyper-efficient, socialist Alexandrian cut.


42
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.220
The fact that we have higher prices than many comparable countries is due to the current situation in Sweden.


43
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.200
And we have a government that could act but chooses not to.


44
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.000
Pushing food prices down is an important way to push inflation down.


45
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.400
This crowd-pleasing conviction is met by the Minister for Finance Elisabeth Svantesson with the argument that


46
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.600
"price caps create shortages because shortages arise when you have price caps."


47
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:48.480
Because of two things. Price caps do not solve the problem of inflation. Also, when you set a price cap, this results in shortages.


48
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.280
Why do you think there would be shortages? 
- That's what happens when you have a price cap.


49
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.680
Compared to the Left Party's command-economic radicalism, the  circular argument of the Minister for Finance sags


50
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.980
like a slack growth curve in the harsh winds of command economy.


51
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.980
We propose a concrete approach to relate to a concrete market.


52
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:19.580
It becomes very problematic to pitch the idea of ​​markets against the prevailing reality.


53
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.280
Although the left's regulative one-size-fits-all solution may appear to be in solidarity with the immediate needs of the households,


54
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:36.180
this kind of simple solutions to complex problems is actually the very definition of populism.


55
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:43.280
Let me therefore explain, point by point, the real reasons for Sweden's price problems


56
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:52.780
and why the Left Party's solutions would only make EVERYTHING worse for EVERYONE.


57
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.160
"A CAPITALIST
CONSPIRACY"


58
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:06.760
Food prices in Sweden have increased more than the EU average and more than our Nordic neighbors.


59
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.880
It is true that Sweden's food prices have risen somewhat more than in the other Nordic countries.


60
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:20.280
However, the Left Party interprets this difference as Sweden having a uniquely dysfunctional food market


61
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.280
which can only be corrected through government regulations.


62
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.743
We don't have free pricing in this market.


63
00:07:28.743 --> 00:07:32.720
It's three large food companies who decide, completely.


64
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.720
And that's why we have to intervene, because there is no free pricing today, of food.


65
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:45.700
This is actually a double error. Because actually, the Nordic countries' food markets are very similar.


66
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:52.200
In fact, as recently as two years ago Norway itself was investigated for cartel formation.


67
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.600
There is thus no great difference in the Nordic markets that would explain Sweden's higher food prices,


68
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:07.000
although a lush and more competitive food market would of course be desirable throughout the Nordics. 


69
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.700
However, such a competitive development is COUNTERACTED by price regulations, which rather cement the market's current status


70
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:25.700
through politically enforced framework agreements that raise the market entry cost for new actors.


71
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:36.100
The real reasons for Sweden's slightly higher food price costs are actually politically caused - by the left-wing government.


72
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:45.000
But tonight we'll begin with food prices. In one year they have increased by almost 20%.


73
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.300
The measure of price increases that Agenda refers to in this clip is the CPI,


74
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:58.000
the "consumer price index" that monitors the prices that Sweden's consumers actually pay.


75
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:08.400
Already a year ago, Statistics Sweden warned that the consumer price index rose as a result of increased energy and fuel prices.


76
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:17.300
"The high energy prices do not only affect the CPI directly. They will also drive up other prices. [...]


77
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:26.800
Producers such as farmers, taxi companies and car manufacturers all face higher prices for their inputs and transports.


78
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.000
In order to preserve their margins, these in turn need to raise the prices of their products.


79
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.200
This is usually called an indirect effect of price increases on input goods.”


80
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:47.680
Although the CPI is largely affected by the international situation, Swedish decisions on, for example,


81
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:55.980
increasing the reduction obligation for fuel and the forced nuclear power shutdowns have made Sweden's domestic production more expensive.


82
00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:04.160
For several years, the agricultural sector has warned that Sweden's uniquely high reduction obligation would lead to price increases and even the


83
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.760
closure of Swedish farms - and according to the research company Energiforsk,


84
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.660
Swedish energy prices would have been between 30 and 50 percent lower


85
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:23.060
if the left-wing government had not forced the decommissioning of four nuclear power reactors in southern Sweden.


86
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:30.760
In addition to this, the Swedish SEK is falling as a result of Sweden's uniquely low productivity.


87
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:39.960
Sweden's economy is the worst in the entire EU and we are the only country where growth slows down and ends up in the red.


88
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:51.260
...and this economic last place is in turn a result of both careless monetary policy and unbudgeted integration costs.


89
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:59.860
So it is not a capitalist conspiracy that causes Sweden's comparatively large food price increases,


90
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:15.360
but the fact that Sweden's left-wing government deliberately and for several years pursued a policy that made both domestic production and imported goods more expensive.


91
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.040
In hindsight, this can be described as the "trinity of regulatory stupidity",


92
00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:27.840
where power-hungry Social Democrats first became dependent on the regulation-hungry Green Party,


93
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:37.640
and then jointly regulated the energy prices upwards - the consequences of which the Left Party now wants to deal with price regulations.


94
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.960
This strategy is like first drilling holes in the boat, then blaming the crew for sinking,


95
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:50.760
and finally, with water up to one's chin, demanding a ban on drowning accidents.


96
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:58.320
Trying to regulate regulations with more regulations in this way expresses almost poetically


97
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.920
socialism's inevitable path towards societal collapse.


98
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:11.020
I will now explain exactly how this works in ten simple steps!


99
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.440
10 SIMPLE STEPS
.
.


100
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.440
10 SIMPLE STEPS
from price regulations
to societal collapse


101
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:28.860
In a free market, the price of a product is regulated by SUPPLY and DEMAND. If many people want to buy a product, its price rises,


102
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:37.760
but great demand also stimulates the production of the product, until supply and demand are in balance.


103
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:47.260
If a politician introduces PRICE REGULATION of the product, it becomes impossible to balance supply and demand


104
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:57.960
because this tells the producer: "if you cannot produce this product cheaper than what we decide, it must not be sold."


105
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:10.760
This means that less of the product is produced, even though demand continues to increase. Price regulation has now created a SHORTAGE.


106
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:21.160
In order to compensate for the shortage that the price regulation creates, the state now starts to SUBSIDIZE the PRODUCTION of the product.


107
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:32.100
This in turn knocks out other producers, who cannot compete with tax-subsidized production.


108
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.900
Now the state's forecasts and tax capital control all production of the product,


109
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:53.200
but because the consumption pattern is irregular, unpredictable surpluses and deficits arise, which means both queues and waste.


110
00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:04.500
To balance this unpredictability, people start hoarding the product, and black markets emerge outside state control.


111
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:10.400
As a result of the growing black market, the ordinary economy begins to stagnate,


112
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:21.100
and the state must invest more resources in both the price-regulated commodity and in fighting the black markets.


113
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:30.900
The government's cost of producing the products will therefore keep increasing, while the regulated price remains fixed.


114
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:36.500
This leads to the whole economy starting to collapse.


115
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.600
Because of the price regulation, the government's costs for the production of the product are now unsustainable,


116
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.800
and because of the now permanent shortage, RATIONING is introduced.


117
00:14:49.800 --> 00:15:01.400
This means that the state forces an adjustment of the DEMAND so that it matches the SUPPLY it can deliver.


118
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:09.100
The state now starts to regulate more prices, more harshly, in order to cover its rampant production costs,


119
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:15.900
while the economy shrinks in an accelerating vicious cycle.


120
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:28.100
Finally, the economy collapses completely - and when society is plunged into misery and poverty, capitalism is given the blame.


121
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:38.040
These ten points describe exactly how every socialist country ever has collapsed. This is so fundamental,


122
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:48.140
so accepted and so empirically well established that anyone who has studied high-school economics can account for it.


123
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:54.440
This is probably also why Sweden's perplexed Minister for Finance was unable to explain to Camilla Kvartoft


124
00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:03.000
why price regulations lead to shortages: because the connection is so obvious that it would be like suddenly being held accountable for why


125
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.700
gravity causes objects to fall to the ground.


126
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:16.600
So if Sweden's economic situation is partly self-inflicted and cannot be corrected with price regulations,


127
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.400
what should we actually do?


128
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:26.680
THE DIFFICULT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONTROL AND FREEDOM


129
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:34.620
Tellingly, both Left Party economic spokesperson Ali Esbati and party leader Nooshi Dadgostar


130
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:43.820
completely dismiss the 75 years of unanimous economic empiricism that contradicts their market-interventionist policies.


131
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.220
But it wouldn't have any good effects, says Lars Jonung, to introduce a price cap.


132
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:56.580
But Lars is talking about long historical events, many situations that have differed dramatically


133
00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.620
and about which there is still debate.


134
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:06.120
There is a shortage, it also becomes bureaucratic, many economists think that this is simply a bad idea,


135
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.100
that you shouldn't intervene and control a market in that way. 
- There are also many economists who perceive that it is not.


136
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:22.700
But outside of the left's most puritanical study circles in Marxist revolutionary theory, there is no debate at all that command economies do not work.


137
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:31.900
It is also telling that some on the left flank are now comparing the ambition to lower the tax on fuel with price regulation,


138
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:40.200
because it inadvertently shows how little this movement actually knows about economics.


139
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:47.000
Lowering a tax is inherently different from introducing regulation,


140
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.120
as the former frees market forces so that they can self-correct,


141
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.420
while the latter locks down both the economy and the market.


142
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.980
Here are a couple of simple, and most importantly,


143
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:11.180
FUNCTIONING suggestions for those who want lower prices and a healthier economy in both the short and the long term.


144
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:20.080
ONE: To help the households struggling with the high prices in the short term - give them tax breaks.


145
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:29.880
This strengthens both the labor market and households' ability to survive, without having to regulate the market to death.


146
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:40.580
TWO: In order to improve the Swedish economy in the long term and lower prices: give tax deductions for newly established small-scale grocery stores.


147
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:51.580
Make fuels cheaper to stimulate agriculture and the logistics sector - and create long-term conditions for the rapid expansion of nuclear power


148
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:57.780
to drive down the production cost of inputs and the consumer price index.


149
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:12.380
Because just like "Sickan's" persistent plans, the state's economic plans ultimately put everyone involved in deep unfreedom.


150
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.389
