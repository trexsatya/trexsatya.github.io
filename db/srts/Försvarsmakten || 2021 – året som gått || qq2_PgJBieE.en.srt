1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:03,986
2021 has been a year that has gone very well-

2
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:07.866
- True that the pandemic characterized both society and us.

3
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:13,546
We have expanded our business in terms of staff, equipment and new associations.

4
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:17,386
And the most important thing: we build stronger war associations.

5
00:00:17,546 --> 00:00:21,946
We have welcomed 5,000 new recruits to our conscription training.

6
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:28,426
Many of our soldiers have chosen to apply for our vocational and specialist officer training.

7
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:32,666
We have gained more civilian competence and expanded by about 1,000 people.

8
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,586
The trend remains that the proportion of women will increase.

9
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:40,346
A strong staff supply strengthens our ability and endurance.

10
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:44,066
We have re -established three regiments and an aircraft fleet.

11
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:46,106
K 4 in Arvidsjaur.

12
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,466
AMF 4 in Gothenburg.

13
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:50,746
In 13 in Falun.

14
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:53,386
And F 16 in Uppsala.

15
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:56,826
The bandages will contribute to a more sustainable organization -

16
00:00:56,986 --> 00:00:59,746
- Where we will continue to train more conscripts.

17
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:04.346
And we get a clear geographical presence in strategically important areas.

18
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:07,386
We have received new equipment but also renewed existing.

19
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:10,426
Among other things, we have received the Robot System Patriot-

20
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:14,906
- A brand new ability that meets the threat development in our immediate area.

21
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:18,666
With the introduction, Sweden has an opportunity to coordinate the air defense -

22
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:24,254
- With other nations that also have the system in order to increase the operational effect.

23
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:29,946
With our new recruits, re -established regiments and new equipment -

24
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:35.026
- We actively actively actively actively in 2021 to build the defense of the future.

25
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:38,026
The army has had good exercise activities during the year.

26
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:42,546
During the southern front, a reduced brigade was practiced under a division's leadership.

27
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:46,746
Thus, we showed our partners and potential opponents -

28
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:52.226
- That we build a stronger army and thus a safer Sweden.

29
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:58,226
Through exercises like Swenex, the foundation is laid for safety in the immediate area.

30
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:03,146
The Navy also practices with others, such as the Air Force and the Coast Guard -

31
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:07.946
- And has several important international collaborations, especially with the Finnish Navy.

32
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:10,986
During the year, the Navy strengthened the sea surveillance -

33
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:16,634
- And also increased the presence on Gotland for a period, in response to increased activity in the Baltic Sea.

34
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:22,586
The Air Force has protected and monitored Swedish airspace around the clock.

35
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:25,666
The number of conscripts during undergraduate education increases -

36
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:29,786
And the Air Force grows in abilities through education and exercises.

37
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:34.306
Such as the recently implemented air defense exercise.

38
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:40,946
During the autumn, the special associations have been together with American special associations in Sweden.

39
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:43,626
Autumn also meant a historical manager's change -

40
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:48.866
- In the large multinational special associations Task Force Takuba in Mali.

41
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:53,146
The strength is now led by a Swedish colonel from the special associations.

42
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:58,466
The Battle Power Home Guard has now resumed its educational activities after the pandemin -

43
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:02.843
- And started work on the supply of new equipment and new abilities.

44
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:08.106
ÖB has decided to introduce a new central management in 2023

45
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:12,586
- which will provide a clearer and simpler management of operations and operations.

46
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:16,866
Our important international collaborations have continued with full force.

47
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:19,923
So does our collaborations with other Nordic countries.

48
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:26,666
Similarly, our operational planning with countries such as the UK, the United States and NATO has developed.

49
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:34,333
With our international collaborations, our exercise operations and ÖB's decision on a new central management -

50
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:40,026
- We have collaborated in a very good way for a stronger defense force in 2021.

51
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:44,426
Our international efforts are important for the defense of Sweden.

52
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:49.945
Our efforts in Mali are difficult and demanding, but of great importance to Africa and Europe.

53
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:54,685
The effort for several years in Afghanistan has also made a difference.

54
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:59,823
Our part in the evacuation from Afghanistan was an operation of the ultimate class.

55
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:04.906
The Armed Forces play a central role in total defense development.

56
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:09.226
How the total defense is to be developed has been made clear in action:

57
00:04:09,386 --> 00:04:12,845
The document that ÖB and DG MSB have agreed.

58
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:17,746
We must never lose focus on our culture.

59
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:22,106
How we are against each other, and with each other, is important for our ability.

60
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:26,586
With clarifications on the development of the total defense and our central role -

61
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:29,986
- In 2021 we have shown samples of foresight.

62
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:34,986
So that Sweden is better equipped for tomorrow's threat.
