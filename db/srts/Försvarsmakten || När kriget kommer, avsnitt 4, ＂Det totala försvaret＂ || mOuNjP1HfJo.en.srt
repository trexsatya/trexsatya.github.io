1
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:30,738
Arctic, gray zone, AI and soldiers on the ground.

2
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:39,259
But civil society then, how prepared are we?

3
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,800
When the war comes.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,250
As a model railway nerd, you are very impressed by this railway bridge.

5
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,926
This is a model of our modern society.

6
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:28,622
It is used by the Swedish Defense Research Institute to easily and pedagogically show cyber threats.

7
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,751
I have lectured to many pedantic and critical people.

8
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:42.027
Here you show how our through -digitized society can be disturbed and what consequences it can have.

9
00:01:53,415 --> 00:01:57.080
Cyber attacks ... You have a computer, I have a computer.

10
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:03.912
I want to influence you in any way or your business-

11
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:09.657
â€”with my computer asks your computer to do something you don't want it to do-

12
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,054
-or that you don't know it will do.

13
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:18,100
Quite small bus can have disastrous consequences.

14
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:23,022
Chopped water purification becomes the entire block of stomach ailment.

15
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:30,128
If someone goes on the traffic lights, the hospital's emergency clinics can be quickly filled.

16
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:37,474
And what happens if a bridge gets stuck in a raised position due to malicious code?

17
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:47.709
We believe that cyber attacks will be used as a complement.

18
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,276
You do this to make it easier for other types of operations.

19
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:57,739
There is nothing that is used completely isolated and separately.

20
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:06.040
Cyber attacks will not only affect the Armed Forces but also civil society.

21
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:09,598
Toward all or part of the country.

22
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:19,866
There are several ways to destroy, weaken and make a public really bad.

23
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,963
Damage a civilian population can be done in many different ways-

24
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:34,283
-Not only with weapons power, but it can be about basic things.

25
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:40,359
Nothing to eat, no heat, no communication opportunities, no information.

26
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,718
Precisely the lack of the basal is believed to be able to cause great problem-

27
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:50,740
-In our future scenarios on which this series is based.

28
00:03:56,934 --> 00:04:02,754
There is especially a sensitive point that can change more than you first think.

29
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:10,000
You call it "just in time", that is, minimal storage of goods.

30
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:15,747
Everything should instead be on the road, between producer and consumer.

31
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:22,809
Thus, if the transport is broken, there are no goods available.

32
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:26,605
Everything will end, and it quickly.

33
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37.571
Very many supply chains are "just in time".

34
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:46,289
In "Just in Time" concept you see stock, storage and reserves and extra resources as an unnecessary cost.

35
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:52.413
This means that everything should preferably be directly in production or truck between different units.

36
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,830
It is clear that a small tuva often steals a large load.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59.402
It is a risk of crisis preparedness.

38
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:14,233
During the initial phase of the Corona crisis, we saw that everyone wanted the same type of supplies.

39
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,046
That private individuals hamstrade goods are a thing-

40
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29.026
-But political cooperation across borders, did it work?

41
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:34,830
You probably know that several EU countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Bulgaria-

42
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:40,172
-As a result of the pandemic has introduced export restrictions on medical protective equipment.

43
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,617
Something that we have been very critical of from the Swedish side.

44
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:50,981
Of course, we understand that there is a concern, but also in this serious situation we should have a solidarity between EU countries.

45
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:54,666
Trade in medical protective equipment must work.

46
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:04,395
Would this escalate into an even more serious social crisis or armed attack-

47
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:10,000
-To this will mean even greater stress and consequences for society.

48
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:28,875
Lack of healthcare materials and lack of imported food is a matter-

49
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:31,089
-But what we have ourselves then?

50
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:33,450
What we are self -sufficient at?

51
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,633
We have plenty of resources within the country.

52
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:39.430
Cultivable soil and animals.

53
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:45,542
We are self -sufficient in principle when it comes to cereals, eggs and chickens, and some more.

54
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:56.088
On the other hand, these products are dependent on the fact that tractors have diesel, that we have fertilizers and other inputs for agriculture.

55
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59.913
Actually, we are not self -sufficient on anything.

56
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:11,467
In domestic production, we are also entirely dependent on electricity working.

57
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:16,912
Sure, farmers have reserve plants, but fuel is needed for them.

58
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,343
What happens if electricity and fuel are gone for a longer period-

59
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:29,433
-As, among other things, that large animal herds are suffocated because the fans do not work in the animal stables.

60
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:44,680
If the central electricity grid is extinguished in a sufficiently large area, basically nothing works anymore.

61
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:55,649
We lose the lighting, we lose the heat. We lose telecommunications.

62
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59.812
We lose health care, we lose agriculture.

63
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:03,290
We lose all types of bank transmission systems.

64
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07.067
Without the electricity, we no longer have a functioning society.

65
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:17,360
A country that is struggling just to survive is easy to get where one will-

66
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,789
-How competent defense force you have.

67
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:26,204
When one cannot, want or can defend themselves further-

68
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:32,854
-So all offers for a conditional peace are probably easy to accept.

69
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:45,210
There are many parts of society that are important in order to live a normal life under decent forms that we are used to.

70
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:52.304
What is ultimately important from my perspective is the desire to defend the country.

71
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,542
Our freedom and the right to live as we choose ourselves.

72
00:08:56,224 --> 00:09:03,470
When you break that willingness to defense you have defeated the Swedish people.

73
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:05,454
That's what we want to avoid.

74
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:12,230
The Armed Forces alone can only stand for part of the total defense.

75
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,741
Civil society must also be robust.

76
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:20,914
Add to that a high defense will in everyone.

77
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:26,320
Then it becomes a good so -called threshold effect.

78
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:32,615
Military threshold effect is something that Sweden as a nation should provide.

79
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:35.529
It is a total defense affair to have this.

80
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:42,384
The threshold effect prevents an opponent from conducting business that he would like to do-

81
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:47.630
-To the cost and price becomes too great.

82
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,189
When we talk about the threshold effect, we connect it before the war starts.

83
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:59,744
That is, we will make sure that the war does not come, and that is the best defense.

84
00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:04,769
We shall carry out operations daily to reject violations-

85
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09.219
-But we will also discover various abuse and attack in the gray zone.

86
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,822
We will also make sure that we practice with others.

87
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:20,377
We must ensure that we meet any threats and attacks directly.

88
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:28,489
In this way we show that we have a desire to defend ourselves and thus abstains an attack.

89
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,439
In the next section:

90
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:50,090
What is really worth defending?
