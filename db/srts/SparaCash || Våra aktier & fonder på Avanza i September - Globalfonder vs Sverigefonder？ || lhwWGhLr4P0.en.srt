1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hello!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There you should look, not there.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay sorry.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now we will run a review of our share portfolios from the month of September.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And as you can see, we are in a different place.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A year ago we were in Spain and where are we now?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now we are on the island of Paros in Greece.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
JajamÃ¤n.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So we jump into the Avanza overview.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Like that then.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How was your September show my month?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who should we start with?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We'll start with mine, I think.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We'll start with yours, okay.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Your total value decreased by?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
SEK 22,356.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But I have also deposited 5,000.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So it actually decreased by SEK 27,735.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Wow!

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That is a lot of money.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes it is.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we'll check mine then.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
View my month.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your total value decreased by SEK 28,976 in September.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But I have deposited 21,000 kroner.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So really, I'm down 50,000 kroner in September.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, there will be almost 80,000 of us back together.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ah shit then.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That is a lot of money.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It was an expensive vacation.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The month before then.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For you, it was yes.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
SEK 4431 back.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So September was worse then August.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, of course.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And mine was 37,000 in development.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Or yes, SEK 33,000 in value change then.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Because I made a deposit there.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But we look ahead.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Exactly.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So we'll see what we come up with now.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is how your development looked like.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Minus.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Minus 3.10 percent.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We'll see what yours is up to then.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, a little down there at the end.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes, my curve looks worse.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Minus 4.6 percent.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But then we will also point that out as well.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That the savings offices are included in this.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Exactly.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And I have quite a lot.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or a large part of my portfolio is in a savings account.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So it probably also affects my numbers.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes exactly.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have a little splash on my buffer there.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But yes.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The month before.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
1.07 percent.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And for me minus 3.36.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Damn, you should take other of my money instead.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know, I can take over and save cash.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes, may I do that.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, next one then.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, then we'll see.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm behind 1.07 and Avanza average is behind 2.9 percent.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So it is still better then the average.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, much better than the stock market now.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And we'll see my portfolio.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Minus 3.36 and.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Minus 2.9 so worse than the average.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And worse than the stock market.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, now it's the month before.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And and.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We want September.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes exactly.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, then we check September.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, but there I was 3.10 percent behind.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And the average for Avanza was 3.18.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So something better then.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, but exactly.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I'm slightly worse again.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, let's check the next slide.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then it was Volvo that worked best for me.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Played.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, and then the rest was Bakta.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Right.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And here there are quite large numbers in the difference there.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It looks like you have a little more money in the funds maybe.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have much more in mutual funds than in shares.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right.

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So that says something about perhaps having a little more funds.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It might go a little better then.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is how it looked to me.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Lundberg best, Adtraction and Mag Interactive.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then we have the big positions in Evolution, Castellum and Savelend

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
which retreated properly, 8,000 down to 6,500.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes, tough.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's it.

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, we skip ahead to the next day.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
My best day was September 14th.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Almost 9,000 plus.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Worst day, September 26 and then I walked almost 10,000 back.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So juicy.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, for me then.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
September 14 here with, same.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Plus 18,000 almost.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But worst there, September 26 for me too.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Minus 17,000 kroner.

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, you have slightly higher numbers than I do.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes exactly.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It swings more in both directions.

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I'm not as risk-taking as you.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, exactly.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, exactly.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have a little more shares than you do, perhaps.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes it was.

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So we come to Felicia's little overview.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What do they write then?

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Interest rate peak in sight or?

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Much about the crown then.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I have talked before in my overviews about people moving into global funds.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And you have a lot of that.

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes, I have noticed that they are the ones that work best.

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Really.

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They are very much a plus right now.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And it feels fun anyway.

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And.

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But in recent weeks it has been a little tougher on global funds, then?

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes maybe.

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Maybe not so good at it.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No.

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, exactly.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes, but I usually scroll down to these now.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now we see in double screen then.

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But mostly the funds bought.

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you recognize any of these funds?

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes, I recognize them all.

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But as I said, I don't own them all.

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No.

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I do own, I think I own county insurance.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And also the split.

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Right.

153
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it has been the case that the dollar fell a bit against the krona here a week or so ago.

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then there was probably a bit of panic among some that the American stock market fell and the dollar fell against the krone.

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And then it will be a double whammy.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So little that I have been aware that perhaps one should be a little careful about buying too many global funds.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, what does it look like otherwise?

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The most bought shares nibe, Novonordisk, Investor, Sinch and Starbreeze.

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you recognize any of those stocks?

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, I recognize Investor and I own it too.

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And Sinch I recognize and unfortunately I also own that.

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Unfortunately still.

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes, then it was minus 85 percent back so far.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, it stings.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It is a bit interesting that the most sold funds are spilled equity funds and investment companies.

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, but it has gone a bit weaker now, right?

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Or I compare it to their global funds.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes exactly. It could be that the global fund has done a little better than the Swedish fund has done then.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I can imagine that there are some who might sell off the Swedish fund and replace it with the global fund, perhaps.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is it good or is it bad?

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, I would say that both funds are good.

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But that I think that many people might make this switch because they think that this fund is better than the global fund.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But personally, I would say that I think there is perhaps more potential in the Swedish fund right now than there is in the global fund.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Precisely because the dollar has become so expensive and that the investor who is the largest holding in the Swedish fund is traded at a very high discount.

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And the investment companies in general in Sweden have come down quite a lot in valuation then.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I'd say no, there I'm sticking with this fuck the sell button.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes, that's what it looked like.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Among our, now I happened to close down your tab but the overview we already went through there at both back properly this month or the month of September.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But generally then, what do we feel?

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, what do we feel?

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I just feel like you've gotten used to it now.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Because if you look at this year and also a bit last year, it went back quite a lot.

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And you're kind of used to it.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And like I told you, it feels like you deposit money every month and then you watch it disappear.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And then I deposit new money and then it disappears.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So no, it doesn't feel fun.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I still think in the long term that I will be happy that I continue to invest every month.

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And today, when we record this, it is Tuesday, October 10, when the stock market is up 2.5 percent.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And so when we were lying on the beach today and logged into Avanza, we saw some pretty funny numbers in the end.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And it is then that you feel that you are happy because you actually continue to invest.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think I was up last time I checked 15,000 kroner today or something like that.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So it is the case that it is tough in certain periods and then all of a sudden it goes the other way.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then you're quite happy that you haven't sold off but that you've perhaps invested a little more money.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Exactly. I guess that's how you think. Be long-term.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And when it goes down, you have to buy more because then you get more shares.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And when it turns up, it goes up faster.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Exactly.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If you choose the right stuff.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hopefully it will be fun in a few years when the stock market is up again.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes exactly.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So hopefully we can go on a trip like this again next year.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Without having to panic.

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm on your channel once a year.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Once a year yes. It was actually a question.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll see if I can find it so I can post graphics here.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Someone asked when you would be back next time.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How do you feel? Is it fun to join?

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, of course it's fun, but I don't know much about stocks and funds.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So yes to you I feel very ignorant.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But it might be fun for you to see too.

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What should I say. You may not need to be super knowledgeable and such to be able to invest money.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No exactly.

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Although it is good of course then it was.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes, and you don't have to be a brain surgeon to be able to save.

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
In principle, anyone can start a fund saving.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So it's not difficult.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No, it is not.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It was quite simply our month of September.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, and if you thought it was fun to watch videos like this, please give it a thumbs up and write a comment.

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And if you want to see some of Ida's content, you can go to her channel.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Exactly then, if you search Made by Run, you will come to my channel where you can find some fun about crocheting and making your own candles and such.

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Lovely.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Shall we go have dinner now?

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Now we're going to have dinner.

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you so much for watching.

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Have fun.

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
HI.
