1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hello!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There you should look, not there.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay sorry.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now we will run a review of our equity portfolios from September.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And as you can see, we are in another place.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A year ago we were in Spain and where are we now?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Now we are on the island of Paros in Greece.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So we jump into the Avanza overview.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How did your September show my month?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who should we start with?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We start with mine, I think.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We start with yours, okay.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Your total value decreased by?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
SEK 22,356.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But I also put in 5,000.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So it actually decreased by SEK 27,735.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Wow!

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That is a lot of money.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes it is.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we look at my then.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Show my month.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your total value decreased by SEK 28,976 in September.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But I have deposited SEK 21,000.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So really, I'm back SEK 50,000 in September.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, there will be almost 80,000 we are back together.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So ah shit.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That is a lot of money.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It was an expensive holiday.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The month before then.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For you it was yes.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
SEK 4431 back.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So September was worse then August.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, of course.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And mine was 37,000 in development.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Or yes, SEK 33,000 in value change then.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Because I made a deposit there.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But we look ahead.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Exactly.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So we'll see what we come to now.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is what your development looked like.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Minus.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Minus 3.10 percent.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We'll see what yours is on then.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, a little down there at the end after all.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes, my curve looks worse.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Minus 4.6 percent.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But then we will also point out it as well.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That the savings accounts are included in this.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Exactly.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And I have pretty much.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Or a large part of my portfolio is in a savings account.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So it also affects my numbers as well.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes exactly.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have a little splash on my buffer there.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But yes.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The month before.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
1.07 percent.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And for me minus 3.36.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Damn, you should take others of my money instead.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know, I can take over and save cash.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes, I can do it.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, next then.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, then we'll see.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am a back 1.07 and the Avanza section is back 2.9 percent.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So it is still better then than the cut.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, much better than the stock exchange now.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And my portfolio we'll see.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Minus 3.36 yes.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Minus 2.9 so worse than the incision.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And worse than the stock exchange.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, now it's the month before.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes Yes.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
September we want.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes exactly.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, then we check September.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, but there I was behind 3.10 percent.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And the average for Avanza was 3.18.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So something better then.

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, but exactly.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I'm slightly worse again.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, we check the next slide.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then it was Volvo who went best for me.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Played.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, and then the rest was back.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Right.

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And here are pretty big numbers in the difference there.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It looks like you have a little more money in the funds maybe.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have much more in funds than in shares.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right.

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So it says a bit that you might have a little more funds maybe.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It might be a little better then.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is what it looked like to me.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Lundberg Best, Adtraction and Mag Interactive.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then we have the great positions in evolution, Castellum and Savelend

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Which backed down properly, 8,000 down to 6,500.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes, tough.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's it.

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, we jump on to the next day.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
My best day was September 14th.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Almost 9,000 plus.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Worst day, September 26 and then I went almost 10,000 back.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So juicy.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, for me then.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
September 14 here with, same.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Plus 18,000 almost.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But worst there, September 26 for me.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Minus SEK 17,000.

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, you have a little higher numbers than I have.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes exactly.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It swings more in both directions.

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I'm not as risk -taking as you.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, exactly.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, exactly.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have a little more shares than you may have.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes it was.

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then we come to Felicia's little overview.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What do they write then?

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Interest rates in sight or?

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Much about the crown then.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I've talked in my overviews before that people are entering global funds.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And you have a lot of that.

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes, so I have noticed that they are the best.

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Really.

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They are good a lot plus in right now.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And it feels fun anyway.

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But in recent weeks there has been a little tougher on global funds then?

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes maybe.

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Not so good control maybe.

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No.

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, exactly.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes, but I usually scroll down to these now.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now we see in a double screen then.

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But most purchased funds.

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you recognize any of these funds?

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes, everyone I recognize.

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But, as I said, I do not own.

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No.

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I own well, I think I own Länsförsäkringar.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And also the split.

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Right.

153
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it has been the case that the dollar fell a little to the crown here a week ago.

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then it was a little panic among some that the American stock exchange fell and the dollar fell against the crown.

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And then it will be a double bang down then.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So little what I have been aware that maybe you should take a little care to buy too much global funds.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, what else does it look like?

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The most purchased shares Nibe, Novonordisk, Investor, Sinch and Starbreeze.

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you recognize any of those shares?

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, Investor I recognize and I also own.

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And SINCH I recognize and unfortunately I own that too.

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Unfortunately still.

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes, then it was minus 85 percent back so far.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, it stings.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
A little interesting is that the best -selling funds are Spiltan equity funds and investment companies.

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, but it has gone a little weaker now?

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Or I compare it to their global funds.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes exactly.
 It may be that the Global Fund has gone a little better than the Swedish Fund has done then.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I imagine that there are some that may sell the Swedish fund and change it with the Global Fund maybe.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is it good or is it bad?

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, I would say that both funds are good.

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But that I think many may do this change because they think this fund is better than the Global Fund.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But personally, I would say that I think there may be more potential in the Swedish fund right now than it is in the Global Fund.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Just because the dollar has become so expensive and that Investor, which is the largest holding in the Swedish fund, is traded at a very high discount.

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And the investment companies generally in Sweden have come down quite a lot in valuation then.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I would say that no, there I stick to this give fuck in the sales button.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes, that's what it looked like.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Among ours, now I have happened to shut down your flap but the overview we have already gone through there at both backs properly this month or September month.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But in general then, what do we feel?

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, what do we feel?

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I just feel that you have gotten used now.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Because if you this year and even a little last year, it went pretty much back.

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And you are kind of used.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And as I told you it feels like you deposit money every month and you see them disappear.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And then I put in new money and then they disappear.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So no, it doesn't feel fun.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I still think that I will be happy that I continue to invest every month.

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And today when we record this, it is Tuesday, October 10, when the stock market is up 2.5 percent just over.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And so when we lay on the beach today and logged in to Avanza we saw quite fun numbers in the end.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And it is then that you feel that you are happy that you actually continue to invest.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think I was up the last time I checked SEK 15,000 today or something like that.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So it is true that it is tough in certain periods and then all of a sudden it goes the other way.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then you are quite happy that you have not sold off without having to put in a little more money.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Exactly.
 This is how you have to think.
 Be long -term.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And when it goes down you have to buy more because then you get the more shares.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And once it turns up then it goes faster up.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Exactly.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If you choose the right stuff.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hopefully it will be fun in a few years when the stock market is up again.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes exactly.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So hopefully we may be able to sit on such a trip next year again.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Without having to panic.

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I am once a year on your channel.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Once a year yes.
 It was a question actually.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll see if I manage to find it so I can put graphics here.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Someone who asked when you would be back next time.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How do you feel?
 Is it fun to be with?

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So yes it is fun, but I do not know much about shares and funds.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So yes to you I feel very ignorant.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But it might be fun for you to see too.

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What should I say.
 You may not need to be super -insofar and so in order to invest money.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No exactly.

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Although it is good so clear then it was.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes and you don't have to be a brain surgeon to save.

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Starting a fund savings it can handle anyone in principle.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So it's not difficult.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No, it is not.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It was our month September simply.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes and did you think it was fun to watch such video so please press thumbs up and leave a comment.

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And if you want to see something of Ida's content, you can go to her channel.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Exactly then you are looking for Made by Run so you come to my channel where you can find some fun about crochet and make your own light and stuff.

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Great.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

226
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Should we go and have dinner now or?

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Now we go and have dinner.

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Have it good.

Ciao.
