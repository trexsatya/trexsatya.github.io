00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.592
Hello Hello

2
00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:17.366
Today is a sunny day.
 It's warm and nice.
 We thought we should put in our ...

3
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.005
 Boat!
 - Boat!

4
00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:22.620
Your boat.
 Your old hull, shoulder.

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.628
Yes.
 This one is like an old abrasive patches.
 It's so risky

6
00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:32.944
But it works, and we haven't tested it since I bought it, so we have to test it.

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.102
 It's about time.
 - Yes!

8
00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:40.244
We have driven to a supplementary ramp on the island where we have our summer house.

9
00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:43.544
Here is the car.
 Here is the boat.
 You see

10
00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:44.913
 Yes.
 - (Harry) No.

11
00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:51.124
You look pretty good, I think.
 It's a little light, so you get a little dazzled.

12
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:57.665
 Here we also have a small treasure.
 - (Harry) We will bring it.

13
00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.112
 (Axel) Oh, she seems to be bothered by the light.
 - (Joanna) Yes.

14
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.426
(Harry) the steering wheel is steering

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.394
Everything you do the first time takes some time.
 It becomes like a little "trial and error".

16
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:42.314
 Do you know what "Trial and Error" means?
 - No.

17
00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:45.631
You try, you fail, you do it again.

18
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.160
You try, you do right hopefully - and so it will be good.

19
00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:52.575
Yes.
 It will be fine.

20
00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:02.215
So there, check out.
 It seems to float.

21
00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:13.581
Oh, there lies my macaop bag

22
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:18.172
(Joanna) You and your sandwiches, so ... you love sandwiches.

23
00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.841
Yes, yes, I do.

24
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.848
 You also love sandwiches, but you must not eat it.
 - No.
 I have a hate love for sandwiches.

25
00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:32.853
 What happens if you eat sandwiches, then?
 -Ehm ... Sprutti-Bang-Bang.

26
00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:37.135
 Because you can't tolerate wheat.
 - No.

27
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:42.696
Jösses, so it flows.
 That's a good sign.

28
00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:48.168
 Dad, you must not sit down!
 - No, but I have to start the engine and see it goes.

29
00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:53.674
 But you can remove the macaop, okay?
 - Okay.

30
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:58.679
 (Joanna) Harry is mostly broken about her sandwiches.
 - (Harry) sandwiches ...

31
00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:01.015
This is pretty good, that we are like this.

32
00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:12.923
Check out this little Donnan.
 The life jacket is kind of larger than her.

33
00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:16.380
 (Alma) What a cute!
 - (shoulder) So sweet!

34
00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:22.313
 (Harry) Oh, her arms!
 They are gone.
 - (Joanna) She seems to enjoy it, strangely enough.

35
00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.626
 It's like a main foot.
 - Great!

36
00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:30.348
Now Axel and the kids will go away with the boat.

37
00:03:30.348 --> 00:03:36.517
I will take the car away for us and then they will pick me up on the bridge where we live.

38
00:03:36.684 --> 00:03:40.244
Because this is a bit away on the island.

39
00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:43.830
Okay, then we'll see you then, then

40
00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:48.729
 See you just as soon, I hope.
 - Yeah!
 I hope so too.

41
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.685
 What should I do with the rope?
 - We take it in when we come out a bit.

42
00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:58.410
Don't get a motor stop now, because then Laura can be very hungry and angry.

43
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.800
Yes, we will try.

44
00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:35.509
 What happened now?
 - We got a motor stop.

45
00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:38.745
 You are joking?
 - No.

46
00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:42.715
 What are we going to do now?
 - I do not know.

47
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.941
 No, but ... you are joking?
 - No, I'm not kidding.

48
00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:49.523
 We may be able to call someone who can help.
 - Dad is kidding.

49
00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:56.363
No, I'm not joking, that is.
 It died.
 It is newly tanked and newly served.

50
00:04:56.864 --> 00:05:03.003
I've been on this boat for what three minutes?
 I sat down.
 Took a rice cake ...

51
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.137
 And it died.
 - Yes, and so the engine died.

52
00:05:06.287 --> 00:05:10.077
But we can still go to Grandma and Grandpa, because they are over there.

53
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.484
 Yes, we are quite close to Grandma and Grandpa's jetty.
 - That was fortunate.

54
00:05:13.626 --> 00:05:17.145
 Or, well.
 Not very close, huh?
 - (Harry) Well.

55
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.430
I'll see if we can start again.
 (The engine starts)

56
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.860
 Yes!
 Dad cheated us!
 - No.
 I'm not fooled.

57
00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:30.145
No, he actually pressed "Start".

58
00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:37.004
(The engine does not want to start properly)

59
00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:42.962
(Joanna) What do you think happens, what is the problem?

60
00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:49.888
I do not know.
 It sounds almost like a fuel crane that is off, but ...

61
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.571
Still lucky this happened when I was on the boat, because I think of poor Laura.

62
00:05:55.571 --> 00:06:00.527
(The engine buzzes a little more) Now something is happening.

63
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:08.493
So I have to sit and pump with the gas for me to have some power from the engine.

64
00:06:08.814 --> 00:06:14.428
It is a sign that there is crap in the carburetor.

65
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.127
 We did not end up in sea!
 But it was close.
 - We ended up at Grandma and Grandpa's jetty.

66
00:06:34.313 --> 00:06:39.888
Yes so far we came today.
 Is anyone craving a dip?

67
00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:42.230
 I!
 - Me too!

68
00:06:42.427 --> 00:06:44.638
1, 2, 3

69
00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:54.259
 Was it good?
 - Great!

70
00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:07.401
So there.
 Now I have called and talked to a good boat meal ...

71
00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:14.117
... and learned that this boat is a little special, so I've learned some tricks.

72
00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:17.033
So now let's see if I get it started.

73
00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:26.590
 It started!
 - No problem.

74
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:34.023
 What was the "secret trick"?!
 - That's you.
 Old boat with lots of small peculiarities.

75
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.535
This was great now we drive!

76
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:50.139
 (Joanna) and Laura are just here and soft.
 - (Axel) She seems to be happy.

77
00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:56.510
 Yes, one for boat children.
 - Lovely, after all.

78
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:03.173
When Alma was little we had a wooden boat.
 She was always asleep in it.

79
00:08:24.184 --> 00:08:28.195
Now we are in Vaxholm where we were going to check out a bit.

80
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:33.680
We have brought SOS the reclining part to Laura, but no trolley, so ... We can't go far.

81
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.179
No.

82
00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:41.621
But we saw that there is a place ... there, so it must be where we go, simply.

83
00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:46.400
Yes came again, the family!

84
00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:54.819
 Do you want to sit here, maybe?
 - It will be just fine.

85
00:08:55.335 --> 00:09:00.507
 It is absolutely incredible that you managed to get the boat started again.
 - Yes I know!

86
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:06.415
 I thought, "Now we get bridge sail. There will be nothing more today."
 - But it worked!

87
00:09:06.415 --> 00:09:08.114
Are you not impressed with dad

88
00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:10.016
 (Alma) Well.
 - (Harry) Nah.

89
00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:14.167
 Aren't you impressed?
 - Nah.
 It's just stupid.

90
00:09:14.167 --> 00:09:15.847
Gosh

91
00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:23.471
And this one, she just keeps sleeping.
 I am impad of her

92
00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:32.663
Good with ice cream.

93
00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:40.466
So what a summer day it was.
 Wonderfully.

94
00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:46.711
Keep in the wooden rails there.

95
00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:52.932
Now we are going back to Grandma and Grandpa's jetty, because we will actually put this boat there.

96
00:09:52.932 --> 00:09:56.296
And ... there is someone who has come to Grandma and Grandpa now.

97
00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:00.367
 Frances.
 - Yes!
 Who is it then?

98
00:10:00.647 --> 00:10:03.336
It's my cousin and ...

99
00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:05.405
 Bästis, huh?
 - Yes.

100
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.509
Cousin and best friend.
 When did you last meet her

101
00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:11.012
A year ago.

102
00:10:11.012 --> 00:10:18.518
A year ago she lives in Dubai, so this is a huge day after all!
 Should we gas there?

103
00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:24.799
 YES!
 We speed up.
 - Quick!
 The foot on the gas and just ...!

104
00:10:25.478 --> 00:10:32.211
 Oh, look!
 It's the ice cream truck!
 - The ice cream truck!
 On a car ferry!

105
00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:36.670
 How fun.
 - I don't think you can see, it's too far away.

106
00:10:36.847 --> 00:10:40.250
Can we buy ice cream

107
00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.294
No...

108
00:10:50.464 --> 00:10:55.634
 I see Frances.
 - (Joanna) What happiness!

109
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.616
(Harry) Hello

110
00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.860
 Are you peppered?
 - Yes.

111
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.196
 Are you happy?
 - mm.

112
00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:05.300
As you have longed

113
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.635
Will I be able to be with grandma and grandpa for a little while

114
00:11:08.692 --> 00:11:10.403
Obvious.

115
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:16.618
 This is the first time they meet Laura as well.
 - Right.

116
00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:19.012
 Hello!
 - Hello!

117
00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:23.016
 Should I receive?
 - Yes please.

118
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.495
 (Frances) Hello!
 - (Joanna) Hello, old man!
 How big you are!

119
00:11:37.092 --> 00:11:40.533
Who wants to hold

120
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.812
 I!
 - I also!
 Can I test?

121
00:11:45.277 --> 00:11:47.254
Hello, Laura.

122
00:11:48.185 --> 00:11:52.378
Now it's been a few days ... full of play.

123
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:53.759
Hello

124
00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:58.571
I stand on the edge and am falling out of the trampoline.

125
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:04.958
I would show these two cousins.
 And someone else has come!

126
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.046
Hussein

127
00:12:11.219 --> 00:12:14.472
 Hello, Youtube!
 - Hi, Hussein!

128
00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:18.004
 Hello!
 Should I also jump?
 - Yes!

129
00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:22.328
Hope it does not break, because I have become heavier.

130
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:30.553
Hussein Hussein!
 Hussein!
 It's been a long time since you jumped with us!

131
00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:36.055
I didn't jump yesterday either, so ... Hörrni, I have to be a little careful.

132
00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:41.376
 (Harry) No!
 We can hold hands!
 - Hello!
 Shouldn't you brush it a bit?

133
00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:44.030
 I can brush.
 - It's lots of junk ...

134
00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:49.168
 (Joanna) It's a great idea.
 - (Harry) Hussein!
 Beware!
 Karate Kid!

135
00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:54.107
 (Hussein) I can do it.
 - (Joanna) You can hold the edges of Hussein.

136
00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:59.252
 Check out this trick, mom!
 - (Axel) What good!

137
00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:04.182
Good now you ended up right at an edge, now you can stay there and hold up.

138
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:09.122
Frances, I have to ... you can keep the edge here.

139
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:13.931
(Harry) No, I want to stand here.

140
00:13:14.263 --> 00:13:19.016
 (Hussein) Good.
 - (Axel) Good!
 Check out how good you are.

141
00:13:20.607 --> 00:13:26.155
 (Joanna) What are you doing, Alma?
 - I clean the hut.

142
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.907
(Harry) I think Hussein should become a photographer when he gets a job.

143
00:13:32.242 --> 00:13:38.685
 (Joanna) Hussein already has a job, Harry.
 - Yes, at a school.
 But why not become a photographer?

144
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:43.022
 (Frances) What is his job?
 - Yes, what is your job, Hussein?

145
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:47.043
My job I work at a school.

146
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:51.030
Hussein is a leisure leader.

147
00:13:52.238 --> 00:13:54.899
So there

148
00:14:06.432 --> 00:14:12.575
 (Joanna) Nice!
 - Thanks!
 There are two more chairs.

149
00:14:12.862 --> 00:14:15.121
 But you ... - Yes?

150
00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:19.255
It is a question that comes back on our channel every week.

151
00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:24.022
What happens to your Youtube channel?

152
00:14:24.369 --> 00:14:29.874
That's the question.
 That's the question.
 No but...

153
00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:36.000
I actually made a video that I will post ... soon.

154
00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:40.680
It is a video where I test dolls with my best friend.

155
00:14:40.874 --> 00:14:45.351
Yes.
 Alma has been peeled with dolls lately ... quite a lot.

156
00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:53.960
When I edited the part where we are out with the boat ... then you see that you are pilling with a doll type all the time.

157
00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:57.807
Pay attention to viewers have probably already seen that doll.

158
00:14:57.983 --> 00:15:00.333
And you are not a doll game otherwise.

159
00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:07.403
No, but I just realized it was ... fun, and that people seem to like dolls, so ...

160
00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:13.277
Now I will test some dolls and toys on my channel in the future.

161
00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:20.462
The whole thing with Alma having her own channel started by making videos for her class

162
00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:23.260
During our first long journey.

163
00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:27.892
For every country we visited she made a type of 5 minutes long video

164
00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:31.358
For the class to watch, which was about that country.

165
00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:35.536
It was very much appreciated and we realized that maybe more people wanted to see them,

166
00:15:35.536 --> 00:15:38.271
So we posted them on their own Youtube channel for her.

167
00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:41.274
Since then, it has not happened very much on that channel.

168
00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:44.677
No.
 She has tested L.O.L.
 Surprise Dolls sometime.

169
00:15:44.814 --> 00:15:49.415
This channel is completely ... depending on Alma's desire.

170
00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:54.453
We do not control it and we do not encourage her to it either.
 We have this channel.

171
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.229
Yes.

172
00:15:55.242 --> 00:15:58.465
But then she got the feeling with her best friend UMA

173
00:15:58.465 --> 00:16:01.761
A few days ago and recorded a video.

174
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.398
And then she thought, "I might continue to test toys".

175
00:16:05.565 --> 00:16:10.085
And it fits on that channel and not on this one.
 That's not what we want to do.

176
00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.604
No.

177
00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:16.175
So, now there is an answer to that question, because it has come quite a lot.

178
00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:20.874
Yes, so if you like dolls, for example, you can go in and check out.

179
00:16:20.874 --> 00:16:23.865
Or "Fidget Toys" I know she has talked about doing something with.

180
00:16:23.865 --> 00:16:27.019
Yes exactly.
 Then you can keep a little lookout on Alma's channel.

181
00:16:27.192 --> 00:16:32.024
It's called "The Swedish Alma".
 We get to tip about it.

182
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:36.849
 Do you think viewers wonder where Laura is?
 - Yes.

183
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:40.114
 She is sleeping.
 - As usual.

184
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:47.813
Our boat was not really to be trusted, so it is facing a total renovation.

185
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.780
That you should do.

186
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.403
 That I should do.
 - Don't mix us into it.

187
00:16:51.403 --> 00:16:55.105
Sometime in the future.
 But, yes ... it will come at a later date.

188
00:16:55.318 --> 00:17:00.000
In the next video on the channel, both Hussein and Frances are included.
 So keep an eye out

189
00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:01.429
Yes

190
00:17:01.681 --> 00:17:08.361
Thank you for watching this video

191
00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:12.467
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

192
00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:13.603
Most thumbs up

193
00:17:13.603 --> 00:17:18.037
Comment, ask questions and have a great time and we will see you again soon.

194
00:17:18.223 --> 00:17:20.206
 Bye!
