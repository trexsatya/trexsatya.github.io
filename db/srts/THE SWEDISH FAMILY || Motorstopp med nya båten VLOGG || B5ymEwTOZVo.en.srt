1
00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.592
Hey, hey!


2
00:00:10.886 --> 00:00:19.005
Today is a sunny day. It's nice and warm.
We thought we would launch our boat!


3
00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:22.857
Your boat.
Your oldie, Axel. 


4
00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:27.628
This one has been through it.
It's so crummy.


5
00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:32.944
But, it works. We haven't tried it
since I bought it, so we have to try it.


6
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.102
- It's high time.
- Yes!


7
00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:40.244
We have driven to a boat ramp on the island
where we have our summer cabin.


8
00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:43.544
Here's the car. Here's the boat.
Can you see?


9
00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:44.913
- Yes.
- No.


10
00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:51.124
You can see pretty well, I think.
It's bright, so you get a bit blinded.


11
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:57.665
- Here we have a little treasure.
- We will take it with us.


12
00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.112
Oh, she seems to be
bothered by the light.


13
00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.426
The steering wheel is moving!


14
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.394
Everything you do for the first time takes some time.
There's, like, some trial and error.


15
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:42.314
- Do you know what "trial and error" mean?
- No.


16
00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:49.990
You try, you fail, you do it again.
You try, you do it right - hopefully - and it's fine.


17
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.229
It will be fine.


18
00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:02.215
There we go.
Look, it seems to be floating.


19
00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:18.172
- Oh, there's my sandwich bag.
- You and your sandwiches... You love sandwiches.


20
00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.841
Yes, I do.


21
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.848
- You also love sandwiches, but you can't eat them.
- No. I have a love-hate relationship with sandwiches.


22
00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:32.853
- What happens if you eat sandwiches?
- Fartie-bang-bang.


23
00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:37.135
- Because you can't eat wheat.
- No.


24
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:42.696
Oh, gosh! It floats.
That's a good sign.


25
00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:48.168
- Daddy, you can't sit down!
- No, but I have to start the engine and see that it works.


26
00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:53.674
- But you have to move the sandwich bag, okay?
- Okay.


27
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:58.679
Harry is mostly concerned
about the sandwiches.


28
00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:01.015
This is pretty good...


29
00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:12.923
Look at this little donna.
The life jacket is basically bigger than her.


30
00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.380
So cute!


31
00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:22.313
- Oh, her arms! They're gone.
- She seems to like it in there, oddly enough.


32
00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:26.626
- It's like a tadpole figure.
- Super comfy.


33
00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:32.751
Now Axel and the kids will take off with the boat.
I will take the car back to our cabin.


34
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:40.244
Then they will pick me up at the jetty that's right where we live.
This jetty is a bit away on the island.


35
00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:43.830
Okay, see you later!


36
00:03:44.124 --> 00:03:48.729
- Soon, I hope.
- Yep! I hope so too.


37
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.685
- What should I do with the rope?
- We'll take it in when we're out a bit.


38
00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:58.410
Don't get an engine stop now,
because then Laura could get very hungry and angry.


39
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.171
We will try not to.


40
00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:35.509
- What just happened?
- The engine died.


41
00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:38.745
- You're joking?
- No.


42
00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:42.715
- What should we do now?
- I don't know.


43
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.941
- No, but... you're joking?
- No, I'm not joking.


44
00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:49.523
- Maybe we can call someone who...
- Daddy's joking.


45
00:04:49.624 --> 00:04:56.363
No, I'm not joking. It died.
The tank is full and it just had service.


46
00:04:56.864 --> 00:05:03.003
I've been on this boat for, like, 3 minutes.
I got comfortable, grabbed a rice cake...


47
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.137
- And it died.
- And then the engine died.


48
00:05:06.287 --> 00:05:10.077
But we can still go to grandma and grandpa's,
because they're over there.


49
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.679
Yes, we're pretty close to
grandma and grandpa's jetty.


50
00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:17.184
- That's lucky.
- Or, no. Not super close, right?


51
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:21.355
Let's see if we can start it again.


52
00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:26.860
- Daddy tricked us!
- No, I'm not tricking you.


53
00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:30.145
No, he actually pushed "start".


54
00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:42.962
What do you think is happening?
Like, what is the problem?


55
00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:49.888
I don't know. It almost sounds like
a fuel petcock that's off, but...


56
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.357
Good thing this happened when I was on the boat,
because I'm thinking of poor Laura.


57
00:05:57.558 --> 00:06:00.527
Now! Now something's happening.


58
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:08.669
I have to sit and pump with the gas
to have any power from the engine.


59
00:06:09.066 --> 00:06:15.585
That's a sign that there's
dirt in the carburetor.


60
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.127
- We didn't end up in distress at sea! But it was close.
- We ended up at grandma and grandpa's jetty.


61
00:06:34.313 --> 00:06:39.888
Yep! That's how far we got today.
Does anyone feel like taking a dip?


62
00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:42.230
- I do!
- Me too!


63
00:06:42.427 --> 00:06:44.638
1, 2, 3!


64
00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:54.259
- Was it nice?
- Really nice.


65
00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:07.401
There. Now I have called and spoke to
a good boat mechanic.


66
00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:14.117
I've learned that this boat is a little special,
so I've learned a few tricks.


67
00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:17.033
Let's see if I get it to start.


68
00:07:22.947 --> 00:07:28.570
It started!
What kind of "secret tricks" was that?


69
00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:34.302
Well... It's an old boat
with lots of little quirks.


70
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:37.535
This was great!
Let's go!


71
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:50.139
- And Laura is just lying here chilling.
- She seems to like it here.


72
00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:56.510
- Yes, another boat child.
- That's wonderful.


73
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:03.173
When Alma was little, we had a wooden boat.
She always slept in it.


74
00:08:24.184 --> 00:08:28.195
We are in Vaxholm
where we'll grab something to eat.


75
00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:33.680
We have brought the bassinet for Laura,
but no stroller, so... we can't go far.


76
00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.179
No.


77
00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:41.621
We saw that there's a place... there,
so that's where we will go.


78
00:08:41.755 --> 00:08:46.400
Yes!
Come on, family!


79
00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:54.819
- How about this table?
- It's perfect.


80
00:08:55.335 --> 00:09:00.507
- It's incredible that you got the boat started again.
- Yes, I know!


81
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:06.415
- I mean... I thought we'd just have to hang out at the jetty.
- But it worked!


82
00:09:06.415 --> 00:09:08.114
Are you not impressed with daddy?


83
00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:10.016
- Yes.
- No.


84
00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:14.167
- Are you not impressed?
- No. It's just lame.


85
00:09:14.167 --> 00:09:15.847
Hey!


86
00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:23.471
And this one, she just continues to sleep.
I'm impressed with her!


87
00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:32.663
Ice cream is good.


88
00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:40.466
What a summer day this ended up being.
Wonderful.


89
00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:46.711
Hold on to the handle there.


90
00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:52.932
We'll go back to grandma and grandpa's jetty,
because we'll actually tie up this boat there.


91
00:09:52.932 --> 00:09:56.296
And... someone has arrived
at grandma and grandpa's now.


92
00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:00.367
- Frances.
- Yes! And who is that?


93
00:10:00.647 --> 00:10:03.336
My cousin and...


94
00:10:03.503 --> 00:10:05.405
- Bestie. Right?
- Yes.


95
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.509
Cousin and bestie.
When did you see her last?


96
00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:11.012
One year ago.


97
00:10:11.012 --> 00:10:18.518
One year ago! She lives in Dubai,
so this is a huge day. Shall we step on it?


98
00:10:18.685 --> 00:10:24.799
- Yes! Let's hurry there.
- Hurry! Put the foot on the gas and just...!


99
00:10:25.478 --> 00:10:32.211
- Look! The ice cream truck!
- It's on a car ferry.


100
00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:36.670
- That's funny.
- I don't think you can see it. It's too far away.


101
00:10:36.847 --> 00:10:40.250
CAN WE BUY ICE CREAM?


102
00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:42.294
No...


103
00:10:50.464 --> 00:10:55.634
- I see Frances.
- What a joy!


104
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.616
HEY!


105
00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.860
- Are you pumped?
- Yes.


106
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.196
- Are you happy?
- Mm.


107
00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:08.692
- Oh, how you've longed for this.
- Can I stay at grandma and grandpa's for a bit?


108
00:11:08.692 --> 00:11:10.403
Of course.


109
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:16.618
- This is the first time they're meeting Laura.
- That's right.


110
00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:19.012
- Hey!
- Hey!


111
00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:23.016
- Shall I catch the boat?
- Yes, please.


112
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.495
- Hey!
- Hey, sweetie! You're so big!


113
00:11:37.092 --> 00:11:40.533
Who wants to hold?


114
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.812
- I do!
- Me too! Can I try?


115
00:11:45.277 --> 00:11:47.254
Hi, Laura.


116
00:11:48.185 --> 00:11:52.378
It's been a few days.
They're full of play.


117
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:53.759
Hey!


118
00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:58.571
I'm standing on the edge
about to fall off the trampoline.


119
00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:04.958
I wanted to show these two cousin-besties.
And someone else has arrived!


120
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.046
HUSSEIN!


121
00:12:11.219 --> 00:12:14.472
- Hey, YouTube!
- Hey, Hussein!


122
00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:18.004
- Hey! Shall I jump too?
- Yes!


123
00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:22.328
I hope it doesn't break,
because I've gotten heavier.


124
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:30.553
Hussein! Hussein! Hussein!
It's been so long since you jumped with us!


125
00:12:30.805 --> 00:12:36.055
I didn't jump yesterday either, so...
You guys, I have to be a bit careful.


126
00:12:36.223 --> 00:12:38.524
No! We can hold hands!


127
00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:44.030
- Hey, don't you want to sweep it off a bit?
- I can do it.


128
00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:48.468
- That's a great idea.
- Hussein, watch out! Karate Kid!


129
00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:54.107
- I can do it.
- You guys can hold up the edges for Hussein.


130
00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:58.497
Look at this trick, mommy!


131
00:12:59.202 --> 00:13:04.182
Good! Now you're right at the edge.
Stay there and hold it up.


132
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:09.122
Frances, I have to...
Here, you can hold up this edge.


133
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:13.931
No, I want to stand on this side.


134
00:13:14.263 --> 00:13:18.865
- Good.
- Good! Look how good you guys are.


135
00:13:20.607 --> 00:13:26.155
- What are you doing, Alma?
- I'm cleaning the hut.


136
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.907
I think Hussein should be a photographer
when he gets a job.


137
00:13:32.242 --> 00:13:38.685
- Hussein already has a job, Harry.
- Yes, at a school. But why not become a photographer?


138
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:43.022
- What is his job?
- Yes, what is your job, Hussein?


139
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:47.043
My job? I work at a school.


140
00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:51.030
Hussein is a
after-school center leader.


141
00:13:52.238 --> 00:13:54.899
There!


142
00:14:06.432 --> 00:14:12.852
- Nice!
- Thanks! There are two more chairs.


143
00:14:13.063 --> 00:14:15.121
- Hey, you...
- Yes?


144
00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:23.821
There's a question that we get every week:
What's happening with your YouTube channel?


145
00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:28.034
That... is the question.
That's the question.


146
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.000
No, but...


147
00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:36.000
I've actually made a video
that I will post soon.


148
00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:40.680
It's a video
where I try dolls with my bestie.


149
00:14:40.874 --> 00:14:45.351
Yes. Alma has been playing with dolls
quite a lot lately.


150
00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:54.025
When I edited the part where we're out with the boat,
you can see that you're fiddling with a doll, like, the whole time.


151
00:14:54.093 --> 00:15:00.333
Attentive viewers have probably already seen that doll.
You don't really play with dolls otherwise.


152
00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:07.202
No, but I just realized that it was... fun,
and that people seem to like dolls, so...


153
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:13.277
I will be trying some dolls and toys
on my channel in the time ahead.


154
00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:20.462
The whole thing about Alma having her own channel
started with her making videos for her class-


155
00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:23.260
-during our first long trip.


156
00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:31.232
For every country we visited, she made a circa 5 minute
long video about that country, for her class to watch.


157
00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:35.536
It was very appreciated and we realized that
maybe there are more people who wanted to see them,-


158
00:15:35.536 --> 00:15:41.325
-so we posted them on her own YouTube channel.
Since then, not a lot has happened on that channel.


159
00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:44.677
No. She tried L.O.L. Surprise dolls once.


160
00:15:44.814 --> 00:15:49.415
That channel depends on
what Alma feels like.


161
00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:54.453
We don't control it nor do we encourage her to it.
We have this channel.


162
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.229
Yes.


163
00:15:55.242 --> 00:16:01.810
A few days ago, she had feeling
with her bestie Uma and recorded a video.


164
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.565
Then I guess she thought, like:
"Maybe I should keep trying toys".


165
00:16:05.565 --> 00:16:10.085
And that fits that channel and not this one.
That's not what we want to do.


166
00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:11.604
No.


167
00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:16.233
Now there's an answer to that question
because we've gotten it quite a lot.


168
00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:20.874
So, if you like dolls, for example,
go and check it out.


169
00:16:20.874 --> 00:16:23.865
Or fidget toys.
She's talked about doing something with that.


170
00:16:23.865 --> 00:16:27.019
Right. Keep an eye out
on Alma's channel.


171
00:16:27.192 --> 00:16:32.261
It's called "The Swedish Alma".
We will link to it on the screen now.


172
00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:36.849
- Do you think the viewers wonder where Laura is?
- Yes.


173
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:40.114
- She's sleeping.
- As usual.


174
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:48.341
Our boat wasn't really to be trusted,
so it's facing a complete renovation.


175
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:55.105
- Which you will do. Don't involve us in that.
- Which I will do, but that'll be sometime in the future.


176
00:16:55.318 --> 00:17:00.000
In our next video,
both Hussein and Frances will join us.


177
00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:01.429
Yes!


178
00:17:01.681 --> 00:17:08.361
Thank you for watching this video!


179
00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:12.467
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.


180
00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:13.603
Mostly thumbs up!


181
00:17:13.603 --> 00:17:18.223
Comment, ask questions,
and take care until next time.


182
00:17:18.223 --> 00:17:20.206
- Bye-bye!
- See you in the next video!
