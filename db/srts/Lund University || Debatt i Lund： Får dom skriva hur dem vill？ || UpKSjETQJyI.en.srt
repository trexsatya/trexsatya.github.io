00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:26,112
Hello there!
 Welcome to debate in Lund!

2
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,428
Some think it's chill

3
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,256
to write as one speaks,

4
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,693
Others are a little more Old School and freaks out

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,393
When new generations say something that is Cringe.

6
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:44,692
So should one let the language go with the flow or should swedish teacher continue

7
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:49,664
And fight to teach them and them instead of them to today's young people?

8
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:55,723
What is the signal value really with a correct language costume?

9
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,822
To really master

10
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,022
Swedish in the traditional way?

11
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:04,721
If more people write wrong, will it eventually be correct?

12
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:05,722
And who decides that?

13
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:13,619
About fine language and ugly language is this day's debate in Lund.

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,285
The language as a class marker is something that we should take a closer look at as well.

15
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:23,984
What debate in Lund is for something, I expect many of you who follow in television know

16
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,350
and certainly all of you who are

17
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
Here at the Grand Hotel as well.

18
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
This increasingly rich forum we see as a place for Lund University

19
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:41,480
sharpest brains and carefully selected guests to discuss what might be right or wrong,

20
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,380
or true or false.

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,652
And I think many of you who are here today are well acquainted with debate in Lund

22
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:50,245
after more than a decade.

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
It's no stranger than that.

24
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:56,480
Four experts are discussing a topic

25
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,010
Without the slightest fear of making it more complicated than it already was.

26
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:06,375
This, my friends, is the equivalent of Tiktok but the opposite.

27
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:14,414
My name is Andreas Ekström and I am often found at Sydsvenskan but it is Lund University

28
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:19,706
And especially the Faculty of Social Sciences, which hosts debate in Lund.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,128
Today's discussion is about language.

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,201
Cane horses you could say and you should not imagine anything

31
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:34,936
All of you who are here in this crowded hall, which cane horses did you ride here?

32
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
Anyone want to shout just?
 What is your linguistic cane horse?

33
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Judgment.

34
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:42,735
What did we have in the back?
 Don't be shy now!

35
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:45,871
Specials yes!
 You don't have to make it tonight anyway

36
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:50,800
Because this is oral so they do not hear, it is a great advantage for you.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,166
I am convinced that we all have our different ones.

38
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:59,165
Right now, where we are in time, I am struggling with "Mello".

39
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:04,053
Melodifestivalen spelled with an L, "Mello" with two L and it's so incredibly infantile

40
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:08,596
That you can't use the whole word so I sit and stay in the table.

41
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:12,796
Even the newspapers' telegram agency has switched to writing "Mello" in its reports.

42
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,062
I will lose that battle too.

43
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,361
I guess you feel the same way.

44
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,210
We also have some people with us on stage here

45
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,760
Who knows differently about such things.

46
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,359
Cane horses have them, I can promise, but also quite different views on what

47
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,358
can be nice and ugly language and the value of both the conservative

48
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:35,808
And the progressive attitude.

49
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,124
First and foremost, closest to me we meet Anna Gustafsson who is an associate professor and associate professor

50
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:46,389
In the Swedish language with a background in the editorial staff for SAOB, the Swedish Academy Dictionary.

51
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:47,584
Welcome Anna!

52
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:57,088
Many of you certainly recognize Ola Wikander, who is an associate professor of Bible science

53
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,720
And expert in extinct language.

54
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Welcome!

55
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:07,175
We are also very happy to have the linguist and the writer

56
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:11,584
For the book "Handbook for Language Police" here, Sara Lövestam!

57
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:21,315
Last but not least, experienced Swedish teacher from the Cathedral School, high school here in Lund,

58
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
Here we have Daniel Sandin, welcome!

59
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:31,913
You know what?
 I actually assume that you love language.

60
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,913
You do that huh?

61
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Why?

62
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,245
Something is it that has brought you

63
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,111
To the place where you devote your life to this.

64
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,911
Do you want to start Daniel?
 Where does love come from?

65
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,243
Where would I be without language?

66
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,809
Without language I would not be me, I think.

67
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:59,641
Without language, no one would be in here who we are.

68
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,974
No one would have been people without language.

69
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:04,340
It is simply the origin of life for you?

70
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Yes...

71
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
It is almost existential now that I hear myself speak.

72
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,551
But the fact is yes,

73
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,838
It feels like it's so important.

74
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,437
Everything that happens in here can not be something but the language I dress it in words with.

75
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,503
And without the language I probably would not have thought either.

76
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:29,635
What does Sara say then?
 Where does your love come from?

77
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
It is difficult to even

78
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:37,367
say for this special interest,

79
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,783
I have had that whole life.
 I cared so incredibly much about

80
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,032
Language from I was two

81
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,439
and therefore it is difficult to say where it comes from

82
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
As I see in language,

83
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,497
So it is that it is ...

84
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,143
It is a nothing but an agreement

85
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,395
between all the people who speak a particular language.

86
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Had we not agreed

87
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
Then we could not use it and then it had not existed.

88
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
So it's like

89
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,026
the most intricate, complicated and universal agreement that exists

90
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,825
And I don't understand how someone can't be interested in it.

91
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,838
Welcome to Lund University!

92
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:26,047
Here are thousands of employees who feel exactly so for their subject.

93
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,911
Ola Wikander, you are one of them, associate professor just in Bible science.
 But you

94
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,589
is known in popular culture for your love for many

95
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,488
Language and extinct language, not least.
 Where does this come from?

96
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,021
Yes, just to pick up what you said, this with humanity.

97
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,416
One of my private favorite thinkers, who was not a language philosopher, is Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin.

98
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,372
He used to say something style with that

99
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,255
"We must explain the world from man and not man from the world",

100
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:59,327
Which is a rather radical humanistic position.

101
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
If you say so, what is most typically

102
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,883
For man really as we see?

103
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,883
Yes, the language.

104
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,649
We cannot express anything without the linguistic

105
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:12,366
and that makes it if we want to be in any sense of the word humanists

106
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:15,014
and explain the world and man in any sense

107
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,713
so we have to take the language by the horns, to use a strange catakres,

108
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
but but,

109
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,412
Yes, because it is the most human we have so I agree with it and

110
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Not only

111
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,011
I as a human being without man with great m

112
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
is the speaking ...

113
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Yes, that's enough.

114
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Really.

115
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,342
But then I am very fond of taking the language by the horns, then I immediately become very happy,

116
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
better than...

117
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,275
It was both good and bad at the same time in some way.

118
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:49,208
Rather a bird in hand before jumping over the hedge.

119
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,274
Yes yes, you mix them up there, I love this, very nice.

120
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:57,573
Anna, you've gone all the way.
 Swedish Academy Dictionary and Research,

121
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
why?

122
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Why?

123
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,771
So I have to tie a little to the gang here but I think it is ...

124
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,904
We have all been there to

125
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,470
We try to find words to

126
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,615
describe what we know or what we think and

127
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
had difficulty for it,

128
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,935
I think.
 Everyone also has the experience of this.

129
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,783
It has probably been a driving force,

130
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Interest in the language.

131
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,183
But then it probably has come to be

132
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,298
How the language becomes the link to other people, how we understand each other.

133
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,664
From the dictionary and the different meanings of words, how you can perceive words

134
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,230
in different ways depending on which contexts,

135
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,596
which persons that pronounces them, in which meetings they occur to

136
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,961
How we interpret impendings in political communication.

137
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,593
So it has always been this link to others and how we understand each other.

138
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,975
Just that, what you say with political communication,

139
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
It has become a whole science

140
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
just as a citizen that one must be observant

141
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,024
On "We BRAKE WITH US", "We review our routines", "Yes, I hear what you say", all these empty ...

142
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:16,024
"I hear what you say" just means I see you talk.

143
00:09:16,024 --> 00:09:21,356
I love all these expressions and what I want to ask you is of course

144
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
If you have that observance?

145
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,288
Can you really participate in regular conversations without the research brain ticking?

146
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:29,788
No, that does not work.

147
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
Absolutely not.
 It's easy to start as well,

148
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,220
You are looking for implications everywhere.

149
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,785
I have devoted myself to this pretty much lately to

150
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,185
to think about what is implied in political communication,

151
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:47,884
Especially in connection with the election this fall.

152
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
Because the debate we have received now

153
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
that is so fast,

154
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,455
compressed, we have like

155
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,383
Twitter posts with vocabulary or instagram posts or

156
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:03,948
TV debate times that are time-limited, you get to talk for 30 seconds.

157
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
People react to single

158
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,113
Words that become signal on such [explosion sound].

159
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:12,812
Yes, that too, but it is also the case that as a politician you have to penetrate something

160
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:19,178
Instead of saying, and now I'm going to give a very short example:

161
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
In Sweden there are parallel communities.

162
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,609
Parallel societies have their own legal system.

163
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:31,609
This legal system is a threat to our society.

164
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:34,608
There are three statements, one can go against each of them

165
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,174
If you listen.
 You could say: "Stop, is there really a legal system there?"

166
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:45,173
Instead, you compress this to a single sentence that is perhaps:

167
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,935
Parallel communities in Sweden

168
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,205
With their own legal systems is a threat.

169
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,335
So the one who will then respond to it must respond to the claim in a threat.

170
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,403
It requires much more of the one who listens to pick up these underpriced things

171
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,702
In text that says parallel communities in a specific form,

172
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
What do you mean by that?
 You don't

173
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,901
and then the heavenly mass of subordinates becomes that

174
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,234
Sprinkled on.

175
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:15,071
What you say is that a good linguistic science is immediately

176
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Politically important?

177
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
I mean absolutely

178
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
And I really meant that this one

179
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,498
the competence to see it as being understood

180
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
is some kind

181
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Civil armor

182
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
which everyone should be trained in.

183
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,930
Yes, it is interesting because this is something that we have talked a lot about in other types of debates,

184
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:40,928
Thus, political polarization and media logic that we have also debated here in debate in Lund.

185
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,791
What the language does with one's understanding is something that we should go into deeper but also

186
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,631
where you place yourself as a human being, who do you then become as voter and

187
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
as a citizen.

188
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
We had another debate here that was about meritocracy,

189
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,370
Very much our students here at the university.

190
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,358
How do you qualify best if you think about one career in one or the other?

191
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:03,357
And what should be measured and what should be important?

192
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:07,356
It was probably a year ago or so, you can check it through the web if you want.

193
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
But then I ask this then:

194
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
To what extent is

195
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,655
A good language merit?

196
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:18,530
Very loud, the highest.

197
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,167
Because that's what we have.

198
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,263
I think everyone could have responded to this with humanity.

199
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
That's what we have.

200
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,431
We have nothing else to convey our expertise

201
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,183
And our knowledge in something than the language.

202
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:42,183
So we can't convey it then ...

203
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:48,482
Yes, but I now think of my old ones, I have a background as a SFI teacher

204
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,119
and precisely the experience of all sitting there, adult students in an SFI classroom

205
00:12:53,414 --> 00:13:00,179
that have so many adult abilities, knowledge

206
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,179
and so the only thing they can say

207
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
"When does the bus leave?,

208
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,744
"What time is it?"

209
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,543
And so you have all this.

210
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,642
So yes, it is quite telling how much the language controls how you are perceived.

211
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:24,641
If you ever fight Daniel by motivating your students by plugging into the next sample,

212
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:28,640
Do you use the future argument a lot?
 So because

213
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,473
See that this you need this, you will not be able to write good job applications,

214
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,473
You will not be able to write good home tentor.

215
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,372
I do that of course but I don't think they take it

216
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,704
because it lies like in the age of age and

217
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,753
The nature of youth not to really see those arguments.

218
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:46,623
But I am convinced, that is that

219
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,436
Builds my vision of what is incredibly important.

220
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,735
I want to give them, as we certainly come in at later, not to

221
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,601
back too much but really stand up to that it is so

222
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Incredibly important

223
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Being able to express oneself,

224
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,766
Incredibly important to master language

225
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,032
as they perceive is old -fashioned or passé.

226
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,967
For it provides access to arenas that

227
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,764
They may not even know that they will need it but they will need it.

228
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:23,234
But explaining to them that it is important is very difficult

229
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:26,662
Because they don't have the tools to understand it always.
 Sometimes, sometimes not.

230
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,143
But sometimes I think that we don't understand either.

231
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
Just as you say, that's what we have.

232
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:38,760
Language is the most important work tool for a lot of professions that do not think about it.

233
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,625
So doctors, how do they know how the patient is doing?
 Yes, the language.

234
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:51,391
A rather different language than they themselves are used to formulating these things in so it becomes

235
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,023
Some kind of double -speaking between that situation.

236
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,522
Just!
 Then you have to have your own and be able to understand ...

237
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,929
One must be able to have the analytical scientific language running in the brain

238
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:07,521
While hearing the patient tell with other terminology.

239
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:10,187
It is a fairly sophisticated situation there.

240
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:12,127
This really applies to a lot of working groups.

241
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,919
You simply have to be an educator.

242
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,452
Ola, you said a word there, double -lust.
 What was the nice word for that?

243
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,453
Diglossi.

244
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,085
Diglossi, then I have learned the first new words of the evening.

245
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,117
I note this, nice.

246
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:26,743
Cucumber you had before.

247
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:30,032
Cucumber, that's before we started with the TV broadcast,

248
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,682
I'll just say it to the poor TV audience.

249
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,682
Now everyone sits here wondering what it is.

250
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:37,448
We do not intend to talk about this but now we continue with ours.

251
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:41,447
Anna, you have identified differences

252
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
in word knowledge

253
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,613
between generations not least.

254
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:50,015
I know you did a study on this.
 Can't you tell us a little bit about what it was you learned?

255
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,343
Yes.
 That was me and David Håkansson in

256
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,011
Uppsala who did a study of the college exam.

257
00:15:56,011 --> 00:16:01,010
We looked at how the comprehension of word on the college exam had over time between

258
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,610
in 2000 and 2011.

259
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,576
Then we could see ...

260
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,175
This is like a somewhat difficult method because there are new words that are tested every year but

261
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,151
All the words that are being tested have also been performed and then we could compare the pre -tests

262
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,673
With regular tests, so to speak.

263
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,673
Then we could see that the comprehension of word

264
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,127
in the younger generation and in the older generation,

265
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:32,404
And we say that the younger one is below 25 and the older one is 40 plus, went apart.

266
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:39,436
It is the college exam we are talking about here, so you have to think from that perspective.

267
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:43,435
They went apart, the distance between the generations increased during this period.

268
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,601
And what happened as we went closer and looked at these results was to

269
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
the younger generation

270
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:57,499
lost understanding of Germanic and Nordic words.

271
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,932
It was mainly there that it went down.

272
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,172
That's the English influence then?

273
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:06,864
Yes, or it is that they do not read that type of text where those words are.

274
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:11,596
Say news texts or newspaper texts simply.

275
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:15,462
However, it was pretty even

276
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
In the understanding of English words,

277
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
There, their understanding stood.

278
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:24,927
So that what happened was really the understanding of old Swedish words,

279
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,927
I have actually marked here

280
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
Which words went down the most.

281
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:34,125
Post, culvert strange enough,

282
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
withdrawal,

283
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
tedious,

284
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
warn,

285
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
exist.

286
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,857
So words like man ...

287
00:17:41,857 --> 00:17:44,523
Bureaucratic embossed Germanic words.

288
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:47,956
In addition, but also as you can find in some news texts.

289
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:53,021
We had chosen words, we have not examined all the words but words that appear in newspapers,

290
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:55,654
So it was our selection criteria.

291
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:57,794
Serious words simply.

292
00:17:57,794 --> 00:17:58,783
Serious words.

293
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,650
It made an effort.

294
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,927
But something I have noticed

295
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,804
When I have been out, I am not just about language but I write novels, after all,

296
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:09,791
so i'm out and hold

297
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,863
Printer workshop for children and young people

298
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,167
and then I have

299
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,482
A rule that it can only be volunteers who come for us to have a good time together.

300
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,711
So there will only be enthusiastic young people who want to write on their sports holiday.

301
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,319
So you start with any writing exercise

302
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,580
And then there are always a few

303
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
Which says "Yes, I usually write in English".

304
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
And that is

305
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:46,655
people with Swedish parents, they do not go in English school or so without them

306
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,348
Writing in English.

307
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:53,055
This is something that I was not so used to ten years ago but now I am the giant.

308
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,475
I talked to two 14-year-olds for not long time

309
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:59,841
Who told them that they are in the process of writing a book together.

310
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,039
Yes, what fun I said, pepper them.
 What is it about?

311
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
"We write in English because we can do better."

312
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,672
And these 14-year-olds, I know them.
 They have all Swedish parents, speak Swedish at home

313
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
so I asked “How can you

314
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
Say you know English better? ”

315
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,704
"No, but we're watching English series and is on Tiktok."

316
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:30,335
What is the book about then? "" Yes, this is a word I cannot in Swedish but scientist. "

317
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
I only "scientist!".

318
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:36,789
There I almost went into angry aunt fashion.

319
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:41,233
What is the loss of domain?

320
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,779
And that the domain was kind of everything.

321
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:48,298
Although not that the domain is exciting fiction?

322
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:54,495
Just those people, I can a little recognize myself in my teens here if I am to be completely

323
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
Wicked to myself.

324
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,359
No but if you have been flushed by

325
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
popular culture in a language

326
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:06,961
Then that domain becomes natural and the Swede sounds a bit like that.

327
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:10,594
Yes, so many people have read fantasy.

328
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:14,463
I would get into it.

329
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,791
So if you have a background in where you have read very fantastic just,

330
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:23,758
Not just fantastic, but literature with bombastic tone.

331
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:29,311
This something I've argued about in different contexts that bother me,

332
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
to Swedish language

333
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,123
or literature policy perhaps, not language policy,

334
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:38,122
have been a bit negative in recent years against the big -wise one,

335
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:44,026
which is more of in English language area and it can make you just when you take in so

336
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:46,654
In Swedish you feel a little pathetic.

337
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,086
But Ola, isn't that if you say "I love you" as a mother tongue speaker

338
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:58,118
So it comes to one but "I love you" costs no more than thanks for the coffee.

339
00:20:58,118 --> 00:21:03,750
It is a huge difference, such as swearing, to say fuck as Swedish

340
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,750
It costs nothing for almost anyone in the room.

341
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,316
There was any shocked native speaker who felt the inappropriate

342
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:13,315
But all of you who are Swedes do not know the roughness of the swearing in the same way.

343
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,552
Don't it do with it?
 That one is distancing with one's second language

344
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:18,214
And that can be an advantage with that then?

345
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,747
I was going to have fun now and say yes, we have even written professional books.

346
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,680
Sorry, we are in Lund, not Gothenburg.

347
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:32,211
But, so it is and not least with the word shit

348
00:21:32,211 --> 00:21:34,864
Which is a very strong swear word in English.

349
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:36,148
Really,

350
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:39,906
Not to mention the so-called F-word that can make Americans completely terrified and

351
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:42,209
So people in Sweden pronounce it in school yards and everywhere.

352
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:48,608
But just shit, there I have to tell you a fun thing I was with.

353
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:53,024
I wrote an interview text, this is 15 years ago, and interviewed

354
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,807
A young lady who had been accepted as a priest.

355
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:58,806
She had been with the bishop and attended the education here in Lund.

356
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:01,672
So I asked what she was thinking when she came out and learned that she had been accepted.

357
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:04,005
"Ahh, I thought Shit what a thing!"

358
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:07,004
Of course, I could write that.

359
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:10,237
But this text would be included in a book that would also be made in English

360
00:22:10,237 --> 00:22:14,003
So this text would be translated into English.
 Then I realize what a dilemma.

361
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,064
She can't say it in English.

362
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,702
HOT DARN!

363
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:23,134
Oh right.
 What will then be the right level for a Swedish

364
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,001
20-year-old's use of the word shit

365
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,072
But in English?

366
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:32,192
And since it was the bishop and a priest, it wasn't my idea, it was the brilliant translator

367
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,965
With Holy Cow.

368
00:22:36,365 --> 00:22:37,965
Great!
 You have to give them that, it was neat.

369
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:38,965
Holy Moly!

370
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:41,964
Yes but very good so.

371
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,296
Then we have concluded and it is really quite obvious that you are interpreted

372
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,296
for how good man is and one is valued meritocratically

373
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:52,296
For how good you are in the language.

374
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:55,695
You know that too Daniel, you have observed in

375
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,608
American Academic Worlds Now where one is starting to discuss whether to release

376
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,763
it a bit and let the traditionally black American English

377
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:09,392
where you turn on the negations and so on, we might start accepting it

378
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,128
At High School and at University.
 What do you think about it?

379
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
I mean, I think

380
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
Accepting one may well do, thus,

381
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,112
But one should be aware of where it leads to.

382
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:28,000
Let's say you write a text that you want to be taken seriously and reach out with

383
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,536
So I don't believe that

384
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
It is a good method to write it on

385
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,887
Even if it expresses someone ...

386
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,953
Thus, language again conveys something, it conveys an identity.

387
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,872
That way you convey my identity.

388
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,651
But if you go into the academic world, I think too ...

389
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,552
You have to convey the academic identity, this is to reach out.

390
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,600
And then there are

391
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,267
All the unions, you have to like ...

392
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,976
I mean, right away when Ola said that deglossia

393
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,348
So he immediately talks about "I'm a little knowledgeable here".

394
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:05,048
It applies to both myself and ...

395
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:09,682
It's signal value and you ask, I think it's very important

396
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:13,046
Being aware of what you do with the language.

397
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,688
So I should not say that you should or should not.
 Who should ban it?

398
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:21,504
But one should be aware that

399
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
how to write affects

400
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
What reception you get.

401
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,343
But the question is really, because to some extent you represent Swedish high school,

402
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:33,775
So it is what line it prefers, then drives.

403
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:40,448
I would tell my students to write you so but expect nothing

404
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,840
good job or any prominent career.

405
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:50,864
You need to learn the codes so you can choose,

406
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:57,271
Then you can be in the system and choose language or choose to go against the power

407
00:24:57,271 --> 00:25:01,003
And do something else and then it is a conscious decision.

408
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,669
It is an important point that is because so fast

409
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,608
Someone thinks that now we'll make a reform about something

410
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,700
So there will always be some people who get stuck there.

411
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,240
There is one thing with the people who

412
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
mastered both for and after so well

413
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:22,685
so that they can only switch and, if necessary, switch back when they end up another social

414
00:25:22,685 --> 00:25:26,698
context or in a more language conservative environment or whatever.

415
00:25:26,698 --> 00:25:30,031
But those who get stuck, they are those who don't have

416
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,897
that double -speaking and can't do it.

417
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,768
And is told that no but now it is okay to write

418
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
What was not okay to write for a week.

419
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:44,061
Well, they think fun, then I do it but at the same time there is this large population

420
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,227
that has not internalized, got the message, to speak Swengel,

421
00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:53,226
and they will so see just these people

422
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,968
And treat them in a certain way.

423
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,509
You often take this up with language simplification,

424
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,591
I have been discussion with different people about this, as some kind of ...

425
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,724
Equalizer then.

426
00:26:04,724 --> 00:26:09,534
Yes, a class equalizer but I think it risks going to just the opposite direction

427
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,023
because what it does is to

428
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,588
those who bring with them both the traditional and the easy -going can

429
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
swim lightly in those waters and know

430
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,824
easily how to switch between a

431
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,176
One style form to another for example, one spelling method to another.

432
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
But those who don't have it

433
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:32,320
marks directly what they end up and get no help with that

434
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
learn to navigate.

435
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:40,450
This sounds a bit like this classic argument from the left in Sweden to

436
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,249
We should not have too much grades in school because it points out those who are weak.

437
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:47,658
The counter -argument has been that yes, we should have grades because those who do not have

438
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:48,948
resources with them from home,

439
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:53,648
It is their chance to get around formal meritocracy, it is a bit like that argument,

440
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:56,904
That it becomes a tool with the formal.

441
00:26:56,904 --> 00:27:00,013
So the difference, without giving me into any grading discussion ...

442
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:04,012
The difference is that,

443
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,216
To take this example that I hope we will not talk too much about tonight

444
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:08,928
Because I'm tired of it, namely they and them,

445
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,577
You can benefit from being able to do that.

446
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:16,076
That there was a certain rating when you went to eight and you don't have much benefit from the rest of your life,

447
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:18,343
If I can be a crass.

448
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,141
But these language skills functions, you can actually use them for something.

449
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,456
I wanted to keep talking about American to

450
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:38,505
Actually, the written language is for us to have,

451
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,184
It should be a language that is a bit washed

452
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,971
From speech -speaking contamination, you might say.

453
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:49,970
Or you understand, there is a standard for it.

454
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:56,435
We pronounce all words different but we spell them the same way it is a type of standardization

455
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,664
which is certainly built on very much who had

456
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:08,233
The highest status when this was established but it is still the type of function it should have.

457
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,276
Afro-American variation of American English,

458
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,964
It has its own grammar and everything

459
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:19,331
So then the question is, you have to give it ...

460
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,863
Respects and everything, it's really cool!

461
00:28:21,863 --> 00:28:24,863
Yes exactly!
 But then the question is,

462
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,995
Should you then have it as a variant?
 Then it should receive a language status,

463
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:32,640
Do you understand what I mean?
 It's not just one ...

464
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,992
Not just a dialect status because a dialect is still written

465
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
When you write, do you understand what I mean?

466
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,576
Then it becomes Tornedal Finnish as well,

467
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
minority language status.

468
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
Thanks so much!

469
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,983
Do you think it would have a minority language status?

470
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,744
Is it like the extremely that,

471
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
That it should all the way to make it ...

472
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
If so.

473
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,495
Sure, why not?

474
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:54,516
But you, Ola, you mentioned it,

475
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,378
This whole question of objects and subject form for personal pronouns

476
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:01,824
in third person in plural,

477
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,188
That is, they and them.

478
00:29:07,188 --> 00:29:09,291
I saw that someone had written so well the other day

479
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,920
"Those who cannot distinguish between them and they will get their judgment".

480
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,719
Elegant formulated!

481
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:18,719
Okay, now we take it.
 We just take it, we have to anyway, you understand that.

482
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:21,685
Okay, Anna.
 They or them, how should we do?

483
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:23,685
I think we have already been into it.

484
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:30,550
I agree with this, somehow we can't start school.

485
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:36,049
We cannot start with the teachers stop teaching it, it must somehow start

486
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,515
from the other side.

487
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,915
I have no strong feelings about them and them, they!

488
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,880
It was a unique position in the debate, I must say that.

489
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
The name, the language changes and

490
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416
Soon we will change

491
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
To them straight over.

492
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,579
It has been good in spoken language for maybe 100 years when we have not made a difference

493
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:56,352
And we have nevertheless understood each other.

494
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,634
It's the central to me.

495
00:29:58,634 --> 00:29:59,988
Ola, how should we do?

496
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:04,476
Thus, what I always want to say on this issue is that nothing is determined

497
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:07,343
And nothing is natural.

498
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,375
All this has to do with language ideological and language policy considerations

499
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:18,074
And that change has taken place has no moral implication in any way.

500
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:21,140
Which means we are in the unique situation that

501
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:27,758
We can choose and then I think we can well learn growing generations

502
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:33,437
To master that standard whether they speak as Finns or not.

503
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:37,318
Just that, for Finnish Swedes still do.

504
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:43,035
Well, not all but some do.
 My grandmother who was very Scanian made the difference in speech.

505
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:44,992
But anyway,

506
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,708
What annoys me in this discussion it is when you make it

507
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:51,136
Like that there is some kind of pure automation,

508
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,136
that by the fact that

509
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,536
The majority speech has lost this distinction a long time ago,

510
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:01,032
Which is completely empirical correct, there is no discussion about it.

511
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,864
Thus, some kind of morality follows

512
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,288
to change the written language.

513
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,430
No!
 It just doesn't!
 Oh!

514
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,430
It holds against?

515
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,386
Absolutely!

516
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,195
And that is what I am committed to, this notion of an automatism.

517
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:23,994
But is it really a moral argument?
 It is not rather about ...

518
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:26,993
Yes, but a little it is.
 "You make it too difficult for the growing up ...".

519
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:32,992
In fact, 40 % of teachers have already stopped teaching elementary school or accepted this.

520
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,992
Then it is a choice they have made.

521
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:39,958
In addition, we can note that in the 80s, when I was a little PAG,

522
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,592
Then it was a lot of journalists who wrote them

523
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,896
And then they stopped it.

524
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:49,122
It is the same with the so-called modern spelling in the early 1900s

525
00:31:49,122 --> 00:31:51,955
When they wrote "Say" for themselves,

526
00:31:51,955 --> 00:31:53,955
Dan Andersson does so for example.

527
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:57,206
But not many people write plural forms now

528
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,020
Without there, there are some things that disappear.

529
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,353
The name of course and sooner or later you take such ...

530
00:32:03,353 --> 00:32:06,352
It is a very good example,

531
00:32:06,352 --> 00:32:09,352
It lasted a few hundred years in writing after it began to die out in speech

532
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,084
And then someone made a decision and then it went pretty fast.

533
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:16,128
We have had spelling reforms of various kinds, even in other countries.

534
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,712
But now I also want to hear what Sara and Daniel say here, how should we do?

535
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:29,696
I don't really have strong feelings either, but I see it as we stand a little at a crossroads.

536
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:36,280
That either we release them freely

537
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
or so we get

538
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,445
plague

539
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,056
teaching both young and old and somehow

540
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:50,176
Start promotions, as well as a Swedish tiger size on that campaign

541
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,392
There are studies, there are not much studies actually on

542
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:07,640
How much more mistakes are made on them and them, there are not so many.

543
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,936
I know that Lena Lind Palicki and Susanna Karlsson

544
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,056
have done but then they have done studies on

545
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:22,104
people who go for the third year on theoretical programs

546
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,248
in high school and it is perhaps a group that is quite

547
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,270
Easy to turn.

548
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,736
I have done

549
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,672
Own personal studies to have some fun on the weekend

550
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,935
So then I have been sitting and downloaded big text tjog

551
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:43,100
from family life.se and from flashback

552
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:49,312
And then I have taken texttjog from 2004 when family life started

553
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:54,664
and some from 2022 and taken out all of them and them

554
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
and compared to each other.

555
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
You can do this at home!

556
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,088
And then checked how many ...

557
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:07,428
It is a small ground, I only had a few hours on Sunday to do this but

558
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:12,352
on it turned out that there was not much difference in 2004 to 2022 except

559
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,725
in the case of a specific article.

560
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:27,264
Good audience!
 There is a person at the front who said "I knew it!".

561
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:32,637
Well, for those who have temporarily forgotten a definite article,

562
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,368
So when you say

563
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:39,744
"The half -full glasses on the tables",

564
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:44,254
that, according to my little study, one

565
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:45,699
So it is more common to write now

566
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,953
"The half -full glasses" and there was not anywhere in my material from 2004.

567
00:34:50,953 --> 00:34:55,452
So maybe something is happening and maybe we're on our way to this particular crossroads

568
00:34:55,452 --> 00:34:57,252
Where we have to choose.

569
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,992
I happened to start one like that debate

570
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:06,112
In the media that dealt with you and them.
 It was because one, I had a deadline

571
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:11,488
and two, I was so annoyed at that

572
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:18,314
A highly educated friend I have in my 50s does not know the difference, she writes the wrong time.

573
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:22,080
Then I thought, this judgment reform just can't come

574
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,568
so that we do not have this and that was what I would come to, that there is

575
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,920
not so many investigations into where it is heading with them and them

576
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,711
But there are surveys showing that those who become annoyed,

577
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:41,710
They become more annoyed at a misused they or them than a widely used judgment.

578
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,972
Can you match in passion Daniel?
 How should we do?

579
00:35:51,972 --> 00:35:55,264
I think I can match the passion actually ...

580
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,200
No, but like this: we might be at a crossroads but I think there is also that there is

581
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,248
Other perspectives on this.

582
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,238
It's not just them and them, it pretty much in the language

583
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,088
which is difficult.

584
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:15,559
I mean, it's not very hard to learn the difference between them and them,

585
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,336
Apart from your academic colleague.

586
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:23,101
But most people who have reasonable knowledge of the language handle it, it is not very strange.

587
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:29,000
What is required are teachers who teach the young people, the children,

588
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,833
to manage subject and object forms in writing.

589
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,033
It's no stranger than that.

590
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,666
The problem is something else that I see it,

591
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:38,732
That it becomes like an educational issue.

592
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
That we have such a large proportion early in elementary school

593
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,797
Teachers who themselves do not master them and them.

594
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:50,796
Then you are facing a crossroads.
 Should we resign one because we have a teaching profession ...

595
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
I know, I stand out

596
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
Hakan here a bit as a teacher but I think ...

597
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
If so many

598
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
Teacher do not manage themselves and them

599
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:04,327
Without choosing to write them, it is clear that the children will write them.

600
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,659
So you get up to high school and so:

601
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:10,659
"Yes, we always had to write them, it went well ..."

602
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:12,659
I just mean that it's a question

603
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:16,158
And when we talk about these stuff we talk, I mean the SJ sounds,

604
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,690
Why should we spell the SJ sounds in seventy-eleven different ways?

605
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,690
It's pretty hard to learn.

606
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:27,389
Not for us anymore because we have learned but for the children, our only generation of young people

607
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,496
Must learn every word with spelling about it ...

608
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:36,054
Yes, you know how many SJ sound it is.
 After all, it was a bit tricky, there are no direct rules.

609
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,053
But this is also associated with another thing,

610
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:43,052
Namely, the learning of what usually becomes our third language in Swedish.

611
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,585
Because if you can't these basic grammatical things

612
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:49,952
Do you get pretty tough to learn German if you try to do it when you are sixteen

613
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,450
If you are not clear to you the difference between accusative and dative,

614
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,116
A toolbox is needed to take on what often becomes our third or fourth language

615
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:59,449
After Swedish and English.

616
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:01,625
Or that's when you get it.

617
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:08,747
Now, not many people have read German, I do not know how it is right now,

618
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,680
But at least it's my experience that

619
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,946
That's when you learned grammar when you started reading German.

620
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
Or Spanish or French.

621
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,444
Because it was not needed in the same way, it is not necessary for one's own native language in the same way.

622
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:27,277
I think Saras

623
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:31,343
Students at the writing courses who want to write in English, do they have problems with They and TheM?

624
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:37,741
It really is no big question really

625
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,841
But there is quite a lot else that comes with

626
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,407
And maybe there are signs of something we don't want, I think.

627
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:48,239
Like a view of education, language.

628
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,239
Because it is not just remove your

629
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,184
Back compatibility as well.

630
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:57,024
By removing them and them we also give a whole new generation

631
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:01,303
It is more difficult to read everything that is written back in time.

632
00:39:01,303 --> 00:39:04,103
There are such aspects, in the same way as we would pie SJ sounds

633
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:07,102
If we remove them because it's so hard

634
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,312
for young people to learn.

635
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:13,568
Because that is the only argument for removing, because it is a bit difficult.

636
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:17,134
Not only, it is also that we do not make that distinction in speech.

637
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,832
I listened to Mumin, it was wonderful but I know it's a minority Finnish Swede

638
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:25,832
But it is still honest.

639
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:30,137
You Ola, I am fascinated by saying, crossroads you agree,

640
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:33,164
But Ola said we are in a election situation as well.

641
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,863
Because something none of you have said

642
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,240
but as one often hears in the debate it is

643
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,262
"But they are unstoppable, it will still be so."

644
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:46,395
That is, that is what we can call the cannabis argument,

645
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:50,060
"People still smoke, we have to make the shit, it can't do anything else."

646
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,060
But I don't look at it.

647
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,696
I have flirted with that argument but then I do not think it is a natural force

648
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:03,125
Without me, I think more according to our tradition of language changes.

649
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:13,056
That the Swedish language has often chosen

650
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
the road that follows the spoken language.

651
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,633
It is a remarkable conservative position you take now.

652
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,721
Exactly, I was just going to say that on the contrary,

653
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,721
that the one who says no in this,

654
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:28,120
Now we shall stop following the spoken language in writing

655
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,720
As we have always done, well then is denn

656
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:38,018
the person quite radical and does not follow the traditional as we have done

657
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:45,183
With all our spelling reforms and the plural shapes, what you always take up is.

658
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:48,216
That said, lasting for 200 years after all.

659
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:50,249
So you think we can hold them for another 100 years?

660
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:52,249
No, but that is an example of

661
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,528
That we have not always been so quick on that.

662
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,530
Well, you should not be either.

663
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:03,013
No, you should not be, but it is not that we have a strong tradition of standardizing

664
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
the written language in that way.

665
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,608
The spelling forms were such

666
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,777
But the plural forms went more organically, where it was a

667
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,210
actor at a time as decided and it was only when TT ...

668
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,309
Exemplify now you are kind so we are completely on what you mean.

669
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:24,542
Who was now that removed them and in what order?

670
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:30,541
Was not the Teachers' Union who recommended to stop teaching it

671
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:31,540
In the late 40s?

672
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,506
And it was quite late, you usually say ...

673
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,906
Lucky I wrote a book about this!

674
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:44,704
It is usually said that with Nils Holgersson, the plural forms disappeared in spoken language reservations

675
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:53,703
And gradually, newspaper editions removed it and then TT removed it.

676
00:41:55,469 --> 00:42:00,001
The Language Council, now I have not memorized the dates for this.

677
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:03,801
Sara is going to the sources in herself here.

678
00:42:04,934 --> 00:42:07,999
Important years for the language police ...

679
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,788
1943 it is Dagens Nyheter that slips the verb plural forms and

680
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:18,664
Soon all the other major newspapers follow.

681
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,063
But that's big is when TT does it in 1945.

682
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,029
How does such an old form sound?

683
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:32,319
Well, yes but it is, for example, instead of saying the drops drops

684
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
As we do now,

685
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,164
If you say the drops drop.

686
00:42:35,164 --> 00:42:39,743
We still have this in our Christmas songs, among other things, we come instead of us.

687
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,326
Crayfish require these drinks.

688
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:47,359
Just!
 These are the old plural forms that were removed under certain frame screams

689
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:54,724
Especially 1945 when TT, the newspapers' telegram agency, assumed that they would now ...

690
00:42:55,103 --> 00:43:00,389
There is a great fun submitter in the Trelleborg Post from 1945 about it

691
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,989
And then people had

692
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,011
not talked so on a long time and

693
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:08,927
After all, there are many workers' writers, for example, who had a very hard time,

694
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,954
Because they did not have that drill with them.

695
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:15,520
The fairs flower, to take an example.

696
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,519
But there is also such a thing, I hard think in that question

697
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,685
that it would have been pretty good about people

698
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,018
In school today learned to passively understand how those forms work

699
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:31,450
because we have so much literature written with that form of form

700
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,949
And then you can also avoid such

701
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,315
I school and things that hurt the soul when you hear.

702
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,115
It should be a star in a book I have!

703
00:43:41,115 --> 00:43:47,513
Yes and the thing is that as this was so conservative thing under

704
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,079
So many years we have a huge literature that is written so and

705
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:59,511
It would have been pretty good to teach perhaps to high school students a quick overview of how this works

706
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:03,510
Because they will be confronted with something that is written like this.

707
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,271
I can say not only when they read

708
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,575
Strindberg without,

709
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
If they do now.

710
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:17,141
I teach in classic Hebrew and our grammar is written

711
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,071
sometime in the 60s

712
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,473
But it was written by a conservative shock called Ivan Engnell and he writes

713
00:44:22,473 --> 00:44:26,572
With plural forms and my students they bounce on that.

714
00:44:26,572 --> 00:44:28,572
Bounces but they understand them?

715
00:44:28,572 --> 00:44:33,438
Most but I get to smile a little obliquely.

716
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:40,436
But then you can of course answer "but write new grammar then", of course.

717
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,879
But the point is still that we have a huge

718
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,927
Collection text written in this way

719
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:50,559
And you can actually learn things without writing yourself.

720
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,143
You can learn it as a literary ...

721
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:57,133
But it is fashionable to write about books now.

722
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:01,921
Last today the message came all Ian Fleming's Bond books will be cleaned up

723
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:04,098
From inappropriate languages and such.

724
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:08,764
But it becomes such a debate every time, because it is often about political things.

725
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:13,263
Now it was about the author Roald Dahl's books, that one would clean up in them,

726
00:45:13,263 --> 00:45:15,263
Then there was a big frame scream everywhere.

727
00:45:15,263 --> 00:45:19,095
Today, in a small note in Dagens Nyheter, the news will have the publishers have thought after

728
00:45:19,095 --> 00:45:21,095
And should release both versions.

729
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:22,628
Yes, they should give out double.

730
00:45:22,628 --> 00:45:25,627
Then no one reacts.
 It's so upsetting!

731
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:30,626
Now everyone believes that now PK fascism has struck and so get 90 % of those who believe that

732
00:45:30,626 --> 00:45:35,625
Now not that there was a language policy discussion that resulted in a compromise.

733
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:39,625
It does not reach out because it is not mass media enough and it ends with a note.

734
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:44,624
But that we write about and modernize children's books into a language like ...

735
00:45:44,624 --> 00:45:46,590
So, it's not just that the plural forms disappear,

736
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:52,589
It is also that the vocabulary changes and it is no wonder.

737
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,354
We have made new Bible translations for the Bible to go and understand by modern ...

738
00:45:58,354 --> 00:46:00,354
Not just why but partly.

739
00:46:00,354 --> 00:46:05,986
No but partly and there is nothing controversial about this,

740
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:10,985
You replace words that are political and then there will be rebellions.

741
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:14,984
I also have to take a small lap and this has to do with one of your texts Sara

742
00:46:14,984 --> 00:46:17,984
where you, and I think it was so good because I agree,

743
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,117
This is how the contemporary man works.

744
00:46:20,117 --> 00:46:24,116
I appreciate the word "hen" very much,

745
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,559
Like a gathering pronoun.
 It's very

746
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,581
effectively in writing, it is more human than “the”

747
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:34,580
And I don't have to write him or her in a text and can use them, it has a lot of advantages.

748
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:38,580
But then there are also those who want to replace the word "man" with "one",

749
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,580
Then you sound like Åsa-Nisse,

750
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,371
Such "Yes, no one knows how to ...".

751
00:46:42,371 --> 00:46:45,378
It will be very strange and you have explained that in a text,

752
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:50,777
Why they are excellent idea but one is a bad idea.

753
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:54,510
Because you are right, I was going to ask you to repeat.

754
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,279
Okay, this wasn't I prepared for.

755
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,809
I can quote the text by the way, I think it is so good.

756
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:01,809
Take it you.

757
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:07,840
I don't think I write bad but I write that you become no less feminist

758
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,335
just because you use the word man

759
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
as generic pronoun.

760
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:20,005
It does not affect that way and man as a pronoun

761
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:23,004
And as a noun are two completely different words.

762
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:28,036
They are used completely different, used different grammatically and even have different pronunciations,

763
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
If one thinks about the matter

764
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:33,069
For the pronoun one can never be emphasized

765
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,679
while the noun one can be emphasized.

766
00:47:35,702 --> 00:47:39,634
You can think about this in your head.

767
00:47:39,634 --> 00:47:43,200
But that's it, there are two completely different words

768
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,400
And there is no one who would ...

769
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,407
If someone says like this:

770
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:52,065
"You should always have a package of tampons with you".

771
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:55,598
Surely no one thinks like this "what? Why should men have it?"

772
00:47:55,864 --> 00:47:57,396
Without being completely ...

773
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:01,023
You also notice that on those who try

774
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,296
Using this, I call it the feminist-one.

775
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:07,059
To distinguish it from dialect.

776
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:15,527
It is noticed that they also usually slip, so to speak.

777
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:19,293
It usually tires with a man from time to time because you are so used to it

778
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,592
And because not means anything!

779
00:48:21,592 --> 00:48:25,592
I get elite there, that is, I think they are a good thing

780
00:48:25,592 --> 00:48:27,592
But you have not taken, this has Sara Lövestam taught me,

781
00:48:27,592 --> 00:48:33,190
There are two words that mean, it's called homonym, and then I get totally crazy

782
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:36,190
Of that and Mello, it's my other such cane horse ...

783
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,563
But then I'll say, I'm for Mello!

784
00:48:38,563 --> 00:48:39,451
Are you?!

785
00:48:39,451 --> 00:48:40,447
Me too.

786
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:46,521
Yes and it is a very common way to shorten words and names of things.

787
00:48:46,521 --> 00:48:50,520
But an extra L?
 You shorten and add a letter?
 How do you defend it?

788
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,503
Yes, Carolina becomes Carro with two R,

789
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,519
Clas becomes class with two s.

790
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:00,159
It follows structure we have.

791
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,351
You have to give up!

792
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,249
Yes, there you had nothing ...

793
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:14,449
Well, it's so strange.
 Then I also have to ask this question,

794
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,448
Here then hundreds of cane horses and so you and I and everyone:

795
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,804
Why do we feel so strong about this Daniel?

796
00:49:22,804 --> 00:49:26,880
Why are people so crazy about discussing language?
 I mean in a positive sense too!

797
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,880
Are we passionate about this?

798
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,111
But it does not go back to what we started to talk about, that it is human.

799
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,744
This is why it is so important that

800
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,607
Language is allowed to live,

801
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,143
That we do not let language die out.
 That people are allowed to speak their mother tongue and so on.

802
00:49:45,742 --> 00:49:49,542
It is so incredibly close associated with who I am.

803
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:53,408
Therefore, it becomes part of the identity.

804
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:59,559
I was called radical because I think something, when you said not radical

805
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:02,739
but radical position but then I sat and thought

806
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:07,743
to hold on to them and them, yes but it becomes like part of an identity to think

807
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,971
Something about the language, it becomes one of me as a human being and how I express myself.

808
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:12,607
It was a small groove.

809
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,004
But how I express myself,

810
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
That's why.

811
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,733
It says something about who I am.

812
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:28,734
You wrote something before the debate, about language, about expressing oneself in a way so one is perceived

813
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
Smarter than you really are.

814
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:35,999
I thought it was so hard on because that's what it's all about, to be able to

815
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,932
formulate themselves, somehow

816
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,535
get into an environment.
 For me, the language has been

817
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,327
part of the

818
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,399
My journey into the academic, in that environment.

819
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
To be able to

820
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,519
Navigate there and make it successful.

821
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,567
I know that when I write

822
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,562
So I will often reach.

823
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,687
I will often get

824
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:01,461
Hearing for my views because I can use the language.

825
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,575
I can convey my thoughts that way

826
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,135
And I suffer with those who can't.

827
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:10,159
When you tell you, Sara, about SFI students

828
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:15,691
which does not, who have all thoughts but who cannot convey them.

829
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,857
Therefore, language is so incredible ...

830
00:51:18,891 --> 00:51:21,190
It is clear that it engages

831
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,983
As public then?
 You have a language column in the newspaper and so,

832
00:51:24,983 --> 00:51:29,189
You must have received some choleric emails over the years I think.

833
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:35,187
Can't you pull something out of the rock sleeve?
 What do people get angry about and why?

834
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:39,903
There is one who writes to Svenska Dagbladet every time someone uses the word hen,

835
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,686
Still after eleven years.

836
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:45,642
There is a woman ...

837
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:46,685
Is it possibly paper letter?

838
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:49,716
It is both.

839
00:51:49,716 --> 00:51:52,651
Then there is a woman who is very annoyed.

840
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,463
She writes to everyone.

841
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:59,016
I am both on the radio on the international and so TV4 and SVT so I get mail from different directions.

842
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:07,114
There is a woman who is very committed to that it is not called humans

843
00:52:07,114 --> 00:52:08,681
Without it named people

844
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,647
and she writes to everyone

845
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:18,479
editors and points out that journalists are now able to talk properly.

846
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:23,478
This is a bit of a thing that I included in "Handbook for Language Police"

847
00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:30,010
Too very often it is about there is a dialectal or ancient Swedish foundation for

848
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,009
Lots of what is considered language errors today.

849
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,479
It's a bit charming that someone attacks

850
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:43,074
A "language error" that is actually Stockholm.
 Because it usually goes the other way.

851
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:45,673
It's not just Stockholm, this with you.

852
00:52:45,673 --> 00:52:49,473
No, but among other things.
 There is otherwise one

853
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,306
very scattered performance that as one speaks in

854
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:56,138
Stockholm that's right, which is - yes ...

855
00:52:56,138 --> 00:53:01,137
But why people get so committed I think is about,

856
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:06,136
Now that I have immersed myself in this language police behavior,

857
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:12,435
It is that, yes, people go around and do this, they correct each other unpaid.

858
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:20,433
This something they feel is so important that they do this, you might risk their relationships,

859
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:26,099
one is not afraid of bad mood but you really want to say that it is not called

860
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
"Where are you?".

861
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:32,631
I think this is related to what I said first, the language is

862
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,330
nothing but an agreement

863
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,929
between all people who speak this language.

864
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:45,855
Up to 13 million who know Swedish to some extent in the world, we shall agree

865
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:51,231
and do we not agree on what words mean and how to formulate,

866
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,047
which ones should in which order,

867
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,583
Where it means ...

868
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,887
So this whole grammar

869
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
And the semantics.

870
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,692
If we do not agree then we cannot communicate.

871
00:54:02,725 --> 00:54:07,615
After all, we are a large herd animal that has the opportunity to form huge flocks.

872
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,930
We can form larger flocks than any other animal on earth

873
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:14,023
by allowing us to communicate with each other.

874
00:54:14,023 --> 00:54:16,789
Then communications fall, then we fall.

875
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:20,788
That was as dramatic as I almost spoke English!

876
00:54:20,788 --> 00:54:22,788
I also want to think ...

877
00:54:22,788 --> 00:54:25,513
Some kind of group thought there ....

878
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,488
My point has not even arrived.

879
00:54:27,488 --> 00:54:31,619
It is not just agreement but it is also

880
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:38,185
What we think is right it has to do with our identity, what we have learned

881
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:41,584
in the time that shaped us as adults.

882
00:54:41,584 --> 00:54:47,583
One usually talks about a linguistic golden age about the time we come out into adulthood and professional life

883
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:50,582
And teach us all these norms.

884
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:52,582
So that's the one we fall back on.

885
00:54:52,682 --> 00:54:58,447
So we are 50-60 then the norm is still the one that was when we were 25-30.

886
00:54:58,447 --> 00:55:01,324
Sara had a point she didn't ...

887
00:55:01,324 --> 00:55:10,245
You can say that is the answer to what, what is it you want people to adapt to

888
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:12,383
But why do I think ...

889
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:16,710
Well, of course, it's about identity and a lot but also the pure

890
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:22,509
evolutionary meaning the language has

891
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,903
thanks to

892
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,439
We maintain these ...

893
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:29,108
When it comes to a child and says "Oh, I cut myself" so do you say "oh, do you cut you?"

894
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:34,107
"Yes, I cut myself".
 That all this behavior is to get people into this ...

895
00:55:34,107 --> 00:55:37,106
That was my point, I'm done.

896
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:37,967
Sorry.

897
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:39,775
Like this,

898
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
There are points in the absolute at the same time it is that,

899
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,479
I mean, we can communicate quite well with Danes and Norwegians and so on

900
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:53,270
Without starting to fight with them simply because we know they are following a norm in themselves.

901
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:57,202
So it's not just the question of group communication,

902
00:55:57,202 --> 00:55:59,368
Because then one would never have been able to cooperate with a Danish

903
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,367
Or for that matter with someone who speaks a strongly different type of Swedish from one's self.

904
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,447
I would still like to raise some flag to,

905
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:11,519
I agree with all that said here I want to emphasize but

906
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:18,798
There is one more thing that makes people, myself included, become committed to this

907
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,431
Which is that the language is an art.

908
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:26,430
The language is not just a means of communication, it is obviously,

909
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:33,995
But the language has for a long time in human history been an active art object that

910
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,827
man, whether you really want to admit it or not, are seen as a stone that has to be plastered

911
00:56:40,827 --> 00:56:43,826
To become a beautiful statue or a house or what you want to build with it.

912
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:50,175
It makes that when you hear someone say or even more when you see someone write because

913
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,491
Language Art is largely in writing about an exclusively,

914
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,024
so it becomes for some people then provocative

915
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,135
When one sees something that

916
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,455
violates what one experiences as an imagined path to some kind of beauty

917
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:08,022
And maybe even more so when it happens inadvertently.

918
00:57:08,022 --> 00:57:12,021
It is one thing with the syntax uprising and such because then you see that it is conscious

919
00:57:12,021 --> 00:57:14,021
or someone who writes

920
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:16,354
novels without using the letter e or such things,

921
00:57:16,354 --> 00:57:19,019
Then you see that it is a conscious point with it so you can say

922
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,519
"Well okay, art points Yey".

923
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:24,479
But if one sees someone who breaks against

924
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:27,807
the default writing language not to make a point without

925
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,017
because they, he, she does not master elements in the standard writing language

926
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:35,743
Then it looks like ...

927
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,047
You know people who can

928
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:43,679
a thousand figures on Pi and so they hear Pi listed with a number is wrong in place

929
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,239
872, it's like it hurts,

930
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:51,646
Because the artwork is broken apart, subjectively.

931
00:57:51,646 --> 00:57:54,679
What we have done here this hour is that we have established that the language is important of

932
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:59,678
political reasons, cultural reasons, aesthetic reasons, emotional reasons and identity reasons.

933
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,844
Case Closed as you say in pure Swedish.

934
00:58:03,844 --> 00:58:07,910
Because we have two minutes on before we have to close for the day, a quick

935
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:11,809
Language Council to Lund University's students,

936
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:15,508
How do you take on the language?
 What to think about?
 What is an attitude for life?

937
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:21,474
The one you, it's not an easy -to -digest thing to stop, do you have something?

938
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,847
Yes.

939
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,407
Be interested.

940
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,759
That's my advice, so care.

941
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,063
If you notice that you can't a word,

942
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,519
find out.

943
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,415
Now there are even apps, you can have it on the phone.

944
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,670
If you don't get on a word

945
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,047
In Swedish and only comes on it in English,

946
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,839
Yes but take it another lap.

947
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,602
I do, it goes well.

948
00:58:46,602 --> 00:58:50,635
Be a bit active with your vocabulary

949
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,591
And find out, if you find out once, you have it later.

950
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,633
Anyone else who wants to throw away with something?

951
00:58:57,633 --> 00:59:00,033
I can link, I think exactly the same.

952
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:06,031
If you buy the idea that it is better to know two words than one word,

953
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,131
That it makes one a better communicator, so three words must be better than two.

954
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:11,131
It almost becomes a ...

955
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,535
It means that 10,000 words

956
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:17,529
is better than 5 and 40 better than and so on.

957
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:21,215
If you buy it then it must mean

958
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,728
That you have to do just that, gather words.

959
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
The more words

960
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,895
you can and master, can use

961
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:32,991
In your way of thinking, in your way of communicating must, with reasonableness

962
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,825
make you think a little better,

963
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,891
Communicates a little better.

964
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
It usually usually

965
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:50,989
Students have a hard time arguing against because they understand that here is something in it

966
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:55,988
And then you can also say that you will get better results on the college exam,

967
00:59:55,988 --> 00:59:57,988
But that's another thing.

968
00:59:57,988 --> 00:59:59,825
But do you have a better language you think better,

969
00:59:59,825 --> 01:00:02,520
Surely no stronger arguments may be needed yet.

970
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,719
My friends, the clock approach the whole hour,

971
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:13,718
Had you who follow us in television had the wisdom to come here for debate in Lund

972
01:00:13,718 --> 01:00:15,797
Then you would have been involved in a fantastic question time

973
01:00:15,797 --> 01:00:17,717
Which will start when we have turned off the cameras.

974
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:22,783
So it can go, learn to next time and take you here, you are so welcome!

975
01:00:22,783 --> 01:00:25,816
It will be something else then but just as exciting then.

976
01:00:25,816 --> 01:00:30,815
You got to meet Anna Gustafsson, Ola Wikander, Sara Lövestam and Daniel Sandin.

977
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:35,455
Thank you so much for coming here!
