1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
- It's fun because you get to plug with your friends. - Exactly!

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07.960
- You hang out all day. That's wonderful! - Yes, amazing!

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,280
- For me it was very good when I started plugging.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,560
I was not thrown into any stress, but it was a very nice start.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,760
Got to do group work in the beginning so you got to know each other and help,

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,000
to get started with the plug. So it was very nice.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
- I hadn't plugged in for a while when I was going to start,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So I was a little happy about what it would be like.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,960
But it is in a completely different way at the university than high school I think.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,200
You plug much more together, hang out all day on campus.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45.560
Fuck together. It will be an everyday life in a different way.

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,240
I think it was beyond expectation. Fun to plug as well.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,200
- I was also scared when I had just started university.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,480
I also felt that in high school you got help from the teacher.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01.880
The teacher knew who all the students were.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08.560
You had been told that at the university, the teachers have so many that you are as a figure for them.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,880
I was really scared and thought how should I get my help.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,240
But it is not at all! Really not at all.

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,960
Here you get help from friends, people in your class because everyone plugs the same thing.

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,080
The teacher. Just send out an email and you will receive an answer.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,400
- Once the teacher asked if I had read the course literature.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,080
And I had not bought the book. Then I had to borrow her course literature book.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,080
To have. Then I returned it after the exam.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,680
Then I felt that these teachers really care about us.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,480
- We have the opportunity to choose a semester to plug abroad.

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51.560
It's so fun that you can get that chance!

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,080
To actually get to study and be in another country and see what it is.

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,520
- For example, I would like to plug in the US and that's how the plan looks right now.

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06.840
You can also plug in Europe so I have also been thinking about Marseille.

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,800
- I am studying for the medical program and unlike many other education in Sweden,

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,720
So we are a pretty small class.

32
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,000
I think that has really been great.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,120
It is very good cohesion between the classes, but also for other classes.

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,720
We also have our own campus, which is Supernice because you meet your friends every day.

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,840
It is also close to the teachers and tiles so you can easily go and knock on the door,

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,880
and ask about something.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,720
- I really would have gone to Vietnam now, but because of the pandemic it was not so.

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
But then our program has possible to adjust when you can go abroad.

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,240
Then I have only postponed that semester so I will be able to go abroad later.

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,440
So I didn't miss my chance to go abroad.

41
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,400
- What good to do so! - Great!

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59.560
- Education General should not be that you come and this is the knowledge, receive the knowledge.

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:07.400
Without it, it should be that the lecturer tells stories and that they themselves have experience,

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,040
And inspires one so that you come home and want to open the course books.

45
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,880
You long to learn more and think "what cool" this topic is.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,680
You don't get it out of everything. Of course, there are boring courses.

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,520
Feels like there is a lot of things like that, that the teachers are really passionate about what they do.

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,840
- Do you only meet people who read to a lawyer?

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,920
- No, we get to meet criminologists, forensic and socio -economists.

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
I think that's fucking fun!

51
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:47,880
As a lawyer, you are often part of a larger network, whether it is at a company or within the state.

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,080
So then it is good to understand how you work in this chain.

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,760
- We have it included in the studies as well, this particular proximity to real life.

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04.920
With companies that come and present, you get the opportunity to ask questions,

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07.920
And talk to people from working life.

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,920
- Yes, it is often that companies come and give in lectures and tell us what it is like.

57
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,280
Maybe sometimes they are looking for, so you can search for something alongside the school.

58
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,200
- That's perfect!

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,920
Being done here and having a job, I really think you will have.
