1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02.880
Great to have a lot of money, right?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07.600
Tog to be able to feel safe and free. I have no control.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,720
How good do you have money and finances? Between one and ten.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Ten.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,600
I have to keep track of my finances now.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,960
Mia IngelstrÃ¶m is not only an economist, she is also a personal trainer in economics.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,040
Yes, you hear. Should we start this?

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,600
Hi, my name is Jonas. Time for passport two in our Economic School.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,880
I'm a little split for money.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44.840
Great to have a lot of money, right?

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,000
Tog to be able to feel safe and free.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52.960
But I'm still uninterested. I think it's complicated.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,880
I have no control. How good are you, Mia?

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,120
-Between one and ten. On money and finances. -Time on the scale.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,160
-You know what? -It's max. Only Ingves has it.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,520
I don't know everything, but have control over what I need to be able to.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,440
-Eight. -There I have ten on the scale.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,000
Eight, what fun. I have zero.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,720
-What should we learn today? -The most important.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:31,640
To dream. Where do I want to come? What do I want to reach?

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,920
We're running. I'm not completely uninterested in money ...

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,960
... but I don't have to care that much, because it works out.

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
And it has, actually. It always does.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,080
-In some way, it works out. -Yes, usually it works out.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,640
But we tend to forget what has been difficult.

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,920
When you were young and didn't know where to live ...

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,080
When you didn't have money to pay the bills ...

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,160
Those who are going to retire often feel stress and anxiety:

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,120
-"Will it even work?" -You have suppressed the boring.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,320
Unfortunately, many feel anxiety, stress and anxiety ... Sometimes it is unnecessary.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,080
-An can not be millionaires? -It's not about it.

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,280
Money can simplify, but they do not create happiness.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,480
Happiness comes when you use the money-

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,400
-and can live your life as you want it.

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,640
That you have the opportunity. And for that, money plays a pretty big role.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,000
Not how much you earn ...

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,440
No matter how much or little you earn, you can be happy.

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,320
That the money helps you do what you want in life.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,000
-How do you know, then? -You have to set aside time ...

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59.560
... to find out. As for everything else, you have to focus and think.

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02.840
-A dream exercise. -Just.

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09.080
Okay, now let's see ... a dream exercise, see now ...

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,080
I want a sailboat, I've always dreamed of that.

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,200
And I want to travel more. I want to go to Capri, Japan, Finland ...

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,000
No, Capri. And I want a bigger apartment.

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,520
I'm so tired of working from home. A new apartment. Yuk...

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,120
I want to divorce too, it feels like. I'm so tired of Micke. A new man. Yes.

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,880
Will you sometime? What are you doing?

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,080
Nothing, honey.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,360
-Yeah, it got a little drastic. -Absolutely.

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,240
-Is it good, do you think? -Yes, great.

52
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,360
To take the time to think through what you want in life.

53
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00.880
Getting from one situation to another is a little difficult.

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,680
You have to break down the dream and see what it takes to reach the different goals.

55
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,080
Small steps. The same thing if you are going to leave a relationship ...

56
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,000
Nor is anything done like this ...

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,440
But you take yourself seriously and investigate if it is possible.

58
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,640
-If you are completely satisfied, then? -Fantastic. Congratulations.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,600
My dreams are met.

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,680
If your feelings and your life in sync, it is fantastic.

61
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,960
-Well then. -You don't have to look for problems.

62
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,480
-And also see this program series. -But then you can show others.

63
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,480
-How did you do so you would get it like that? -Lecture?

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,200
Sure, why not? So you can spread the knowledge or feeling to other generations.

65
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,440
Quite a few are not happy with their lives, unfortunately.

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57.560
A viewer question.

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,000
"I work at an insurance company, but want to become a gardener."

68
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07.680
How nice. You understand that.

69
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,960
"But we can't afford that." Or how can you get there?

70
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,880
Oh ... This person must not write off his dream right away.

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,360
You have to break down the bigger dream into smaller parts.

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25.560
What is needed for me to become a gardener? Do I have to school about me?

73
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,200
How long will it take? What salary do I get in the new job?

74
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,760
You divide the dream into smaller parts. First you look at costs today.

75
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,880
Can I lower my living expenses? Maybe i have to opt out of something i have-

76
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49.440
-To be able to choose for the dream instead. Usually it goes if you turn on all stones.

77
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,160
But I also think this person should test.

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,320
Maybe she doesn't want to work as a gardener. You can do internships.

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02.960
What have we learned today? Tell me if I say wrong.

80
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,520
Do the dream exercise. Take time to it.

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,680
And when you do it, don't be afraid to dream big.

82
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,560
-"Take yourself seriously," you said. -Giant weighing.

83
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,840
And no matter what you earn, you can ...

84
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,240
You can become a gardener or whatever you want to be ...

85
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,040
-Formula 1 driver. Right? -Absolutely.

86
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,280
Just take some time and break it down ... - Thanks for today. Have a good time.

87
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,400
-Mia. What did you dream about? -I dreamed of becoming a tour guide.

88
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,360
-Not me. -But do you know? I have tried.
