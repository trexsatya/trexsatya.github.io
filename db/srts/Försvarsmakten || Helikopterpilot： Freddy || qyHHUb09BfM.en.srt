1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,160
I had not intended to be military at all

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,240
Had not intended to become an officer, had not intended to be a pilot.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,080
Now I'm all three.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,040
There is a picture that pilots are some kind of über people.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,440
We are not.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,760
It's about being specific more than special.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,120
One cliché that people say is "One day is not the same."

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,120
Here, weekdays are incredibly similar.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,760
We follow the same routine.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,520
It is weather brief, air traffic conductor review

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43.560
Air pass and debrief.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,760
What is good is the great contrasts between the weeks.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,760
One week we do.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,800
Then maybe we have a week of survival

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00.360
Where you find yourself in a raft in the archipelago.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,000
It's actually pretty wonderful.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,280
We are a defense force resource.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,680
We can lift things

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,240
From one place to another, optional.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
Then it's just the question who wants that resource.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,280
We fly a technically complicated machine

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,080
that is important to be able to

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,680
So there is a lot to read too.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,680
The flight itself is quite unpublished

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00.840
But we have to keep a good shape.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04.600
So training is a big part too.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,040
Late obviously a sense of freedom

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,440
to get to rush forward

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
between cobbles and cuts

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
The sun sparkles and

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22.560
You see the waves go a bit.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,240
It is also wonderful of course.

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,120
My name is Freddy and I am a helicopter pilot.
