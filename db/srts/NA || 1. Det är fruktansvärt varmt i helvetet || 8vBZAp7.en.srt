1
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.360
<b> <c.Cyan> All this starts with Jonnah. </b>

2
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.720
<b> <c.Cyan> She is 22 years old.
 In a few months </b> <b> <c.Cyan> she takes her nursing degree. </b>

3
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.520
<b> <c.Cyan> But then her parents will not. </b>

4
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.640
<b> <c.Cyan> It's been three years since she </b> <b> <c.Cyan> was excluded from their congregation. </b>

5
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.040
<b> <c.Cyan> It's three years ago </b> <b> <c.Cyan> She was dismissed by her family - </b>

6
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.080
<b> <c.Cyan> –Efters as she had sinned against God. </b>

7
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.600
What does it mean to be excluded?

8
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.960
That you must not have any contact with your relatives -

9
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.360
- Or they must not have any contact with me.

10
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.920
My parents are very strict.

11
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.920
And it's tough.
 It's terribly hard.

12
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.160
Can you describe your feelings before the exclusion, when you understood that ...

13
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.680
- Do you want to pause?
 - No, it's going well.

14
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240
- What is you thinking now?
 -Dad...

15
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.440
-Dad?
 -Yes.

16
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.360
He was my best, best, best friend.
 Really.

17
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.680
It's tough.
 It's probably the worst.

18
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.360
I had my best friends and my whole family that I loved.

19
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.080
But...

20
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.520
... Dad was everything.

21
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.240
Yes.

22
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.200
<b> <c.Cyan> This story begins with </b> <b> <c.Cyan> jonnah, but does not end with her. </b>

23
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.600
<b> <c.Cyan> This is the story </b> <b> <c.Cyan> about all the children who have been injured - </b>

24
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.840
<b> <c.Cyan> –A of the religion </b> <b> <c.Cyan> their parents chose for them. </b>

25
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.960
<b> <c.Cyan> and those children are everywhere. </b>

26
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.920
<b> <c.Cyan> They are raised in various religious </b> <b> <c.Cyan> context, and they are many. </b>

27
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.840
<b> <c.Cyan> All children who grow up </b> <b> <c.Cyan> In Religious Home not bad - </b>

28
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.560
<b> <c.Cyan> - But now it is about those who have done </b> <b> <c.Cyan> it.
 Now we're going to listen to them. </b>

29
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.120
What scared me as a child was the fear of hell -

30
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.400
- Not being able to spend the rest of eternity with my family.

31
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.160
There were so many ways in Islam to end up in hell.

32
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.240
The devil who whips one, and you have to drink blood.

33
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.680
The demons and evil made me very scared and insecure as a child.

34
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.120
In the children's books there were illustrations of harmedon -

35
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.600
-How people are pulled down into fire gap, globe bombing the earth -

36
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.800
-And all non-witnesses die.

37
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.360
In our teens, we were encouraged to start speaking in tongues.

38
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.000
Then someone could suddenly stand up and scream:

39
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.720
"The end is close! Jesus is coming soon! We must prepare for the battle!"

40
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.640
On one occasion, when mom fell under prayer-

41
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.720
- I went ahead to check if it was okay.
 But then I was reversed.

42
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.440
She would have her time with the Holy Spirit or Jesus and be healed.

43
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.920
When I was a child I asked for God to remove me -

44
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.080
- Because I understood that what I was caused to others.

45
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.880
God who has the children in love, please, remove me.

46
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.880
<b> <c.Cyan> on January 1, 2020 </b> <b> <c.Cyan> became the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Sweden. </b>

47
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.960
<b> <c.Cyan> It says that every child </b> <b> <c.Cyan> is entitled to freedom of opinion - </b>

48
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.240
<b> <c.Cyan> —The Freedom, </b> <b> <c.Cyan> Freedom of thought and freedom of religion. </b>

49
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.400
<b> <c.Cyan> Children in Sweden are right </b> <b> <c.Cyan> to choose their own religion. </b>

50
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.440
<b> <c.Cyan> But they also have the right </b> <b> <c.Cyan> to freedom from religion. </b>

51
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.360
It is about the child's right to choose his religion-

52
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.600
- To exercise or not to practice religion, to believe or not believe.

53
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.800
You don't have to tell you if you believe in anything.
 One has the right to exercise it-

54
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.120
- But you can also have a religion without telling it to anyone.

55
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.120
Why does this say in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, you think?

56
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.920
After all, the Convention on the Rights of the Child contains all human rights for children.

57
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.000
The general human rights also apply to children -

58
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.160
–But you have made a special Convention on the Rights -

59
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.640
- Because it is not obvious that children and adults have the same rights.

60
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.560
Then all basic human rights have been raised.

61
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.720
In this case, you want to mark -

62
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.040
- That children have their own religious freedom.

63
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.680
The parents do not have the right to give the children a religion-

64
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.400
- It has the right to choose the children themselves.

65
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.800
<b> <c.Cyan> The ones I have met in this series </b> <b> <c.Cyan> have never had the right as a child. </b>

66
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.240
<b> <c.Cyan> They have grown up with a religion </b> <b> <c.Cyan> they themselves have not chosen. </b>

67
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.920
<b> <c.Cyan> Now they come forward, and they </b> <b> <c.Cyan> want to tell them how it affected them. </b>

68
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.800
What is the freedom if you only have one choice?

69
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.800
You are busy that it is fantastic all the time.

70
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.520
One must never process that the back side is that if you do something wrong -

71
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.760
- So it becomes the opposite, in theology.
 Then you go to ...

72
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.600
The Mormons do not have hell, but the extreme darkness.

73
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.040
So it was an imminent threat all the time.

74
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.280
If you do not fit in, you will go out.
 If you are wrong, you go there.

75
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.640
What did you ask for before you would fall asleep as a child?

76
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.440
Oh, help ... I'm almost moved when I think about it.

77
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.440
I asked for ... "sorry if I have committed some sins today."

78
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.920
"Thanks for everything."
 Thanks for that and that, everything you were grateful for.

79
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.600
I often had it: "Help me to be the best I can be."

80
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.680
"Help me to become everything you want me to be."

81
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:59.200
I was so pious and sacred.
 I wanted to be so good.

82
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.080
Here I am dressed up for the Kingdom Hall.
 Then we will be at a meeting.
 And even there.

83
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.520
Here we are at a great gathering where many congregations are seen.

84
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.880
Do you remember waiting for Harmagedon to come?

85
00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.040
Yes.
 Obviously you went ... There was a lot of talk about Harmagedon.

86
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.920
Everyone was waiting for paradise, and also then Harmagedon.

87
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.360
They said, "Soon it will."

88
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.760
You didn't know what it would look like -

89
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.600
- Or during how long it would be.

90
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.840
Or if you were to come to paradise or die in Armagedon.

91
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.880
It was ... many thoughts.

92
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.160
Sometimes almost so much that you prefer not to think about it at all.

93
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.320
And that's Dad.

94
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:22.200
There was a gathering, when many different congregations were met.

95
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.920
- Here is a gift day.
 - You don't celebrate a birthday.

96
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.560
No, no birthday or Christmas.
 You have a gift day instead.

97
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.640
How was it in school when celebrating birthdays?

98
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.560
It was pretty hard.

99
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.040
Everyone stands up and sings, but I couldn't sing.

100
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.120
So I had to sit down at the same time as the one who turned years sat down.

101
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.680
Sometimes I got up and sang anyway, and had a bad conscience for it.

102
00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.920
It was very difficult often with all the holidays.
 You became very ...

103
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.800
... designated.

104
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.920
Who is this girl?

105
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.480
Yes...

106
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.920
Frankly a girl who didn't feel so good.

107
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.240
I have tried to identify why I was not feeling well.

108
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:33.120
I didn't have that many friends.
 I didn't get to meet friends so much.

109
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.480
You were not allowed to play with children who were not witnesses?

110
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:43.080
No.
 Many classmates became good friends on birthday parties -

111
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.720
- As I was not allowed to participate.
 They had girl evenings and "sleepovers".

112
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.200
It was not appreciated that I slept over with someone who was not a witness.

113
00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.640
<b> <c.Cyan> On the net it has become everything </b> <b> <c.Cyan> more common with forums and chat threads - </b>

114
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.880

119

122
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.840
<b> <c.Cyan> —To the last time. </b>

123
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.280
I was very scared.

124
00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:00.320
"What if I don't really believe in. Will I come to heaven?"

125
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.480
"How can I know that Jesus really lives in me?"

126
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.440
I had to give my life to Jesus a lot of times to be safe.

127
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.120
And so there was a lot with demons.

128
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.800
I was told to ask Jesus to drive away the evil spirits -

129
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.360
- For then I was protected by God's power.

130
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:30.920
So I lay in the evenings and prayed to Jesus that he would protect me -

131
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.800
- And couldn't sleep.

132
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:41.200
I was lying down like a little ball in the middle of the bed and shook.

133
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.920
I didn't dare extinguish.
 I didn't know who to turn to.

134
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.840
I think my fear was very much reflected in those dreams -

135
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.880
- As returned night after night.

136
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.920
The demons told me:

137
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.760
"You think you can hide from us, but we know you don't believe."

138
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.840
"We can get into you."

139
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.240
It was ... it was very nasty.

140
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.880
As a child, I learned that we live in the last few days.

141
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.880
One would spend all one's life serving the god Jehovah -

142
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:39.720
- And override all their own needs and dreams.

143
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.880
I was a very dreamy child, curious, creative and imaginative -

144
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.600
- And wanted to explore it.
 And there I felt very limited -

145
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:58.200
- As the individual's needs and development, no space was given.

146
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.560
It was considered selfish and worldly-

147
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:07.400
- And it was considered that devilish temptations entered your skull.

148
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:14.920
This in itself meant that they were characterized by shame and guilt over it.

149
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.720
To live as a Jehovah's witness at such an early age -

150
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.320
- Inventible to live in a chronic fear of death.

151
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:31.000
At any time, my life could be taken away from me, everything I loved.

152
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:38.720
My loved ones could die in Harmagedon, and I too -

153
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.120
- As I knew I was inside the wrong road.

154
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.080
Very many of those we interview have a hell of a horror -

155
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.360
- And a fear of demons.
 What about religions?

156
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.320
Why are they doing heaven and hell?

157
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.080
Because one of the function of religions is -

158
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.480
- To discipline people to obedience and keep a group together.

159
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.160
And then carrot and whip is a classic trick.

160
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.000
It is clear within Jehovah's Witnesses.
 This is information material -

161
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.560
- To the members.
 Here is Harmagedon.

162
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:36.320
Their Bible interpretation differs from the main sheep of Christian orientations.

163
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.360
Jehovah's Witnesses think that there is no immortal soul.

164
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.200
Instead, it is the consuming fire that burns people up.

165
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.600
Some belong to the crowds of the selected, but the others will be annihilated.

166
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.920
And Harmageddon is that day.

167
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.240
It is interesting to see who the people are.

168
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.440
This is some kind of hard rocker with skull.

169
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.600
–And Linne.
 He has some clothes.
 - Yes, he's a rocker.

170
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:18.680
She has a short skirt, does not seem so moral and has a tattoo.

171
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.360
Then it's a bar here, some kind of drinkable.

172
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.280
A cinema, maybe a little porn cinema, with these "xxx".

173
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.880
But the chosen ports here?

174
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.480
Yes.
 It is a selected crowd of perfect people -

175
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.480
- which is allowed to live with God forever.

176
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.400
This is how you think it will be.

177
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:50.000
This is extremely physical and concrete, and all animals are the same.

178
00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.560
People from different parts of the world, tree house ...

179
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.160
It's a bit like in the Phantom, someone like that island ...

180
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.800
Is it a good way for a faith community -

181
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.040
- Keeping up their group and getting new members?

182
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.320
Jehovah is one of the fastest growing religious movements.

183
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.760
Surely this is a traditional Christian image?

184
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.800
Yes, it is a depiction of the doomsday from the 15th century.

185
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.600
Here are the good ones to come to heaven -

186
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.240
- And here are the evil who come to hell?

187
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.760
Demons many people talk about that it was scary.
 What is a demon?

188
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:44.280
Religious history is a demon a pre -Christian God.

189
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:50.520
It is demons who can occupy people in the New Testament -

190
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:57.760
- And like Jesus and the Holy Spirit can drive out.
 It is evil spirit being.

191
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:07.240
When I was a little older, 14 years maybe -

192
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.120
- started my youth leaders talking about demons-

193
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.600
- Demons are there.
 There may be demonic forces -

194
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:24.240
- If you listen to non -Christian music or watch movies that are not Christians.

195
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.040
There may be demons if some teacher in the school says -

196
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:37.240
- It is good with feminism or individualism.
 It's demonic.

197
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.840
And they talked about strategies, how to stay ...

198
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.480
... keep up against demons, for a fourteen -year -old!

199
00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.160
"If you think too much about demons" -

200
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.560
- "How to become susceptible to them."

201
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.560
"So you must not think about them."

202
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.720
"And you should not be afraid of them, because then they get hold of you."

203
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:14.720
I had such an incredibly hard time sleeping, for every night I thought:

204
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.960
"Don't think of demons. God, please, protect me."

205
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.800
"I must not think about demons."
 It was real to me.

206
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.880
This is f.d.
 Södermalm Church.
 Now they are called We Are One Church.

207
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.600
- "Jesus is coming."
 -Yes.
 This has been waiting for a long time.

208
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.800
- You've been waiting for Jesus for a while?
 - When is Jesus coming back?
 No.

209
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:54.160
You laugh now.
 But it was a big part of your upbringing.

210
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.680
Yes.
 I knew Jesus would come back.

211
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:05.480
I was hoping to get up to Jesus.
 I didn't want to stay.

212
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.640
So we got to see demon expulsion from an early age.

213
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.080
And adults who collapsed and lay and shook.

214
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:26.240
You screamed a lot in the mood, lifted your hands and shouted.

215
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.600
The demon expulsion and talk of hell affected me so-

216
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.360
- I was afraid of demons.
 It was so terribly real.

217
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.440
"They can take me in possession. If I make the slightest mistake, they will come into me."

218
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.200
And I was afraid to end up in hell.

219
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.800
I believed hard that demons were everywhere.

220
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:05.240
For every day I eg
 Do not take on the veil, the sins are built on.

221
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.920
And as a child, I was told what it means to be in hell -

222
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.440
- Where the fire is so strong that one's brain boils -

223
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.800
- And one's leather melts, but grows out and over again.

224
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.080
God never lets you get used to it-

225
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.240
- It feels like the first time every time.

226
00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.960
What sins could you mean that you ended up there?

227
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.440
Actually very many moral issues -

228
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:47.520
- For example, stealing and lying, but also religious sins.

229
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.200
Not to be a Muslim, not to obey the parents' order.

230
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:59.840
Being too invested in enjoying this life can also mean -

231
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.880
- That you end up in hell because you forget to worship God.

232
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.920
When I have interviewed young Muslims about what they have learned as a child -

233
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:20.120
- If it surprised me how incredibly strong the pictures are of the fire.

234
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:27.800
Here Islam has the same variety of understanding as Christianity -

235
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.520
–Alt a larger part of the contemporary Islamic interpretations -

236
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.760
- Has a more concrete understanding of hell.

237
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:44.520
That it is a place that you come to, where you have to suffer forever.

238
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.080
Some Islamic orientations -

239
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:54.040
—The emphasizes God's mercy and forgiving -

240
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.240
- While others are more in the scare line.

241
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.440
It is part of Islamic piety to discipline themselves in this life -

242
00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.800
- So you get to the right place after life.

243
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.000
Many things scared me during my upbringing.

244
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.240
I went in a religious free school-

245
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.800
-And there we learned very detailed about the purgatory -

246
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.040
- And everything that happens if you end up in hell.

247
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.200
The warm, warm fire -

248
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.760
- The devil who whips one and being forced to drink blood.

249
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.680
It was so easy to be punished.

250
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.480
As a child I used to ... I made many mistakes as a child.

251
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.760
I lied well and maybe twisted my friend's eraser.

252
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:58.640
When I realized that it would be punished with the fire, I started training.

253
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.960
I washed my hands in giant hot water to exercise for hell.

254
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.480
I didn't dare tell any -

255
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.640
- That I would end up in hell, so I trained on my own.

256
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.800
<c.YELLOW> Anna: How old were you then?

257
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:23.000
Maybe five, six, seven.

258
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:34.600
<b> <c.Cyan> Although all religions </b> <b> <c.Cyan> have a doctrine about heaven and hell ... </b>

259
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.400
<b> <c.Cyan> What happens when sinning </b> <b> <c.Cyan> I have rarely thought of - </b>

260
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.000
<b> <c.Cyan> —Hur It can affect the children.

261
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.600

262
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.200
<b> <c.Cyan> what can it do with them? </b>

263
00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.800
Yes, then ...

264
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:10.160
This makes them scared and insecure.

265
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:16.600
Many people probably get compulsive problems, which we hear examples of here.

266
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:22.040
Large parts of childhood are probably spent in fear, coercion and anxiety.

267
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.080
From a psychological perspective is the problem of fundamentalism -

268
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:33.720
- That people literally believe in what are pictures in the religious scriptures.

269
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:39.360
It will be an unfortunate combination.
 Parents believe in it literally-

270
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.640
- And for the children, who think even more concrete, there will be seven trips worse.

271
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.040
What do these children need support, who have been involved in this?

272
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:56.480
I meet quite a few with this type of background when they are adults.

273
00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.640
I believe that the opportunity they need -

274
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.160
-Is to survive to adulthood -

275
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:11.360
–And stake out a track for themselves, where they can process their experiences -

276
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:17.800
–The action with a psychologist or a soulmate.
 The race is not run -

277
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.880
- But they need to work on these issues, preferably as the elderly -

278
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.600
- As the problems have not been noticed when they are small.

279
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:35.360
<b> <c.Cyan> All children who grow up with this </b> <b> <c.Cyan> type of teachings do not suffer from it. </b>

280
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:43.280
<b> <c.Cyan> But the ones we met here have, regardless of </b> <b> <c.Cyan> community, experienced the same horror. </b>

281
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.600
<b> <c.Cyan> Horror for God to hear </b> <b> <c.Cyan> all sinful thoughts - </b>

282

<b> <c.Cyan> –and for the punishment that may then come. </b>

283
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:58.360
<b> <c.Cyan> The greatest sin seems to all </b> <b> <c.Cyan> children we are talking about about sex. </b>

284
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.720
I am raised in an innocence and purity culture.

285
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.680
There were lessons with ... a bowl of dumle that you sent around.

286
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:16.240
A leader stopped a dumb school in his mouth, put back it-

287
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.040
-And sent around the bowl: "Who wants the dumbs I had in my mouth?"

288
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.920
"It's the same with your body."

289
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.680
I took care of what they said, and thought:

290
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.600
"What I feel is sick, disgusting and wrong."

291
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.600
It was a huge shame.

292
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.120
Man condemned my love.
 If I didn't repent -

293
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.000
- So I would never feel love again.
 What does it do with a child?

294
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.240
