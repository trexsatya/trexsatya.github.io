1
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:33,500
"OVERTIME WAR"

2
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,755
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! No! Ow, ow, ow!

3
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:21,486
It's five o'clock, it's five o'clock!

4
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:25,256
Ah man, and I just got off my shift.

5
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:27,258
Ow, my intestines!

6
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:32,113
Oh no, I've got coffee-stains on my uniform,

7
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:34,833
you've got to be kidding me.

8
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,325
I can't get them out!

9
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:43,565
OK... A positive attitude strengthens the team spirit.
A positive..

10
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:49,891
Well at least we get our over-time compensation!

11
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,673
A little bit of extra money...

12
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:52,305
What?

13
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:55,684
Yeah, when you're at war after five o'clock
you get a bonus for your over-time.

14
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:57,454
We don't get a bonus...

15
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:00,469
Really, you don't?

16
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:01,556
No.

17
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:07,381
What? You guys should really bring that to your union's attention.

18
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,627
What's you hourly wage?

19
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:13,681
Six...

20
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:15,875
Six bucks?

21
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:20,921
You do know that minimum wage is nine, right? 

22
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:25,013
We're having a strategy-day on Sunday,
planning the attack on you guys and what-not,

23
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:26,489
we aren't getting paid for that either.

24
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,609
They can't just exploit you guys like that.

25
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,186
You need to get your days off, there are laws on that, you know.

26
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,650
Man, you guys seem to have a sweet deal over here.

27
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,040
Yeah, it's pretty nice actually.

28
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,334
Here, have a Danish.

29
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:50,910
Well hey, you guys are winning at least.

30
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:58,315
It looked terrific when you came running in here before.
You seem great at this.

31
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,862
What the hell... You guys have toilets in your trenches ?

32
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:10,742
Yeah, we used to only have urinals,
but someone complained about it being discriminating.

33
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:12,878
Not everybody has a penis.

34
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:23,026
Great! Hey you! We're in a bit of a jam...

35
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,833
Blastâ€“Bengt has transfered to the Suicide Brigade
so I need you for the night shift.

36
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,591
Oh, okay...

37
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:32,485
I'm actually starting to feel a little sick,
I'd really like to go home.

38
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:34,362
And you have a medical certificate for that?

39
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:38,863
No, I don't have one...

40
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:46,006
Well, for a leave of absence with full compensation
to be justified you need a medical certificate.

41
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,257
I really need to fill this schedule.

42
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,983
I understand, it's just that...

43
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:54,329
I could probably take the shift.

44
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:58,202
But you're German...

45
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:08,100
Well great! So then you'll take the shift.
And remember our motto

46
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:14,710
"A positive attitude strengthens the gut feeling."
I meant team spirit...

47
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:23,963
Oh, yeah! Would you be a sweet-heart and clean up
the toilet before you go on your next shift?

48
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:27,589
It's such a sorry sight,
especially now that we have the coffee table here and everything.

49
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,628
Absolutely.. I'll take care of it.

50
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,003
Employee of the month!

51
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:36,645
Oh wow, thank you! How nice.

52
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,001
God damn it...
