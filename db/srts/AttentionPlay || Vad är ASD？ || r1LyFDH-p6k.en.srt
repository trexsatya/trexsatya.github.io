1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
What is autism spectrum disorder?

2
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:08.137
Previously used, among other things, to use the diagnoses

3
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:13.547
Asperger's syndrome, atypical autism, autistic syndrome.

4
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:18,445
The research found that these diagnoses

5
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,805
Actually has more similarities than differences.

6
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:23,105
Although one may have different needs for support

7
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:25,195
Or have other diagnoses too.

8
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:27,415
Therefore, you have chosen to merge all the diagnoses

9
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:29,715
to the collection diagnosis ASD.

10
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:32,638
But it is not wrong or strange to still say

11
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:34.668
For example, Asperger's syndrome.

12
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,931
What is the Asd on?

13
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:40,697
Today you do not know exactly what ASD is due to.

14
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:42.547
But you know that it is something you are born with,

15
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:45.307
or is something that occurs during pregnancy

16
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:48.047
or childbirth, which affects the development of brain.

17
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:51,587
Common misunderstanding about ASD.

18
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:54,317
Is ASD a disease?

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,870
No, ASD is no disease,

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,670
It is a disability.

21
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00.345
Having ASD only means having

22
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:03.435
A different way of thinking, feeling, thinking and being.

23
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:07.351
Society is adapted to how most others work.

24
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09.931
It makes it harder for people with ASD

25
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,551
to work in everyday life.

26
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:15,872
Are everyone with Asd Superner and HUGE INTERMATE?

27
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:20,017
No, to have merely the diagnosis of ASD does not mean

28
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:22,787
That you are more or less smart than others.

29
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:25,177
But some people with ASD have one or more

30
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:28,147
Special interests in which they are very well read.

31
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,698
Is it just guys who have ASD?

32
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:34,859
No, it is both girls and guys who are diagnosed.

33
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,290
What does ASD mean?

34
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:40,558
People with ASD are at least as different

35
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,528
each other as people are at large.

36
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,053
However, there are some areas where people

37
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:47,273
With ASD can have a reduced ability.

38
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:49,095
Which areas this is

39
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:50,765
and how large the reductions will be

40
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:52,725
varies from person to person.

41
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:57.003
Now we'll meet Charlie, Alice, Malte and Ayla

42
00:01:57,003 --> 00:02:00,213
To hear what things they experience as extra difficult.

43
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06.059
I think it is most difficult to be with friends.

44
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,979
It takes a lot of energy from me.

45
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:10.022
I like to make a lot of effort

46
00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:11,832
To be able to be social.

47
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,882
It doesn't come naturally to me.

48
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:16,822
Things that are hard for me can be

49
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,498
to listen to when someone tells about such

50
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:21,798
Which I don't think is interesting.

51
00:02:21,798 --> 00:02:23,398
It can also be difficult to know how to

52
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:25,988
Take me into a discussion without interrupting.

53
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:30,085
To know how long I will keep eye contact.

54
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:32.515
Ideally, I would avoid it completely.

55
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:35,185
Sometimes I hear that people think I'm staring.

56
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:37,953
That I interpret things literally

57
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:39,723
So that there is a misunderstanding.

58
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:41,543
When friends tell me "we hear",

59
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:42,953
So can I go around for a long time and ponder

60
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:44,443
On what it really means.

61
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:47.721
Should I call, should he call?

62
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:49.921
Or does he just mean that we should be seen in school?

63
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:53,722
To read people's facial expressions and body language.

64
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:55,182
It takes a lot of energy from me

65
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:57,132
And sometimes it gets completely wrong.

66
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,521
That I most preferably spend time with a friend

67
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:02,121
At a time and do not like to spend time in groups.

68
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07.261
- I seem to experience the world at a

69
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:09,201
completely different way than others.

70
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:11,103
I have very sensitive hearing and can

71
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,813
Pay attention to sounds that maybe no one else hears.

72
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:16,316
I tried to go on green grove this summer

73
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,956
But it didn't work at all.

74
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:19,926
I had to go home.

75
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,933
The metal sparkle from mountains and the roller coaster

76
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,193
Made me completely exhausted.

77
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,193
When I'm out and about I see everything.

78
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,243
And then I really mean everything.

79
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:30,743
It's like I have no filter.

80
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,263
And everything I see goes straight into me.

81
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:36,298
I can walk on the town in type 30 minutes

82
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,648
Then I'm completely done.

83
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:40,078
It's also like my skin

84
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:42,218
is completely hypersensitive to touch.

85
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:44,190
Showering is the worst I know.

86
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:47.655
It's like a thousand needle sticks come out of the shower hose.

87
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:50,471
Clothes are also very busy.

88
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,971
When I was little, my mom sat

89
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:53.851
and softened all my socks

90
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55.421
before I could have them.

91
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57.241
Now that I am older I have learned

92
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59.331
Which clothes work.

93
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:01.761
Pants that sit at the waist for example,

94
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:03.601
is the widest thing there is.

95
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:06,284
I may also think it's hard when people

96
00:04:06,284 --> 00:04:08,484
Getting too close to me without me being prepared for it.

97
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,978
Once I happened to push to a friend,

98
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:13,608
Who just wanted to give me a spontaneous hug.

99
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,824
- Stress is my biggest enemy.

100
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,514
When the stress strikes it is like I

101
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:23,584
Gets completely blocked and freezes.

102
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,544
What stresses me most is rapid changes.

103
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,413
It happened to me last night at the Scouts.

104
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,875
On the schedule it was said that we would fire.

105
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,830
When I got there it was too few leaders

106
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,110
And we had to keep up with cipher instead.

107
00:04:40,444 --> 00:04:42,504
I just couldn't change.

108
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:45,084
And chose not to be at all.

109
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,150
How my day becomes also depends very much on

110
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,250
How stressed I am in the morning.

111
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:54,107
If all my morning routines float on

112
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:56,657
And I get to take things at my pace so it will be good.

113
00:04:57,745 --> 00:05:00.015
If my little sister locks in to the toilet,

114
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02.555
Or if Mom gaps that I have to hurry,

115
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:04.215
Then it gets bad.

116
00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:08.677
At school, the dining room usually stress me the most.

117
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:11,916
I have a definite place in the dining room

118
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,716
but sometimes it is taken and then it becomes completely

119
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:15,526
crazy in my head.

120
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:17,216
Where should I sit down then?

121
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,076
Last time it happened I just went out without eating.

122
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,876
I couldn't calm down and find a solution.

123
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,510
I will be calm with rules because then I know as well

124
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,600
What is expected of me.

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,480
If rules are in any way broken

126
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,960
or if one makes exceptions

127
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,930
So the stress strikes right away.

128
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:36,553
When I was younger sometimes thought my friends

129
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,793
That I was hard because I was a little class police.

130
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:43,704
- There are also good things.

131
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47.570
I think it's so hard to distinguish

132
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,470
What is me and what is my diagnosis.

133
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,300
That's like this I am.

134
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:55.019
I often think you talk about what is difficult.

135
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,579
But there are actually things that are good too.

136
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:59,329
My friend likes I'm honest.

137
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:01.509
And don't keep up with lots of white lies.

138
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,589
That I think differently is just good!

139
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08.169
Because I often think of things that others easily miss.

140
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,889
I can see details in the picture

141
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,389
that no one else sees.

142
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,644
I have very easy to learn those things

143
00:06:14,644 --> 00:06:16,434
Which I find interesting.

144
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:18,874
People look at me as a specialist.

145
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:22,314
Because I can have difficulty with the social codes

146
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:24,584
Am I not so judgmental against others

147
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,334
which is a little different.

148
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,124
I am thus less prejudiced

149
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,794
Against new people.

150
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,007
Because I try to avoid stress

151
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:34,547
So I always come on time.

152
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:36,899
Often long before agreed time.

153
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:41.865
Now have you heard different voices about how it

154
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,555
may be to have ASD.

155
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:44,925
It is important to remember that

156
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:46,205
it may differ very much

157
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,925
from person to person.

158
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:50,055
Depending on the surroundings and circumstances

159
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:52,485
the difficulties can be labeled more or less.

160
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:54,725
That which works with those you know well

161
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:56.015
may be difficult together with

162
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,325
new people or new environments.

163
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00.515
Those things one sees as challenges

164
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:02,395
can also vary over time.

165
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:04.733
One thing that was perhaps very difficult in early

166
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:07,153
School age can work without problems

167
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:09.493
in later age and vice versa.
