1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,640
Once you have broken a leg heals it-

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,040
-Do training you get muscles, if you cold form the antibody-

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,040
-And if the hairdresser cut an ugly hairstyle, you know that the hair is growing out again.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,880
You can thank protein synthesis for that.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,000
Our DNA is like a library-

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,320
-Or contains instructions on how the body should be built up and function.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,800
In order to build up the body, not only instructions are needed but building material-

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,080
-and someone who can do the work.
 It is the task of the proteins.

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,960
When protein is created, it is called protein synthesis.
 It happens in two steps:

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
Transcription and translation.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,480
Let's start with the transcription.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,160
My recipe book represents our DNA-

13
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,880
-Or available in the Cell Core, our library.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,600
The different pages of the book are our genes.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,480
The yellow pages represent genes that are active-

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,720
-Ach contains recipes for the protein to be created in different cells.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,040
In order to build the protein, the recipe must be out of the cell nucleus itself

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,240
-And the logical would be if the recipe was torn out.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,080
But this information must be preserved in your DNA, so it is not possible.

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,040
How do you solve this?
 Well, by copying the information.

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,120
This is the process we call transcription.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,840
The part of the DNA to be copied is divided into a single spiral.

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,320
This binds enzyme and helps to create a copy.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,880
The copy is called RNA instead of DNA.

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,240
It contains another type of sugar-

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,600
-And the nitrogen base Tymin is replaced with a nitrogen base called Uracil.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,160
If the DNA string consists of G, C, G, A, A-

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,560
-blir copy, RNA: t, C, G, C, U, U-

29
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,720
-The uracil replaces thymine.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,280
The type of RNA formed during the copy is called "Messenger RNA".

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,280
It is shortened the mrna.

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,680
It carries on a message-

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,840
-Shelve the recipe for the protein to be manufactured.

34
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,520
Now there is a copy of the recipe, the code for the protein's ingredients.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,920
The next step is to form the protein itself.
 Translation should take place.

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,280
This is done in the ribosomes, the cell's factories, which have the ingredients.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,960
Everything that happens from here is a chemical process.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,600
When MRNA arrives at the ribosomes, supplementary nitrogen bases should be switched on.

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,840
In the Ribosomes there is another RNA called TRNA-

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,320
-"Transfer RNA", which helps with it.

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,240
TRNA contains three nitrogen bases that encode a specific amino acid.

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,320
These are matched and linked to MRNA's chain of nitrogen bases.

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,200
A chemical process occurs which creates amino acids.

44
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,400
MRNA contains signals that mean "stop".

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
When the interconnection has reached there, the chain is ready.

46
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Now the job is done and both TRNA and MRNA leave the amino acid sequence.

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,280
It takes itself to the golgia apparatus-

48
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,560
-Where the protein gets its last, specific properties.

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,160
This process happens all the time, in every cell, day in and day out.

50
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,600
We have a lot to thank the proteins for.
 They heal your broken bone-

51
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,320
-Is involved in the immune system, build your muscles-

52
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,720
-And make sure you avoid an ugly hairstyle.
 After a while, anyway.

53
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,040
