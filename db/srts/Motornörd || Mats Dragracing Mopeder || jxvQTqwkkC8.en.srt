1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,780
Jeeeesus, what a moped!!

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,540
MotornÃ¶rd =  Engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,940
STANDARD IS FOR OLD BASTARDS

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,780
-Hello!
Hi.

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,400
-How are you?
I'm fine.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,295
My name is Mats Ohlsson.
Hi Mats my name is Douglas

7
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,860
-I understand that you like mopeds?
Yes, that is my passion.

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,700
-What is this?
I have a son.

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,460
He is often in the garage here with me.
Has tearing apart and build things.

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,380
-I love old mopeds
and here were many.

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,480
Yes it is ... half of them I own anyway.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,200
-Which one would you want to show first?

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,400
This one I like the most.
It's a Zundapp.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,560
Zundapp and drag racing are my passion.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,620
-Drag racing with mopeds?

16
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,700
There are competitions around the country
and a National Championchip is included.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,940
-Why did begin with drag racing?

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:20,120
I've been a drag racing mechanic 
when I was younger, in the ProMod class.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,980
I have also with been involved 
around snowmobile drag racing.

20
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,640
I've always liked drag racing.

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,860
-Let's see what you got.
What are you competing with?

22
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,520
We can start with the veteran class.
Then you can have a moped like this.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,860
Sure you can have a nicer one but I 
have chosen it to look a worn...

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,380
-Like a rat rod?
Yes.

25
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,660
Mechanically, it is in top condition.
Brakes and bearings are new.

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,300
It is in a very good condition 
even if it doesn't look like it.

27
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,260
-70's
No all mopeds I got are from 1966.

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,240
Sport Combinette 1966.

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,375
So 1966 is the year...?
Yes for now...

30
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,640
Well, I got some newer mopeds as well.

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
The mopeds that stand here are from 1966.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,980
This is a 1966 Zundapp Sport Combinette
moped for veteran class 70cc.

33
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,500
There are veteran class 50, 70 and 90.

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,980
-Is the number for CC?

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,720
Then you can modify to 52cc, 72cc or
92cc and that is the maximum limit.

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,220
This one has a 66cc with a
superterm athena cylinder.

37
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,900
Standard engine and has not 
maximum cylinder volume.

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,220
It could be stroked up to 72cc.

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,920
-What does it cost?
Is it expensive?

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,360
Both yes and no.
It's a cheap sport to be a motorsport.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,000
Motorsport costs money
but this is cheap.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,900
I crashed an engine a week ago.

43
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,600
The engine block cracked and the gearbox...

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,360
It cost 2500 SEK (250 USD) to fix.
-Oh!

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,200
A few gears and shafts and then it works.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,280
A car engine that breaks can cost 
around 75.000kr (7500 USD) to fix.

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,000
Absolutely!
Or more.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This one I bought far in
the forest a few miles away.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,160
The only thing I couldn't fix was the petrol tank.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,100
It was so rusty, I now use a petrol tank inside the tank.

51
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,800
-A tank in the tank?

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,060
Aha!
-It couldn't fix it.

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,780
There is a smaller petrol tank inside.

54
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,840
Aha!
Only to keep "the look".

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,200
-What is this?
It's flocked.

56
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,680
It was very popular in the 70's.

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,280
I've seen it's popular today as well.
Yes it may have come back.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,920
Flocked car dashboards,
stereo stuff etc.

59
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,800
-The seat didn't look comfortable.
No, but it should look like this.

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,180
It can't look too "good".

61
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,500
-But what is it?
I first drove with the original seat.

62
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,100
When I was carrying the moped on a trailer
to Lycksele for a competition...

63
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,280
...then it started to rain.
I had to pull on a plastic bag over the seat.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,220
So I wouldn't get wet when competing.

65
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,960
The moped is mapped.

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,940
15.7 hp on the rear wheel.
-15 hp!?

67
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,535
Yepp, 15.7 and earlier it had 15.4 hp.

68
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,680
I think it has more power now
since it runs better.

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,220
It runs well and revvs...

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,800
The last race I drove I had to change the sprocket.
It revved 14,500 when I drove over the finish line.

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,700
Then I had to add a bigger sprocket.

72
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,280
-How fast is it?
I have driven 102-103 km/h at best. (60 mph)

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,000
-You're joking!?

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
-On a moped??

75
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,920
10.3 seconds.

76
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,260
-Do you drive 200 meters?
Yes, 200 meters with stationary start.

77
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,660
-How many gears do you have?
This one has four.

78
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,060
3-4 years ago I had a 3 speed gearbox.

79
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,620
It was such a big step between 2nd and 3rd gear.

80
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,920
It was not suitable for drag racing.

81
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,320
Especially if you want to perform.

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,380
What I remembered from when I was young.
I didn't have a Zundapp myself but...

83
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,260
..the shift lever had a very long stroke.

84
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,200
Yepp, you hit your knee in the elbow.

85
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,020
That is why we as competitors have gear stops.

86
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,560
-Gear stops?

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,940
I never miss a gear with this.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,140
It rarely happens and works well.

89
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,600
It takes time to adjust since it hard
to change gear when driving slowly.

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,500
When you drive fast it's much easier.

91
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,020
-Then we take the next moped.
Which one do you want to show me now?

92
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,100
We can take this one.

93
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,220
This one is newly build.

94
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,200
It is also a veteran 70cc
the same class as the other one.

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,500
In veteran class 70cc you can also
race with a liquid cooled engine.

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,700
This one has a stage 6 cylinder from Minarelli.

97
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,140
It is also stroked.

98
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,080
If I stroke it with Zundapp
parts I get more than 72cc.

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,760
Stroked to 39.7 and reeds feding 
directly in to the crancase.

100
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,200
I broke this engine ealier this
year but now it's up and running again.

101
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,015
-This one also have a gear stop.
Yes I have it on all mopeds.

102
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,840
This one have not been proper adjusted yet.
Hopefully I can do it next season.

103
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,080
-When you compete, do you use several mopeds?

104
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,480
Last race I had 3 mopeds with
me but that was too much.

105
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,740
It becomes more quantity than quality.

106
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,620
I don't have time to give all mopeds
love they need between the runs.

107
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,540
One or two is recommended.
How much adjustments it is vs driving?

108
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,060
Hmm ... change sprocket and nozzles...

109
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,920
..the rusty I've been driving for years
and I hardly do anything with it.

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,160
Last race I change the sprocket
and that was probably the only thing.

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,380
This requires ignition adjustment, nozzle...
...there are so many adjustments left to do.

112
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,020
It can take 10 hours of driving
before I get 90% of its capacity.

113
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,400
The rusty is probably at 100% of its capacity.
It can hardly run any faster with it.

114
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,405
It is difficult.
But there is a lot left to do.

115
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:16,540
This one should go faster than that
rusty but it doesn't.

116
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,520
It is still a long way to go.

117
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,100
-Is it still in a run-in period?
Yes, very much left to adjust.

118
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,480
-The petrol tank looks a different?
Yes it is older.

119
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,540
I think this one is better looking.

120
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,560
-How much older is it?
From 1964 or 1965.

121
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,700
The "pear" tank is much nicer than the rusty one.
-Well both looks fine.

122
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,240
I can see another thing.
If you straighten the handlebar.

123
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,600
-The handlebar Isn't that wide.
It's just a bike handlebar.

124
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,180
There were many buttons to be a moped.
Yes...

125
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,300
Here is the water pump.

126
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,520
Temp gauge.

127
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,360
And the electric fan.

128
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,000
-No speedometer?
Nope.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Only temperature gauges.

130
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,100
And a kill switch.
It's needed for drag racing.

131
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:19,160
I run with HPI ignition system so I 
can choose between 2 ignition curves quickly.

132
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,980
What a job!
The tires look the same as my motorcykle.

133
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,060
Continental similar to motorcykle tires.

134
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,800
Does it need some upgraded brakes?
No, but it must work.

135
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Often you have a long distance to slow down.

136
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,300
Some tracks it may be short distances.

137
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,600
Often it is enough to release the throttle.

138
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,340
But it is important that they work
if anything should happen.

139
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,320
We also have a third moped
but it looks a little different.

140
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,660
This is the next class, ProMod.

141
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,000
-ProMod!?
Yes it sounds violent.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,860
ProMod is available in 50, 70 and 100cc.

143
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,180
ProMod 100 is a impressive class
and they drive really fast.

144
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,040
In ProMod you can have modern engines.
For example, AM6 and Derby engines.

145
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,900
And in this class there are Scooters included
with variator operation and they very quick.

146
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,700
When a Scooter is fully adjusted it is full 
throttle since they have automatic gearbox.

147
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,840
I have chosen to run a Zundapp
engine on this one as well.

148
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,580
-What does a modern engine mean?
Yes you can have 6 gears.

149
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,080
Most engine are reed-fed as standard.

150
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,260
These are great engines and esy to work with.

151
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,740
This is a little more complicated.
-But you stick to Zundapp?

152
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,200
It would be ridiculous to put
an AM6 engine on this one.

153
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
Then I would rather be further down the results list.

154
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
This is a ProMod 50, ie 50cc.

155
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,760
The rusty is 66cc in the veteran 70 class.

156
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,540
This one is pretty much 70cc in the same class.

157
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,100
And this ProMod 50 and it is about 50cc.

158
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,440
It is also stroked down to 39.7
to keep the cubic boundary.

159
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,760
-This one has wheelie bars.
Yes but I haven't used it yet...

160
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,260
...since it's not fully adjusted yet
so i have no need yet.

161
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,340
But when everything works, I will need it.

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,060
The other mopeds i have could flip over
since the wheelbase it is too short.

163
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,560
I have to be very careful at the start.

164
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,420
60 feet I drive at 2.2 seconds at best.

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,100
When this is optimized it is under 2 seconds
and then the wheelie bar is needed otherwise it will not work.

166
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
I understand!
This moped is much longer.

167
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,500
It is a custom built frame
which is extended around 12-13 cm.

168
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,420
And the parts are extended about 5 cm.
So it is about 20 cm longer than a standard moped.

169
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,760
I've seen 3 different things.
The rusty has the handlebar bent forward.

170
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,700
Yes it is to get the center of gravity forward
and it should be easier to get a great start.

171
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,160
-And you've turned the handlebar forward.
Yepp.

172
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,280
Here the handlebars are in the right place but are straight.

173
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,620
It is straight and a little more weight
on the rear tire but it works.

174
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,320
And this moped has the handlebars far down.
Yes has moved down the handlebars on the front fork.

175
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,960
To be able to hang as far forward as possible.

176
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:33,080
The entire moped is build in fiberglass.
We have made plugs from a moped.

177
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,820
-The Petrol tank as well?
The tank is made of fiberglass.

178
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,160
Behind is my trump card.
Several people have it in ProMod.

179
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,300
It's fed with nitrous oxide.
-Nooo.

180
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,060
-Hahaha!

181
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,720
This is how it looks like.

182
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,780
-What a moped!

183
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:55,320
When did you started to building this moped?
I've probably 1.5 years ago.

184
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,640
Me and a friend named Magnus LindelÃ¶v
has helped me a lot.

185
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,560
We have built this moped.

186
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,660
He lives nearby so we have garage nights
with a beer and fixes with the mopeds.

187
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,680
It sounds great.

188
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,900
-How many races are there?
There are 4 national competitions.

189
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,540
Geographically it has been Lycksele...

190
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,520
Hudiksvall....

191
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,380
Orsa and Ludvika and it has been different every year.

192
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,020
And this year it was a competition in LaxÃ¥.

193
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,400
That was arraged.

194
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,540
-How many are competing?

195
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,700
-We were quite many last and then we were 33st in total.

196
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,600
It's not a huge hobby, but we are
hope more people will join.

197
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,380
-I can imagine it's fun to watch.
Yes it is.

198
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,700
-Our mopeds have been ivated to some car races...

199
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,495
...they were impressed.

200
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,980
They thought the mopeds were cool.
We hope more people start competing.

201
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,020
-Which is the most fun to drive?
Right now it's the rusty one because it delivers.

202
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,025
It is tested to max.

203
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,655
The other two I have a lot of work left to do.

204
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,840
-Both?
Yes both.

205
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,520
Last year I tested the chassis with this engine.

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Just to test the chassis and then 
I used this engine with a Polini that I ported myself.

207
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,300
I drove 10.3 and 105-106 km / h with that engine.

208
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,560
I discovered that the chassis needed to be reinforced.

209
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,100
Trying to build as light as possible but...

210
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,400
...but that engine turned the whole chassis.

211
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,180
The chassis was too tight so I had to reinforce.

212
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,980
Last year I got the chassis to work.

213
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,780
This year I have used the real engine but...

214
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,815
...I've had problems with it.

215
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,440
It sounds strange and I have scraped some membrane 
and blown radial seal when I run nitrous oxide.

216
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,160
Here's how...

217
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,160
-How many people use nitrous oxide on mopeds?

218
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,800
There are some ...

219
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,380
..there are also those who ride with nitro in ProMod.

220
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,640
And those who run methanol.

221
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,000
The rules are pretty much unlimited in ProMod.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,280
-How's the spirit at the competitions?
It is very good.

223
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,280
- No fierce rivalry?
No, it's a nice level.

224
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,400
There is no prestige.
Everyone knows everyone and we have fun in the evenings.

225
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,120
-You don't reveal your secrets, do you?

226
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,980
Well, maybe it is, port times etc ..

227
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,760
-Do you do everything yourself?
I try to do everything myself.

228
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,840
I've built some exhaust pipe but
haven't got it really good.

229
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,620
Lately I have bought factory pipes
which I have modified.

230
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,380
Shortened and extended and made some other adjustments.

231
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:03,100
There are many pipes hanging in the roof.
Yes some different pipes that I have tried over the years.

232
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,720
-How long does a piston & cylinder last?

233
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,560
That one..
You're talking about the rusty, right?

234
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:15,640
I've been driving it for 2 years and
I only changed piston ring that's all.

235
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,520
Although it revvs so much so it works well.

236
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,000
-What is this?
It looks like...

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
Here I usually sit and port cylinders.

238
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,420
Isn't this what a jeweler usually uses?

239
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,500
No, it's from an old workshop.

240
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,680
It's a little small sometimes and
I haven't been able to port coil.

241
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,320
Now I have found this one and I think it is from the 60's.
It is old dental equipment.

242
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,280
Now I get down into the cylinders
so I can change the coil.

243
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,960
-Where do you find such old stuff?
Think it was at Tradera. (Ebay)

244
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,100
You had another scooter over here
is it also a Zundapp?

245
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,580
Yes it is a riding moped completely standard.
Just a daily driver.

246
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,220
-From what year?
1969 with the famous ...

247
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,940
...ball crushing petrol tank.

248
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,600
-HAHAHA!!!
You see why.

249
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,380
Don't want to run into anything with this.

250
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,040
The "famous" ball crushing petrol tank, love it!!

251
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,560
I was on a moped rally last year but 
I wouldn't be welcome back if I don't upgrade the cylinder.

252
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,080
So that engine will be used instead.

253
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,300
-It can't be a standard moped?
No no...

254
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,460
...standard it's for old bastards.

255
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:36,280
-Any success when you compete?
Well, it have been some good results.

256
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,980
I have been placed 1st, 2nd & 3rd.

257
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,460
Sometimes you go out in the first round 
like I did last weekend against a fast moped.

258
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,580
Then you are out.

259
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,960
It was against a teammate Jens HÃ¤gglund.

260
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,660
That bastard!
-Hahaha

261
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,940
I have no problem with that.
He was faster than me.

262
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,320
It is worse if you miss the start
or a gear and lose when you have a faster moped.

263
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Then it does not feel good but you lose courage
a faster moped it is easier to take.

264
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,920
-Is there any moped we can start?

265
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,100
I can start any of them.
We could try the rusty one.

266
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,400
Do not think people understand how qiuck it is 
especially when it looks the way it does.

267
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,080
Great, lets have a go.

268
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,040
-Is it comfortable to sit that one?
No!

269
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,640
I usually practice a lot of starts
and I get abrasions on the inside of the thighs.

270
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,620
It's not nice but everything for "the look".

271
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,740
14400 rpm.
It could revv more.

272
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,060
Now the moped it's cold so I don't to push it.

273
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,480
Damn!

274
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,780
What a moped.

275
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:27,205
15840 rpm, Jeeesus!

276
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:31,280
Is there any moped team in town?
Yes there is a club called RFR.

277
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,920
RFR?
Straight Forward Racing, a simple name.

278
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,600
There are some poeple in Ã-vik, Lycksele and BjÃ¤sta.

279
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,120
Good name!
Easy to remeber.

280
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,120
Hahaha!
It sounds like a motocross.

281
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,780
16320 rpm, that's totally crazy.

282
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,720
-This is like a motocross.

283
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,920
Looks are deceiving.

284
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,940
Hahaha, really!

285
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,620
It's totally crazy.
I didn't have time to turn the camera when you drove past.

286
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:45,060
I missed gears, since I'm not in race mode 
and I have "racing Crocs" on my feet.

287
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,200
Normally changing gears works fine.

288
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,000
Not many people think it should go fast when you see it.
That's true.

289
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,400
It has a wonderful sound.
Yes it's the clutch housing.

290
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,720
That makes the sound buzzing.

291
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,360
What a machine!

292
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,020
-What should people do if you want to start competing?

293
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,800
There are two good pages on the internet and facebook.

294
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,180
Facebook: Swedish Moped Dragracing och
Lyckseletwostroke.se

295
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,580
There you can read and ask questions.

296
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,500
Read about past events.

297
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,600
Then I think you should start competing.
There are so many fast mopeds...

298
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,780
... that can be competed with.
It's really fun.

299
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,400
Many thanks for taking the time and to show us all your stuff.

300
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,120
It is really appreciated and it has given
me a new view on tuned mopeds.

301
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,940
See you later!
I hope to see this on other events.

302
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,960
Well, I have to go to southern parts of Sweden and attend to other races.

303
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,300
Many thanks!
See ya!
