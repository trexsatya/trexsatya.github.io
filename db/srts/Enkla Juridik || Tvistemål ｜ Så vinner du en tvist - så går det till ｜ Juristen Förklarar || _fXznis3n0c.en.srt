00:00:04.914 --> 00:00:09.327
In this video we will explain what a dispute is and how it works.

2
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:15.759
A little later in the video we tell you how to maximize your chances in a dispute.

3
00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:21.085
A dispute is a conflict that arises between two or more individual parties.

4
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.713
Disputes belong to civil law, which means that the parties in a dispute can only be private individuals, companies or associations.

5
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.964
There are two different types of disputes.

6
00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:34.442
Dispositive and indispositive.

7
00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:38.029
In indispositive disputes, there are only two possible outcomes.

8
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:41.169
It cannot be reconciled in such disputes.

9
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.560
A good example is a dispute over paternity where there are only two possible outcomes.

10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.585
Dispositive disputes, on the other hand, are disputes where it is possible to compromise and negotiate.

11
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:58.833
Common such disputes are divorces, conflicts regarding contract interpretation, custody of children or money.

12
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.664
The rest of this video will be about dispositive disputes.

13
00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:06.880
Dispositive disputes can be resolved both in or outside the court.

14
00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:12.526
It is very good to agree with a lawyer with his counterparty outside the court with the help of a lawyer.

15
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:18.331
Then the counterparties can advantageously establish a settlement agreement that regulates how the solution becomes.

16
00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:24.000
The dispute goes to court if one of the parties submits a lawsuit against the other party.

17
00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:27.747
The party that submits the lawsuit is called a plaintiff.

18
00:01:28.103 --> 00:01:37.809
A lawsuit is a document where the plaintiff describes his views on the situation and, through so -called claims, demands what the counterparty should do.

19
00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:47.218
Once the court has received the lawsuit, the court will ask the counterparty to respond to the requirements of a so -called defense.

20
00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.923
In this case, the counterparty is called defendant, as it must respond to the requirements.

21
00:01:53.423 --> 00:01:58.833
After this exchange of letters, both parties meet on the so -called oral preparation.

22
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.547
In the presence of a judge, the two parties negotiate and try to agree on a compromise.

23
00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:07.386
Such a compromise is called a settlement.

24
00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:15.901
If it becomes a settlement, the court signs a settlement agreement that both signs and which tells what each party should do.

25
00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:21.478
If the parties do not agree in a settlement, the case goes on to a main hearing.

26
00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:26.105
In the main hearing, both parties report on their views on the situation.

27
00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:30.441
Then the judge makes a decision on how the case should be resolved.

28
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:34.909
The party that loses may replace the winning party according to what is in the judgment.

29
00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:44.119
The loser also bears responsibility for the winning party's legal costs for legal representatives, lost work income and other costs.

30
00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:51.164
If there is no clear winner in the case, the costs will be allocated in proportion to the distribution in the judgment.

31
00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:55.889
Often, your home insurance covers large parts of the costs.

32
00:02:56.289 --> 00:03:00.814
Contact a lawyer and your insurance company for an individual assessment.

33
00:03:01.192 --> 00:03:03.992
How should you do if you have ended up in a dispute

34
00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:11.906
What you can do if you want to sue someone or if you yourself have been sued is to gather all the evidence that can prove your cause.

35
00:03:12.618 --> 00:03:18.137
Collect any sms, email conversations, letters, agreements or other.

36
00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:23.562
In addition, you can contact people who may have witnessed the situation or agreement.

37
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.821
Another advice is that it is good if you are objective to the situation and try to keep the emotions in control.

38
00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:36.000
It can help you get a compromise with your counterpart and save you a lot of time and money.

39
00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:45.378
One last advice is that you contact a lawyer who can help you with your case and can best assess the situation and how you can maximize your chances of success.

40
00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:47.178
