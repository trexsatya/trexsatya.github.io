00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,210
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:08,067
We drive to Väddö.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,921
Come along! (- No, we fly to Väddö!) The

4
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:24,389
road from Märsta to Väddö.

5
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:56,150
Väddö is an island located approximately 100 km northeast of Stockholm.

6
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:20,237
We're at a farm dairy.

7
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:29,837
Here the children can watch all the animals that are here.

8
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:33,000
(not just children, adults too)

9
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:37,718
There is a cow.

10
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:46,380
They are hiding in the shadows.

11
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:48,805
It is hot.

12
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:54,593
Here is water they drink.

13
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,216
- Who are you looking at? - Pigs!

14
00:02:08,297 --> 00:02:10,862
one pig - three pigs

15
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:17,064
- Check what I can! - What are you doing? You jump!

16
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,872
Now I'm going to jump in there!

17
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:24,259
There are rabbits too!

18
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:39,814
One Rabbit - Several Rabbits

19
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:47,108
One Little Rabbit - Several Little Rabbits

20
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:03,550
What a Dirty One!

21
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:13,643
Come on, let's go and look at the goats!

22
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:21,801
one goat - several goats

23
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:43,312
- They are so cute!

24
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:08,650
They rock together.

25
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,205
From the farm dairy we go to a small beach nearby.

26
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:50,356
Here there is a bathing place, a beach.

27
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:54,694
But it blows so much. It's cold.

28
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:57,534
The water is cold.

29
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:03,000
But it's nice here.

30
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:11,258
It is very late now, it is five o'clock in the evening and we are going home.

31
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:17,384
It has been a great day today here on Väddö.
