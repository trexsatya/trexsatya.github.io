1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.880
When we communicate weather, we usually use slightly different meteorological expressions

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.140
But it is not always obvious what these mean.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.340
I think we go to the studio and work out a bit of the meaning of some of these expressions.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.560
So hang with it

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.300
High pressure and low pressure are largely what controls our weather up here in the north.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.560
When we say high -pressure weather during the summer then we mean simply will be

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.680
sunny and warm days while if we say low -pressure weather

8
00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.512
well then it will be a little more varied, a little more unstable weather

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.120
where there may be sun switched with some clouds and where maybe it will

10
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.740
rain or a rainfall passing.

11
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.020
Just when it comes to clouds, we have expressions such as changing clouds and varying clouds.

12
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.100
This picture actually shows both.

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.880
Up here in the north we have a plot -rich cloud cover

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.400
It is then changing clouds where it is stack clouds that have been formed during the afternoon.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.360
And when it is changing cloudy it will be quite so sunny anyway on the days.

16
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.760
But when it is varying cloudiness then there is a slightly different clouds that

17
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.760
varies during the day, it may be high cirrus clouds or low cumulus clouds

18
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.240
These vary both in time and space.

19
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.240
So we may have moments that are completely cloudy and then

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.640
That they clear up and become sunny weather.

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.120
Clouds give off rain showers and rain showers are really small rainfall areas

22
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.660
Then it may be that a rain shower is formed, passes over a community and dies out within 20 minutes.

23
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.560
But they can also be a little long lasting than that and a little varied when it comes to size.

24
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.720
Some are very small and some are a little bigger.

25
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.640
And since they are so small sometimes, it can be difficult to capture them in the forecast itself.

26
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.680
It may also be that the forecast says they should pass

27
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.500
A little else than what they really pass.

28
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.380
So that's why they can be missed in the local forecast sometimes so that's why it is also

29
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.480
Very good to supplement with the meteorologist's comment on our website.

30
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.540
Then when it comes to temperature, well then we also have slightly different expressions that we usually use.

31
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.280
Partly high summer heat and high summer heat is that the temperature comes

32
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.200
reach up to 25 degrees or more during the day.

33
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.744
A tropical night

34
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.800
Yes it is that the temperature did not drop below 20 degrees during the night

35
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.180
So the temperature was above 20 degrees all day.

36
00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:16.704
Heat wave

37
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.040
Yes, that is when the temperature is 25 degrees or more

38
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.820
for a small longer period.

39
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.680
Then we usually say about at least five days the temperature should reach above 25 degrees.

40
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.460
Iron nights, yes they are a little more common during early summer

41
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.620
And it is simply that we get a cold night very late into the season.

42
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.460
So if we come in in June and get a frost night, yes but then it has been an iron night.

43
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.080
Are there any expressions that you are wondering what it means or

44
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.060
expressions that we usually use that you don't really understand

45
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.440
Then you have to question the question below in the comments field.
