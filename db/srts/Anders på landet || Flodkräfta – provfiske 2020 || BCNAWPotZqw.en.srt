2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,020
It has now been almost five years since I planted river crayfish in the pond.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,340
null

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,660
I planted 200 river crayfish, about 50/50 males and females.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,480
null

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:18,980
null

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,400
The reason for having so many males is the genetic diversity.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,720
In recent years I have fished pretty hard on the breeding crayfish.
 Especially the males

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,580
Because they have become very large and it is important to keep after them

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,220
null

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,840
null

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,320
so that they do not chew up the fry to an excessive extent,

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,260
null

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,840
null

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,600
Tonight, it's now mid -June, I thought about doing a little test fishing

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
null

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,000
To see what it looks like.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,040
When I pick up the cages tomorrow I have no idea if there are any crayfish in them.

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,080
It may be that it is shells now and when the crayfish sit down in their holes

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,940
Unprotected without shells they do not go in the cages.
 Then there will be no crayfish.

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,060
null

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,560
null

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,060
null

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,140
Another reason for not fishing crayfish in June without traditionally in

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,260
August.
 It is that each shells grow, the crayfish grow about 10 percent.

26
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,300
And you want to bring that growth over the summer.

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,800
null

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,300
null

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,540
You do not reap the carrots when they are small but wait until they get bigger

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,120
If you want a big harvest.

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,760
null

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,380
So...

33
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,880
We'll see what it looks like tomorrow.

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,840
As usual, I graze with Frolic.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,875
But only put out four cages this time.

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
So we'll see how it goes.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,460
null

38
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,220
The reason for the grazing cages is that it will be a little more difficult

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,500
harder for the crayfish to access the bait

40
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,325
So they stay longer in the cages.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,300
null

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,820
I only have four cages so it goes pretty fast.

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,320
null

44
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,125
null

45
00:02:37,845 --> 00:02:38,845
null

46
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,700
null

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,980
I apparently had five cages.

48
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,360
null

49
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,900
Then I put a little loose in this and we will see if there is anything.

50
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,780
I can't go up and pick up a grazing cage.

51
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,640
Frolic "Fresh Ox" - Someone asked what kind I used.

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,200
null

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,280
Almost every time I post a movie about the pond or cancer cultivation

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,340
So is someone who hears and says "what ugly water you have".

55
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:29,840
null

56
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,420
I am fully aware of this, but do you have a pond with natural clay bottom without cloth

57
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,115
null

58
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,520
null

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,500
And crayfish that dig holes so you will have a muddy water.

60
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,200
null

61
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:48,445
null

62
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:50,240
I have reconciled myself to the thought.

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,460
It starts to obscure so small.

64
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,640
And tomorrow I'll see if there has been something in the cages.

65
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,440
Hopefully there will be crayfish in different sizes.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,040
It will be exciting to see if those born in the pond have come up in eating size.

67
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,840
null

68
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,680
\{Soft music\}

69
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,680
null

70
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,595
null

71
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:01,985
null

72
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:07,765

78
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:27,545

79
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:31,805

80
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,275

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,540
null

82
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,060
So it was morning and it was time to pick up the cages again.

83
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,240
null

84
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,320
First cage - just two small crayfish.

85
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,860
It may be that the bigger crayfish

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,860
Skalmates at slightly different time than the little ones.

87
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,840
null

88
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
null

89
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,380
Here it looked a little better - slightly larger crayfish.

90
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,060
I have a theory that crayfish of different sizes are in different parts of the pond.

91
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,655
null

92
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,500
null

93
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,340
But I have no documentation on this yet.

94
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,020
null

95
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,880
There are several details that separate the river crayfish from the signal cancer.

96
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,400
null

97
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,260
If you are offered river crayfish and are a little unsure, I can show some of them.

98
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,260
null

99
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,800
null

100
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,300
Here we have a river crayfish.

101
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,500
Firstly:

102
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,060
null

103
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,560
The river crayfish has no white spot in the thumb fold

104
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,320
but rather a little red point.

105
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,740
But it is not certain that you can see it when the cancer is cooked.

106
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:17,820
But something you can always feel if you pull your finger between the main shield and the back shield.

107
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,480
null

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,980
null

109
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,480
null

110
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,940
Then the river crayfish has tags.

111
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,040
Right here

112
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,540
So there are tags, it does not have the signal cancer.

113
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,180
Another way is to look at the claws.

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,240
The signal cancer usually has wider chlorine.

115
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,400
and additionally

116
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,820
- It is perhaps difficult to see if you cannot compare -

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,700
The river crayfish has taggering chlorine than the signal cancer.

118
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,780
null

119
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,760
Then you can see if it is a male or female.

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,040
You can see that on the underside.

121
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,960
Here you see that there is no extra leg pair after the pedestrian legs,

122
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,360
The males have.

123
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,480
So it is a female.

124
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,820
So she's going back.

125
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,080
During the summer months - almost from May to September.

126
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,540
So I feed the crayfish once a week with feed peas.

127
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,560
null

128
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,480
The feeding peas have several advantages.

129
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,100
They are pretty cheap and then they sink when you throw in them.

130
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,600
null

131
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,100
null

132
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,060
And when they start to get bad after a while, they do not remain and impair water quality.

133
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,840
They float up and float in to the beach

134
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,540
null

135
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,800
And there the birds eat them up.

136
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,320
So there will be no problem with eutrophication in the pond because of the feeding-

137
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,720
In addition, feed peasers have reasonably high protein content.
 Which is good for the crayfish.

138
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,340
null

139
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,160
The goldfish like them too.

140
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,300
null
