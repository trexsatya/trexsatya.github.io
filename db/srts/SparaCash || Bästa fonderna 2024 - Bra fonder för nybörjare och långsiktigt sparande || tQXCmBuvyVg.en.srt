00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
In today's video so we'll go through

2
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:05,376
The funds that I think are best to invest in

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,656
This does not mean that

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
These are the best funds

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,984
Without it are the ones I consider

6
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:16,765
Are interesting to start saving in case you are a beginner and may want to start saving in funds this year

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:21,925
If you do not know who I am, my name is Marcus Lindblad.
 And it's me who runs Sparecash!

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,552
On sparecash and you will learn

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,844
Save in shares, funds, and much more.

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,440
The funds that we go through in this video you should see as

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,720
Inspiration and tips

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,024
But not as advice without

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,304
you must always read on

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,352
And wondering if this is right for you

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,424
Never invest more money than you can afford to lose

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
Because if you are a beginner and want to start saving in funds

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,574
For an extended period of time for example three to five years ahead

18
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
Then these are these funds you should invest in.

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:53,248
Some key features that I look for when I look at this fund

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
It is that the fund should have:

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Performed well in the past

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
That it has a low fee

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,082
And that it is a equity fund.

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,440
It is the three important pieces that

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,744
You should look at if you look at different funds.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,304
And when we talk about funds with a low fee

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Then I look at funds below 1 % in fee.

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,448
(The discussion about fees) It is a completely different video that we can take another time.

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,496
Now we jump into the first fund!

30
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,152
The first fund I think is good to have in a long -term savings

31
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
It is

32
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,109
Spiltan equity fund investment company

33
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
Spiltan Aktiefond investment company is a

34
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Investment company fund

35
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
The fund is investing in

36
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Other investment companies

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
And for the most part, it contains:

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Investor

39
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,954
But also other investment companies such as:

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
IndustrivÃ¤rden, Kinnevik

41
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,656
And many others.
 And this at a low fee of only 0.2%

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,667
And yes, you can definitely buy these investment companies yourself!

43
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
But in case you are not ready to

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Start buying shares

45
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Then buy this fund.

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,968
I have this fund as a base in my long -term portfolio.

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
Because it is easy to save only each month in the fund

48
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
To this low fee

49
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,416
Fund number 2 which I find interesting it is Avanza Zero.

50
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,744
Avanza Zero is a free fund

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,883
Which invests in Sweden's 30 most traded shares.

52
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
And then you get a pretty

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Nice mix of

54
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
Big

55
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
Swedish stable companies traded over the stock exchange

56
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,824
The good thing about this fund is completely free.

57
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,387
So you will get a stable return over time and it doesn't cost you a single penny.

58
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:30,528
The third fund that I find interesting in long -term savings is:

59
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
Avanza Global

60
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,392
Avanza Global is a global fund

61
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,399
This means the fund is investing in shares all over the world

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,700
So then you get exposure to the absolute largest companies in the world.

63
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
And this to a very low fee

64
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,752
And these three types of the funds - they are enough!
 (short and good)

65
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,867
In a long -term fund portfolio.

66
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,592
My own little tactics when one

67
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
Saves in funds: three funds are enough

68
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
You need a Swedish fund

69
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
An investment company fund

70
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
And a global fund

71
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
And then you can season with

72
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
Small companies

73
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
Technique

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Or somebody else

75
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
For example, developing countries or whatever.

76
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,536
But it is enough with these wide funds that have a low fee

77
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
And that invests in 100% shares.

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,338
This type of funds is enough for your savings if you are long -term.

79
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:26,731
They fit perfectly if you are a beginner and just want something to save in each month.

80
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,896
Of course there are options

81
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
To Avanza Zero

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
Spiltan investment company

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
Avanza Global

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,808
There are a lot of good options

85
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
And I've listed them in my article:

86
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,136
Best funds at sparecash.se

87
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,263
So check out that article and I put a link below in the description

88
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
And the comment field

89
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
So go in there

90
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,205
Because there you can see more different funds.

91
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,916
There are many good funds out there!
 But the most important thing you have to think about.

92
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
It is to save every month!

93
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
Instead of trying to look for

94
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
which fund is the best

95
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
Instead try to sell out

96
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Those funds that are bad

97
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,808
It doesn't matter if you go one or two percent up or down

98
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Up or down

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Or so

100
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Without looking for them instead

101
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Good funds

102
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Save in them all the time

103
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
Do not try to change and so if you do not

104
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
manage to spend time on it

105
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
Without finding any good funds

106
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,399
Save in them every month

107
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
And do it

108
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,108
for several years

109
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
That's what will make you

110
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,031
Really rich over time.

111
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,383
