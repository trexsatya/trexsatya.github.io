Lyrics: Good morning, are you awake yet?

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,920
Episode 56, Speed Weekend on ice 2019.
-It should go faster.

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,100
This is a fantastic day in Sweden 
and as you see wonderful clear sky.

4
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,220
The lake has frozen overnight which apparently
mean amazing conditions with today's event.

5
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,140
Something I look forward to.

6
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,180
-I agree with Edd.
What a fantastic event and what nice weather.

7
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,820
Before we kick off, what is Speed Weekend?
I'll ask someone who knows.

8
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,480
Yes it was unfortunately my idea.

9
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,680
It was perhaps not my smartest idea
in life but it is fun.

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,600
My name is Glenn Ocklund and I am
organizer of Speed Weekend.

11
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,360
It is the eleventh year in a row 
that I arranges this event.

12
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,860
Most people comes for speed records
and it's "landspeed record on ice".

13
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,680
It is about going as fast as you can
with the vehicle you have manufactured.

14
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,680
You can come with any vehicle.

15
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
The only thing we require is vehicle safety
and personal protective equipment.

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,020
We assess each vehicle individually.

17
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,340
We don't say no to anyone.

18
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,720
If the vehicle is safe, it's okay with us.

19
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,320
Thank you, Bye!

20
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,340
I'm here with CTEK as you might see.
I have done some things with them.

21
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,220
They said I hade to come here.

22
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,380
I hadn't heard of it before.

23
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,380
Why haven't I heard of this before?
It's amazing!

24
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,320
I look forward to seeing all crazy vehicles.

25
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,380
-What is this?

26
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,280
Basically it is a lawn tractor,
go-cart, motorcycle and a quad bike.

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,740
As a type of hybrid you can say.

28
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,860
Much of it is a go-cart and the engine
from a motorcycle.

29
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,000
Even if it looks like a lawn tractor.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,080
The chassis is built of a go-cart.

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,480
The chassis have been extended
and I have rebuild it myself.

32
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,580
Much to get wheel angles to
work as a go-cart etc.

33
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,560
It should be able to drive it on race track aswell.

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,920
It works very well but the 
problem is to remain seated.

35
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,700
I don't know if it's good for anything.

36
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,680
But it works on the ice and asphalt.

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,040
The idea is to try drag race this summer.

38
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,340
It is a Triumph Speed ​​Triple from 2004.

39
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,060
It is 955 cc and the engine delivers 120 hp.

40
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,640
-That's pretty good!
Yes the weight ratio is the same.

41
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,180
It weighs around 120 kg.

42
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,220
The effect and weight ratio are very good.

43
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,540
It is very interesting to drive.

44
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,825
This is the gear switching unit.

45
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:29,620
The idea was that I would have a foot pedal
for the clutch but I got no space.

46
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,080
How could I do this as simple as possible?
Then I build it similar as a motorcycle.

47
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,200
I have put the gear lever in the front
and the only thing I do is pull it.

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,620
It flexes here with a brace.
I never have to touch it.

49
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,580
-How fast did you drive earlier today?

50
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,900
I haven't driven anything today.

51
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:19,995
Yesterday I had an average speed of 130.2 mph.

52
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:23,305
-What is the goal today?
130.4 mph or more.

53
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:26,275
A wonderful day like this
I'm going for 130.4 mph or more.

54
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,520
-Have you crashed?
Hehe, not me.

55
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,100
But it looks cool, right?

56
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,900
Here comes a happy Rickard.

57
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,960
129.8 mph. 
It's close, hahaha.

58
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,180
Anyway, it did not break.

59
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,920
-How did it go?
The rumor says, an averaged speed of 129.8 mph.

60
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,220
It is probably one of the fastest
the rounds I have run.

61
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,940
-Lovely!
Yes, it's great.

62
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,280
Now, I'm hungry.
Do you want some?

63
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,700
-Maybe.

64
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,000
This is the highlight of the 
year for us and many others.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,420
I visited you in September / October.

66
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,820
And I had never heard of Speed ​​Weekend
but now I have seen it and totally understood.

67
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,900
If you like odd things then this is where you should be.

68
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,860
Here is something for everyone.
Everything from extreme cars with 1000 hp to...

69
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,980
...homemade stuff that cost 50 USD.
Anyone can participate.

70
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,520
Those who come here and think it's to 
much noice have come to the wrong place.

71
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,500
Plenty of noice, that's exactly what it is.

72
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,520
-What is wrong?
The drive shaft is broken.

73
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,580
I have to knock out a small piece 
from the rear differential.

74
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,700
I have to open it so I could get hold of it.

75
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,160
-Is the goal to get a speed record?

76
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,135
No, we are drifting.
-Aha.

77
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,060
I want to drive as much as possible.

78
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,640
So, cut the cords so you can open it.

79
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,960
Useless gasket, best ever...

80
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,180
-How often?

81
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,480
-No one can hear anything now.

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,460
-Someone passes with a lawn tractor.

83
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,720
This is what's happens 
if you weld the differential.

84
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,540
And it's the cheapest way to it.

85
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,540
So it happens...

86
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:01,040
...that it could work for a while.

87
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,140
-Are you here every year?
I've been here eleven years in a row.

88
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,060
I've been at all Speed Weekends since the start.

89
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,360
I usually go with a Super Seven
on the high-speed track.

90
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,340
But this year I just went for drifting.

91
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,120
-What's so good about Speed ​​Weekend?

92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,740
You can drink beer in the evening and
drive a car during the day and just have fun.

93
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,360
It is a bit special to live on the ice
with all other like-minded people.

94
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,980
It's inventive petrol heads coming here.

95
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,260
-How long will this take?

96
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,340
I'll guess it takes an hour 
before I can drive again.

97
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,875
See ya.
-Good luck.

98
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,100
-For how many years have 
you been at Speed Weekend?

99
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,280
It is the fifth or sixth year.

100
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,020
I was first here as a visitor.
Then I was here with a friend who drove a motorcycle.

101
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,720
Then I built something my own.

102
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,700
It was a hard to find information
about Speed Weekend at the beginning.

103
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,300
I heard about it many years ago.

104
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,020
Finding out which date it where was difficult.

105
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,580
-What kind of creation do you have out here?

106
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,380
It's a little different, the main creation 
is a jet-driven Forshaga Shopper. (old moped)

107
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,440
That's where it started and then it has
been more things added during the year.

108
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,660
It is Mobacken Racing's fault, or...

109
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,700
It is Anders Johansson and Olov Selander
who have built a jet-powered kick.

110
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,800
As they have been riding for 
many years at Speed ​​Weekend.

111
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,540
I started to follow them online and 
thought that I have to build a jet engine.

112
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,600
They have already build a kick 
so I need to create something else.

113
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,700
Then I saw a Forshaga Shopper and thought
the space at the back will fit a jet engine.

114
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,800
I bought a big engine and a Shopper and started to build.

115
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,180
The jet-enginge I have build myself.

116
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,320
That consists of a turbocharger from
a 16 liter (4,2 gallon) Volvo marine diesel engine.

117
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,440
The turbo weighs 32 kg so it is a decent aggregate.

118
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,280
On top of the turbo I have built a combustion chamber
where I am conducting the compressor air.

119
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,100
It drives the turbine before it goes
into a afterburner chamber.

120
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,260
Where more fuel is added for more power.

121
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,340
The fuel consumption is three times 
higher than the original engine.

122
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,400
It consumes 4 liters (1 gallon) a minute.
I can ride it 5 minutes on a full tank.

123
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,285
If I drive with full power.

124
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:30,880
-How does it look in the cockpit?
I sketched on which analogue gauge I needed.

125
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,400
I hardly looking at gauges since
I have plenty of other things to do.

126
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,800
-And the hole in the roof?

127
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,680
I could fit the shopper so I had to cut it.

128
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,200
My first plan was to put a shade above in plexiglass.

129
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,060
But I didn't have time to fix it.

130
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,760
When that was the case, it 
seemed to look pretty okay anyway.

131
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,740
The helmet protrudes slightly from the hole.

132
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,360
-This is the disadvantage of standing outdoors.

133
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,760
Do you think? Hahaha.

134
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,580
It's such a constant noise here.

135
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,520
Yes it is a really nice 
event if you like noise.

136
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,660
-What can you tell me about this vehicle?

137
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,835
It's an electrically powered 
ice yacht that I call Propster.

138
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,520
-Where did you get the idea to 
build something like this?

139
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,400
I do not know, you are a little crazy.

140
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Then I want to be a little bit different
and I always liked the electrically powered vehicles.

141
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,160
Since you get so much power from small engines.

142
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,060
I have built everything myself, except the engine.

143
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,860
I development body and chassis myself.

144
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,740
The engine comes from a model aircraft.

145
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,020
It's a Plettenberg.

146
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,400
Normally I have the largest engine 
but it is now unfortunately broken.

147
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,220
I have to run a smaller engine today.

148
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,900
Last year I drove 89 mph on average
and 92 mph as the top speed.

149
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,220
-Wow!

150
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,480
With this engine I have had
88 mph as the top speed.

151
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,920
I hope I'm able to ride around that speed.

152
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,080
I'll charge the batteries now
and have a go in half an hour.

153
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,620
-Good luck!
Thanks.

154
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,740
Now we have Jonas with the electric 
powered ice yacht Propster.

155
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,000
-Is this the latest creation?

156
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,500
Yes it is the last one since you last visited.

157
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,320
-And what is it?

158
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,040
It's a kick with a pulse jet engine.

159
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,440
With very poor traction and consumes a lot of petrol.

160
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,860
But it sounds good.

161
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,780
Most people can attest that it is loud.

162
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,480
I drove 2 km and it consumed
10 liters (2.64 gallon) of petrol.

163
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,020
I ran out of petrol 10 meters before the finish line.

164
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,120
-What speed did you get up to?

165
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,660
I'm note sure but I will guess around 44 mph.

166
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,355
Earlier it was unusual if there 
were participants from other countries.

167
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,860
But now there are more and more teams coming.

168
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,520
It is the only place in the world
they arranges speed races on ice.

169
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,220
It's really fun for all of us.

170
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,540
Here is our place to chill out.

171
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,260
Here we can relax.

172
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,560
For those of you who were born in the 60-70s
would remember this childens tv-program.

173
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,140
The TV has lighting so it lights up
a nice black and white picture in the evening.

174
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,620
I got these furniture from a colleague's parents.

175
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,800
They are nice to have on the ice so picked them up.

176
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,880
Speed ​​Weekend also has the prize for best depot
and there we have been top ranking for many years.

177
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,060
We have been ranked both 1st and 
2nd place previous years.

178
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,200
-It's a lot of noise.
Yes, there is a lot of noise.

179
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,280
Well, I suppose it belongs here.

180
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,320
We are sitting in here instead since
the noice is unbearableh outside.

181
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,880
There are plenty of vehicles which 
makes noise all the time.

182
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,480
-What is Svarthålet Racing? 
(the Black hole Racing)

183
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,240
It's just three friends.
Me, my brother and Lars-Erik.

184
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,100
We decided to build odd and fun vehicles.

185
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,740
It started at Speed ​​Weekend.

186
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,700
At that time it was in Funäsdalen.

187
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,680
Back then Lars-Erik had built the pulse jet kick.

188
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,740
We'll bring it to the Speed Weekend and see how it goes.
That was how it started.

189
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,220
Many hobbyists are building a small pulse jet engines.

190
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,140
A pulse jet can be built from one
old dairy pipe or something similar.

191
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,880
It was Lars-Erik who came up with the idea of ​​building a kick.
And I don't know why.

192
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,340
And when we wanted to scale up the 
projcet a kick was not suitable anymore.

193
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,060
Then we were going to use Mom's old Yamaha chassis but it was too small.
We build a custom chassis instead.

194
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,960
We started with the chassis but it was much simpler then.

195
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,100
And then the engine, which incidentally 
took 1.5 years before we could start it.

196
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,380
Then it became optimization since the 
first engine broke down quite promptly.

197
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,580
We had made some stupid design flaws.

198
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,760
A new engine design and build a 
suspension on the chassis.

199
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,500
A few years later, we made an engine cover.

200
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,300
Second and third generation
engine became operational.

201
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,920
Then we started investing in 
aerodynamics to reach higher speed.

202
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:01,080
The latest engine we invested in very good sheet metal.

203
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,280
And we scaled up the engine a bit.
It is an iterative process.

204
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,700
What is most critical this time around?
Then we get that part fixed.

205
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,140
Do you see that guy Douglas?
The Motornörd guy in blue pants.

206
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,640
You should subscribe to his Youtube channel.

207
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,855
Now it's time for Svarthålet to have a go.

208
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,920
I wonder if there is someone who has told the about
the bump in the ice at the end of the runway?

209
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,860
Svarthålet aims to ride faster than last year.

210
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,540
Which was 149,75 mph on average.

211
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,200
People, cover your ears.

212
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,940
Holy baloney!
That was amazing!

213
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,180
Did you pee in your pants? Hahahaha!

214
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,360
I would say I'm mildly moist.
That was awesome!

215
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,000
-It is loud!
It definitely is.

216
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It isn't loud when you ride it.
I'll guess I start to get used to it.

217
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,300
We got proof that it's loud when
things breaks when they are too close.

218
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,580
Flower pots fall out of the shelves 
when we start it at my moms house.

219
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,940
It's a bit brutal.

220
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,580
-How many decibels is it?
No one really knows.

221
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,300
But there are many.

222
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,900
There was someone sitting indoors
20 miles away and heard it yesterday.

223
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,460
-How is it to drive?

224
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,680
Great for the most part.
But it depends on the weather which surface it is.

225
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,720
Some of the rides today were a bit unpleasant
due to side wind and the track was bumpy.

226
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,340
-What's the fuel consumption?
There is about 15-20 liters (4-5 gallon) on a each run.

227
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,620
15-20 liters (4-5 gallon) for riding 1.2 miles?

228
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,400
Mmm, maybe that's not good.

229
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,300
But we don't drive it often.
And it's not something we commute with.

230
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,200
That was all for this time.
it will be more content in the next episode.

231
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,440
If you like odd vehicles you 
should screen Brooklyn Choppers.

232
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
I will link to that series in the credits.

233
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,220
Thank you for watching!
See ya in the next episode.

234
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,520
This is enjoyable.

235
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,800
Lovely!

236
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,160
The engine was running but the hole 
in the valve is difficult to repair.

237
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,380
Motornörd = Engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

238
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,100
More episodes will be translated to 
English in the near future.

239
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,000
