1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,919
You always have to be in your head.

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,119
It is important to know which rules apply and which laws are to be applied

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,039
And you have to keep track of different systems.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,640
It is also important to have the ability to meet and talk to different people

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,559
And see things from their perspective and how they view the situation.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,679
I am really passionate about my tasks and to investigate.

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32.920
The best thing is when it gets a little tricky and I really have to think about it.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,799
It is a challenging job, a high tempo, it is rewarding and I make a big difference for people.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,679
If someone has become ill then I can help that person understand what applies

10
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,359
And what exactly that person needs to do.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,840
It is full up all the time and you must not be afraid that things change.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58.560
There will be new laws and new rules. And one must be able to change quickly and

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,960
do in a different way than before.

14
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,920
At the same time, it is great fun with positive feedback from insured and colleagues.

15
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,879
We have a great unit, a great manager and I can always be involved and influence.

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,599
It's really a fun job.
