1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,462
Are we recording now?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,352
I am good looking?

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:10,386
Hello, hello. Today we are going to run a 
Q&A video and now it is so that this intro-

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:14,823
-or the previous intro sucked, so now I record this on 
the other camera because I have a little lack of time.

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,720
So, now we jump to the other camera 
and then I start some videos.

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,992
Hello!

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,000
Today we will run a Q&amp;A, a question video.

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,160
I think we'm jumping right in.

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,080
That's fun.

10
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:36,791
Tjena Marcus. I wonder what is the difference between the 
A, B and C shares for the same company?

11
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:41,250
Tjena Emil. Well, the difference between 
A and B shares is that-

12
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,915
-it is usually the case that when you own an A share, 
you have the right to vote.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,128
You have the right to influence the company.

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,089
At a general meeting, for example, you get to 
vote on what you think and feel.

15
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:56,449
If you think a company should do this or that.

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
If you instead have a B share 
, you do not have as strong a voting right.

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
An A share is usually worth 10 times more 
than a B share in the form of voting rights.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
Otherwise, the shares are exactly the same.

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,288
The more shares you have, the greater the 
impact you can make on the company.

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,945
If you are the main owner, you usually have A-shares, 
but if you are a small saver like you and me-

21
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,225
-then it is usually the case that you drive on the B shares instead.

22
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:32,243
These shares with less voting rights 
usually have greater turnover on the stock exchange.

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,232
So it's easier to buy and sell them.

24
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,649
A short answer to your question is that an A share is 
worth more than a B share in the form of voting rights.

25
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:45,896
If you are not the main owner of the share, then 
it is unnecessary to even think about it-

26
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:50,382
-and only buy the share that is cheapest 
and has the highest turnover.

27
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:56,703
Should it be a high or low P / E ratio?

28
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,640
Tjena Elin! 
The P / E ratio is an abbreviation of price divided by earnings.

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,737
Thus, the share price divided by the earnings per share.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,770
These two key figures. How much does the share cost 
and how much does the company earn in earnings per share?

31
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:15,820
Then you get the P / E ratio.

32
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,828
If a share costs SEK 5 and the earnings per share are SEK 1-

33
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:27,325
-then it takes 5 years for the company to earn the profit 
that the company or share is valued at.

34
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
Some people think that a low P / E ratio is better than a high one, 
but quite frankly you can say that a low P / E ratio

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,741
-means that the company is undervalued 
compared to a high P / E ratio.

36
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,805
It can be said that the higher the P / E ratio of a company, 
the higher their expectations are.

37
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:50,241
For example, we have Amazon which has 
had a P / E ratio of 70 up to 130-

38
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
-if you look back since 2011.

39
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:58,377
But Amazon has also done very well, 
increasing sales quite significantly.

40
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,599
And the stock has actually more than 
tenfold in value since 2011.

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,397
So in that case, a high 
P / E ratio has actually not been so bad.

42
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,840
Personally, I do not care so much 
about P / E ratios when I choose shares.

43
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Tjena Marcus.

44
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:18,656
I was just going to draw a quick question 
how do you think about your own investing?

45
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
What is the goal of your savings?

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,568
How did you set it up in the form of monthly savings?

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,408
And you can even add how you started.

48
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:37,113
Did you have any start-up capital or did 
you save monthly with a lower amount and then increase?

49
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:39,520
Yes, your strategy quite simply.

50
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Tjena Daniel!

51
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
I always save at least SEK 1,000 per month 
and today I do it in 7 different equity funds.

52
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:53,866
Gradually, I sometimes sell off some of the funds 
if I am dissatisfied with the return.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,312
And then I buy more of my shares instead.

54
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,443
I often want an 80/20 distribution 
between my shares and funds.

55
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,760
I remember when I was little 
and then we had cash-

56
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,818
-and I saved them in my piggy bank and sometimes 
I took out my money and put them on the floor.

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,400
Then I wrote on a piece of paper how much I had saved.

58
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,582
My first goal was to save to 
a Sony Ericsson mobile phone.

59
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,152
I really wanted it, 
so I saved as much as I could-

60
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
-to afford to buy this cell phone.

61
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,902
And it's always with me. 
This to save for something-

62
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:37,196
-or just that it's fun 
to feel that you have money.

63
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,135
I started investing by reading a lot, I googled a lot and then I opened an account on Avanza.

64
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
I was 19 then, so it's just over 7 years ago.

65
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:54,046
So 7 years ago, in 2013 I think, 
then I bought Avanza Zero for SEK 2,500.

66
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,034
It was savings that I did not 
know what to do with.

67
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,055
And I have always wanted to learn 
how stocks and mutual funds work.

68
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,037
So I put this money on Avanza 
and started buying Avanza Zero.

69
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,946
I bought Avanza Zero afterwards, a bit like that.

70
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,397
And then I bought my first shares after that too.

71
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:15,000
Then I took some courses and have learned over time.

72
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,393
You never get full, even though 
I've been doing this for 7 years-

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,536
-you never get full, you learn 
all the time and that's what's fun.

74
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
Erik Martinger.

75
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,027
Many monthly savings in funds, 
but what about stocks?

76
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
How do you do?

77
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,377
As I mentioned in the question before, 
I buy funds every month.

78
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,223
Sometimes more often than not, if it is the case that it fluctuates a lot, 
like now in corona times, I bought a little more.

79
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,542
As I said, my funds 
account for more than 20% of my total portfolio.

80
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,719
-then I usually reallocate a little 
or sell a little of my funds.

81
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
And buy more shares instead.

82
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,839
Because I think it's 
more fun to deal with stocks.

83
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Mattias Sandelius.

84
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,935
What does your portfolio look like?

85
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Tjena Mattias!

86
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,270
Yes, I have 4 companies in my equity portfolio today.

87
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:11,090
Some may think it is a little higher risk, 
but I like that it is high risk.

88
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:13,834
And I like when it swings a lot. 
I think it's fun.

89
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,692
Today it is Castellum, Mycronic, Sinch and Plejd.

90
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,800
Then I also have 7 funds 
and you can see them here.

91
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Gabbe LÃ¶nn Erlandsson.

92
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:32,191
Do you have any examples of places where you can invest in the 
interest-on-interest effect to secure your future savings?

93
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Tjena Gabbe

94
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:39,614
I do not really know what you mean, but the interest on the interest rate effect 
you achieve if it is the case that you invest in something-

95
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,384
-and then you get a return or interest 
and then you reinvest it.

96
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:50,145
So that the year after or a time after that, 
you get a bigger return or a bigger interest rate.

97
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:58,188
I advise you to watch my interest on interest rate video 
where I explain more about interest on the interest rate effect.

98
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,560
Dividend shares are a perfect example of 
how to apply interest to the interest rate effect.

99
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,656
How do you go about finding out 
why a stock is going high or low?

100
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,336
Usually check news about the company, reports and more.

101
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
Through rumors, I search for news on Google.

102
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,591
If you search for the company, you usually 
find it on Google on news or on Twitter.

103
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,391
Rafi Newton Andreasyan.

104
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,225
I do not know if I said that name correctly, but ... Sorry.

105
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,760
What strategy do you use to decide if you want to buy 
a particular stock or not buy it right now?

106
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,263
I actually have no direct strategy, but if 
I feel like buying a share, I buy the share.

107
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
I have a little gut feeling, you could say.

108
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,817
If I think the company has potential and I want to buy shares, 
then I usually buy a small watch item

109
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,991
-which I hold and then I read about the company.

110
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,143
And is it so that I get a greater faith 
in the company, then I buy more.

111
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,633
What did your portfolio look like when you started with 
equities and mutual funds? And what does it look like today?

112
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,000
I am therefore interested in how the development has gone.

113
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:10,986
The development has probably not gone so well. I made quite 
a lot of beginner mistakes that everyone makes the first 2, 3, 4, 5 years.

114
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,367
I'm still a beginner in my eyes.

115
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:19,497
I bought a lot of Avanza Zero in the beginning and a bit naughty ... 
yes, cancer companies and stuff.

116
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,600
I do not think it went very well, but I can 
throw up a print screen here so you can see.

117
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Wilmer Lehtonen.

118
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
Hi, here is a question from a real beginner.

119
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,748
I am trying to build a portfolio 
and study a few different funds, but also equity

120
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:39,116
-it feels like the stock market has been doing very well lately 
and many funds and equities are at the top.

121
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:43,063
How to think then? Should you wait or 
look for others who have not done as well?

122
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:47,903
Or buy into those who are high and wait for 
Q3 in the hope that they will go up further?

123
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:48,437
Thanks.

124
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:50,687
Yes, you Wilmer.

125
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:54,705
I think you should not think too much.

126
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:57,558
But should I think about how long I invest?

127
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,750
Am I investing in one or two years?

128
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:04,193
Is it that you invest quarterly or why are you worried?

129
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,596
Of course, in the short span of time, it's hard 
if it fluctuates a lot.

130
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,906
-as an example with corona when the stock market went down 10% in one day.

131
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:21,197
It was a lot of work for a lot of people and many sold out 
and you might lose some money on it.

132
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,717
The absolute best tip I can give and 
that I usually give, is to be long term.

133
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,167
To think that this is money that 
I invest in maybe 10 years.

134
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:38,247
Then when you invest, you know that I should 
not be affected by such short-term events.

135
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,529
So should one wait?

136
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:46,715
Yes, if you find it difficult because there is a risk that 
it can go down a lot, then maybe you should wait.

137
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
Instead, I usually think like this that I might invest a little 
less, if I'm worried it's a pretty high peak.

138
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,555
And keep investing over time just all the time.

139
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,868
You do not have to go all in at once, because that's 
what a lot of beginners do in the beginning.

140
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:08,496
That you buy insanely large sums, 
so if you earn 20,000 a month-

141
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:16,047
- do not go in with 20,000, but go in 
with maybe 10% of what you earn.

142
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,900
If you might deposit SEK 5,000 for savings, 
then you do not need to go in with 5,000 at once.

143
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,843
SEK 500 is enough, so that if it 
goes down, you can buy for another SEK 500.

144
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,716
Then you have come in both when 
it is high and when it is low.

145
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
Filip Thunstedt aka the boss and the legend.

146
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,245
Do you run mortgages?

147
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:45,026
Yes I do. I run with securities lending. 
The super loan on Avanza. I run a maximum of 5% loan.

148
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,026
That's my personal rule.

149
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,015
Magnus Sturedahl.

150
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:53,477
How to lie down long or short? And how 
do you calculate a possible loss?

151
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:00,146
Going to bed long means 
that you believe in your investment in ...

152
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
It is believed that it will simply go up.

153
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,855
Going to bed short on time means 
believing in decline.

154
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
It is therefore believed that investment will decline.

155
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:17,002
This can be done with leverage products 
such as bull, bear, turbo variants, CFDS.

156
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,679
There are a variety of such products.

157
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:30,000
I actually do not know all these products in my head, but 
leverage products are not recommended for beginners.

158
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,870
It's pretty easy to burn yourself there.

159
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,760
If you want to calculate the risks with a lever, then you have to look at how 
much leverage is in the product that you buy.

160
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,255
Then you get to look at the potential downside, 
if it is the case that it would go down 5% -

161
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,263
-multiply it with the lever, type. 
There you have your risk.

162
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,679
Plus any fees and interest for that product.

163
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,949
This is a very complicated issue 
that is very difficult to get into right now.

164
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:01,663
The risk is great when you trade with leverage, 
so read on carefully and make sure you learn first.

165
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,735
Tore Landin Larsson. My real brother, the star.

166
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,462
Strategies for buying, selling, reallocating. It would 
be interesting how you reason about it.

167
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:18,818
So, when you take home profits, sell off bad holdings, if you are long 
on minus investments or if you sell off those with the highest development?

168
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,599
Well, it's a little hard to say something red.

169
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
If it is the case that I see that a company is 
not developing as well as I hope

170
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,845
-if it just keeps going down and down, then maybe I'm selling off.

171
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,522
For example, I invested in Catena Media 
a while ago and they did not go so well.

172
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:47,193
-then I sold at a loss, because 
it's better that you sell at a small loss-

173
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:51,602
-than you sit for as long as you like 
and hope for a turnaround.

174
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,328
Many say, "Yes, be long-term." Which I also say 
that you should be for 5, 10 years and blah, blah blah.

175
00:12:56,328 --> 00:13:00,971
But if there is news that comes up 
during the time you invested in a stock-

176
00:13:00,971 --> 00:13:08,080
-which shows that this company is not performing well 
and their profits are falling, they are losing money.

177
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,272
Why should you join a sinking ship for?

178
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,272
Then it's better for you to get rid of that sourdough.

179
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,135
That's usually how I think.

180
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:22,346
Then I prefer to hop on a boat or a train 
that goes and where the chance to make money is greater.

181
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:29,111
I also invest my money in something that I 
feel can give me more value for my investment.

182
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:34,555
Than I should have them in some sourdough 
that does not give me a return simply.

183
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,663
Tony Godlike Lindh.

184
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,071
Is it better to allocate an equal amount to funds 
or a large amount to a single fund?

185
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:50,413
Yes, you Tony. This is a good question. I myself prefer 
to do so so that I spread the amount among different funds.

186
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,431
Some funds that I think will 
go better, I have slightly larger amounts in.

187
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:02,195
And some others have slightly smaller amounts in 
which I might think is high risk and other things.

188
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
So it's different and it's from person to person.

189
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
You get to feel yourself, quite simply.

190
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,762
Erik Martinger.

191
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,042
When will the video come up?

192
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Now.

193
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:19,127
Ida Runn. I subscribe to Youtube, but still 
have not received a vacuum cleaner as you promised.

194
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,375
I wonder where it is?

195
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,411
Vacuum cleaner?

196
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,936
So now I have answered most of the questions 
and forgive me if I have not answered your particular question.

197
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,475
I've been getting a lot of crazy questions lately 
and I try to answer as much as possible.

198
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:45,640
I have an idea that we should run maybe this week's question 
or that I bring some of your viewer questions-

199
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,831
-and have them at the end of each video perhaps.

200
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
I think it might be a good idea.

201
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,901
Feel free to thumbs up if you like the idea 
or write a comment below.

202
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,583
Dare to introduce yourself in the 
comments field here on Youtube-

203
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,628
-or in our Facebook group.

204
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:06,495
It's incredibly fun when we build this small community, 
so we can learn from each other.

205
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,925
It's a lot of fun.

206
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:15,181
I get an awful lot of questions every day and it just grows 
every day and I get more and more messages-

207
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,879
-and I actually do not have time to answer everything.

208
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:26,518
Sometimes it can be that I answer and it is because I am kind, 
but preferably I wish that if you have private questions-

209
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:35,478
-either you can book a meeting with me 
for a fee for my time costs.

210
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:36,737
I have to pay my bills.

211
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,647
But otherwise it is so that I recommend 
instead to ask the question completely free in our Facebook group-

212
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,749
-so that others can take part of the knowledge.

213
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,135
But it can also be the case that others in the group 
can help you with just the answer to your question.

214
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,017
And I really appreciate when you others 
answer questions in our Facebook group.

215
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,553
So that I do not have to go in and answer everyone myself, 
because it takes an incredible amount of time from me.

216
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,270
We have more many good videos that will come and 
if you have tips on good videos, comment as well.

217
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
I hope you enjoyed this video too.

218
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
See you in the next. Have a nice day! Thanks.

219
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Bye.
