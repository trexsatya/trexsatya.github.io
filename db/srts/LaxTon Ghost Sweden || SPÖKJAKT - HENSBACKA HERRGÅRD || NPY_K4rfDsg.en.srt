1
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07.709
LTGS has now made it to Hensbacka Herrgård and to Munkedal.

2
00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:15,000
Tonight we will investigate this 1700s building and this is where we were a few months ago with Jocke, Jonna and other Youtubers.

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21.527
Then it happened a lot on the second floor, where we got this energy to be mapped up.

4
00:01:21,527 --> 00:01:27,582
We also had a lot of activity away in the stable building. So there are two places we will focus on tonight.

5
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:34,160
Today we are only four, so we will have a lot of sound recordings and try to monitor as much as we can in all the other rooms.

6
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:44.063
So join us on our paranormal journey through Sweden.

7
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:47,646
Ltgs goes from Borås to Munkedal, to the Hensbacka mansion, which is 2 km north of Uddevalla.

8
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:02,394
Wait I'm coming...

9
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:08,166
Check! It looks like someone is hanging, as if someone has been hanging out.

10
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09.361
Shit!

11
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:10,661
It's totally sick!

12
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:15,272
It's so damn scary!

13
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,938
After all, it is for the hell who is there.

14
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,757
It's so damn creepy.

15
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:21,550
Thanks!

16
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:29,174
Our previous experience with Hensbacka Herrgård was when we were there with Jocke & Jonna and conducted a joint ghost hunting.

17
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:39.840
It was a strong memory when the kinect mapped up a person hanging in one of the rooms that many have felt a great discomfort in.

18
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:47,089
Hensbacka Herrgård is located in a very old place, which goes back to 800 BC.

19
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:53,246
The site has been a settlement for over 10,000 years.

20
00:04:54,046 --> 00:05:00,000
It was precisely in this place that some of the very first people in Sweden settled down to hunt and fish.

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,560
And one can imagine that at that time the sea level was a few hundred meters closer to the place, called the hensback height.

22
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:25,009
During the 1600s, Hensbacka was a subordinate farm to Torre Säteri. Which was owned by the very wealthy Margareta Widfelt. Who owned large properties around the west coast.

23
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:33,822
Margareta was a very mythical woman and it is said that she is still haunting Hensbacka.

24
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:41,267
The current building was built in 1730 and was a private residence until the 1940s.

25
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:49,800
Then the Forestry Board bought the farm and Hensbacka became a forestry school for about fifty years.

26
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:56,983
It was a very suitable place for a forestry school with lots of woodlands surrounding the mansion.

27
00:05:57.304 --> 00:06:08.836
Today, Carina and Örjan own the farm and have for some time renovated both the manor and the hotel.

28
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:19,520
Among other things, it is said that someone has hung in one of the rooms. And that many feel a great feeling of discomfort in the room.

29
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:30,880
A Norwegian couple woke up in the middle of the night and has then panicked after feeling strangle in bed.

30
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,840
Step in the stairs and sound although no one is there, belong to the everyday life of the owners.

31
00:06:40,097 --> 00:06:51.605
The camera located in a cupboard in one of the rooms is said to move on itself. Likewise the doll sitting on a chair in the pool room.

32
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:58,249
But it is interesting for that folder just if something breaks these points, it must be a lot.

33
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:05,796
And that person is not on the floor then but really hangs in the air., It is incredible.

34
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:10.058
It becomes difficult to breathe immediately when you come in here.

35
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:13,626
Is it often the guests tell it? When they make this room sleep in?

36
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:14,430
Yes.

37
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,828
They know it too? Without saying anything?

38
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:28,854
We don't usually say anything. Without it depends on who it is that comes here. Many people like this, but those who do not know something usually tell us, that things happen in here.

39
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:32.065
You really know it immediately when you came in here.

40
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:41,764
If you want to guess and think that that person has taken his life here, if it is up here, do you think it is in this room?

41
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:48,875
Yes, they have shown that it should be here in one of the scrubs we have here.

42
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:54,922
In here it would be.

43
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:59.635
Here in the wardrobe?

44
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:06.467
It could very well be. There are plasterboard up there.

45
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:09.349
Is there any activity in there?

46
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:17,188
Here we also have a lot of activity. When we work in the kitchen down there we hear how someone goes up the stairs.

47
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:22,057
If you are several, you go and check, but no one is.

48
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:23,732
But you hear steps?

49
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,825
Yes, we hear that someone goes up the stairs.

50
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,793
Does it sound like it is coming up or down?

51
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:28,807
Down.

52
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,868
Who comes from here and goes down?

53
00:08:30,868 --> 00:08:36,299
Somehow so when I'm here a lot of things happen, I don't know if I might bring it with me.

54
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,638
It may be.

55
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:40,006
It may be that they are drawn to a person.

56
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:49,753
We have a lady here who is 93 years old, she was here last summer and left a gift to us. She has been a kitchen down here.

57
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:58,939
She has been working here since she was 16 years old and she tells a lot of things that happened, I don't remember everything right now though.

58
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:10,210
And she felt like she had had something with her and just so I feel too. But it is a positive feeling, not that hard.

59
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:15,770
But she also said that she feels that there is something negative here as well.

60
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:25,417
This positive feeling, do you know it on certain floors and the same with the negative? Because in that room here I feel negative.

61
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,711
It's negative.

62
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:32,767
And when I was down in the basement, I also thought it was a heavier energy.

63
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:39,612
It's probably more positive down there, because it feels like something is kidding with me there.

64
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:53,725
And we can sometimes hear that the radio is in the kitchen. I work alone very much and then I know that it is only me who is in the kitchen, if no other staff arrived in the evening.

65
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:57,381
There is no one who can start anything.

66
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:01,782
So things happen that you can't explain.

67
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:06,684
The stable out there, is it available?

68
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:08.019
Absolutely.

69
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:15,840
Because we were going to run one man sessions, where we go alone and then we just thought about the stable. There it happens a lot.

70
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,930
And all the horse people who have been with us say the same thing, that things happen there.

71
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,050
Good.

72
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,867
I have never experienced it myself, but they say so.

73
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:31,020
I had someone who took me on the butt here before.

74
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,267
Right!

75
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:36,367
When we just went through here, I thought it was Linda.

76
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:42,131
I don't know if you know anything about this yard, but this place is older than Birka.

77
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:48,675
So it is a very old place of residence.

78
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:56,274
This house was built in 1732, but then it was one floor. So it has built on gradually.

79
00:10:56,274 --> 00:11:05.408
I think we have a picture somewhere on before this house was built, from the 1600s. Then there was a small house here.

80
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:11,482
So this has been called a mansion since 1732?

81
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:17,471
Has it been family -owned that it was inherited?

82
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:30,000
In 1940 they sold it to forestry school. Before that, it was privately owned. Until we bought it, private.

83
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,861
Until the municipality sold it?

84
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:45,907
Yes, it was the Forest Conservation School's foundation that had it. They conducted forestry here. There was one in between who rented it for 10 years, then we bought it.

85
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:48,820
It was intended as a golf resort here.

86
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:54,233
And now you run hotels and conference?

87
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:58,668
Which starts now in May then?

88
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:01,475
Yes, then we reopen.

89
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:09.919
Then we are up in the pool room and here we have the doll on the chair, the one that is said to move and change style.

90
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:19,003
So we have brought with us three EMF pucks. They are very sensitive and they have a small lamp here that will shine blue if something comes close

91
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:25,056
or trying to touch it. So these we will place. We put one on the edge there.

92
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,226
We put the others there. Also one here too.

93
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:50,821
We put one more thing against this doll and it is our PMB, ie Paranormal Music Box. And this one has a sensor forward, so if it is broken we will hear it.

94
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:55,427
So we put it placed against the doll and activate it.

95
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:58,323
Now it will calibrate.

96
00:13:03,397 --> 00:13:09,399
So if something now passes here we will see it.

97
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:24,149
The pool balls usually move here on the table, so we have put them in a circle so we have control over them. And they are monitored by a surveillance camera that we sat high up.

98
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,439
Because then we get to know both the table and the doll.

99
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:33,231
And here we will place a paracope.

100
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:44,152
This one activates very easily and it goes static. Lamps will also light up if something comes close to it.

101
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:46,648
So we hope it will start tonight.

102
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:53,202
In this room we have placed our movement camera and it is aimed at the bed.

103
00:13:53,716 --> 00:14:01.001
We have no surveillance in the room so we rely completely on this camera, that it will foot if something moves in here.

104
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:12,450
Now we are in the room where we last got an old man who hung here. We got it via the kinect, so it's up and running.

105
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:19,703
We will also place a beltpod and it builds its own magnetic field, so if something comes close to it we will hear and see it.

106
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:25,343
We will place it in there, where we got the old man hanging up.

107
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:36,377
The surveillance, the kinect and the belt pod are now in a line here, so we get something and we will see it on the camera.

108
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:47,548
We have now placed some things on the second floor and now we will be up in the attic and place another paracope.

109
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:02.336
Is there a spider network here?

110
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,317
What did you say?

111
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:07.642
It felt like something was moving my forehead. Is there a spider network here?

112
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:09.662
Not what I see.

113
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:18,131
Cool. It felt like something caressed me over my forehead.

114
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:29,244
Now we will place our paracope here. There are some theories about where this person has been hanged, here is a place where you think.

115
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:33,564
So either down in the room or it is in this room.

116
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:39,048
That was a bit cool, it felt like someone took me on the forehead from the roof.

117
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:42,300
*scratch sound is heard from the downstairs*

118
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:44,564
*We think it is the girls who tape fixed cables*

119
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:52,105
But the parascop is placed here so if something moves here we hope we see it on it, and it is monitored by a camera behind Niclas.

120
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,470
"What was it that sounded?"

121
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59.707
It wasn't you? Because we heard it sounded down there.

122
00:15:59,707 --> 00:16:00.859
"It wasn't we"

123
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,143
We go down and check.

124
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:04,677
It sounded like something was tied.

125
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,954
Was this?

126
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:33,233
Wait..

127
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:40,618
We have to see if there is anyone here. Hello?

128
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,441
Is anybody here?

129
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:50,791
Check if it is open.

130
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52.961
Locked.

131
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:58,295
Cooling room, no one there.

132
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:03.708
The freezer room is definitely no one in.

133
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:14,030
Someone here?

134
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,962
Nothing.

135
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:45,640
What the hell was that? I thought you started tape.

136
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,921
I wrote up approximate time here.

137
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,780
I heard two such sounds before.

138
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,773
We also check the intermediate floor.

139
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,413
Down here you are in control if someone comes.

140
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05.816
Then they should have heard if someone has gone up.

141
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:10,761
Was it you now?

142
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:11,818
"No"

143
00:18:11,818 --> 00:18:14,166
Wasn't that the same sound?

144
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:18,015
It was!

145
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:18,751
It was me.

146
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:22,027
That was this sound huh?

147
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:23,024
"Yes!"

148
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:28,352
It is from here the stairs.

149
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:37,452
Yes you saw, we heard a sound and we thought the girls had started tape, because we always tape down the cables.

150
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:41,725
But we heard this sound.

151
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:52,156
From the stairs. Only we four are in here and me and the brother were at the top of the attic when we heard this. But it was heard very high.

152
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55.803
So!

153
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:58,273
"Exactly that sound it was"

154
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,156
"I've heard it twice before"

155
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:08.643
I've heard it twice before today. Once when I filmed interiors in the pool room, I said it on the camera so check it out.

156
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:13,758
Then I think it was when I passed by here.

157
00:19:14,015 --> 00:19:15,514
*Linda's recording of interiors*

158
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:21,652
*strange sounds like Linda hear*

159
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:30,000
Vafan was it for sound?

160
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:35,401
Is anybody here?

161
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:45,382
So we were in the stairwell on the back. And heard, if it is this sound ...

162
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:49,737
For it sounded exactly as if you were pulling out tape

163
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:59,502
I was pure luck because I pulled my foot on the stairs when I went up. I did this ..

164
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:05.082
I dragged my foot. And then everyone reacted to the sound, that it was the same.

165
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:20,507
Think about it, the steps here have heard. And it is not so far from our surveillance center, so we will most likely hear it in real time.

166
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:27,274
I'm just going to double check so no one is up here. We should be completely ourselves here.

167
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:32.069
Someone here?

168
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:35,994
No one in here?

169
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:45,760
Interesting, we have just started, set up all the equipment and got this sound from the stairs.

170
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,654
It really sounded like someone dragged their feet behind.

171
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:55,342
We will place our PMB too, so we go down.

172
00:20:56,306 --> 00:21:04.731
I got an idea. After all, we can sacrifice a belt and put it on the stairs, where we heard the sound.

173
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:09.863
There is a bench down there, so we put it there. We will hear it from supervised ice cream.

174
00:21:09,863 --> 00:21:15,000
Because we are quite close to that sound. Topping idea!

175
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,194
Then we place a beltpod in the stairs where we think we heard that sound. So we activate it.

176
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:41,364
We also place our PMB Pro down here. We have activated the radar, Movement, so it will feel vibration in case someone goes here. We have EMF and temperature.

177
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:51,837
So now we have everything started, so something happens in here and we will notice it and it is monitored by a camera that is there.

178
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:53,867
We start it.

179
00:21:57,207 --> 00:22:07,724
Then the darkness has settled over Hensbacka Herrgård and we will go to the stable and make an EMF sweep. Then we will move to the large building as well.

180
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:09,285
Let's go.

181
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:19,180
It was here that Danjal said it was like someone was holding the door, it was not possible to get out of here.

182
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,414
It is locked now.

183
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:27,748
We had a lot of stones that were thrown here too.

184
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:49,002
We will try to run one man sessions here. We place a chair and we have a camera here. So you have to be just yourself.

185
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:53,727
See if we can get in touch with something.

186
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,700
Hell be steep.

187
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:02.908
What is going on?

188
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04.745
“PMB”

189
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06.749
Does it play?

190
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:09.003
"Yes, we got a great shape with"

191
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:11,851
Okay, we're ready in the attic just so we'll.

192
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:17,162
Are you still there?

193
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:24,189
I don't know if you see us, but Linda and I sit here at the surveillance with Carina.

194
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:29.590
And PMB starts playing completely crazy in there.

195
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:34,748
Now it became completely quiet here. It's just us girls here too, we're terrified.

196
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:44,126
Now it stopped.

197
00:24:51,385 --> 00:24:53,519
It's crazy.

198
00:24:54,033 --> 00:25:03.341
And all this happened when the guys are in the stable and film EMF Svep.

199
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:08.833
As soon as they went, the worst thing became here, when we just have girls left.

200
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:19,928
We are still here in the stable and run EMF Svepet and the girls have full activity away at Herrgården. They say that PMB is playing and that they thought they saw a shape.

201
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:24,871
So we have to run this clearly pretty quickly, then we go over there.

202
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,006
My head hurts..

203
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,994
Stop.

204
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:53,236
Did you hear the sound?

205
00:25:53,236 --> 00:25:54,039
Yes.

206
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,462
Can you make that sound again?

207
00:25:57,462 --> 00:26:01.663
*No sound was recorded*

208
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:18,869
What you see in front of the camera is a lot of dust particles that go around. There is a lot of hay here that pulls up a lot of things when we go, so there is nothing else.

209
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:36,690
Then we are ready here in the stable, no EMF hits, so we go over to Herrgården.

210
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:47,831
As soon as you left, PMB started flashing.

211
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:50,128
It played all the time.

212
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:55.557
It played and it flashed.

213
00:26:57,484 --> 00:27:01.927
Then I did not find focus and then the camera died.

214
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:05.845
There was no battery in it.

215
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:07,590
After all, it has been charging.

216
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09.808
It just touched.

217
00:27:09.808 --> 00:27:11,061
It's great.

218
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:19,790
And then when I was standing here in the hall, then it played almost the whole song. So Linda and I took the Pro camera and tried to light up.

219
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,861
Then it stopped completely and I thought it was the battery, so I went ahead, but then it played.

220
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:32,145
Then we have heard some knocks that are recurring.

221
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:40,175
Is it the girl who is here? If you want to cuddle with us then blink twice and then a blink first came and then again.

222
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:43,454
So it was like it was confirmed.

223
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:55,987
Then we run our EMF swipe and we start here on the ground floor and we have had a lot of activity here in the large room where PMB is so we try there.

224
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:46,091
There we have an power plant. Very strong EMF.

225
00:28:54,698 --> 00:29:00,000
Then we go up on the second floor.

226
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:37,513
It smells..

227
00:29:37,513 --> 00:29:39,452
Perfume.

228
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:42,315
Yes it does.

229
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:43,949
Strong perfume scent in here.

230
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,225
Fruity.

231
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:47,222
It can be here.

232
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:51,729
No, it smells of nothing.

233
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:54,974
It smells of female perfume.

234
00:30:14,243 --> 00:30:19,615
Now we are at the top of the third floor and will be looking through here.

235
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:26,190
Someone here?

236
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,896
*EVP is recorded*

237
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:30,325
"No"

238
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:49,529
We also go in and run an EMF swipe in the hotel building.

239
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:52,410
*EVP is recorded*

240
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:58,240
I heard a voice.

241
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,714
"Hello"

242
00:31:06,495 --> 00:31:09.342
Hello?!

243
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,409
Hello?!

244
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,561
*bang upstairs*

245
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:19,359
Battle up there.

246
00:31:22,635 --> 00:31:25,012
I am completely 100 that I heard a voice.

247
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:26,133
What did it say?

248
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:30,310
In the right ear.

249
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,581
We have to check it out.

250
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:46,576
As you can see, they are renovating here so that's why it looks a bit messy here. And it can in itself be good because then the activity tends to increase.

251
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:50,691
So we'll see if anyone is with us now.

252
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:22,832
We are checking. What was that?

253
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:26,585
*respiratory sound*

254
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:42,823
We have to focus more in the corridor here because we cannot go into all rooms for the floor are not laid. It can be floating putty. So we stay here and go up one floor later.

255
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:56,792
We go up on the second floor and continue our EMF sweep there.

256
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:59,220
Are we in the suite?

257
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:04,134
What pressure in my head I got.

258
00:33:05,676 --> 00:33:07,200
It almost hit the ears.

259
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09.165
I also know it, a damn pressure.

260
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:10,657
Hell..

261
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:15,000
I felt something on my hand.

262
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,939
EMF did not react or?

263
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:18,610
No.

264
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:11,245
Now we have made EMF swipe in all three buildings, ie the stable, the hotel and here in the manor. We did not go any rash on any of the meters.

265
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:17,413
It is good in itself, because if we get a rash tonight it is something completely different that we manage to capture.

266
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:24,211
Parascope on floor three so now the guys are going up there. Bring your camera, it's on rec.

267
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,932
Does it shine?

268
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,526
Who do we have here?

269
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:12,034
Is anyone here?

270
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:17,841
It goes strongly there now.

271
00:35:23,943 --> 00:35:28,952
Get closer to me again.

272
00:35:39,486 --> 00:35:52,980
Every time we have come up, it has been here somewhere. And when we come up and come from this direction and should try to communicate, then it sticks down the stairs.

273
00:35:54,008 --> 00:36:05.428
When we placed this one we put that one first, up on the railing.

274
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:13,235
And then some sound heard down from. So it seems to be an active line, I have shudder on my arm.

275
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:17,272
I don't know why the hair gets up, just on the left arm.

276
00:36:17,272 --> 00:36:18,798
I see it.

277
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:22,200
Now it starts to decline.

278
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:33,653
So I think we should continue to stand here for a while. We will run the communication tool and see if we can get in touch.

279
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:43,243
Because it has started now, we have heard sound down from. So we'll see who it is now, if it is the little girl, who wants to come up to us.

280
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,889
Is there anyone down there?

281
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:52,287
Can you make a loud sound?

282
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,227
My name is Niclas and this is my brother Tony.

283
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:04,767
I go around trying to communicate with those like you, who remain in these places.

284
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:09.813
You may come up to us and say exactly what you want.

285
00:37:10,455 --> 00:37:18,611
I say it to all the seconds who are here, everyone who has to do with this farm. Come up to us now and talk to us here.

286
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:29,673
This decides nothing,

287
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:39,019
Can you say who you are?

288
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:44,579
Could you say your name?

289
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:52.882
There is a door here that is a bit open, could you open it?

290
00:38:01,874 --> 00:38:07.020
Can I hear a sound down by the stairs again? If you're there.

291
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:11,998
Pull your feet ...

292
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,662
“Working hard”

293
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,052
It was loud.

294
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:22.567
I'll ask a question, can I find out how old you were when you went over to the other side?

295
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,931
Can you give me your age?

296
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:25,775
“29”

297
00:38:25,775 --> 00:38:30,000
29. Thanks!

298
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:35,736
Shudder on the right arm.

299
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:43,946
Have you been hanging out in this room?

300
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:51,050
Why have you been hanging out here?

301
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:57,464
We are moving now.

302
00:38:59,648 --> 00:39:08,404
We are running a communication tool now and we had to run up here because of the parascop. After all, we wanted to communicate directly with what was in front of it.

303
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:13,582
So we are now moving to another room.

304
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:17,490
Should we sit down here?

305
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,773
Now I'm sitting here. Me and mine...

306
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:24,374
Do we have a woman here?

307
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:31,505
What I thought she said huh "was"

308
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,274
Are you stuck in this house?

309
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:47,450
“Shoot them”

310
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:51.988
Are you stuck in this house? At this mansion.

311
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:53,572
*sounds from the stairs*

312
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:56,928
Battle behind us.

313
00:39:58,084 --> 00:40:03.095
Are you down there in the stairs now?

314
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:13,964
Come up the stairs in that case so we will see you. Or walk up the stairs and we will hear you.

315
00:40:16,276 --> 00:40:21,149
We will move now. Do you want to drive a little Tony or should I continue?

316
00:40:21,149 --> 00:40:22,912
We can switch. I can take the next floor.

317
00:40:22,912 --> 00:40:25,604
And so we see if Tony can also have good contact.

318
00:40:25,604 --> 00:40:32,911
Now that I sit and try to communicate I get no clear words, you almost have to guess what it says.

319
00:40:33,425 --> 00:40:38,199
Nothing that has made this blink either.

320
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,511
So we will move down the stairs now. We'll see if something comes with us.

321
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:52,614
We continue to walk around. Niclas and I are now taking the second floor. We run communication here as well.

322
00:40:54,156 --> 00:41:00,000
If someone is on this floor ..

323
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,179
So you have to talk to us.

324
00:41:03,179 --> 00:41:06,524
Would you be able to come to us here?

325
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:11,317
If it's your presence here, could we see you too?

326
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:15,511
"Do you remember who?"

327
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:17,178
It was an unpleasant voice.

328
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:18,848
Do you remember?

329
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,306
It was here that it was that unpleasant voice. Just where we are actually standing, last.

330
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:28,326
The hair on the arms stands straight up as well.

331
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:33,584
The energy that is there, that man because I think I hear a man ..

332
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:39,685
Could you say your name? Or show you in front of us.

333
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:44,670
"Scare"

334
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:48,735
Take my arm.

335
00:41:48,735 --> 00:41:53,294
Push me.

336
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:58,999
Close that door in front of us.

337
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:06,100
Can you do it?

338
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:15,000
Move these pool balls for example.

339
00:42:15,514 --> 00:42:18,614
Can you do it?

340
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:25,048
You can throw this doll from the chair or change places.

341
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:31,869
The owners say that that doll usually changes place. And sit in the other armchair.

342
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,448
Can you do it for us?

343
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:35,855
It feels like a wind ...

344
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:36,987
"No!"

345
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,132
No?

346
00:42:39,132 --> 00:42:41,177
Why not?

347
00:42:41,177 --> 00:42:47,940
Do you know that? It came in cold from the left side. And it said no when I asked it to move it.

348
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,887
"Yes!"

349
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:54,217
No and yes.

350
00:42:54,217 --> 00:42:56,040
Thanks!

351
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,617
Both no and yes. Can you do it now?

352
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:04,400
Would you be able to move that doll? So we'll see it.

353
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08.713
Can't you do it for us?

354
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:18,259
Or do you play with us? Says yes and no.

355
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:22,434
I got dizziness in this room.

356
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:25,167
I can say this, yes or no we have never received.

357
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:28,099
Never got yes or no.

358
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:32,697
Now come here and move something in here.

359
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:41,714
You can choose between the pool balls here, the doll or stir it in the middle and it will light up for us.

360
00:43:46,146 --> 00:43:49,327
You can pass there if you want.

361
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:55.228
Or just make a loud noise. Close a door or stomp in the floor.

362
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:02.923
We move on to the next room.

363
00:44:04,624 --> 00:44:07.738
It was awesome, yes and no.

364
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:19,831
Bang. Extreme bang. Were you girls?

365
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:22,466
"No we heard nothing"

366
00:44:31,523 --> 00:44:33,107
It was a real bang.

367
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:34,365
Did you hear it from here?

368
00:44:34,365 --> 00:44:36,855
Yes, somewhere here.

369
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,951
Is anyone here?

370
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,148
Didn't you hear that?

371
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:46,737
No.

372
00:44:46,737 --> 00:44:49,823
I sat so close to the speaker.

373
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:54.806
Girls, you hear me now, open the door because you miss all the bangs here.

374
00:44:54,806 --> 00:44:56.648
*sound is recorded*

375
00:44:56,648 --> 00:45:00,270
Back here again. It's here.

376
00:45:01,105 --> 00:45:04,078
Where does that sound come from?

377
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:08,145
Can you do it again?

378
00:45:10,072 --> 00:45:12,138
Here I really shudder.

379
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:16,903
Where does that sound come from?

380
00:45:17,288 --> 00:45:20,507
Can you do it again for us?

381
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:26,609
I went into the lamp behind ..

382
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:32,250
I asked for loud sound ..

383
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,332
Yes and we got that ..

384
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:38,906
When we sat there, this was so small. And now we know it's in the stairs.

385
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:42,583
Somewhere in the stairs. So this is the second time now.

386
00:45:42,968 --> 00:45:49,475
Now we stand here by the stairs, somewhere here it hits.

387
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:55.245
I asked for a loud sound. And now I've got two bangs here on the stairs.

388
00:45:55,695 --> 00:46:04,165
So we'll probably stay here a little neighbor and hear if there is something that goes on this stairs.

389
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,247
Should we try to go back?

390
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:25,059
Who is here with us?

391
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:28,003
Can we have your name?

392
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:40,753
So we can play. If it is the little girl who is here, you have been playing with children here before, could you come here?

393
00:46:40,753 --> 00:46:46,035
You can play on the piano a bit or go to this meter.

394
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:49,552
The green lamp that glows there, can you go to it?

395
00:46:49,552 --> 00:46:51,578
"The room"

396
00:46:51,578 --> 00:46:54,437
The room.

397
00:46:55,978 --> 00:47:02.492
Come to this room. Don't know which room you are in?

398
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:06.011
Stir Niclas while standing there.

399
00:47:06,011 --> 00:47:08,551
I put my arm out here.

400
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:14,520
I stand against this doorway. I'll stand a little further in.

401
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:22,870
Stir him on his back as he stands there.

402
00:47:28,523 --> 00:47:32,684
Push me if you can.

403
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,458
I turn this off so it gets quiet here.

404
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,349
I'm standing here.

405
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:50,190
Make a sound. An optional sound.

406
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,372
In which direction we should go.

407
00:47:55,684 --> 00:47:57.882
It's out at the stairs.

408
00:47:57,882 --> 00:48:02.023
We have to go there. This is the third time now it is hitting at the stairs.

409
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,691
Did you get a name?

410
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:27,823
Is your name Anna? Is it a woman in the stairs here?

411
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,000
"Perfect"

412
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,383
Perfect.

413
00:48:32,383 --> 00:48:34,890
Okay thanks!

414
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:37,947
Have you worked here Anna?

415
00:48:43,792 --> 00:48:45,765
I think it feels a little cooler in here.

416
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:49,405
Yes it does.

417
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:56,316
Anna? Have you worked at this mansion?

418
00:48:57,215 --> 00:49:01,795
Or have you lived at this mansion?

419
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:09,324
Should we move on here? We haven't been here.

420
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:12.605
Join us Anna, if you are here.

421
00:49:14,532 --> 00:49:19,312
Here, many have felt a presence.

422
00:49:19,697 --> 00:49:23,085
Would you be able to come here?

423
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:34,634
We are going to sleep in this room.

424
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:39,716
Or some of us, maybe Niclas and Sofia sleep here.

425
00:49:39,716 --> 00:49:43,274
You may have to awaken them late in the morning.

426
00:49:44,173 --> 00:49:52.238
Make a sound here or tear off their quilt.

427
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:54,715
I think we move on to the other room.

428
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:57,240
Now we go to this room where we last got ..

429
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,962
*EVP is recorded*

430
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:04,124
What was mapped up here.

431
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:12.545
There was a scent when I came in here. do you feel anything?

432
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:16,059
Well, old ..

433
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:17,616
Tar!

434
00:50:17,616 --> 00:50:19,342
Does not it?

435
00:50:20,627 --> 00:50:26,373
Can anyone come and stand with me in here?

436
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,392
*knocks*

437
00:50:30,392 --> 00:50:36,382
If anyone is here, put you behind me.

438
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:43.565
You may touch me.

439
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:49.808
Push me into the closet.

440
00:50:53,854 --> 00:50:58.908
It feels like the neck hair is standing straight up ..

441
00:50:59,615 --> 00:51:08.091
If there is someone behind here, can you get enough energy so we can see you?

442
00:51:08,091 --> 00:51:09.867
Presence.

443
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:14,488
I have a lot of shivers on my back and neck, but I feel nothing forward ..

444
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,917
"He"

445
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,286
Does anyone have taken their life here?

446
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:25,342
In this place.

447
00:51:25,342 --> 00:51:30,000
And if so, why did you do it?

448
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,714
Want to tell us that?

449
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:41,414
Show yourself there at the chair now you are kind.

450
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:56.662
Then we end this session. We have run both the wind and the second floor. We have received a lot of interesting answers that we have to listen through later.

451
00:51:56,662 --> 00:52:01,156
And a lot of activity in the stairs behind us. We also got some name.

452
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:09,182
Now we change and send the girls away. They may take the ground floor.

453
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:15,000
Now we girls will go into the dining room.

454
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:22,978
Where we previously had a lot of activity with PMB and the ball. So let's see if we can communicate with anyone.

455
00:52:23,556 --> 00:52:27,146
Now we are here.

456
00:52:27,146 --> 00:52:33,712
I Sofia, Linda and Carina, as you probably know.

457
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:38.711
Is there anyone here who wants to talk to us?

458
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:42,643
*rash pmb*

459
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:51,960
You are welcome to come here and play for us again.

460
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,472
Can you tell us who you are?

461
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:14,443
"Children"

462
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:18,627
"Children"

463
00:53:22,288 --> 00:53:26,550
It's hard to hear.

464
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:34,215
"Children"

465
00:53:35,564 --> 00:53:39,695
I thought it said children.

466
00:53:43,035 --> 00:53:48,365
Are there any children here? So how many?

467
00:53:51,705 --> 00:54:02,153
Is it something you want to say to us or to Carina that goes here daily? She usually senses and hears you.

468
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:13,218
It is a finely newly lacquered floor here, can you not put past here quickly?

469
00:54:13,218 --> 00:54:16,721
"How?"

470
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:34,601
Can you blink on it again? On our little manic there on the floor.

471
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:42,886
If you're here, can you get the lamp to shine again?

472
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:53,602
*high bang*

473
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:56,507
What kind of sound was that?

474
00:54:56,507 --> 00:54:58,459
"It was from the stairs"

475
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:00,972
Yes, we heard it.

476
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:08,582
Above us.

477
00:55:12,307 --> 00:55:19,230
It might be a sign. We have to get up then. Although it feels a bit uncomfortable.

478
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,635
Let's move on.

479
00:55:20,635 --> 00:55:23,016
Then we end here, thank you so much. So we continue upwards.

480
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,649
"Oh no"

481
00:55:25,649 --> 00:55:29,479
Huh? Go..? What did he say?

482
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:35,017
Can you say it again?

483
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:50,032
Now I sit down here.

484
00:55:56,005 --> 00:55:59,032
This does not feel fresh.

485
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:11,974
It feels like I got very dizzy here.

486
00:56:13,387 --> 00:56:16,132
Are you giving me this feeling?

487
00:56:16,132 --> 00:56:19,845
"Same me"

488
00:56:20,616 --> 00:56:25,664
Then we thank you. We finish here.

489
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:31,357
"Lillan"

490
00:56:32,128 --> 00:56:35,697
Lillan! Yes the little one is here in the yard.

491
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:40,770
I am also called the little one.

492
00:56:41,284 --> 00:56:43,120
Be awesome.

493
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,868
What's your name?

494
00:56:52,327 --> 00:56:58,029
I really got really dizzy in there ..

495
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:07.804
We move on then.

496
00:57:08,511 --> 00:57:10.038
Could you say your name?

497
00:57:12,736 --> 00:57:14,655
!

498
00:57:14,655 --> 00:57:17,853
Tony said it!

499
00:57:17,853 --> 00:57:19,225
"True"

500
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,069
Fy I now shudder all over my body!

501
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,078
Yes Tony is sitting down there.

502
00:57:34,812 --> 00:57:41,369
It's strange, all energies and others want to talk to Tony. It's something special.

503
00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:46,586
We'll send him up just as soon.

504
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,965
*EVP is recorded*

505
00:57:51,415 --> 00:57:52,856
What was that?

506
00:57:53,691 --> 00:57:56.845
"Protect me!"

507
00:57:56,845 --> 00:57:58,457
Did you also hear that sound?

508
00:57:58,457 --> 00:57:59.886
Yes, did you hear that?

509
00:57:59,886 --> 00:58:00.837
What was that?

510
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:02,160
It sounded like it was up here.

511
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,632
Yes, behind you!

512
00:58:03,632 --> 00:58:05.735
It was an EVP.

513
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:07,596
Is that what you want to say Tony?

514
00:58:07,596 --> 00:58:11,059
Oh five ..!

515
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:16,929
It was just like I saw something in my eye when I was standing here.

516
00:58:17,314 --> 00:58:21,872
Something just fluttered by.

517
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:29,225
We go into the pool room here then. Here, things have.

518
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:37,480
If you see this round thing on the table ..

519
00:58:38,379 --> 00:58:45,000
If you go against it, it will start to shine with lots of lamps.

520
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:56,585
Do you want us to send Tony?

521
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:07,396
Because it doesn't seem like you want to communicate with us.

522
00:59:10,543 --> 00:59:12,877
No, but then we thank you.

523
00:59:12,877 --> 00:59:15,844
Thanks so much!

524
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,235
It wants to go with you Tony.

525
00:59:19,235 --> 00:59:19,925
Huh?

526
00:59:19,925 --> 00:59:22,456
It wants to go with you.

527
00:59:22,456 --> 00:59:24,516
Tony, it said.

528
00:59:24,516 --> 00:59:26,931
We got the little one. I am called the little one.

529
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,615
Well, did you get the little one too?

530
00:59:29,615 --> 00:59:38,282
Now the girls have been up and running some communication, with something that said Tony.

531
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:40,999
And the little one. As you are called?

532
00:59:40,999 --> 00:59:42.808
Yes, I'm called Lillan.

533
00:59:43,193 --> 00:59:54,406
So we're going to go up and run a spirit box now. We will see if we can communicate more. So let's see if anyone wants to say what it wants you Tony.

534
00:59:54,406 --> 00:59:57,113
We go up to the wind and start there.

535
00:59:57,434 --> 01:00:08,110
Now we are up in the attic and we will run a spirit box here. We have had sounds here in the stairs before, even in the other stairs there.

536
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,858
And we have had activity on that one.

537
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:16,490
So we start here and go down. With spirit box.

538
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:20,217
So I start it.

539
01:00:20,602 --> 01:00:24,873
Is there anyone here who usually goes on this staircase?

540
01:00:24,873 --> 01:00:26,722
"I"

541
01:00:28,006 --> 01:00:29.805
Two me.

542
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:33,395
Is it a man or woman?

543
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:36,827
"MAN"

544
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:38,755
MAN.

545
01:00:38,755 --> 01:00:40,026
"No!"

546
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:48.045
Is Staffan left here? If it is Staffan we talk to ..

547
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:53.503
Or was there someone else we talked to?

548
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,550
It sounded like a bang.

549
01:01:00,922 --> 01:01:05.092
Can you come up for this staircase and talk to us?

550
01:01:08,817 --> 01:01:11,990
“Yeah”

551
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:15,342
"I go"

552
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:19,298
"Come here"

553
01:01:19,298 --> 01:01:21,566
"No"

554
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,369
Can you say your name to us?

555
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:25,557
"No"

556
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:30,494
Have you been hanging out in this room?

557
01:01:32,935 --> 01:01:36,547
I will open there where we think it has happened.

558
01:01:40,465 --> 01:01:42,312
Are you in here?

559
01:01:42,312 --> 01:01:44.016
"I'm here"

560
01:01:44,016 --> 01:01:45,394
Did you hear that?

561
01:01:45,394 --> 01:01:46,401
I'm here.

562
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:49,985
Go into that room Nicke.

563
01:01:53,518 --> 01:01:56,984
Return the door when he is in there.

564
01:01:57,434 --> 01:02:00,293
Are you here?

565
01:02:03,248 --> 01:02:07,155
Can you close this door?

566
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,246
Let it be so.

567
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,624
I think we pause there.

568
01:02:26,028 --> 01:02:31,626
I thought it sounded like Tony. Did you say Tony again?

569
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:38,424
"I want.."

570
01:02:38,424 --> 01:02:40,140
“Tony”

571
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,880
I want to, Tony.

572
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:45,075
What do you want from me?

573
01:02:58,178 --> 01:03:01.451
My hair on my arm has risen, I don't know why.

574
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,249
It's colder on my back ..

575
01:03:04,249 --> 01:03:05,584
Is it colder on the back?

576
01:03:06.098 --> 01:03:07.445
"You"

577
01:03:07,445 --> 01:03:09.391
Are you affecting us right now?

578
01:03:11,484 --> 01:03:13,063
I also feel it.

579
01:03:14,026 --> 01:03:17,202
Set up the meter there and we'll see if we have anything.

580
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:22,858
Nothing on it.

581
01:03:24,078 --> 01:03:26,015
It's like I went into a field.

582
01:03:27,749 --> 01:03:31,275
Did we go near you now? You who usually be here?

583
01:03:33,073 --> 01:03:36,812
Is it a small child who is usually up here?

584
01:03:40,473 --> 01:03:43,212
"So"

585
01:03:43,983 --> 01:03:48.806
Can you tap this door for me?

586
01:03:48,806 --> 01:03:51,490
"Come in"

587
01:03:52.068 --> 01:03:55.219
I thought it said came ..

588
01:03:56,439 --> 01:03:59,854
We continue down, huh?

589
01:04:03,452 --> 01:04:06.318
"Shut up on you"

590
01:04:09,878 --> 01:04:11,447
*child scream*

591
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,801
Want to talk to Tony?

592
01:04:29,602 --> 01:04:31,281
Do you know anything here?

593
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:35,753
I feel the same shudder again.

594
01:04:35,753 --> 01:04:36,757
Right here.

595
01:04:36,757 --> 01:04:39.035
Yes, right here I rush again.

596
01:04:39,035 --> 01:04:41,729
Who is here?

597
01:04:47,959 --> 01:04:49,586
Do you see anything on my wrist?

598
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:51,597
No..

599
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00.876
It felt like it was something that caressed me just.

600
01:05:02,225 --> 01:05:08,634
We will move on now and around the strap here the rooms. You got "Tony" in that room huh?

601
01:05:08,634 --> 01:05:10,297
Yes and inside.

602
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12.408
So we'll go there now.

603
01:05:14,399 --> 01:05:17,340
Are you usually moving on this camera?

604
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,004
"Yes"

605
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:24,703
Who is usually moving this camera? Can you say the name of that person?

606
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:33,988
We get to listen to it in the analysis, but it sounded like it said a name.

607
01:05:36,385 --> 01:05:37,883
"Oops"

608
01:05:37,883 --> 01:05:41,240
I went into the table.

609
01:05:42,846 --> 01:05:43,949
"Be found"

610
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:44.741
"Do you think?"

611
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,333
"Yes"

612
01:05:48,388 --> 01:05:51,753
Can you come in to us? Now Tony is here.

613
01:05:51,753 --> 01:05:52.982
"I want"

614
01:05:54,074 --> 01:05:55.457
"Well"

615
01:05:55,457 --> 01:05:57.627
Well

616
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:05,110
Now Tony is here, do you want to say something to Tony?

617
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,177
I'm standing here.

618
01:06:10,682 --> 01:06:13,500
I stay this one.

619
01:06:14,528 --> 01:06:18,885
Now you and I change, and we will see if we can get communication.

620
01:06:18,885 --> 01:06:22,122
We have changed so now I will try spirit box.

621
01:06:22,122 --> 01:06:29,151
But before that, I want to check, if someone is here, someone shouted my name before ..

622
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:33,504
Can you light up one of the lights that are on the table?

623
01:06:33,504 --> 01:06:41,502
If you can't move on a bullet, can you get one of the lights to shine? So I know you are here with us.

624
01:06:47,026 --> 01:06:50,882
You said my name before ..

625
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,460
"Yes"

626
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,700
Can you say any of our names here?

627
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:03.465
"NO"

628
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:10,460
I shudder a little on my arms.

629
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:13,700
Do you want us to leave this room?

630
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,033
"No"

631
01:07:19,987 --> 01:07:22,470
Wait, what happened? ”

632
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:23,964
Someone took me by my hand.

633
01:07:23,964 --> 01:07:24,626
Huh?

634
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:25,993
Someone took me by my hand.

635
01:07:25,993 --> 01:07:26,988
"I took"

636
01:07:26,988 --> 01:07:28,528
Turn off. What did you say?

637
01:07:28,528 --> 01:07:30,422
Someone took me on my hand here.

638
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,928
Yes, I saw that you were reacting.

639
01:07:37,103 --> 01:07:38,847
How scared I was.

640
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:40,760
It was like someone took you in your hand?

641
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,613
Yes, who took this on the hand ..

642
01:07:42,613 --> 01:07:44,264
Did the hand caress?

643
01:07:44,264 --> 01:07:49,197
It was about what I felt, though I knew someone who pulled me on my wrist, out there.

644
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:53,770
On the outside of the hand like this ..

645
01:07:57,174 --> 01:07:58,748
Ask if anyone did it.

646
01:07:58,748 --> 01:08:00.385
Was anyone taking ..

647
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:02.997
"Well

648
01:08:05,695 --> 01:08:08,273
My name is Tony, what is your name?

649
01:08:08,273 --> 01:08:10,102
"Go"

650
01:08:13,378 --> 01:08:13,878
What is it?

651
01:08:13,878 --> 01:08:15,981
It sticks on my back.

652
01:08:19,385 --> 01:08:24,411
Now many people feel physical touch here and it is good. Thanks for that!

653
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:25,896
Ask if it is the ones who do it.

654
01:08:25,896 --> 01:08:28,653
Are you doing it?

655
01:08:35,718 --> 01:08:41,018
Can anyone come in to us here and talk to us properly?

656
01:08:41,018 --> 01:08:41,838
"Yes"

657
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:44,875
It was a small child.

658
01:08:46,481 --> 01:08:47,997
Do we have a little girl with us here?

659
01:08:47,997 --> 01:08:49,974
"That's me"

660
01:08:52,055 --> 01:08:54,585
It's far behind ..

661
01:08:54,585 --> 01:08:58.665
Can the little girl say her name?

662
01:09:05,217 --> 01:09:09.351
Were you recently touched?

663
01:09:09,351 --> 01:09:10,491
"Yes"

664
01:09:12,225 --> 01:09:14,374
Could you say what your name is?

665
01:09:14,374 --> 01:09:19,257
If you are with us here, can you say your name?

666
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:30,000
Will you show up for us tonight?

667
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:35,890
"If you like"

668
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:38,663
It sounded like, if you want.

669
01:09:39,177 --> 01:09:45,000
We will change rooms. And of course we want to. Join us out here.

670
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:50,194
Here is the piano that you have heard play.

671
01:09:52,634 --> 01:09:56.009
Is anyone here with us?

672
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:07.027
Surely there was a little girl we had with us? It sounded like a little girl.

673
01:10:08,633 --> 01:10:11,139
Ask if she can come out and be with us here.

674
01:10:11,139 --> 01:10:12,720
"Here"

675
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,121
She said here.

676
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:21,988
Can you play on this piano?

677
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:23,338
My pulse went up here.

678
01:10:23,338 --> 01:10:24,489
What then?

679
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:27,281
"Here"

680
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:36,918
Here. So look at that clip then, it felt like something went straight through me.

681
01:10:36,918 --> 01:10:38,070
Well?

682
01:10:46,292 --> 01:10:50,882
Damn what strange. The hair on the arms stands straight up.

683
01:10:50,882 --> 01:10:53,190
It was like something just passed.

684
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:54,592
Ask if they did.

685
01:10:54,849 --> 01:10:55,758
"Yes"

686
01:10:55,758 --> 01:10:59,550
Who did it? Was it you the girl?

687
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:00,457
"Yes"

688
01:11:03,219 --> 01:11:05.882
That was odd. I've never been to it before.

689
01:11:05,882 --> 01:11:09.131
I saw that you reacted, I thought you jumped off the sound that came through.

690
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:15,000
No not the sound. There was something else like ... I don't know what it was.

691
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,426
Thanks for that!

692
01:11:16,426 --> 01:11:22,939
Tony, stand a little more in the middle there. Because there is that passage.

693
01:11:22,939 --> 01:11:28,297
Can you do it again? I thought it felt like someone was passing me.

694
01:11:28,297 --> 01:11:33,026
I've never felt that way before. Can you do it again?

695
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:42,673
It feels very great here in the neck.

696
01:11:46,784 --> 01:11:49,994
Is it okay for me to stand here? I know you.

697
01:11:55,839 --> 01:11:58,143
"Do you?"

698
01:12:04,759 --> 01:12:08.600
Should we go into the next room too?

699
01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11,708
Is there anyone in here?

700
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:14,559
"I am"

701
01:12:17,064 --> 01:12:19,794
Do you want us to leave this room?

702
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:21,820
"Yes"

703
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24.931
"Go"

704
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:29,108
"Laxton"

705
01:12:31,332 --> 01:12:33,493
Ask if we should get out to the stable.

706
01:12:36,492 --> 01:12:38,335
So did you want?

707
01:12:38,335 --> 01:12:42,208
Yes we want to get out to the stable if it's okay for you.

708
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:49,184
Can all energies gather there?

709
01:12:54,066 --> 01:12:55,869
"Come then"

710
01:12:55,869 --> 01:13:00,000
We end here and we will get there.

711
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01.185
Thanks!

712
01:13:03,562 --> 01:13:11,194
We have run Spiritbox here on the second floor. We got some interesting things that will surely find more of in our analysis later.

713
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:20,697
Now Linda and I go to the stable building. Where we will try to run some one man sessions as well.

714
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:27,855
So we set up and then I leave Linda there or if I become myself, we will see.

715
01:13:27,855 --> 01:13:29,541
So join us there.

716
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:43,587
When we were standing in the pool room, I feel that someone pulled their hand over mine. I was completely stiff, I didn't know where to go.

717
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48.605
Then any of you felt something, it was you?

718
01:13:48,605 --> 01:13:50,674
It was me.

719
01:13:50,674 --> 01:13:51.845
In the same room.

720
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:57,618
I've never had such ailments as I have now.

721
01:13:57,618 --> 01:14:02.856
I have back pain, I have spasms on one side of my stomach. I've never had it before.

722
01:14:03,498 --> 01:14:12,743
And then I got a damn pressure between the shoulder blade up there. So it felt like I had to find a door frame so I can push my back against.

723
01:14:12,743 --> 01:14:15,417
I really never felt like these ailments in the body.

724
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:25,089
Then there was a line between where the chairs are in the hall up there. Both of them felt that right away.

725
01:14:30,578 --> 01:14:35,845
It was like we went into a field, the hair got up.

726
01:14:35,845 --> 01:14:37,864
And you felt like someone was going through you.

727
01:14:37,864 --> 01:14:39,825
We have to look at that clip.

728
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:45,398
It really felt like someone passed through the body.

729
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,772
And at the same time there was sound from Spiritbox.

730
01:14:49,928 --> 01:14:57,777
Now I stand here in the stable. I will do a one man session it is intended.

731
01:14:58,805 --> 01:15:04.024
I'm alone here, but Tony is on the other side of the door.

732
01:15:04,024 --> 01:15:06,374
In case.

733
01:15:06,374 --> 01:15:15,340
But I'm alone in here right now. I have three k2 meters down here that I hope you can see.

734
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:24,266
If they start to shine. I also have with a communication tool

735
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:29,582
So we'll see if I get any contact here.

736
01:15:30,738 --> 01:15:35,631
A very unpleasant feeling.

737
01:15:38,521 --> 01:15:41,534
Is there anyone here with me now?

738
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:52,755
What are you saying?

739
01:15:52,755 --> 01:15:53,592
*sound is recorded*

740
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:54,578
What was that?

741
01:15:55,734 --> 01:15:57,636
"Behind you"

742
01:16:02,582 --> 01:16:05,978
What did you say? Behind you?

743
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,142
Are you here?

744
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:15.903
"Go!!"

745
01:16:23,739 --> 01:16:27,265
You may say what you want.

746
01:16:34,202 --> 01:16:39,148
*sound is recorded*

747
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48.519
What is that sound?

748
01:16:48,519 --> 01:16:52,471
This was not comfortable.

749
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:55,499
Thanks for the sound!

750
01:16:57,644 --> 01:17:01,395
Can you make one to sound?

751
01:17:01,395 --> 01:17:06,281
So I know where you are somewhere.

752
01:17:10,135 --> 01:17:13,612
Who are you?

753
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:30,552
*someone knocks*

754
01:17:32,929 --> 01:17:36,919
The last chance to say something now.

755
01:17:43,278 --> 01:17:45,986
Anything.

756
01:17:49,647 --> 01:17:52,662
What is it?

757
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,942
"Running!"

758
01:17:55,942 --> 01:17:57.048
"Tony" - running.

759
01:17:57,048 --> 01:18:01,270
No! Come now, now you have to come!

760
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:02.206
What did it say?

761
01:18:02,206 --> 01:18:03.467
Running.

762
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:07.968
Then I stand here alone. In the stable.

763
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:20,191
This is where we were with Danjal and the others in the gang. Then many were chased out of here.

764
01:18:20,191 --> 01:18:24,966
I am completely alone, no walkie talkie and there is no surveillance in here.

765
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:29,648
All alone. Linda has gone back to the others.

766
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:35,914
So if there is anyone here now ..

767
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:41,615
Can you show yourself either up there ..

768
01:18:41,615 --> 01:18:46,023
Or in front of me? So I'll see you.

769
01:18:53,024 --> 01:19:00,000
There are three meters in front of me as well. You can go in front of there, if so I will see it.

770
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:18,309
If there are children running up here in the loft ..

771
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:28,182
No one who is here with me?

772
01:19:29,145 --> 01:19:35,580
*sound is recorded*

773
01:19:46,178 --> 01:19:51,507
*door closes*

774
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:56,292
I heard a sound up from.

775
01:20:01,816 --> 01:20:06,495
Last chance to say something.

776
01:20:09.061 --> 01:20:12,783
Then I end this session.

777
01:20:12,783 --> 01:20:14,729
Hello then, thank you!

778
01:20:15,307 --> 01:20:23,547
Now Tony and I will go into the stable. And try to communicate a little.

779
01:20:25,592 --> 01:20:29,050
We already have contact.

780
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:34,596
Do you want us to go into the stable?

781
01:20:36,716 --> 01:20:38,603
Just open the door there.

782
01:20:38,603 --> 01:20:41,467
I have to look first.

783
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:43,956
May we go in here?

784
01:20:46,589 --> 01:20:49,459
Yes, it hasn't said anything.

785
01:20:49,909 --> 01:20:51,644
"My home"

786
01:20:52,094 --> 01:20:53,817
My home!

787
01:20:53,817 --> 01:20:58,589
Then we will come home to you.

788
01:21:05,526 --> 01:21:09,220
We can show, if you extinguish your comb there.

789
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:14,566
It's bright for you, but for us it looks like this.

790
01:21:14,566 --> 01:21:19,279
It's completely black, you see nothing here.

791
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:23,916
Let's go.

792
01:21:25,072 --> 01:21:27,363
Should I go first?

793
01:21:39,824 --> 01:21:41,759
“Stallet/stay”

794
01:21:41,759 --> 01:21:44,514
What does it say? Stay?

795
01:21:44,514 --> 01:21:46,583
So no ...

796
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:48,724
Stop or the stable, I don't know.

797
01:21:50,458 --> 01:21:52,588
Go some more.

798
01:21:53,166 --> 01:21:55,663
We'll come to you now.

799
01:21:55,663 --> 01:21:58,446
Can we come in here?

800
01:22:02,814 --> 01:22:04,896
I'm really scared.

801
01:22:04,896 --> 01:22:06,989
Can you handle it?

802
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:11,168
I dare not check out there.

803
01:22:11,168 --> 01:22:12.575
We're coming now!

804
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:17,165
Wait! There was sound here now.

805
01:22:17,486 --> 01:22:20,371
"Do you see?"

806
01:22:26,023 --> 01:22:28,022
Here we come and greet!

807
01:22:28,022 --> 01:22:30,811
Is anyone here in the stable?

808
01:22:31,389 --> 01:22:33,792
Who has worked here ..

809
01:22:34,755 --> 01:22:37,988
Should I turn off the lamp?

810
01:22:37,988 --> 01:22:42,492
It's a carriage there? Or what is it?

811
01:22:46,346 --> 01:22:49,283
Yes, it's a carriage.

812
01:22:57,376 --> 01:23:02,283
I don't want to go last. I want to go first here.

813
01:23:03,118 --> 01:23:05.081
Check.

814
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:12,947
Can anyone stand in front of us so we will see you?

815
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:17,211
*light phenomenon*

816
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:22,468
Something passed the camera for now the autofocus is on.

817
01:23:25,101 --> 01:23:30,768
I thought I saw something, could you pass the camera again?

818
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:41,146
Can you make a loud sound in here?

819
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:47,235
Thanks for greeting!

820
01:23:48,455 --> 01:23:52,755
I think we should go now. Or?

821
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05.010
I got a feeling that we wouldn't be left.

822
01:24:05,845 --> 01:24:07.797
Then we go on that feeling.

823
01:24:11,265 --> 01:24:13,701
What a disgusting sound.

824
01:24:28,345 --> 01:24:30,315
No.

825
01:24:31,022 --> 01:24:32,979
It can be left.

826
01:24:32,979 --> 01:24:36,302
We say thank you.

827
01:24:37,137 --> 01:24:39,270
Thanks!

828
01:24:39,848 --> 01:24:45,993
Now it's time for me to go into the stable and make a one man session.

829
01:24:45,993 --> 01:24:55.731
Nicke is now and will leave me here. Exciting. We will put the camera on a tripod so we drive.

830
01:24:56,245 --> 01:25:00,787
The camera went out for no reason so I had to ..

831
01:25:00,787 --> 01:25:02,978
"Do it"

832
01:25:02,978 --> 01:25:07.838
Do it. Was it you who did it?

833
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:12,986
It feels like there is someone behind me.

834
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,022
What should you do?

835
01:25:22,177 --> 01:25:26,488
I have some lamps that shine here on the ground ..

836
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:30,000
"The divorce"

837
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:46,417
It feels like there is someone looking at me up there. It feels like someone is behind it. It's scary.

838
01:25:49,886 --> 01:25:56,848
Is it something you want to say me? Can't tell you who you are?

839
01:26:04,877 --> 01:26:06,970
“The ball”

840
01:26:06,970 --> 01:26:11.537
I would love to have a name.

841
01:26:20,979 --> 01:26:28,071
I pull down the sound on this and I'll just listen a little.

842
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:37,149
Can you make a loud sound for me? So I know you're here.

843
01:26:45,628 --> 01:26:50,187
Or get these meters to flash.

844
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:58,349
I pull up the sound again.

845
01:27:00,661 --> 01:27:07,854
Last time we were here and went through the stable, someone took me on the butt.

846
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:15,000
People have also felt observed here. And heard stones are thrown up in the attic.

847
01:27:15,578 --> 01:27:19,658
Give me a sign that you're here.

848
01:27:21,392 --> 01:27:23,813
Thanks!

849
01:27:23,813 --> 01:27:28,210
I was almost going to give up.

850
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,448
*EVP is recorded*

851
01:27:31,448 --> 01:27:34,689
Take all your power and energy.

852
01:27:34,689 --> 01:27:35,876
“Them die”

853
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:42,100
You can certainly make them go all the way up until they shine red.

854
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,359
"The children"

855
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:45,586
The kids?

856
01:27:46,871 --> 01:27:51,169
Yes, there are said to be children here.

857
01:27:51,683 --> 01:28:01.349
Inside the mansion. They usually hear a little girl and we have heard her ourselves tonight.

858
01:28:01,349 --> 01:28:05.488
Someone was busy with us.

859
01:28:11,783 --> 01:28:16,416
It looks like someone is standing there ...

860
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:29,300
Does anyone stand and look down at me right now?

861
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:33,896
I dare not even look up ..

862
01:28:34,795 --> 01:28:43,347
It does not feel as uncomfortable to stand with your back there, but it is up there.

863
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:56.301
It feels like someone is looking at me again. It's totally sick. I can't even lift my eyes.

864
01:29:16,855 --> 01:29:19,238
Okay, the last chance!

865
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:32,046
No one here with me?

866
01:29:35,964 --> 01:29:38,427
Then I finish.

867
01:29:40,347 --> 01:29:54,022
Then I end this session. Sofia in the stable. I mostly thought it felt uncomfortable, like someone standing looking at me. Up there.

868
01:29:54,022 --> 01:30:07.063
But we continue. Now it's Nicla's turn so I go and pick him up at the manor.

869
01:30:07.063 --> 01:30:15,455
Then I'm Niclas in the stable. I'm alone and I'm going to run a spirit box. So let's see if anyone wants to talk to me here.

870
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:21,849
I can say already, if there is anyone in here ..

871
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:27,214
So you are happy to throw something.

872
01:30:34,922 --> 01:30:41,051
My name is Niclas and I would love to talk to those who are in here.

873
01:30:41,051 --> 01:30:46,022
You have thrown stones when we were here once before.

874
01:30:47,371 --> 01:30:51,084
Is there anyone in here who would like to talk to me?

875
01:31:00,976 --> 01:31:02.891
"Hello"

876
01:31:03,983 --> 01:31:07,128
Can you throw something?

877
01:31:14,486 --> 01:31:16,895
"Yes"

878
01:31:18,949 --> 01:31:20,161
I thought I saw something ..

879
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:20,661
"I"

880
01:31:20,661 --> 01:31:25,423
Behind the camera, it flashed against the wall.

881
01:31:25,423 --> 01:31:26,534
"That's me"

882
01:31:26,534 --> 01:31:28,145
"I"

883
01:31:29,494 --> 01:31:32,717
It's a dialogue here.

884
01:31:34,194 --> 01:31:37,222
Does there usually be horses in here?

885
01:31:38,892 --> 01:31:40,352
"No"

886
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:47,806
Are you up there anywhere?

887
01:31:50,568 --> 01:31:58,629
It feels like there is someone up there looking down at me all the time. I feel damn observed. It looks like shadows in the periphery.

888
01:31:58,629 --> 01:32:00,494
"Go up"

889
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:03,427
"Help"

890
01:32:03,427 --> 01:32:06.105
Are you running up there?

891
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:07.517
"Yes"

892
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,935
I think I got a yes.

893
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:21,377
I turn this off now. And just standing quietly, see if I can get something to slap.

894
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:31,734
Can you make a loud sound somewhere so I know where you are?

895
01:32:34,817 --> 01:32:40,046
Can you run up in the loft so I hear you?

896
01:32:42,872 --> 01:32:57.019
*steps heard upstairs*

897
01:32:59,331 --> 01:33:04,285
Can you get any of the meters in front of me to blink?

898
01:33:10,772 --> 01:33:19,577
Now I have been here for a while with Spiritbox. Now it is analysis on the one that applies. So we'll see. If there were any good answers.

899
01:33:19,577 --> 01:33:25,944
Now I go back to Herrgården and we will see if anyone goes back here again.

900
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:31,038
It was Sofia and I, the stable again.

901
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:38,397
We're going to walk around here now and feel. I drive spirit box all the way around and we see if we can get any communication.

902
01:33:38,397 --> 01:33:40,134
We start at the attic then.

903
01:33:40,584 --> 01:33:45,000
We take the lower road and then we take the stairs at the far end.

904
01:33:48,019 --> 01:33:55,052
Now Sofia and I will go around here and I will go around with this communication tool called Spiritbox.

905
01:33:55,759 --> 01:33:57,790
So talk to us now.

906
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59.904
Now I open this door.

907
01:33:59,904 --> 01:34:01.823
"Can"

908
01:34:03,236 --> 01:34:05,480
"Sorry"

909
01:34:05,865 --> 01:34:08.001
Are you here?

910
01:34:17,379 --> 01:34:19,314
Can you make a loud sound somewhere in here?

911
01:34:19,314 --> 01:34:20,499
"Not"

912
01:34:22,041 --> 01:34:23,110
Not?

913
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:24,064
"Drag"

914
01:34:25,349 --> 01:34:30,000
We will go farthest here, then we will go back.

915
01:34:37,258 --> 01:34:39,116
"Go up"

916
01:34:39,694 --> 01:34:42,511
What is that?

917
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,495
"Nothing"

918
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,137
Can you say your name to us?

919
01:34:57,918 --> 01:35:01,527
My name is Niclas and this is Sofia.

920
01:35:02,105 --> 01:35:03.705
"Hello"

921
01:35:04,091 --> 01:35:06.446
Do you want to say something to us?

922
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:11,648
"Come"

923
01:35:13,786 --> 01:35:17,016
Where are you then? Tell where you are.

924
01:35:17,016 --> 01:35:17,697
"Come"

925
01:35:23,863 --> 01:35:25,977
"Go in"

926
01:35:27,301 --> 01:35:29,653
Where should I go in?

927
01:35:29,653 --> 01:35:30,997
Should I go in here?

928
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:33,199
“Closed”

929
01:35:33,584 --> 01:35:35,844
Closed.

930
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:38,431
Should I go in here?

931
01:35:42,168 --> 01:35:45,000
Now the PMB is running.

932
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,693
I don't get a focus, can you go in front of there only?

933
01:35:51,005 --> 01:35:52.708
The temperature increases or?

934
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:57.108
The temperature increases sharply in the room.

935
01:35:57,686 --> 01:36:00.051
Thanks!

936
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:05,760
My God what it increases ..

937
01:36:14,624 --> 01:36:16,559
Thanks so much!

938
01:36:16,559 --> 01:36:21,281
Is it the girl who is here?

939
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:34,030
Thus, the temperature is increasing very powerfully right now.

940
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,566
Can you move the ball too?

941
01:36:51,851 --> 01:36:54,650
What happens?

942
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:04,700
Does anyone play with this one?

943
01:37:12,408 --> 01:37:19,093
It sucked out of the battery out of the entire PMB ..

944
01:37:26,286 --> 01:37:27,886
Then we put in new ones then.

945
01:37:27,886 --> 01:37:34,516
It is dead. It drained all the battery in this room.

946
01:37:34,837 --> 01:37:40,978
We have changed batteries in the PMB. So we place it in the same place again and we will see what happens.

947
01:37:51,255 --> 01:37:56,829
If there is someone in here can you get it to play again for us?

948
01:37:57,985 --> 01:38:06,994
Then we leave this. So you can go past it, and we'll see it again.

949
01:38:07,765 --> 01:38:10,582
My God now!

950
01:38:10,582 --> 01:38:12,488
Thanks!

951
01:38:16,085 --> 01:38:19,973
Are you there at the ball?

952
01:38:26,845 --> 01:38:29,824
It goes on all features.

953
01:38:31,932 --> 01:38:36,930
Can you call your name high?

954
01:38:41,812 --> 01:38:44,452
It feels like something is pilling me on my hand.

955
01:38:44,452 --> 01:38:46,100
Which hand?

956
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:47,446
Here.

957
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:52.108
Can you do it again?

958
01:38:59,045 --> 01:39:04,997
We go from here and you will play it again. So we see it.

959
01:39:05,511 --> 01:39:10,637
We go up now and then we go over the attic and then the stairs down.

960
01:39:12,435 --> 01:39:13,846
Are you up here somewhere?

961
01:39:13,846 --> 01:39:14,717
"Yes"

962
01:39:14,717 --> 01:39:16,207
"I think"

963
01:39:16,207 --> 01:39:17,755
Wait.

964
01:39:17,755 --> 01:39:18,852
"Stay"

965
01:39:18,852 --> 01:39:20,177
Stay?

966
01:39:20,177 --> 01:39:22,475
Can you say hello then?

967
01:39:22,989 --> 01:39:24,778
“Stand left”

968
01:39:26,384 --> 01:39:30,595
The man I'm talking to now, can you say your name?

969
01:39:34,064 --> 01:39:36,731
Then we say hello then.

970
01:39:41,163 --> 01:39:43,231
Then we shut down spirit box.

971
01:39:43,231 --> 01:39:47,456
*sound is recorded*

972
01:39:49,961 --> 01:39:51,858
What the hell was that?

973
01:39:51,858 --> 01:40:01,792
*sounds from the loft, sounds like a man greets*

974
01:40:04,183 --> 01:40:06,959
It sounded like a man who moaned.

975
01:40:09,528 --> 01:40:13,387
Was it a man who just gave up?

976
01:40:17,177 --> 01:40:20,689
We heard it clearly.

977
01:40:23,644 --> 01:40:27,049
I don't want to be here anymore. I want to leave.

978
01:40:27,563 --> 01:40:32,888
Then we go this road so I light up a lamp.

979
01:40:32,888 --> 01:40:38,829
I light up a flashlight because we have to step over some things here.

980
01:40:38,829 --> 01:40:41,955
Thanks for commenting!

981
01:40:41,955 --> 01:40:44,686
Fy fuck ..

982
01:40:48,476 --> 01:40:53,875
Can you make one to sound before we go?

983
01:41:00,427 --> 01:41:02.927
Sound down there.

984
01:41:05,747 --> 01:41:12,357
Oh God! It was like someone moved my foot!

985
01:41:16,917 --> 01:41:19,468
Damn how disgusting it was.

986
01:41:20,046 --> 01:41:26,574
I have to feel if it's slippery here. It was like someone pushed away my foot.

987
01:41:26,574 --> 01:41:28.003
Well?

988
01:41:28,581 --> 01:41:30,582
Grabbed it or?

989
01:41:30,582 --> 01:41:33,744
I do not know..

990
01:41:35,785 --> 01:41:39,046
Was it the man who did it?

991
01:41:39,367 --> 01:41:42,156
As we heard.

992
01:41:42,477 --> 01:41:44,550
I want to go from here now.

993
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,935
*slap below us*

994
01:41:45,935 --> 01:41:48,125
A bang here.

995
01:41:53,135 --> 01:41:57.521
Make one a loud noise before we go.

996
01:42:04,073 --> 01:42:07.626
That equalization was cool.

997
01:42:07,626 --> 01:42:11,637
Here it was like there was someone when I was here myself. Here at the edge.

998
01:42:11,637 --> 01:42:13,546
Up here?

999
01:42:13,546 --> 01:42:15,860
That was exactly what I knew too.

1000
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:22,076
Like someone standing looking down at one. And we stood down there somewhere.

1001
01:42:22,076 --> 01:42:25,547
We stood in the same place.

1002
01:42:25,547 --> 01:42:28,815
Yes, we were in the same place.

1003
01:42:32,797 --> 01:42:35,239
Yes Sofia, what do you say?

1004
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:38,161
Yes what should I say?

1005
01:42:38,611 --> 01:42:42,913
Unpleasant. It feels more uncomfortable here than inside the mansion.

1006
01:42:42,913 --> 01:42:46,606
And that equality we both heard ..

1007
01:42:46,606 --> 01:42:49.048
It was scary.

1008
01:42:49,819 --> 01:42:52,184
Now we go back to the manor.

1009
01:42:52,184 --> 01:42:56,483
I think Tony and I will go down to the basement.

1010
01:43:10,293 --> 01:43:12,748
Hi johan.

1011
01:43:15,317 --> 01:43:17,285
My name is Tony, this is Niclas ...

1012
01:43:17,285 --> 01:43:19,489
“Leksand”

1013
01:43:20,131 --> 01:43:24,351
Did that Leksand say? My mom is from Leksand.

1014
01:43:34,435 --> 01:43:38,071
Thanks so much!

1015
01:43:43,595 --> 01:43:47,810
Come back and talk to us here.

1016
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:50,335
Can you go here?

1017
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:04,787
You who said Leksand and Johan, can you come back?

1018
01:44:11,981 --> 01:44:15,638
Now let's see what we get for contact here.

1019
01:44:15,638 --> 01:44:17,047
We move on there.

1020
01:44:18,203 --> 01:44:21,352
Who is here?

1021
01:44:25,784 --> 01:44:28,002
"Turn around"

1022
01:44:28,965 --> 01:44:31,952
Did it turn around?

1023
01:44:32,723 --> 01:44:36,433
We go straight ahead here.

1024
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:54,977
If there is anyone here, can you come to us?

1025
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,000
Do you come out here?

1026
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01.098
No.

1027
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:13,142
"Dog"

1028
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,152
Does anyone die here?

1029
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:22,810
Can I have your name?

1030
01:45:30,453 --> 01:45:32,263
"Become free"

1031
01:45:32,263 --> 01:45:34,072
Become free.

1032
01:45:35,035 --> 01:45:37,462
Light in there.

1033
01:45:58,273 --> 01:46:02.804
Then we go back to the mansion.

1034
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:14,094
We always have our surveillance system on our investigations. These cameras become our extra eyes throughout the evening and night.

1035
01:46:14,094 --> 01:46:19,801
What you will see now is what the camera has managed to catch.

1036
01:46:57,738 --> 01:46:59,859
Someone here?

1037
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:03,133
Who is here?

1038
01:47:07,359 --> 01:47:10,943
Thanks so much!

1039
01:47:10,943 --> 01:47:14,195
Is it the one who has been hanging out here?

1040
01:47:16,734 --> 01:47:21,115
Can you make a rash on any of our meters too?

1041
01:48:50,556 --> 01:48:52,592
Who do we have here?

1042
01:49:03,833 --> 01:49:07.244
Is anyone here?

1043
01:49:10,391 --> 01:49:14,600
It shines really strongly there.

1044
01:49:20,574 --> 01:49:24,756
Get closer to me again.

1045
01:49:43,576 --> 01:49:47,954
*high bang in the room*

1046
01:49:59,195 --> 01:50:01,250
*high bang in the room*

1047
01:51:43,562 --> 01:51:47,362
The investigation of Hensbacka Herrgård was now completed.

1048
01:51:47,362 --> 01:51:52,358
The advantage of being here before was that we knew where all the hot spots were in the building.

1049
01:51:52,358 --> 01:51:58,561
But as many times before, we got more activity elsewhere this time.

1050
01:51:58,561 --> 01:52:07.261
Our paranormal Music Box indicated that someone or something was over the floor although no one was there.

1051
01:52:07,261 --> 01:52:10,905
It was also in this place that the ball went over the floor.

1052
01:52:10,905 --> 01:52:22,015
What is interesting is that you feel presence from children in this room, which the communication tool several times mentions.

1053
01:52:22,015 --> 01:52:29,743
We got an indication that someone was standing outside the door in the attic, via our parascope.

1054
01:52:31,863 --> 01:52:45.525
We also managed to document steps in the stairs that the owner told us. And we also got a sound that sounded like someone dragged their feet up the stairs in the building.

1055
01:52:45,975 --> 01:52:56.881
What was a new experience for this time was when Tony got a strong feeling that someone passed through his body in the doorway in the piano room.

1056
01:53:00,658 --> 01:53:10,409
This was an investigation that contained a huge amount of EVP, electronic voice phenomena. Especially in the stable building.

1057
01:53:12,143 --> 01:53:21,853
Several times during the evening, a woman cried out Tony's name. She also said to protect me during Linda and Sofia's session on the second floor.

1058
01:53:21,853 --> 01:53:28,089
What was it she wanted to be protected from? Did she want to be protected from the more strong energy that is on the second floor?

1059
01:53:28,089 --> 01:53:30,631
Or against something completely different?

1060
01:53:30,631 --> 01:53:37,336
We left the building with a feeling that we are not quite clear with what the energies wanted to convey.

1061
01:53:37,336 --> 01:53:46,680
This means that we have to go back to the farm at some point, so that the spirits once again have the opportunity to once again communicate to us.

1062
01:53:50,405 --> 01:53:57,936
Hensbacka Herrgård is a place with energies that can extend as far back as 8000 BC.

1063
01:53:57,936 --> 01:54:05.306
So it is no wonder that Hensbacka height may be counted as one of Sweden's most active places.
