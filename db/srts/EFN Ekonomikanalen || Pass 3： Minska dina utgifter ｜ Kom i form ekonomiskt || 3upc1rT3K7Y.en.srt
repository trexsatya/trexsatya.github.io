1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05.440
I like my expenses. They give me the lifestyle I want.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07.960
The ones I don't like I have cut away.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,840
I have to keep track of my finances - now.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,320
Mia Ingelström is not just an economist. She is also a personal trainer in finance.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,120
You hear. Should we start?

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,240
Please, say I can cut off many of my expenses.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,760
It's done. You can cut down than you ever thought.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,960
I want to put in another thing. I like my expenses.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,440
They give me the lifestyle I want.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,800
The ones I don't like I have cut away.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,960
You have already started this.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,400
I've got started. I have some service with broadband, TV and a film service.

13
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,520
I didn't have to have TV. I called and asked them to remove what I paid 900 for.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,400
"Hang on for a moment," they said. When they came back they said:

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,400
"You get exactly the same but we cut it down to 400 instead."

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,120
Thank you who invite.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,480
So SEK 500 per month by lifting the handset.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,920
-How did it feel? -That they've cheated me before.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,640
I have paid for something like ...

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,200
Could there be other agreements that you could do the same with?

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,200
Then this is where we should start.

22
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,160
How should we cut down the fixed costs?

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43.560
Fixed costs are all that you pay as a subscription or have an agreement.

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,640
It is important that you find out what you pay today, but also what you want to pay.

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,360
Compare with what others pay. Then you call.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,080
-Variable expenses? -Then you have to negotiate with yourself.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,520
It's about a behavior.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,480
Look how much you put on different categories, type of food.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
Then put up a goal and give it to reach it.

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,520
Before the stop. Don't go to the store if you are not going to shop.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,520
Make sure to shop when you are measured. Make sure you really keep it.

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,880
It's a choice you make. It's your behavior.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,000
What you do not consume today you can take advantage of tomorrow.

34
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,360
I eat sweets for 80 bucks a day. You don't touch that money, Mia.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,200
It is my goal. May I be allowed to offer a good cup of coffee?

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39.560
Gladly. Thanks.

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,800
You, Mia, if I follow your excellent advice ...

38
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52.080
I have saved SEK 2000 a month.

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,600
Now I can shop at Pressbyrån weekly and do not have to go out to Willys.

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01.800
-Now you talk about the lifestyle trap. -Yes is not it?

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04.320
It is about correcting the mouth for the lunch bag.

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09.080
-You have more money and get rid of them right away. -It will be lobster again today. Great.

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,840
You were used to fish sticks. Now it's lobster.

44
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,520
This is where you have to decide what you have for goals.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,840
If you have a goal to save the money to do something late-

46
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,520
-You must help yourself to keep that money.

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,760
This is the hardest thing for us humans.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,160
We are used to having money, we get rid of them.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,400
But it is deferred reward. You have to learn to see that there is a late.

50
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,520
"Hello! I'm the worst impulse shopper. How should I do?"

51
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,880
You should give yourself the opportunity not to end up in situations where you can shop.

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,480
Do not go out in the stores to check for lunch.

53
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,680
Do not google to look for the newest bags or clothes.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04.920
Help yourself to fill your time with something else so that you do not end up in the temptation.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09.760
This is about a behavioral pattern that you have to change for you want.

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,040
Help yourself actually change it.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,040
You can introduce a purchase stop and not buy anything for the next 30 days.

58
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,520
When you see that the money is growing, you are motivated by seeing that it works.

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,760
-That's really good. -You can't just say, "sharpen you!"

60
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,000
You have to be kind to yourself and see that it is a thing you have to work with.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Today we have learned that fixed expenses can be negotiated. Just drive on.

62
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,920
Variable expenses - negotiate with yourself.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,760
Set some lovely goals.

64
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,440
Lifestyle changes take time.

65
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,080
Then you say, "Get in the collar!" I say: "Be a little kind to yourself."

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,200
Don't be so hard all the time.

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,520
-Or? -It sounds really good.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,280
We'll talk later. Perfect summary.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09.760
-You are so hard? -Really not.
