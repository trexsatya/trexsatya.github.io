1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,880
Open access affects me in the sense
that I see it as the future of our work.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,120
It's strongly linked to digitalization.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,040
Libraries will not be able to function

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,800
without addressing the issue of open
access in connection to digitalization.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,840
Publicly-funded work
must be openly accessible online.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,320
In my personal life,
if I need to search for medical information,

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,720
I don't have access to those articles
from home.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,280
They are publicly funded.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,240
I have friends who run startups
or who study.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,440
They don't have access to what they need
to be effective in their studies or work.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,280
For me, it's primarily about making books
and journals accessible

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:03,400
via link servers that connect to our local
directories and thereby also to LIBRIS.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,080
It's about making databases accessible.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,480
The databases we feel
are relevant to the work.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,520
It's also about the projects
the Bibsam Consortium supports.

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,720
Most recently Open Book Publishers
and Knowledge Unlatched.

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:32,640
I'm helping make the titles which are part
of those content services accessible.

18
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,560
This raises the discussion
about how the collection is perceived,

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,040
what the collection will look like in the future.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,440
NLS has a fairly large collection
of printed journals,

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,040
to which we continue to subscribe.

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,640
When journals transition
to an electronic-only format,

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,480
and in some cases
are made openly accessible,

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,440
it raises the question
of how to make the most of that material.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,480
How do you preserve it?

26
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,960
Knowing how to use open access
is important,

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,600
because then you know
how to use the material.

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,480
If you know how it was created.

29
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Open access material
comes in many forms.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,760
It may have been peer-reviewed,
or it may not have been.

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,480
It's comparable to Wikipedia,
which is designed so everyone contributes.

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,600
In some cases,
Wikipedia articles aren't reviewed.

33
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
Controversial subjects
can cause differing opinions.

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,760
If you know how things work,
you can use them in the right way.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,240
You can include unreviewed work
that's still interesting to discuss.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,000
That's one reason why knowing
how to use open access is important.

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,680
If you write the material
which will be openly accessible,

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,880
if you know what that means,
you have power to shape the process.

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,760
For example, the copywrite issue.

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,440
For a long time, researchers signed away
their copywrite ownership,

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,760
the right to disseminate their material.

42
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,200
Now the plan is to set up licenses,
so researchers retain their copywrites.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,600
This requires knowledge of which license
to use, which license suits the work?

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,560
It's important that the person creating
the resources or writing the material

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,160
knows what to do,
what choices are available.

46
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,360
The number of openly accessible
publications is increasing.

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,040
It will most likely continue to increase.

48
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,720
Since the issue is at the forefront,

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:56,880
it's good for the staff to stay current
on issues which affect the libraries.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,840
NLS is a national library
which other libraries look to as an example.

51
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,960
So it's good to have a plan, a strategy,

52
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,560
about how to convey that knowledge.

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,600
Part of my job consists of work in the field,

54
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,880
where I meet users and visitors.

55
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,840
So far there hasn't been a lot of questions

56
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,600
concerning open access materials.

57
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,120
That may be because visitors and users

58
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,080
think they know
what the NLS collections consist of,

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,440
the printed collections or the archives
or the audiovisual collections.

60
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,280
But they may not know about open access.

61
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,760
In the long term that will certainly change,
because of the changing landscape.

62
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
It's good for the staff to have the knowledge

63
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,240
to guide users down the right path.
