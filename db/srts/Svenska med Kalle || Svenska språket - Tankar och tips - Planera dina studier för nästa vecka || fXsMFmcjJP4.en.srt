00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:04,115
Hello and good morning everyone.

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:06,675
It's Sunday.

3
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:10,835
and that means that soon it is work week again and time to

4
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:13,875
and that means that soon it is work week again and time to

5
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:15,505
tackle

6
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:17,935
Swedish studies

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,840
And in this video I want to test one thing

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,855
It is a simple challenge to you who are watching

9
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:30,035
It is a simple challenge to you who are watching

10
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:32,845
If you want to be with me on a thing

11
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:36,775
and it is a challenge a small

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,220
a small

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,240
No, not a test is not.
 How to explain challenge?
 I do not know.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,980
No, not a test is not.
 How to explain challenge?
 I do not know.

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,180
It's called "Challenge" in English.

16
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:47,415
And many

17
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:51,255
Many Swedish use the word "challenge" even when they speak Swedish

18
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:54,375
Many Swedish use the word "challenge" even when they speak Swedish

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,600
But the Swedish word is challenge anyway

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,105
and my little challenge (coming) there are two steps

21
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:05,475
sometime today

22
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:08,465
Take ten minutes

23
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:09,465
and sit down

24
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:13,205
and plan your studies

25
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:16,375
Monday to Friday

26
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,225
so think through the week

27
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:21,775
and plan some things to do

28
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,205
To train Swedish.

29
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:26,945
It depends on how much time you have to exercise ...

30
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:29,180
You might just ...

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,440
It can be as simple as deciding that you should read

32
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:36,955
read for 30 minutes each day

33
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:38,945
read for 30 minutes each day

34
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:42,425
or maybe work out a bit with your favorite app

35
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:46,545
or you can plan to go to a language cafÃ©

36
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:49,815
Or maybe you have a small study schedule for each day

37
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:52,835
or so maybe you have a small study schedule for each day with different things

38
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:56,315
It depends on how you exercise and how much time you have

39
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:57,905
but

40
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,275
try making some form of plan

41
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,275
try making some form of plan

42
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:05,115
maybe set some goals too

43
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:08,755
I will learn 20 new words

44
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:09,755
or

45
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:13,145
I will learn 10 phrases that I can use in a clothing store

46
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:16,555
I will learn 10 phrases that I can use in a clothing store

47
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,845
It depends after all what level you are at

48
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:22,345
and what goals you have with learning Swedish

49
00:02:22,345 --> 00:02:23,455
and what goals you have with learning Swedish

50
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:27,065
Some form of plan, planning, set up some goals

51
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,965
Some form of plan, planning, set up some goals

52
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:30,965
It's step 1

53
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:33,815
And then step 2, if you wish, you will be very happy to share

54
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:36,975
And then step 2, if you wish, you will be very happy to share

55
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:39,945
your plan or your goals

56
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:42,875
or just a small part of it

57
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,785
In a comment on this video.

58
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:47,635
It would be fun to see

59
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:50,365
what you have for study goals for the week to come

60
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:53,255
what you have for study goals for the week to come

61
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:56,695
And then on Friday we can look

62
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,860
about how it has gone

63
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,160
If you have reached your goal or if you have followed your planning

64
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,160
If you have reached your goal or if you have followed your planning

65
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:07,205
So, I'll do the same for my Somali, I'll be sitting a bit today someday

66
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:10,205
So, I'll do the same for my Somali, I'll be sitting a bit today someday

67
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,205
If you have reached your goal or if you have followed your planning

68
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:15,675
and think about, how I should be able to train a little

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
and think about, how I should be able to train a little

70
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,920
for my part I have trained a lot with apps

71
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,780
So I try

72
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:26,695
train some more by reading and writing

73
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:29,755
on paper instead

74
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:31,155
so there will be something with it

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,440
But I haven't been able to think

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,040
or i haven't been able to plan it yet

77
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,375
So I get to see myself, but as I said

78
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,520
Do a little planning, perhaps put up some special target

79
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,915
and if you want

80
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:48,985
Write a little comment and tell us what you intend to do

81
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:51,615
To train Swedish this week to come

82
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:52,875
To train Swedish this week to come

83
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,345
Okay this was all for this time, see you again soon

84
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:58,195
Okay this was all for this time, see you again soon

85
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:01,745
And have a nice Sunday and ...

86
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:04,745
A good start to the week to come

87
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,515
Have a nice day!
 Bye.
