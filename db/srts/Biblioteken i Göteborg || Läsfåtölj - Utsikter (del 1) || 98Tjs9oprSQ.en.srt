00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,180
Welcome to the Gothenburg City Library.

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,400
Mirjam is my name and work as a program librarian

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,520
and we have for some time made a series of reading armchairs

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,920
that is actually an old program series from the 90s

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,320
There the actors at the City Theater of Gothenburg

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,300
come in after the Saturday rehearsals and

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,260
told stories or read poems on different themes.

8
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,280
We invited Gothenburg's freelance actors for this

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,660
And we have been running for three semesters now.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,640
And today we have Timo Nieminen and

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,280
Annika Nordin here and the theme are prospects.

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00.928
Yes right now we have to keep away from each other.

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05.860
For it is hard to hug you have to keep more than one

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08.040
arm's length.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,900
It is said that every time we hug someone hot

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,300
So our lives are extended by a whole day.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,980
At least it says Paulo Coelho.

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,780
So we would not be able to write a book about all types

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,100
of hugs that exist for it would never end.

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,900
There are as many types of hugs as there are

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,700
people,

22
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,980
situations,

23
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,720
Relationships.

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,100
So here's a reading chair

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,540
full of poetic, lyrical, crazy,

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,420
Romantic hugs.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49.560
But

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,640
at a safe distance,

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52.640
like this.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,220
Prospects yes ..

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00.880
In the synonym dictionary we find words like:

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
panoramic,

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04.440
hope,

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,100
hopes,

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07.440
Views.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,540
And from views

37
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,600
the associations can easily go to windows.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,240
Windows, it is a strong theme of many artists through the ages.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,620
Charles Baudelaire highlighted in one of his prosepoem:

40
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
There is nothing deeper,

41
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Secret

42
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
richer, richer,

43
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,660
dumb and more dazzling

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,720
than a window illuminated by a light flame.

45
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,100
What to look like in the sun is always less interesting

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,140
than the one that adds

47
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,040
Behind a window pane.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51.020
In this black hole

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,280
living life

50
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Dreaming

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,600
Suffering.

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04.320
From Baudelaire to Saarikoski, Pentti Saarikoski.

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09.940
One dark gray morning I go to buy wine.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,080
The only one in the small bus and in the big one, out of three.

55
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,180
Until a day when the little one is no longer needed

56
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,800
It replaces the big one and we, we have become a winery

57
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,944
And the great bus drivers drive the small and the small bus drivers chop our firewood.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,020
Desolate to be the only bus's only

59
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,880
and embarrassing that in the big product one of three looking down at the knee

60
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,020
A dark gray morning in February.

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49.640
New thoughts are not needed for a long time

62
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,380
On the high bridge I doubt its strength

63
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,820
The fairway is dredged for larger boats
