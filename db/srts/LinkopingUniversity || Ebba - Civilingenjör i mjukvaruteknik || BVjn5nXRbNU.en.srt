00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:05.888
My name is Ebba and I read a civil engineer in software technology at LiU.

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07.424
I'm in my fourth year.

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,240
As a civil engineer you read a lot of math.

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,104
But just on software technology you read a lot of programming, several different programming languages.

5
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:21,248
What I think is fun about programming is that it is very concrete. You get a response from your computer.

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,344
But it is also very creative. You can solve a problem in very many different ways,

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
So you get both the concrete and creative in one.

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,304
When we did our bachelor's work, we worked in a team of eight people throughout the semester.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,680
They have taken 3D scans, inside the actual mines, up in Kiruna.

10
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,776
As they read to data file. And we developed an algorithm that can,

11
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:49,664
Our node graph generates itself. Then they can do simulations

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
that makes you can see where it becomes most worthwhile

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,784
to break ore, and that can do it for any mine.

14
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,880
It got very cool because it is actually used by LKAB's system today.

15
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
I think anyone can search!

16
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06.816
It is a bit sad that there is a stereotype today, which you see a lot in movies and TV series.

17
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
That people who program are super -smart, self -taught and sit completely alone in any basement

18
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
and hack into institutions while

19
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,360
This is not the case in reality, but we are social and we have great fun.

20
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
So you should not hesitate to search.
