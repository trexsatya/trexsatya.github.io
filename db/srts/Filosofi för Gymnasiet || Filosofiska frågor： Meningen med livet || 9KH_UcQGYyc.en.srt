1
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,180
Throughout history, many major issues have been dealt with in philosophy.

2
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,000
In the name of honesty there are few of those who received a final response

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,260
But in any case we have the second best - a number of exciting theories!

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,680
One of the questions that man has asked at all times is what the meaning of life is.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,400
Here we will take a closer look at some of the most common answers that can be given to that question.

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,380
These are far from comprehensive but are examples of how to reason.
 The interesting thing is what you think!

7
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:51,914
Maybe the meaning of the life of everyone is to achieve their personal potential?

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,400
This is a thought that (consciously or unconsciously) shaped the lives of many people

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,200
And is probably what drives our foremost athletes, musicians, artists and others.

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,400
According to theory, the meaning of life is subjective

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,520
And examples of such views of life are humanism and existentialism.

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,440
Existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre have built its entire philosophy on this starting point.

13
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,420
He believes that man must create his own meaning because there is not

14
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,000
some congenital purpose with human existence.

15
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,440
A theory related to the previous one is about the meaning of life to be

16
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,720
to develop the human species.

17
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:44,020
Here you highlight the meaning of the individual and believe that together we strive for a larger goal,

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,460
to achieve the potential of the human species.

19
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,300
One philosophy that partly represented this focus was Friedrich Nietzsche with his idea of the superhuman.

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,500
A theory reminiscent of the previous one finds in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.

21
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,680
According to this, the meaning of life is survival.

22
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,860
But since we all have limited life length, this leads us to the meaning of life

23
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,460
Will reproduce, to pass on their genes and their species.

24
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,640
But even though Darwin felt that this was the meaning of life, he claimed with determination

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,260
that there was no purpose behind this.
 It was just so it had happened to slump.

26
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,660
Sometimes it is claimed that all theories referring to a subjective meaning of life have one thing in common

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,420
- That we feel good when we reach our goals.

28
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,340
Instead of formulating several different theories, such as the meaning of life is love or to have their

29
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,480
Wishes fulfilled, maybe the meaning of life is simply to achieve happiness.

30
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,920
The theory is called hedonism and has its roots in ancient Greece and philosopher epicurosis with a

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,160
Modern variant in utilitarianism and the principle greatest possible happiness for the greatest possible number.

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,620
Hedonism (and variants thereof) is relatively common as a view of life in today's society,

33
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,200
But there are objections.

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,900
One such is Robert Nozick's thought experiment "The experience machine".

35
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,520
He thinks of a large machine you can connect

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:26,080
against, a machine that feeds the brain with experiences and happiness, all while your body is still.

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:32,660
A hedonist should then reasonably think that a life linked to such a machine would be the perfect life

38
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,460
Since it is only the experience of happiness that is important.

39
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,080
But this is contrary to most people's intuition for a good life;

40
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,200
For example, we do not just want to experience love, we want to love and be really loved.

41
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,600
An answer to the meaning of life is to live in accordance with God's will.

42
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,580
This religious answer is compatible with all the great religions

43
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,340
And has had a huge significance for our history.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,940
Even today, in many places in the world, laws are based on religious beliefs.

45
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,500
The view is based on the fact that some kind of God is in the objective truth.

46
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,940
Life is then based on understanding this truth and as far as possible to follow it.

47
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,000
To their aid, you have sacred writings such as the Bible, the Qur'an or the Tora.

48
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:31,820
Often, this view of life is associated with the belief in an afterlife, either in heaven, hell or over again on earth.

49
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Many are attracted by the call of religion to live a morally good life,

50
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,580
But have a hard time accepting the idea of a God.

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,780
Then the meaning of life may be to live morally right - to be a good person.

52
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:57,400
To their aid, you have a number of theories about what right is, such as mindset ethics, consequence ethics and rule ethics.

53
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,320
A pessimistic response to the meaning of life could be that it

54
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,380
Mainly consists of suffering and misery.

55
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,320
One representative of this view was Arthur Schopenhauer who believed that life is defined by just suffering.

56
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,180
Life is bad because it is the final proof that our lives are completely meaningless.

57
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,640
Only the knowledge that we will one day die makes us stand out with life.

58
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,220
In the same way, we stand out with the idea that we should die because life is still a torment.

59
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,740
Sometimes one encounters people who not only mean that life is meaningless

60
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,840
But which also distance himself from the question itself.

61
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,340
This view is called nihilism after the Latin word "nihil" which means "nothing"

62
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,520
And its foremost representative is Friedrich Nietzsche with his theory that God is dead.

63
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:02,940
Without God, all significance and the answers and the truth that existed when God "lived" is now gone.

64
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,840
There are no moral values or any meaning to life, which is why everything becomes meaningless.

65
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,480
There is a measure of nihilism in all the theories that dismiss an objective meaning with life,

66
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,860
That is, most of the theories we have raised here.

67
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,660
Some people are annoyed for various reasons on the question of the meaning of life

68
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,300
And mean that there is nothing we humans should think about.

69
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,140
Instead of taking a stand on the issue, you ignore it.

70
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,160
Such a person was the famous psychologist Sigmund Freud who meant that all the thoughts about this

71
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,480
Be unnecessary and only a sign of man's willingness to rise above nature.

72
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,620
He even went so far that he felt that thoughts about the meaning of life

73
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,180
was a sign of a sick mind.
