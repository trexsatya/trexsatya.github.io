1
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:14,848
RDA (Resource Description & Access) It is the international standard

2
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,664
We use resources in Libris when describing.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,736
And the content of this presentation:

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,560
It will be a review. But not the rules in detail, but an overview of how the content of the RDA is structured.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,340
And about the conceptual models behind it.

6
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,912
There will also be something about RDA and Libris.

7
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,496
Where to find libris practice for RDA

8
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,080
And where to find instructions for cataloging.

9
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,712
RDA nationally and internationally

10
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368
From autumn 2017 there is a national RDA committee with representatives from research,

11
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,720
Special and public libraries around the country.

12
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:08,608
KB is a member of the European Cooperation Group Eurig,

13
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
European RDA Interest Group, which meets once a year to exchange experiences.

14
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:26,180
Eurig is represented in RSC, the RDA Steering Committee, which is the main organ of RDA.

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,140
There is a beta version with a new version of RDA.

16
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,280
It will start to be used no earlier than 2021 internationally.

17
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,140
But KB is awaiting the new version of RDA until further notice.

18
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,060
RDA will be used in primary catalogization in Libris.

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:55,200
Descriptions in Libris may be made according to different cataloging rules:

20
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,080
Before RDA, KRS (cataloging rules were followed for Swedish libraries).

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:10,980
Imported items may be made according to RDA, AACR2 or national cataloging rules.

22
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,500
The main rule is that descriptions in Libris that follow other cataloging rules other than RDA

23
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,568
not to be redone according to RDA.

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,580
The RDA is developed by the RSC (RDA Steering Committee) consisting of representatives from different countries.

25
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,080
The goal is for all continents to be represented and it is a work that is ongoing.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:50,560
RDA was completed in 2010 and then replaced AACR2 on which our previous cataloging rules, KRS, are based on.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,860
The Library of Congress was the first to switch to RDA. They went over 2013.

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,340
KB switched to RDA in 2017.

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,256
RDA is gathered in the online service RDA Toolkit.

30
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:22,680
Swedish, publicly funded libraries have access to RDA Toolkit through a subscription that KB has.

31
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:46,600
Via the link: https://www.kb.se/rdakatalgization/rda-litaction/rda--toolkit

32
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,460
If you get information on how to access RDA Toolkit.

33
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:03,500
RDA contains data elements, guidelines and instructions to create well -formulated metadata.

34
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,860
RDA is based on internationally recognized models, especially IFLA's models:

35
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,380
FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records)

36
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,420
Frad (Functional Requirements for Authority Data)

37
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:31,980
and frozen (Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data)

38
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,280
RDA follows principles for linked data.

39
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:46,780
RDA's elements and vocabulary as linked data in RDF can be found in a service called RDA Registry.

40
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,600
Element. To each entity a number of elements are attached.

41
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:07,120
Example: Main title, publishing site, type of carrying, medium type are elements that are linked to the manifestation.

42
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,720
And further examples: GÃ¶sta Berling's saga - it is the main title of a manifestation.

43
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,040
Kalmar - It may be the place of release for a manifestation

44
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,420
Elements in RDA are the same as properties in Libris.

45
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,420
By having basic knowledge of the FR models, one also gains a better understanding of how RDA

46
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,300
Is structured and it becomes easier to navigate in Toolkit.

47
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,460
KB's RDA instructions also follow the structure of RDA Toolkit.

48
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,840
RDA is divided into ten sections.

49
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:04,200
Sections 1-4 include the elements, as well as instructions for the elements, used to describe the entities:

50
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,100
1: Manifestations and copies

51
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
2: works and expressions

52
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,160
3: families, persons, institutions

53
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,820
4: Subjects, objects, events, locations

54
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,975
Places are the only chapter in section 4 that contains information.

55
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,980
It was thought that the other chapters would be added after the release of RDA Toolkit, but it never happened.

56
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:40,580
Now that you have launched the beta version of the new RDA Toolkit, there is only space left of the entities in section 4.

57
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:49,480
Section 5-10 gives you guidelines on how to describe relationships between the entities.

58
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,840
A number of appendix that contains rules for upper and lower case, for example,

59
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,340
Abbreviations and symbols are also available.

60
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,240
There are also appendix with different types of relationship designations to indicate more

61
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,080
specific relationships between the units.

62
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,551
Appendix I-M (Relationships)

63
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,940
Relationships between a resource and agents linked to the resource. It is available in appendix I.

64
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,160
When you talk about resource, you mean the work, the expression, manifestation and copy

65
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,400
When you say agent you mean person, family and institution.

66
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:50,080
Relationships between works, expressions, manifestations and copies can be found in Appendix J.

67
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,140
For example, a work can be based on another work.

68
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,999
Relationships between agents can be found in Appendix K.

69
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:06,680
For example, a person may be a member of a family or be employed by an institution.

70
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:15,100
Relationships between concepts, objects, events and locations - Appendix L.

71
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,240
Unfortunately, there is no content there because these entities never developed in the RDA.

72
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:34,380
And subject relationships can be found in Appendix M. e.g. A work may be the subject of another work.

73
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Appendix I-M (Relationships)

74
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:49,360
Libris practice is not to use the relationship designations in the Appendix I-M in RDA.

75
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:57,060
The features we use for agents in the new Libris are based on the function codes in Marc21.

76
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,020
These largely overlap in the appendix in the RDA.

77
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,460
It is possible to specify more specific relationships between e.g. Works in Libris.

78
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
Description methods

79
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,687
The new RDA talks about four description methods.

80
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:30,360
Please note that the description methods are about how to specify the value for a particular element.

81
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,060
They should not be mixed with description levels, which we will talk about later.

82
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,960
But the description levels are also available in the current RDA but there they are not as clearly pronounced.

83
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:53,160
The four description methods are: unstructured description, structured description,

84
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,040
Identifier and uri.

85
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,900
Unstructured description

86
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
Yes, there may be remarks, quotes from different sources and information transferred from the manifestation.

87
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,215
"Mechanical" transfer, ie That you write what stands.

88
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:27,640
They are manipulated according to certain rules that apply to punctuation, upper and lower case, etc.

89
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,860
And unstructured description cannot be understood by machines.

90
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
Structured description

91
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,100
We have an example under publishing details:

92
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:53,940
"Take what you see" applies to each individual element, ie. Follow the formulation of the resource, but

93
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,660
Enter the elements in a particular order.

94
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:08,140
Example: Stockholm: Bonniers, 2019

95
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,800
Structured description can partly be understood by machines.

96
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,240
The information is retrieved from the manifestation and you enter them as they look in the manifestation,

97
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:27,871
But you specify each task in specific elements, in a certain order.

98
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,000
There is an element for publishing site, one for publishers and one for publishing year.

99
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,420
Identifiers

100
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:47,620
Locally unique and assigned by an organization, so -called. default number.

101
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,600
For example. Issn, ISBN and EAN.

102
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:05,520
Also publishing number, such as Disc mark and number are counted as identifier.

103
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,900
Identifiers can partly be understood by machines.

104
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,040
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

105
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,660
They are globally unique and they can be understood by machines.

106
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,880
Description levels

107
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,200
In KRS, which we used before the RDA, we talked about three description levels.

108
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,720
They indicated which elements must be stated at each level of description.

109
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,000
In Libris, the description levels remain.

110
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,640
In RDA there are really no description levels. Instead, talking about nuclear elements

111
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,800
Or core elements as it is called in English.

112
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:10,140
The picture shows the element title (manifestation) in RDA Toolkit. Title has several sub -elements.

113
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:21,360
The main title is a nuclear element. All other titles are optional, e.g. Other title information, variant titles.

114
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,480
Nuclear elements - what does RDA say?

115
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:38,180
Well, a description of an entity should contain all nuclear elements that are applicable and easily accessible.

116
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,580
It should also contain all other elements necessary to distinguish

117
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,160
the entity from other similar entities.

118
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,920
Think about the user's needs and use the catalog's judgment.

119
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,560
Not least important.

120
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,060
Libris practice

121
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:11,455
In addition to the nuclear elements in RDA, the cataloging instance can define

122
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,620
Additional elements that are mandatory to indicate.

123
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:24,380
KB has defined a number of elements compulsory in Libris. Who they are found in libris practice.

124
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:37,720
Librispraxis is found in RDA Toolkit, such as KBSP, and in instructions for cataloging (RDA).

125
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,020
Librispraxis in RDA Toolkit

126
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:55,980
When clicking the KBSP button, in yellow and blue, in RDA Toolkit,

127
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,880
KBSP thus stands for the Royal Library Swedish Practice,

128
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:09,300
So you get into the document that contains libris practice, and SMDB practice, for RDA.

129
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,280
Librispraxis in instructions for cataloging (RDA)

130
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes, here is also libris practice in the RDA instructions at https://www.kb.se/rdakatalogization

131
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,300
The description levels in Libris

132
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,700
Minimum level = nuclear elements in RDA

133
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:55,900
Library level = nuclear elements + the elements stated as mandatory in Libris.

134
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:05,720
National bibliographic level = nuclear elements + the elements stated as mandatory in librispraxis +

135
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,980
a few more elements specified by the national bibliography.

136
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,880
NB practice can be found in the RDA instructions.

137
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,580
Important aids in cataloging

138
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:37,260
RDA Toolkit is at the address https://ecess.RdoDoolkit.org

139
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,000
Contains the RDA instructions and all RDA's entities

140
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:49,140
And the elements for the entities and KBSP which are libris practice.

141
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:58,060
Libris practice talks about which elements are mandatory and briefly how we apply RDA's rules in Libris.

142
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,500
Instructions for cataloging (RDA)

143
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:14,700
Available at https://www.kb.se/rdakatalgization

144
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:20,640
Contains more extensive instructions with examples (in Marc)

145
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,840
For the most common elements and rules in RDA including authority work

146
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,280
Here is also stated which elements are nuclear elements and which elements are mandatory

147
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,600
according to libris practice. There are also workflows for a number of material types.

148
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
Another tool for cataloging is help texts in the cataloging tool.

149
00:17:48,540 --> 00:18:00,480
which is at the address https://libris.kb.se/katalization/help

150
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:08,660
and they contain, among other things. instructions on how to insert and add properties to the cataloging tool

151
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,860
As well as workflows for a number of materials.

152
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,263
Work is underway with new cataloging instructions adapted to Libris.

153
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,335
Yes, that was all.
