1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,960
Hey.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,360
- Hey.
- Hey.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,140
- Where are we?
- We are in Isaberg, in Småland.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,220
Yes.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:22,240
- And what's behind you?
- Our house and daddy, who's packing his backpack.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,240
Isaberg is a ski slope during winter, and during summer
this place offers lots of fun action-packed activities.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,840
Really cool.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,940
When we got here yesterday, this place was full of
mountain bikers. You can go to the top and bike down.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,160
We're not doing that.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,960
- I can't do that.
- I know.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,340
If I bike really fast
I get so scared that I fall.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,860
- What are we going to do now?
- Tree Top Adventure!

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
We are starting
our day up high.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,240
- Camera mounting in progress.
- Yep. Thank you, Alma. How nice.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
- Are you nervous?
- No.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,920
- It's pretty high up.
- It's going to be really fun.

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,960
- They look so professional.
- Right?

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,780
They look like they are about to
chop down trees or work on power poles.

19
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,140
- Daddy, when will you put on your suit?
- In just a bit.

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,860
- We are ready!
- Yes!

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,280
Yeah, yeah,
I have the coolest suit, wow!

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:58,500
I got a green helmet because I have the biggest head
in the world, so now I really do look like a watermelon.

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,940
- Will we climb the ladder?
- Right? Just like a watermelon.

24
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,960
We will get instructions now, Harry.

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:14,020
You can't open both of these at the same time, so you'll
always be locked in with at least one. That's good, huh?

26
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,280
If you look at these you will see
which one is open and which one is locked.

27
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,520
The one that's like a C is open
and the one that's like a U is closed.

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,820
When one is open I can't open the other one, see?
So, you will always be secured up there.

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,760
The arrow to the magnet, and push.

30
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,280
Now that this one is locked,
the other one is open.

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,300
Push the button and pull it towards the wire.
There, now it's open.

32
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,760
Pull up and pull down,
pull up and pull down...

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,040
Oops, I accidentally hit the camera.

34
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,300
(Alma) Harry, stop.

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,620
- Oh, someone's a bit too excited.
- Yeah... we'll see how this goes.

36
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,100
Now Harry will try it.

37
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,560
Fasten yourself again.

38
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,060
- Here?
- Mm.

39
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,260
Okay.

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,220
Where's the little rope?

41
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,580
Here.

42
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,060
Watch out!

43
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,780
Watch out.

44
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,600
Do not do that
when we are on a real course.

45
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,900
- Do we know everything now?
- Yes.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
- Are we ready for the first course?
- Yes.

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,320
- It's a little scary to go on our own.
- Yes, a little.

48
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,660
Now we should just know it.
From this low spot to up there, folks.

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,420
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

50
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,920
Okay... this was kind of difficult.

51
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,180
- Oh, how fun. A sleigh.
- Yeah, indeed.

52
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,440
Alma is Santa Claus!

53
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,880
- Ready?
- Yes.

54
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,380
Go!

55
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,240
♪ Prince Ali!
Mighty is he! Ali Ababwa ♪

56
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,200
I feel like I'm too heavy
and will fall.

57
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,120
Help, help!

58
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,040
Now I'll jump
to the next one.

59
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:38,180
It's... semi difficult
to walk and film...

60
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,220
But, what don't we do so that
you guys at home can come along.

61
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,440
What did you think of the 
Tree Top Adventure?

62
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,300
- Really fun!
- Perfect!

63
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,580
- Really fun.
- It was really fun. And really hot.

64
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,180
Extremely hot.

65
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,300
We had to go inside
and eat our lunch.

66
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,500
Swedes usually eat outside
when the weather's nice, but-

67
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,820
-it's almost too hot.
I know you can't say that, but...

68
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,300
Alma almost had sunstroke.

69
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,180
Now we'll try something we've never tried before.
I know I'm very excited, how about...

70
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,760
Me too!

71
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,240
- I'm very excited.
- Rodel!

72
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,740
Yes, rodel! Summer rodel.
The track is there, I'll turn the camera around.

73
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,600
There.

74
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,900
- Come on, friends.
- Let's run!

75
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,960
- Mommy, are we going in one? 
- We'll sit one adult and one child per...

76
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,640
Okay, I want to sit with daddy.
Daddy is so kind.

77
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,760
- Do you want to sit with me?
- Okay.

78
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,280
- I'm also pretty kind.
- Yes.

79
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,740
You ride up there, then turn around
at the top and ride down.

80
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,080
It sort of looks like
a roller coaster.

81
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,420
The camera is mounted.
And we are ready.

82
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,200
- Buckle up.
- Oh, right.

83
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,820
- Hey.
- Hey.

84
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,880
- Have you done this before?
- No.

85
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,760
- Are you getting the buckle in? There you go.
- That feels very important.

86
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,320
- On the way up, you don't have to do anything.
- No.

87
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,080
- It's too tight.
- Oh, she's saying it's too tight.

88
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,140
Rather it's too tight
than too loose, Alma.

89
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
- There.
- Thank you.

90
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,300
So, you don't have to do anything
on the way up.

91
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,060
At the top, push the levers forward
to go full speed.

92
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,540
Hold them there.

93
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:20,800
If you want to brake, just release them a bit.
So, you decide the speed on the way down.

94
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,240
- We'll go full speed, right?
- Mm.

95
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,520
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

96
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,640
(Harry) Daddy!

97
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,580
(Alma) This will be exciting!

98
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,620
Daddy, get in.

99
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,880
- Alma, how high is it?
- How dare they ski all the way down there?

100
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,340
- Are you ready?
- Yes. Are you ready?

101
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,580
- I'm ready.
- Are you really sure?

102
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,260
- Yes.
- Are you really?

103
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,960
Are you really? Are you?

104
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,620
Full speed.
Here we go, Harry!

105
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,880
- Are you really ready?
- I'm ready.

106
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Are you really?

107
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,720
"Forbidden to stop"
"Accelerate"

108
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,620
- The rodel was crazy fun.
- Super fun.

109
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,940
- In the curves, it felt like you'd fly out.
- Yes, it did.

110
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,280
So, there was also
a scary element to it.

111
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,740
There was one curve
I didn't dare to go full throttle in.

112
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,620
- Full speed.
- Yes, full speed. It was a little scary, actually.

113
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:35,060
- It's fun that there's so much action here. I get NZ vibes.
- Yeah, indeed! Rotorua vibes.

114
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,820
Yes! New Zealand was like this.
Lots of nature and lots of action things to do.

115
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,260
- The... swing.
- Yes, exactly.

116
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
And the ZORB ball.

117
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:53,660
- We're only trying a few things here, there are lots more.
- I'm riding a zip line, wieee...

118
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,860
- Golf, all these mountain bike tracks, and such.
- Yes, right.

119
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,620
This is the last stop on our Småland trip
that we are doing in collaboration with Visit Småland.

120
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:19,060
All our stops are on a link in the video description,
if you're curious about any of our stops in these 4 vlogs.

121
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,360
- Yes.
- Check it out, if you want to.

122
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,200
Check it out.

123
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,700
- "Yes."
- "Yes." "Check it out."

124
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,220
This is where we are staying.
Here is mom and dad's room.

125
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,820
Here is the living room.

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,640
- And an upside down Harry.
- Yeah.

127
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,140
Here's the kitchen, and...

128
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,900
Here's mine and Harry's room.

129
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,400
- Please excuse the mess, we are on vacation.
- Yes. Excuse us.

130
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,920
And our tech stuff has moved
from the bed to the kitchen table.

131
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,600
Sometimes it's like this.
Here comes the camera Christmas tree.

132
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,960
- That's fitting, because we are in a mountain hut.
- Yes, exactly.

133
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Oh, right. This must've been
a mountain hut from the beginning.

134
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,360
Then this ski resort
was turned into a more summery place.

135
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,500
- They still ski here, when there's snow.
- Right, when there's snow.

136
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,640
It's a great resort, I must say. I like it.
It's nice that there's a lake nearby.

137
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,400
God, how nice.

138
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
It's super nice.

139
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:52,260
We are on this super cozy floating sauna.
Oh, that's bright.

140
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,560
It's still so hot outside.
It's like 6 PM.

141
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,800
In there is Alma, all cozy.
With a camera!

142
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,300
Will you jump in with it?

143
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,960
Oh, you splashed!

144
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,980
It was a bit cold on my feet...
It was a bit cold on my feet at the bottom.

145
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,760
Was it?

146
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,420
What a tricky face
you just made.

147
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,460
Oh, the castle face.
Show mommy.

148
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:53,180
This is what Gustav Vasa does.
(King of Sweden, 1523–1560)

149
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,480
- Can you add a picture of Gustav Vasa?
- Yes, I can.

150
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,460
Harry was super kind. We walked past the front desk,
and he said: "Daddy needs some snacks".

151
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,780
He knows exactly
how to charm me.

152
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,780
The chipsomaniac.
You have a weird shadow on your face.

153
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,480
Give me some Pringles.
Thanks.

154
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:24,140
- There are lots of people over on the beach.
- Indeed. Lots of families.

155
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,800
Now it'll be very good
to eat some food.

156
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,280
Harry and Axel got burgers.
Alma got...

157
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,140
- Potato pancake.
- Just like me.

158
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,760
Then you can go and play
in the really fun park right next to here.

159
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,820
Yay!

160
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,860
Harry, wait for me!

161
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,280
- I said no.
- You said no?

162
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,020
This is going to be scary.

163
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:59,660
I thought we could summarize Småland,
instead of answering a Question of the Day.

164
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,080
Yes. Beautiful, I think.
Very beautiful.

165
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,400
- Yes. Lots to do.
- So much to do.

166
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,120
Great for families.
And we say that from our heart.

167
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,640
Many lovely swimming lakes.
Lots of Swedish fika spots, everywhere.

168
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,080
They love Swedish fika and sugar!

169
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:26,520
We didn't film it much, but there are fika spots,
waffles, ice cream, pastries and candy everywhere.

170
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,400
Mixed with flea markets
and small towns.

171
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,940
And gnats.

172
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:38,720
Yeah, there's an extreme amount of gnats right now.
I'm trying to stand still but my body just wants to, like...

173
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,840
Thank you for watching this video!

174
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,880
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

175
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,200
Leave comments, ask questions
and have a great summer. See you again soon!

176
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Bye bye!
