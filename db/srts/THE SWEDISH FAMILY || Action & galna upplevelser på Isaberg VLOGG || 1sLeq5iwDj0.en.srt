1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,960
Hello.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,360
- Hello.
 - Hello.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,140
- Where are we?
 - We are in Isaberg, in Småland.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,220
Yes.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:22,240
- And what do you see behind, then?
 - Our house and dad, which packs his backpack.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,400
Isaberg is a ski slope in the winter.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,240
And now in the summer you can do lots of fun action activities here.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,840
Very cool!

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,940
We came here yesterday and then it was full of mountain bikers everywhere.
 You can go up to the top and cycle down.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,160
We should not.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,960
- I can't.
 - No I know.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,760
If I cycle very fast, I will be so scared so I fall.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,340
Oh yeah ... but what should we do now, then?

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,580
- High -altitude course!
 - Yay!

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,940
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,300
We start the day at high altitude.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,240
- Camera mounting in progress.
 - Yeah.
 Thanks, Alma.
 How nice.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
- Are you nervous?
 - No.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,920
- It's pretty high.
 - It will be great fun.

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,960
- How professional they look.
 - Right?

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,780
It looks like they are going up and folding trees or pulling electricity into any post, or something.

22
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,140
- Daddy, when do you put on your suit?
 - Soon.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,860
- We are ready!
 - Yes!

24
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,280
Yes, yes, yes I have the coolest suit, wow!

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:58,500
I got a green helmet because I have the world's biggest head, so now I really look like a watermelon.

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,940
- Are these the steps to climb up?
 - Right?
 Worst watermelon.

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,960
We will have a review now, Harry.

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,900
These are great, because you can't open both at the same time, so you will always be locked with at least one.

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,180
Good, is not it?

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,620
If you look at these locks, at the cabin hooks, you see which one is open and which is locked.

31
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,900
The one that is like a C is open and the one that is like a U is closed.

32
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,500
Now I have one that is open, and then I can't unlock the other.
 It only goes halfway.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,820
So you are always stuck up there.

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,460
The arrow against the magnet, and press firmly.

35
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,280
Then you see that it is also locked, and then you will get rid of the other.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,440
Press the button and pull it against the wire.
 You don't have to use your fingers.
 So, then it unlocks.

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,760
(Harry) pull up and pull down, pull up and pull down ...

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,800
Oh, I happened to hit the camera.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,300
(Alma) Harry, stop now.

40
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,620
- Oh, someone is a little taken over.
 - Yes ... we'll see how it goes, this.

41
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,100
Now Harry will try.

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,560
Connect you again.

43
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,060
- Here, or?
 - mm.

44
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,260
Okay.

45
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,220
Where does the little rope hang?

46
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,760
- Here it is.
 - Thanks.

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,580
(Alma) Be careful!

48
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,780
Beware ...

49
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,600
Don't do that when we're out on a real track.

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,900
- Okay.
 Can we everything now?
 - Yes.

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
- Are we ready for the first course?
 - Yes.

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,320
- It's a bit scary to be a solo twig, without an instructor.
 - Yes, it's a bit jerky.

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:03,900
Now you just have to.
 From this low height, up there ... there, good people.
 Here we go!

54
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,420
Here we go!

55
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,520
Okay ... This was a bit difficult.

56
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:25,180
- (Axel) Oh, what fun!
 Worst sled.
 - Yes indeed.

57
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,440
Alma is Santa Claus!

58
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,880
- Are you ready?
 - Yes.

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,380
Run, then!

60
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,240
♪ Prince Ali, which magic, aliababa ♪

61
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,920
It feels like I'm too heavy and will fall down.

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,120
Help, oh, help!

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,040
Now I'm going to skip to the next.

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:38,180
It's ... half -hard to go and film ...

65
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,220
But what do we do because you get to hook at home.

66
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,440
What do you think of the high altitude track?

67
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,300
- Great fun!
 - Perfect!

68
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,580
- Very funny.
 - It was really fun.
 And really warm!

69
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,180
Yes, extremely hot.

70
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,300
We had to go in and sit down and have lunch.

71
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,840
Usually, like Swedish, you always sit outside when the weather is nice, but it is almost too hot.

72
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,820
I know you can't say so, but yes ...

73
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,300
Yes, Alma got almost a little sunbathing there for a while.

74
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,180
Now we will test something we have never tested before, but which at least I am very embarrassed.
 What do you feel?

75
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,760
Me too!

76
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,240
- I'm really nice.
 - Rodel!

77
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,740
Yes, Rodel!
 Summer rod.
 The track is there.
 I turn the camera.

78
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,520
- There.
 - Woho!

79
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,900
- Come on, friends.
 - We are running!

80
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,960
- Mom, should we drive one?
 - We will sit an adult and a child in each ...

81
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,640
Okay, I want to sit with dad.
 Dad is so kind.

82
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,760
- Do you want to sit with me, then?
 - Okay.

83
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,280
- I'm pretty kind too.
 - Yes.

84
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,740
You go up there, then you turn around at the top and go down.

85
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,080
It looks like a roller coaster, roughly.

86
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,420
The camera is mounted.
 We are ready.

87
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,200
- I think you should fasten you.
 - Oh, just that.

88
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,820
- Hello.
 - Hello.

89
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,880
- Have you gone before?
 - No.

90
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,760
- Do you get in the belt?
 So yes.
 - It feels very important.

91
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,320
- On the way up you don't have to do anything.
 - No.

92
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,080
- It's too tight.
 - Well.
 It's too tight, she says.

93
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,140
Rather too tight than too loose, Alma.

94
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,460
- So.
 - Thanks.

95
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,300
That said, on the way up you don't have to do anything.

96
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,060
And when you are at the top you pull out the levers, then it is full gas.

97
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,540
Then you hold there.

98
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:20,060
If you want to slow down you release a little, you decide your speed on the way down.

99
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,180
- Yes.
 We run the highest speed, huh?
 - mm.

100
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,520
- Let's go.
 - Thank you thank you.

101
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,640
(Harry) Dad!

102
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,580
(Alma) This will be exciting!

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,620
Dad, jump on.

104
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,880
- Alma, how loud is that?
 - How do they dare to ski down there?

105
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,340
- Are you prepared?
 - Yes.
 Are you prepared?

106
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,580
- I'm ready.
 - Are you really sure?

107
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,260
- Yes.
 - Are you really?

108
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,960
Are you really that?
 Are you?

109
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,620
The gas forward.
 Now we drive, Harry!

110
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,880
- Are you really ready?
 - I'm ready.

111
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,160
Are you really that?

112
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,720
"Forbidden to stop", "accelerate" it says.

113
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,620
- The rowing was absolutely insanely funny.
 - Super fun.

114
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,940
- It felt, in the curves, like you would fly out.
 - Yes, it did.

115
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,280
So it was a creepy moment in that.

116
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,740
So, it was a curve that I never really dared to keep full skewers in.

117
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,620
- Full gas.
 - Yes, full gas.
 It was a bit jerky, actually.

118
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,200
It's fun that there is so much action here.
 I get some new Zealand vibes.

119
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,060
Yes indeed!
 A little rotorua ...

120
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,820
Yes!
 So here it was in New Zealand - nature place and lots of action you could do.

121
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,260
- mm, this ... swing.
 - Yes exactly.

122
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
And the Zorb ball.

123
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:53,660
- We just test a few things here, there is much more.
 - (Harry) Wieee, I go cable car, wieee ...

124
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,860
- Golf, all the Mountain Bike tracks, and so on.
 - Yes.
 Of course.

125
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,620
This is the last stop on our Småland trip that we do in collaboration with Visit Småland.

126
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:11,680
All our stops are on a link in the descriptive text,-

127
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,780
-If you are curious about any of the places we visited in these four vlogs.

128
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,360
- Yes.
 Yes.
 - So check it out if you want.

129
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,200
Check out.

130
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,700
- "Yes."
 - "Yes."
 "Check it out."

131
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,040
This is how we live.
 Here is Mom and Dad's room.

132
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,820
Here is the living room.

133
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,640
- And an upside down Harry.
 - Yes.

134
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,320
And here is the kitchen, and ...

135
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,900
Here is mine and Harry's room.

136
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,400
- You can excuse the mess.
 We are on vacation.
 - Yes.
 Excuse us.

137
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:05,100
- And the technology has moved from bed to the kitchen table.
 - Yes.
 So here it is sometimes.
 Here comes the camera Christmas tree.

138
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,120
It fits, because we are in a mountain cabin.

139
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,980
Yes, but exactly.

140
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,160
Yes exactly.
 This must have been a mountain cabin from the beginning.

141
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:20,360
And then this ski resort, as it was from the beginning, has redone and become a little more summery.

142
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,500
- They also run skis here, when there is snow.
 - Yes exactly.
 When it's snow, yes.

143
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:31,640
A great facility, I must say.
 I like it.
 Nice with a lake nearby.

144
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,400
God, what a nice.

145
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
It's super nice.

146
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,260
We are on this awesome sauna raft.
 Oh!
 What a light.

147
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:59,060
So, it's still so hot.
 It is six o'clock in the evening.

148
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,960
In there, Alma sits, and cozy.

149
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,280
With a camera!

150
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,300
Should you jump in with that one?

151
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,960
(Harry) Oh!
 You splash!

152
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,620
It was a little cold on your feet.

153
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,980
It was a little cold on your feet ...

154
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,920
- Was it?
 - ... at the bottom, so I got a little ...

155
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,640
What a pillemary mine you did.

156
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,460
Oh, now you made the castle minute.
 Show for mom.

157
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,740
This is how Gustav does Vasa.

158
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,480
- Can you put on a Gustav Vasa image?
 - Yes I can do that.

159
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,460
Harry was super nice.
 We went past the reception, so he said, "Dad must have some snacks".

160
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,780
He knows exactly how to charm me.

161
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,780
- Chipsoman.
 You get a strange shadow on your face now.
 - Oops.
 So there.

162
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,480
Give me chips pringles.
 Thanks.

163
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:24,140
- There are a lot of people away at the bathing place.
 - Really.
 Many families.

164
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,800
Now it will be very good with some food.

165
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,280
Harry and Axel have burgers.
 Alma has ...

166
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,140
- Raggmunk.
 - Just like me.

167
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,760
And then you can go and play in the really fun park that is right next to it.

168
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,820
Yeah!

169
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,860
Harry, wait for me!

170
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,280
- "in said no."
 (I said no) - "You Said No?"
 (You said no?)

171
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,020
(Harry) This is going to be jerky.

172
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:59,660
I thought we could take care and summarize Småland, instead of today's question.

173
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,080
Yes.
 Beautiful, I think.
 Really beautiful.

174
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,400
- Yes.
 Much to do.
 - Very much to do.

175
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,120
For family, top.
 And we say that from the heart, that is.

176
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,400
Many lovely bathing lakes.
 A lot of coffee, everywhere.

177
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,080
Yes, they love coffee and sugar!

178
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:26,520
We have not filmed that much, but it is like coffee cottages, waffles, ice cream, pastries and sweets everywhere.

179
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,400
Mixed with flea markets and small towns.

180
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,940
And knob.

181
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:38,720
Yes, now it is extremely bump.
 I try to stand still, but my whole body just wants to ...

182
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,840
Thanks for watching this video!

183
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,880
Feel free to leave a thumbs up, or down.

184
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,200
Comment, ask questions and have a great summer, and we will see you again soon!

185
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Bye!
