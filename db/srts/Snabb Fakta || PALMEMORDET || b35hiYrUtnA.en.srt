1
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:25,850
It is February 28, 1986. We are in Sweden's capital Stockholm.

2
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:42,050
It is 23:15 in the evening and two people who have just been to the cinema Grand on Sveavägen 45 and seen the movie Mozart the movie is now starting to walk home.

3
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:52,600
These two people were not anybody, because it was Sweden's then Prime Minister Olof Palme and his wife Lisbeth Palme.

4
00:00:53,266 --> 00:01:03,100
They walk along Sveavägen south and when they come to Adolf Fredrik's church street they cross the way and continue the walk.

5
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:11,200
When the clock beats 23:21:30, what happened that didn't happen.

6
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,950
The couple was now at Tunnelgatan at a store called Dekorima.

7
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,633
Suddenly a man shows up behind the couple, in his hand he has a gun.

8
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:42,783
The thunder of two shots that go by oaks through the streets this February evening.

9
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:54,783
The first shot hit Olof Palme in the back The second shot turned his back on his wife Lisbeth.

10
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:07,166
The perpetrator flees the place up the stairs towards Malmskillnadsgatan and then down the street of David Bagare before he disappears without a trace.

11
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:15,516
Palme falls lifeless down to the ground, the shot had killed him immediately.

12
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:28,333
After the shots were fired against the Palme couple, the first call came in to the alarm center 23:22:20.

13
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,983
And the talks continued to roll in to the alarm center during the evening.

14
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:21,900
This whole event would raise so many questions, questions that people would ask themselves for several years to come.

15
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,900
What really happened?

16
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,383
Why would anyone want to kill Sweden's prime minister?

17
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,766
And above all..

18
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:35,833
Who murdered Olof Palme?

19
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:51,100
To summarize the course of events after Palme was shot, the following things happened:

20
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,216
23:24, the first police patrol arrives at the scene.

21
00:04:56,216 --> 00:05:03,250
23:28 Palme is picked up by an ambulance and taken to Sabbatsberg Hospital.

22
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,450
00:06 So Palme is declared dead at the hospital.

23
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,916
His wife Lisbeth had managed with minor injuries, the ball had just turned her back.

24
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:24,116
00:20 Sweden's National News Agency TT sent out a Flashtellegram with the text “Olof Palme is dead”

25
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:34,533
00:45 So Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson arrives at Rosenbad, that is the building where the government is located.

26
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:46,933
01:10 At night, the music was interrupted in Sweden's Radio and instead the voice is heard by the report Jan Ström which reads the following message to the public:

27
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:12,350
Since this message was broadcast in the middle of the night, the majority of Swedes were completely unaware of what had happened.

28
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:18,800
But now the hunt for the killer of Sweden's prime minister was underway.

29
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,783
The day after the murder happened, they began to investigate the crime scene.

30
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:39,100
Unfortunately, they did not find much trace of the perpetrator, but they found the two bullets that were fired.

31
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:50,016
One bullet was found in the morning on March 1st the day after the murder on Sveavägen's western sidewalk.
 It was the ball that had turned at Lisbeth's back.

32
00:06:50,816 --> 00:07:02,650
The second bullet was found on March 2nd at the Jalusigallret to the stairs leading down to the subway on Tunnelgatan.
 It was the ball that killed Olof Palme.

33
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:12,416
The bullets were of the type .357 Magnum metal piercing from manufacturer Winchester western.

34
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:21,333
The weapon itself used by the killer is not entirely clear, but the most common weapon used for this type of ammunition

35
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:25,866
is a revolver from manufacturer Smith & Wesson.

36
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:36,616
But there are also other manufacturers of weapons with the same type of caliber.
 For example.
 Colt, Ruger & Co, Taurus and others.

37
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:44,366
Unfortunately, the bullets were in far too poor condition to determine exactly which weapon was used.

38
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:48,900
But despite that, there are some theories about which weapon may have

39
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:58,600
been used for during the murder occurred, there were between 10-13 weapons of the right type that were theft-signed.

40
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,783
And the weapon that is perhaps best known is the Mockfjärds revolver.

41
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:19,233
This revolver along with 91 cartridges of .357 Magnum was first bought altogether in Luleå by a private person from Haparanda.

42
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:25,050
The weapon was later stolen in connection with a burglary in 1983.

43
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:35,900
The weapon was later used at a robbery against a post office the same year in Mockfjärd in Gagnef municipality in Dalarna.

44
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:43,483
During the robbery, a shot was fired.

45
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:58,050
When analyzing the ball it showed that the ball and even the ball found on Sveavägen that murdered Palme

46
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:06,500
were manufactured for one and the same time and were sold in Sweden in the late 1970s.

47
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:16,433
Mockfjärds revolver was found in 2006 in Djursjön approximately 1.5 miles from Mockfjärd by two private divers

48
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,433
Benny Gustafsson and Ove Jansson.

49
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:28,600
The revolver who had been a great interest in the police and sought for 20 years was found in about 3 hours

50
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,716
of two private divers hired by Expressen.

51
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:42,183
Unfortunately, the weapon was in just too poor a condition because you could decide whether it was the murder weapon or not…

52
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:48,316
Another weapon that was of interest to the police was: "Sucksdorffsvapnet".

53
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:56,616
The same type of weapon that must have been used in the murder, stolen at home with filmmaker Arne Sucksdorff in 1977

54
00:09:56,616 --> 00:10:05,500
And the man who stole the weapon claims he sold it for SEK 2000 at the "Old Bowler" pub, which is now known as Norra Brunn.

55
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:22,400
During the investigation, the police have tested 788 different weapons to try to find similarities to the bullets fired on the Palme couple.

56
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,683
Unfortunately, it is basically impossible to know which weapon has been used.

57
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:37,066
But before we continue I have to

58
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:46,316
In 1986, the Internet may not exist in Sweden yet, but it does now and as you probably know, the Internet is everywhere.

59
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:57,000
When you are surfing the web, your internet provider sees what you do and what you are looking for.
 Like a small uninvited guest that you have not asked for.

60
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:06,350

Go to nordvpn.com/snabbfakta and use the code quick facts

67
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,750
Then - back to 1986.

68
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:04,733
After the police interrogated all the witnesses who were around the crime scene that night, a description of the perpetrator was sought.

69
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:15,366
The murder must have been committed by a man who was between 175-190 cm long.
 The man should be between 30 - 50 years old.

70
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:21,833
The man had a dark jacket or rock and a cap or a hat on his head.

71
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:31,216
According to some witnesses, the man moved clumsily and limped forward.
 According to other witnesses, he moved smoothly and easily.

72
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:35,650
Okay, so we have a description of the perpetrator.

73
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:46,450
On March 6, 1986 - thus about 1 week after the murder, the police had produced a phantom picture of the perpetrator.

74
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:57,216
After the phantom image was published in almost every news magazine throughout the country, the tips began to hail in to the police.

75
00:12:57,216 --> 00:13:05,200
The phantom picture gave between 7000 - 8000 tips to the police.

76
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:11,733
However, this phantom image has afterwards been very questioned.

77
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:22,983
It is based on a testimony from a person who was in Smala alley, about 350-400 m from where the murder happened.

78
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:32,066
According to the witness, it was between 23:30 - 23:40 when the witness saw the possible perpetrator.

79
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:45,400
Since the murder took place 23:21, this time span between 23:30 and 23:40 is, according to a later police investigation, far too late for it to be likely.

80
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,166
Today, you don't even think the Phantom image represents the killer.

81
00:13:50,950 --> 00:14:01,000
Anyway, the police have followed a lot of different tracks over the years to find the one or those who murdered Olof Palme.

82
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,416
Remember that this video is a summary so I will not go through any possible perpetrators and tracks,

83
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:15,100
But we look at 3 of those who have been highlighted a lot in the media and they are:

84
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,333
"The 33-year-old"

85
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,566
“Christer Pettersson”

86
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:22,566
"Skandiamannen"

87
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,450
If we start with the 33-year-old.

88
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:32,283
The 33-year-old was a man named Victor Gunnarsson.

89
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:43,566
He really hated Olof Palme.
 He was a member of the "European Workers' Party" - an organization that was very critical of Olof Palme.
 He also liked weapons.

90
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,500
He also liked weapons.

91
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,250
The tip about the so-called 33-year-old came to the police the day after the murder.

92
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:28,150
One woman told me she had been to a cafe named Mon Chéri on Kungsgatan at 22 the same night as the murder happened.

93
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:34,933
During the time he spent at the cafe, the man had talked loudly about his hatred against Olof Palme.

94
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:44,016
Several other people must have also advised the police about the same man and they have also mentioned the "33-year-old "'s Palmehat.

95
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:51,133
On March 8, 1986, he was picked up by the police and taken in for questioning.

96
00:15:51,133 --> 00:16:00,383
He was released the same evening but already 4 days later he was taken into interrogation again and now the police began to become suspicious.

97
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:11,783
He told me in the interview that he was at Mon Cheri the same night as the murder took place.
 In the cafe he had talked to 3 different women and even 2 men.

98
00:16:11,783 --> 00:16:20,616
After that he had gone to the cinema Rigoletto to watch a movie and after the movie was over he went to McDonalds on Kungsgatan.

99
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:30,600
The two men he had talked to at Mon Chéri stated to the police that Gunnarsson left the cafe between 23:00 - 23:30.

100
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,850
The police also found tracks on Gunnarsson's jacket which indicated that he had recently fired a weapon.

101
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:43,383
However, you do not know if it was the same type of weapon used against Palme.

102
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:53,383
He was arrested on March 17, 1986 for about 3 weeks before he was on the loose again.
 There was no concrete evidence.

103
00:16:53,383 --> 00:17:00,166
In July 1988, the preliminary investigation was closed.

104
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:09,733
Then we come to Christer Pettersson.

105
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:24,250
Christer Pettersson was known to the police since before.
 He was an addict of, among other things, amphetamine who was sentenced to closed psychiatric care in 1971 for a knife trail.

106
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:33,616
He had stabbed a person to death on Kungsgatan in Stockholm.
 He was declared well after 1 and a half years and released.

107
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:48,816
He was questioned by police on May 28, 1986, 2 months after the murder of Palme where they wondered, he was during the murder night on February 28.

108
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:56,683
According to Christer Pettersson himself, he had visited a club on Oxtorgsgatan called BK Oxen.

109
00:17:56,683 --> 00:18:02,316
He arrived at the club around 19:00 in the evening and went home at 22:00.

110
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:11,716
He went to the Central and took the commuter train to Rotebro.
 He was at home in his home at 23:30 and went to bed.

111
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:17,450
In the morning he went and picked up the newspaper and then got the knowledge of the murder of Olof Palme.

112
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:31,733
However, the police were very suspicious of Pettersson and about 1 year later, tips began to fall into the police that Christer Pettersson was similar to the Phantom image that the police had previously published.

113
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:46,383
He was called in for questioning several times and on December 14, 1988, Lisbeth Palme pointed out Christer Pettersson as the perpetrator in a recorded testimony.

114
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:59,783
A witness confrontation is a measure that the police can take when investigating a crime and has a strong suspected offender and wants to investigate whether a witness can recognize the perpetrator.

115
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:11,900
Then you can, for example,
 Set up several different people in a row without saying which of them is suspected of the police.
 Then it is up to the witness to point out the perpetrator.

116
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:19,450
After Christer Pettersson was designated by Lisbeth as her husband's murderer, Christer was arrested and

117
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:30,083
In July 1989, Christer Pettersson was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme.

118
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:36,500
And there the mystery of Olof Palme's murderer had been resolved…

119
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,650
.. at the moment anyway.

120
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:49,383
Pettersson appealed the verdict to the High Court and on November 2, 1989, Christer was released due to weak evidence.

121
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:59,466
It came out during the court proceedings that Lisbeth had been told before the witness confrontation that the suspect was an alcoholic.

122
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:11,250
Everyone in the witness confrontation was also police, except Christer then.
 And that all police officers had black shoes, while Christer had white.

123
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,950
Lisbeth had then said - "Yes, you see who is an alcoholic."

124
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,183
Then it was so that ...

125
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:29,116
There was no technical evidence showing that Christer was even at the murder scene.
 And one could also not show that Christer had had any motive to kill Palme.

126
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:40,000
And then we come to the third offender in this video.

127
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,566
Stig Engström - Skandiamannen

128
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:49,183
Stig Engström was a graphic designer and advertising consultant at the insurance company Skandia.

129
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:53,800
He was a member of a shooting club and also knew a weapon collector.

130
00:20:54,366 --> 00:21:02,266
Skandia's head office was at this time on Sveavägen 44, right next to the murder scene.

131
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:13,466
Stig was interrogated on March 1, 1986, the day after the murder.
 His description of the murder night is as follows:

132
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:20,600
He had quit his work for the evening and went home at 23:20.

133
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,783
When he was on Sveavägen south, he hears a bang about 20 meters away.

134
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:33,783
Then he sees a person lying on the ground and blood on the ground and that there were people around.

135
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:41,216
When he arrives, Lisbeth tells him that the perpetrator had a dark blue cover jacket.

136
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:45,783
Police arrive at the scene and ask "in which direction?"

137
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:55,700
Stig, who at the time sat down stands up and points with the whole hand towards the tunnel and says "in that direction!"

138
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,833
Then Stig finds that he might have mentioned something about the dark blue cover jacket.

139
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:11,266
Stig then runs after the police officers he has seen running into the alley, without catching them.
 The police were gone.

140
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:14,033
He then returns to the crime scene.

141
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:23,866
He himself believes that the signal element left afterwards, that they are looking for a man with a dark rock and cap can apply to him.

142
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:27,716
Because that's what he was wearing during the evening.

143
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:40,483
According to Stig, he remained at the crime scene for a while before returning to Skandia about 23:40.
 He called his wife, took a coffee and then took the night bus home.

144
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:47,250
What makes his statement a little suspicious is the following:

145
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,866
According to Lisbeth, she has not talked to a man at the crime scene as Stig describes.

146
00:22:52,866 --> 00:23:02,133
According to the police at the scene, they have no memory of Stig who pointed with the whole hand or even that Stig has talked to one of the police.

147
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:09,266
And according to witnesses, no one has even seen him at the crime scene.

148
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:18,350
So what did he really do during the 20 minutes between 23:20 and 23:40?

149
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:25,716
Many of Stig's friends and relatives describe him as a person with a great need for confirmation.

150
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:34,516
He exaggerated and often spread his stories.
 He spiced his stories a little extra to portray himself as a little better.

151
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:42,466
So it may be that Stig is trying to portray himself as a bit of a hero in this context

152
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:48,116
Or could it be so ... that he tries to mislead the cops?

153
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:57,100
It was discussed in 1986 by members of the police investigation into Stig Engström was a possible perpetrator.

154
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:05,583
But he was put aside and the suspicions against Stig cooled off while the police focused on other tracks.

155
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,250
34 years later.

156
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:26,716
The police investigation into who murdered Olof Palme is the largest police investigation in Sweden's history and even one of the largest police investigations in the world.

157
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:32,900
Over 90,000 people have been in the investigation.

158
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:38,766
10,000 people have been interrogated and many of them several times.

159
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:49,383
22,430 different tracks have been examined and 788 different weapons have been shifted.

160
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:59,283
134 people have admitted the murder, of which 29 of them have admitted directly to the police.

161
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:07,183
After 34 years, the police finally had an answer to the question that everyone asked.

162
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:21,250
On June 10, 2020, the police and the Prosecutor's Office held a press conference in which they presented the person whom they suspected murdered Palme.

163
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:27,083
And it was ... Stig Engström, Skandiamannen.

164
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:31,883
And how did you find that Stig Engström was Palme's murderer?

165
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:43,000
It is based, among other things, on the fact that no witness remembers Stig from the crime scene and that parts of his story about what happened during the murder night were very unlikely.

166
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:55,566
But .. You did not present any murder weapon that may have been used and there was no technical evidence against Stig and no witnesses had also pointed him out as a perpetrator ..

167
00:25:55,566 --> 00:26:00,366
But despite that, he was still suspected as Palme's murderer.

168
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:05,283
But one could not prosecute against Stig anymore.

169
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:12,033
Why?
 Well, because he died 20 years earlier in his apartment when he was 66 years old.

170
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:16,150
And you can't prosecute a dead person.

171
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,150
So the investigation was closed down.

172
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:33,516
The designation of Stig Engström as Palme's murderer, of course, received harsh criticism from all sorts of different directions and the conspiracy theories if the murder is still flowing.

173
00:26:33,516 --> 00:26:38,116
The murder may remain a mystery to many.

174
00:26:38,116 --> 00:26:47,516
Whoever was printed by the revolver at Tunnelgatan that night, there is one thing that is certain.

175
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:54,033
When the ball left the pipe, the Swedish history changed ..

176
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:57,033
..forever.
