00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.360
In tonight's semi -finals of IFS ...

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.880
... quiz about all culture in Sweden:

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.720
The Syrian on the run from Özz Nujen - Filip Dikmen.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.920
Humor legend from Degeberga - Petrina Solange.

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.360
The world's Swedishest Arab - Elaf Ali.

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.600
Landskrona's most attractive Palestinier - Farah Abadi.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.120
The Somali radio pirate - Assia Dahir.

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.200
The dancing Korean Gold Detective Hanna IS Golden.

9
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.960
She goes humor ping pong between Gbg and London - Evelyn Mok.

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.400
The character chameleon from Botkyrka - Thanos Fotas.

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.080
Long as a flagpole, always with punchlines in progress: Ahmed Berhan!

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.480
IFS, the program with longer life than Filip Dikmen's music aid career.

13
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.640
It is time for the semi -finals in the quiz about all culture in Sweden.

14
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.000
Our semi -finalists:

15
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.000
The man who was so chill that we gave him another chance - Anders.

16
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.920
Her winning skull took her ... the influencer from Hofterup - Emelie!

17
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.040
The man who does not need any presentation-IFS amon from Uppsala.

18
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.240
Patrick!

19
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.800
- Anders, who do you want to talk to?
 –Evelyn.

20
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.000
If you have a green hat a Chinese friend can ask you to take it off.
 Why?

21
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.360
Because you look like a stupid.
 No, this is how it is.

22
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.960
In Chinese culture, colors have different meanings.

23
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.800
You have red when you celebrate something, so you usually have red at a wedding.

24
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.520
White has a funeral.
 So if you have green it means -

25
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.280
- That your partner has been unfaithful.

26
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.840
- Do you have a color for that event?!
 - It's great.
 Then you know!

27
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.920
If the guy has been unfaithful, you put on the hat - and then everyone grabs.

28
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.880
- You say: "We're talking about it later."
 -Yes.
 And then maybe you have to lie down.

29
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.400
-What are you saying?
 - Yes, what do I say?

30
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.000
- I think ... she is lying.
 - You think she is lying.

31
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.640
You don't think a green hat means your partner has been unfaithful?

32
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.840
It's true.
 It's true.

33
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.560
A green hat means that the partner has been unfaithful.

34
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.160
"A man whose wife has been unfaithful" -

35
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.280
- Bli in Chinese "to wear a green hat".

36
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.360
Do you have a color for "What the fuck is that wrong on you"?

37
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.080
It's the same as your eye color, Filip.

38
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.640
–Emelie, you who rip green ... - I start looking ...

39
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.040
- You Pult is green.
 -Ah!

40
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.000
–Emelie, who do you choose?
 –Alaf.

41
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.680
You are an Iraqi writer.
 Another is Saddam Hussein.

42
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.560
-What?!
 - Nice transition!

43
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.240
One of his books stands out a bit.

44
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.720
–Mein Kampf.
 -It is called El-Mein Kampf.

45
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.000
We both stand out.
 I am an Iraqi writer who writes in Swedish.

46
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.480
Saddam Hussein writes, or then wrote, with his blood.

47
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.000
He has a Qur'an written with his own blood - the "blood chore".

48
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.800
But how much blood was it?
 That's how he died.

49
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.400
Americans tried to murder him.
 He just: "I have a few lines left!"

50
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.240
I think it must be false, because he is a very special man -

51
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.960
- So it hadn't surprised me.

52
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.360
He used his blood, not the Kurds - it was still nice.

53
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.840
Elaf ...!

54
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.920
Pam-Pam-Pam, Elaf!

55
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.200
I say it's false.
 I think so.

56
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.080
- You think Elaf is lying?
 - I don't want to believe it.

57
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.680
But there will be no point, because Elaf did not lie.
 What Elaf said is true.

58
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.600
It's totally sick.

59
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.160
It's true.
 The blood chore is correct.

60
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.720
It has been discussed how much is in Saddam's blood.

61
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.720
He must have donated 27 liters of blood in two years.

62
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.640
It was rather three liters of blood mixed with chemicals.

63
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.840
Patrick!

64
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.120
-Welcome!
 Who do you choose?
 - Filip.

65
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.360
This picture is known all over the world.
 What does it represent?

66
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.920
It is a figure used, among other things.
 As a refrigerator magnet-

67
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.840
- And symbolizes the Palestinian people's struggle against Israel's occupation.

68
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.640
It's not just a refrigerator magnet.
 Some use it as a tattoo.

69
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.080
- I think it's false.
 - You don't want to trust Filip?

70
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.320
No.
 There are no symbols in.

71
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.760
-You thought a McDonald's logo?
 -Just.
 Sodastream and stuff.

72
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.480
You got an applause for your joke, but no point for your reply.

73
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.200
It's true.
 The picture we just saw adorns many homes and some bodies:

74
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.400
It symbolizes the struggle of the Palestinians.

75
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.120
It represents Naji al-Ali who was allowed to leave his home and means--

76
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.360
- That he cannot grow up until he returns.

77
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.960
- Anders?
 -Thanos.

78
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.920
You are on vacation in Greece and see this.
 What is going on?

79
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.720
It's not Greece, the man.
 That is Hornsberg's beach.

80
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.760
When Ronna invades Hornsberg ...

81
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.440
No, what we see here ...

82
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.440
... it is a Greek ritual that men do when they have been unfaithful.

83
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.360
They are allowed to jump in the water and swim.

84
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.800
They come to the cross and kiss it.
 It is a form of confession.

85
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.040
- Why are you so obsessed with infidelity?
 - The wives in green hats are watching.

86
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.120
Their Chinese wives ...

87
00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.760
After all, it was all of Greece's male population that jumped in. Seriously.

88
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.200
I think it's false.

89
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.800
They don't compensate for their infidelity?

90
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.120
Shunon has been in Greece.
 Congratulations, a point.

91
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.240
It's false.
 This is a Greek thirteen -day tradition.

92
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.080
A priest throws a cross into the water and you should find that.

93
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.600
The winner is said to have luck and blessing for the rest of the year.

94
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.560
Emelie?

95
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.600
I want someone who understands me: Petrina.

96
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.880
- What was the Senegal village for something?
 - It's Yasin village's little brother.

97
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.000
No...

98
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.480
Senegalbyn was a human zoo on Gröna Lund in the past.

99
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.720
They took people from Senegal and put them there.

100
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.800
People went and looked at them.

101
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.280
They thought, "If we can't go to Africa, we may take Africa here."

102
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.960
And we came!

103
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.960
And that village then developed and became if's ...

104
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.800
- A human zoo.
 Unpalatable but true.
 - How long has Gröna Lund been around?

105
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.440
- It was sick human view ... - This was Black Lund.

106
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.800
In Gröna Lund, everyone is just unfaithful.

107
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.760
- I hope it's false.
 - I want to.

108
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.840
But it's true.

109
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.520
That is sick!

110
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.120
Gröna Lund had the exhibition Senegalbyn -

111
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.280
- Where Swedes looked at real Senegalese.

112
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.520
Then they went to Gambia.
 We know what happened after that ...

113
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.920
But this was true.
 So unfortunately no point to you.

114
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.280
Patrick ... who do you choose?

115
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.080
We drive ... Farah.

116
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:13.080
Farah!
 In 2018, the National Board of Health released a brochure that was noticed.

117
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.480
People lacquered on it.
 What was it about?

118
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.080
They asked Dad to stop going to Tunisia and get married and have children.

119
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.520
It was enough with seven.
 True.

120
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.440
No ... but that ...

121
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.080
Here, trauma is processed.

122
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.120
They released a brochure called "Hustla Soc is Haram".

123
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.040
They wanted to reach your target group and show that contribution fraud is illegal.

124
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.200
It was criticized for pointing out immigrants as a contributor.

125
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.440
- "To hustle ..."?
 - "... soc is haram."

126
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.560
I think it's great.

127
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.680
-What do you think?
 - That is true.

128
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.360
You think you released the brochure "It's Haram to Hustla Soc"?

129
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.240
It's haram that you think so.

130
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.560
Unfortunately, it is false.

131
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.040
It would have been an incredible brochure!
 But it wasn't that brochure.

132
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.920
It was a brochure that was about child marriage:

133
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.560
"Information to you who is married to a child."

134
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.400
"That Hustla Soc is Haram" is great.

135
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.360
- They should do one.
 - They should only change laws to Haram.

136
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:47.080
- Then people will start following them.
 - Is it just Muslims who are rooted?

137
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.640
Listen, Södertälje has made Sweden change so many laws -

138
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.560
–P.G.A.
 Your businesses!
 Södertälje has just released the information -

139
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:04.040
- That their district court is driven by someone from the Södertäljen network.

140
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.280
Okay, Anders.
 You have received a letter - a letter from Botkyrka.

141
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.720
Here it smells like immigrants.
 Come along!

142
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.480
-Hello!
 Hello everyone!
 -Hello.

143
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.680
You want to be good looking in the suburb, because then you can be called a cat.

144
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.920
But are you ugly - are you called a bird then?

145
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.600
Do you call an ugly person a bird?

146
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.720
Skata maybe, but you mean bird overall?

147
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.320
- False.
 - Anders ... it went like a treasure.

148
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.080
- You got no points.
 It's true.
 -Wait what?!
 !

149
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.560
- DOGGE just comes up with it.
 - Dogge cuts with the cap on.

150
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.000
Applaud if you heard "bird - ugly".
 /A few applodes/

151
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.200
Applate if you have never heard it.
 /Most applause/

152
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.000
Ahmed.
 Sorry, in this case we feel sorry for Anders.

153
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.760
According to the jury ... Whether a few have heard it ...

154
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.320
- I had given points.
 -No.
 Right must be right.

155
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.760
- But we are the blasts here!
 - Learn Swedish then!

156
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.440
- But he said ... åsödertälje District Court ...

157
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.320
That's him!

158
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:54.800
Okay.
 That was the question you got.
 It is a minority that heard it before.

159
00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.600
There will be no point, but you are a Buddhist so take it with a heel kick.

160
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.360
- In tried!
 –Emelie?

161
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.120
Assia ...

162
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.640
Director Hayao Miyazaki, which is behind films such as Spirited Away -

163
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.000
- Ville make her own version of a Swedish film.

164
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.200
A gay version of fast cash.
 So fast cash.

165
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.160
Sorry, what a bad thing.

166
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.840
No, what he actually wanted to do was -

167
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.280
- An elevated, animated version of Jönsson League.

168
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.280
But it became a little difficult because he wanted to depart from the original.

169
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:48.640
He wanted to change the name of Dynamit-Harry to Kamikaze-Kim and hold on so.

170
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.280
The rights holders said no.

171
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.480
It would have been a rather exotic version.

172
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.840
I choose to believe that it is true.

173
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.840
You say the Japanese director wanted to do ...

174
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.480
—... his own version of Jönsson League.
 - Can we get points now?
 Please?

175
00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.920
No!

176
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.640
You Kamikaze-Kim, your score.

177
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:23.240
He wants to make a Japanese version - but by Pippi Longstocking.

178
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.280
Patrick, how was the response after the first season?

179
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.120
-Fairly good.
 - Treaty pussy?

180
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.720
- If you take a point, you move on.
 –Yes.

181
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.920
The last panelist is Hanna.

182
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.200
Vamos Lá!
 Para-Papa-Papa-Papa-Papa

183
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.480
Para-Papa-Papa-Papa-Papa

184
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.000
Pa-para-pa-para ...

185
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:04.560
This Brazilian song is prohibited in Brazilian radio.
 Why?

186
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:10.920
It was too bad.
 But here in Sweden, bad Latin songs are zumbahits.

187
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:17.400
So it was a hit here.
 No ... in 2020, President Bolsonaro banned the song -

188
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:24.000
- For its antibrara, anti-Christians and gay-friendly messages.

189
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.720
Like "para-paper-paper-papa-pary-papa-papa".

190
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.040
- I think it's true.
 - Because you agree with Bolsonaro?

191
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.240
- I think it's true.
 - You think it's true.
 Yes.

192
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.040
He just ignored my question.

193
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.520
You choose to believe that it is true.
 It means no point to you!

194
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.040
Sorry, patrick.

195
00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:01.280
It's false.
 The song is prohibited on Brazilian radio - for other reasons.

196
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.680
"Rap Das Armas", "Rap if weapon" is a Brazilian proibidão-song-

197
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.200
- which is forbidden to be played on radio as it praises weapons and crime.

198
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.280
In this case, they sing about the laws' takeover against the police.

199
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.080
There was no point.
 - It was a lot of luck for you, Emelie.

200
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.440
Now we will run a rash question: the closest win.

201
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.400
When Jews, Sami, Roma, Swedish Finns and Torneda's were recognized ...

202
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.920
–... as national minorities?
 - Do you love them?

203
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.280
Are you ready?
 How about you showing them at the same time?
 3 ... 2 ... 1!

204
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.520
–Oj ... –2021?

205
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.080
null

206
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.720
- It's always later than you think.
 - All time before!

207
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.640
Always later.

208
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:06.720
Should we give them a little "drum role"?
 - The correct answer to the question is ...

209
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.560
... 1999!

210
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:18.680
Congratulations, Emelie.
 - Patrick!
 Always a delight to see you.

211
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:24.320
You two have moved on to the next round, so we'll see you in the duel.

212
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.280
You know how it goes?
 - Anders, the panelists you get to talk to are:

213
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.160
Petrina and Assia.

214
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.640
Bugg is called Sweden's national dance.
 Romania's national dance has a name.

215
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.720
-Which one?
 - The dance is called "Dansul Suedez".

216
00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.680
And why does it do that?
 It is then translated into "the Swedish dance".

217
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.480
This is because in the 17th century Sweden and Romania had ...

218
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.040
... great trade relations ...

219
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.840
They have had incredible contact with each other.

220
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.520
And after that Romania has had a great love for Sweden.

221
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.680
Many countries love Sweden.
 Poland!
 Sweden is mentioned in Poland's national anthem.

222
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:36.360
No that is not true.
 This dance is called whore.
 It is spelled so - "whore".

223
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:42.640
So if you are in Romania and someone says "whore!"
 Should you not be sad.

224
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.440
They offer.

225
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.520
- But in Swedish it will be strange.
 - It may be p.g.a.
 your outfit.

226
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.520
It was the most sophisticated way I heard someone say "whore".

227
00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.760
- Can't you say it again, Petrina?
 -Whore!
 But it is spelled "whore".

228
00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.440
- Book it.
 -WHORE.

229
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.480
So it is spelled!

230
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.840
So if you hear one a Romanian in Sweden say to their children "your little whores!" - -

231
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.840
- Then he means "your little dancers! You are so nice and dance so nicely."

232
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.640
-What are you saying?
 - Giant.

233
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.360
Glad you are starting to understand the concept!

234
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.600
I believe in Petrina.

235
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.200
You think the dance we saw is called "whore"?

236
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.080
-Whore!
 - You are doing absolutely right.

237
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.280
Congratulations, Anders!
 You got a point.

238
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:52.640
Anders listed it.
 We have never had a good relationship with Romania!

239
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:59.440
The dance whore is a kind of ring dance performed on, among other things.
 Wedding and children's baptism.

240
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:05.920
Emelie, now we run your duel.
 You get to talk to Thanos and Farah.

241
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:17.120
In the small Jämtland town Mörsil, the establishment Mcdragan opened.

242
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.840
- What did they offer?
 - I don't think it's called as you said.

243
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.880
- Mörsil?
 I don't think so either ... - it is spelled that way but pronounced "whore".

244
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.560
What did they offer on the McDragan?

245
00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.920
It was a strip club that was opened by a man named Dragan.

246
00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.240
He called the strip club something that everyone can recognize.

247
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.240
Mcdragan.
 "I'm Loving It" he had as the slogan as well.

248
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.640
- Where do you recognize the mcragus?
 - From McDonald's.
 You drive past ...

249
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.840
You get hungry.
 Sometimes you choose drive through, sometimes you sit there.

250
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.200
Sometimes you bring the children and wife, sometimes not.

251
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:16.440
No, it was a sports shop.
 They sold adidas pants, slippers and t-shirts.

252
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.280
- There was what I got?
 - It's your options:

253
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.520
A store for three Stros-enthusiasts-

254
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.720
- or a strip club ...

255
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.880
- You don't make it easy.
 - Have you met jugs?

256
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.520
-I have.
 - The stereotype, how do they usually dress?

257
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.760
And where do they usually go?

258
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.200
- I invest in the McDragan.
 - As a strip club?

259
00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:02.480
You believe in Landskrona's pride Farah - that the McDragan is a strip club ...

260
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.680
- Better than an adidas store, as well.
 -Really.

261
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.400
It gives you a point.
 Congratulations!

262
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.720
Dragan Bratic has opened several strip clubs.

263
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.160
In Mörsil, as Farah said, he had the slogan: "Mcdragan's - I'm lovin it".

264
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.080
The strip club was located on the old enriched Brinkeboda Wärdshus in Mörsil.

265
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:36.000
We will return to Anders.
 You should talk to Filip and Elaf.

266
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:46.200
Filip and Elaf!
 What does the Kurdish expression "Qozelqort" mean?

267
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:51.280
"Qozelqort" is Kurdish.
 It is their word for "prosit".

268
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.880
- What you say when someone sneezes.
 - Atjoo!

269
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.960
Exactly.
 So "Qozelqort" ...

270
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.480
Verbatim it means "dust in the nose".
 "Qoz el Qort" - "Dust in the nose".

271
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.040
So one of the seven dwarves is called Qozelqort?

272
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.960
It's only seven Kurds!

273
00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.160
I think Elaf can “qozelqort” -

274
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.800
- For "Qozelqort" is an expression of "shut up".

275
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.080
Verbatim it means "drink poison".

276
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:34.520
Elaf ... - Tell me, Anders: "Qozelqort!"

277
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.160
Elaf!

278
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.840
- Anders?
 - It was awkward.

279
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.720
My two colleagues are Kurds ...

280
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.880
When you get to work: "You know we are Turks, huh?"

281
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.480
It will be embarrassing.

282
00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.280
I believe in Filip.

283
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.640
You got a point.
 Elaf tried to sell it well.

284
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.880
Qozelqort means "shut up", "Drink poison".

285
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.440
I've heard it before.

286
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.240
Emelie, now it is exciting, because now the winning skull has to come forward.

287
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.400
The ones you are going to talk to are Hanna and Evelyn.

288
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.880
Evelyn and Hanna, what are we looking at?

289
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.880
My ovaries.

290
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.280
—Obefruit ... — - a little moldy?

291
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.200
Yes exactly!

292
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.200
No, it's a Chinese delicacy.

293
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.200
It's eggs ...

294
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:53.520
... as you have kind of preserved in clay, ash, a little salt.

295
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.800
You leave it aside for a few years or a while.

296
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.960
And so it becomes that the white part of the egg becomes like jelly -

297
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.080
- And the protein part turns green because of the salt.

298
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.160
And they are called millennial eggs.

299
00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.800
"Century eggs", like my ovaries.

300
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.680
Why is so much Chinese food from the Fear Factor?

301
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:31.720
- You don't want to eat that.
 - This is Jamaican scented candles.

302
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.120
They are cast in eggshells and contain in addition to paraffin plant extract.

303
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.360
Hence the green color.
 Common in Jamaican homes, even as souvenirs.

304
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.240
You put it in the bedroom and light up ... the light!

305
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.000
And...

306
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:57.040
When you light the flame, it symbolizes that the guy can endure all the time.

307
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.720
The light burns for several hours.
 So ... "More Fire".

308
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.520
"More Fire!"

309
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.640
–Emelie?
 –Eh ... mm ...

310
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:15.400
I drive at Evelyn.
 - You lied to me last so you might be talking the truth now.

311
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.840
You said I should never trust a Chinese.

312
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.480
It took hard.

313
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.920
- Don't wear a Korean either!
 - You choose to believe in Evelyn.

314
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:37.160
That it is millennial eggs.
 It is right!
 You do that right in that.

315
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.120
Emelie, you got one more point.
 That's what Evelyn described it.

316
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:48.200
It's a delicacy, millennial eggs.
 But who cares about it?

317
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.320
It will be a rash question because we have had two fantastic semi -finalists.

318
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.040
But only one can move on to the final so we will drive closest to win.

319
00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:08.360
What year did the Swedish-Iranian Arash release his first hit "Boro Boro"?

320
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.840
- Boro Boro ... - I thought some of you hummed!

321
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.960
Have!
 Have!
 Have!
 Have!

322
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.080
Boro Boro ...

323
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.640
You got flashback to the Harem Nights nights ...

324
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:34.760
Are you ready?
 Do you have an answer ready?
 You show off your paintings on 3 ... 2 ... 1!
