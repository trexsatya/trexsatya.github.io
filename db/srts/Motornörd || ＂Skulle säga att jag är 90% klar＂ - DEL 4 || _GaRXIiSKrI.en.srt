1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,730
When there is a lot to show on this building now.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,550
Looking forward to showing all Kalle Duck Secrets.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,479
I'm going to build a camper and do it with a different approach.

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,789
Like to be a little inventor and generally crazy

5
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:23,639
So I've gone all in on crazy ideas.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,239
Hello Hello!

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,739
Hi Douglas!

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,879
How's it going?

9
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:29,869
Now it's good.

10
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:33,020
It was heavy a week ago.

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,380
Then I was pretty stressed.

12
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,849
The heat that has been here has not made it easier.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,639
I am so happy that it is overcast now I can say.

14
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:43,970
It is almost thunder in the air so that it is now possible to breathe.

15
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:48,630
Now it is working and now I am almost done.
 It's nice.

16
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,554
Almost finished you say.
 Yes!

17
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:51,560
What does that mean?

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,650
Deadline and the budget I have withdrawn on this project,

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,030
But it usually belongs.

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,270
May 1 was set like my soft deadline and now it's last June.

21
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,580
So one week to approximately need me.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,270
Then I'm done to go.

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,989
I would say i'm 90 % ready another week, say 95 % finished

24
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:14,860
And the last thing I do during the journey so that a week, ten days

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,930
Something is the plan.
 Then I stick.

26
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,029
But have you slept in it yet?

27
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:24,430
Well, it's now that everything happens.

28
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:29,069
I have built the last week, ten days that

29
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:32,080
I have done surface layers on it.

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,260
It's Thursday today and on Monday I was

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,480
And also inspected it.

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,000
It is now that everything happens.

33
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,190
Wonderful congratulations!

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,019
Thanks!
 It's nice to have that bit over.

35
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,800
I have set a deadline for myself that was not.

36
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,239
About any real reason.

37
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:57,940
Not just because I want to push myself.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,029
It has been good and spurring.

39
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,200
But now, now that I pass on May 1st and that it was June 1st

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,810
so there are very many who have been on me

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,729
And it has become a stress feeling.

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,779
I knew you would miss this deadline

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,839
from the first day.
 I also.

44
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,189
It was far too much work.

45
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,559
But the hat off!

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,759
You have done a fantastic job!

47
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,529
Even though I haven't seen it see it on the inside yet.
 I'm so damn curious.

48
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:27,139
I have closed again and do not want to show anything.

49
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:30,929
I want to watch the reaction video to it.

50
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:35,169
But before we go in and look so, so some stuff has happened.

51
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,789
On the one hand, you have no pressure left.

52
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,559
No, the letters are gone.

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,009
On this page I have a few left on the other side.

54
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,509
It has been by far the most boring on the entire building.

55
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,419
There are two colors on a light blue, dark blue and the dark blue.

56
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,564
The sticker surface has crackled in the sun so you can pick square millimeters by hand.

57
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:01,213
With the nails do not go at all.

58
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,478
Doesn't it work with razor blades either?
 No.

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,729
The problem is not that they are stuck.

60
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,839
The problem is that it is so brittle.

61
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,570
It crackles.

62
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,419
It is five times five square millimeters pieces that one gets away regardless

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,099
What technology you use.

64
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:24,019
But I have tried with razor blades I tried with chemically dissolve rubber pulleys,

65
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:29,369
As you grind away and everything works and everything takes exactly the same time.

66
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,659
It doesn't matter what technology I use one

67
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,429
and half an hour per letter to get it away

68
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,599
And I have no patience.

69
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,879
Is there so much else you need to do so it's an eternal job

70
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,009
that never ends.

71
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,679
Besides now that I've removed it, the cabinet is so matte of oxide

72
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,919
And behind it so you have stickers that are bright

73
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,949
And it is not possible to remove.

74
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,750
I have tried polish clay, I have done everything possible.

75
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,600
It ends with me having bought color and I come and paint.

76
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:04,796
Look what geeky!
 Fy phase what bold!

77
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:10,490
Each battery has its own information display

78
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,250
to show the charge status on it.

79
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,619
So it's 14 kilowatt hours like a Nissan Leaf in battery capacity

80
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:21,070
SisÃ¥d is 4-5 times as much as you usually have normal.

81
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,959
You have 2500 watts on the roof, which is also three times

82
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,959
More than people usually have.

83
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:30,639
There is an excess of energy.

84
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,910
That was the idea from the beginning.

85
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,000
And I thought it was so fun to drive it up there.

86
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,170
It was great fun!

87
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:44,299
130 kilos weigh the batteries and hydrome pistons

88
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,089
Draws 150 kilos each, they pallets.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,940
The spoiler is left to plastic.

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,540
But that wasn't that the Star-Link would sit in it?

91
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:57,989
I have also slaughtered it.

92
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:02,510
The Star Link is motor controlled on a 3-foot.

93
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:06,979
But when I remove that mechanism, it's just Parabol itself

94
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,519
The surface I saved.

95
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,290
The one in turn is only five inches thick and as I will fold into the spoiler

96
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,989
So it gets fixed in horizontal position.

97
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,269
So it is simplified and.

98
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,240
Wondering how many people in the world are like butcher Star-Link?

99
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,250
I can say that surprisingly many on youtube

100
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,529
Have I learned a lot.

101
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,380
They start to go in and solder about components and so on

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,100
So that people can geek down in all subjects.

103
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
On this page I have.

104
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,489
I have an electric bike in the garage for longer tours

105
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:47,269
And then my plan is that when I get somewhere in Europe

106
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,549
Then I take the scooter and raise what to ask.

107
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,399
This is Durk aluminum that I have powdered.

108
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,640
It could not agree but mounted there an hour ago.

109
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,850
I have it down here too.

110
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,429
On the underside of the box.

111
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,089
It is like a design thing that you should have the dark

112
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,420
Because it is the same as it is on the back of the dock.

113
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,850
And you have fixed new hub caps as well.

114
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,919
They came there yesterday.

115
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,179
Big difference for a small money.

116
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,470
It does a lot for freshness and the whole.

117
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,799
There you have the key.

118
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,169
A and B are on the key.

119
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:29,269
Yes.
 Remote control.

120
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,630
It is not possible to sneak with that opener anyway.

121
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,940
No, it's a winch for a quad bike.

122
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:48,209
It is very strong and works great, but it is definitely not quiet.

123
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,779
The quality is not the best on it.

124
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,429
Then it is the disadvantage that it sits on the back of the bed,

125
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,109
So it's basically a drum that sits on a wall only.

126
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:01,089
It has been silent it has been quieter.

127
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,919
When you are at some campsite we'll go five in the morning

128
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,829
and wake half the neighborhood.

129
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,649
They have to take that.

130
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:13,989
The floor here on the door is art material called Eva.

131
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:16,709
Eva plastic or Eva rubber.

132
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,809
It is a substitute for teak

133
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,478
which is endangered and you have to devastate it longer.

134
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,970
Used on large luxury hunts and so on.

135
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,450
Has this type of material instead of the teak.

136
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:33,970
It's soft to go on.

137
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,339
It is soft and it is not slippery when it is wet.

138
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,820
It's easy to keep clean.

139
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,320
You can even take it if it has been given color on dirt.

140
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,970
On it you can take sandpaper and sandpaper away the dirt.

141
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,649
It is superbly good material.

142
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,250
It is certainly very expensive material?

143
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,139
No, it is mainly 3m double -sided tape that comes on a roll

144
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:59,160
Just buy a 70 wide I think it was three meters long roll

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,609
As you roll out it just self -adhesive.

146
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,170
It was very simple and smooth.

147
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,519
In the garage I want to try to squeeze in some features even when I sit outside.

148
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:13,380
I will be jawing.

149
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:19,359
Also fold down we have a kitchen table where you have a seat.

150
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,089
Again, it is 95 % clearly what is left to do

151
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,009
will do during the journey.

152
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:30,839
One of the examples is that the underside of the table,

153
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,100
What you see now is done.

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,400
But I will make the surface of the table in burnt wood.

155
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,559
Same as I have on the kitchen table inside the car as well,

156
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,609
So I will do it during the journey.

157
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,169
The first part is that you sit and take one berred together with someone

158
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,960
and then because I am about to tinker and stuff

159
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:55,130
And need to fix so you have to have a workbench too.

160
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,359
So then you can do so that you continue to pull it out.

161
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:04,320
Here I will have hanging off the tools and putting a screwdriver.

162
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,489
So here it is like a workbench and because there I have storage.

163
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,710
It is four and a half meters of box that I have the opportunity

164
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:14,200
to have storage in.

165
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:19,340
One -third of the kitchen floor I use all the way to

166
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,280
to almost all the way to the back wall.

167
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,030
This is an electric bike.

168
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,450
Yes, it is an almost legal electric bike.

169
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:35,429
It is just over 250 watts, rather EU mop in performance,

170
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:37,979
But it is really easy to carry.

171
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,400
It is collapsible, but I do not need to fold it in the middle.

172
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,110
It is a detachable rule.

173
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,880
What is the range of things like this?

174
00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:52,429
I have tested it without treading and it does somewhere around 50 km/h

175
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,039
So it is about five miles reach.

176
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,740
Not so much bike left of it.

177
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,685
Think it will cycle something?
 Or will you just slide around.

178
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,070
The tramps are only symbolic.

179
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,140
I have three transport opportunities and the truck is one.

180
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,900
If you are in a small town small town, it can be crowded and booky.

181
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,020
I have the electric bike for long excursions, the scooter for short quick travel

182
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:24,119
Around different purposes with them.

183
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,280
But you have a regular interior door for the front door.

184
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,010
Inner door because I have the back tilp to fold

185
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:36,922
So it is technically speaking in, it is inside.

186
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:38,415
Welcome Tom My Crib!

187
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,746
Here it was cold!

188
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:46,100
I have on the AC so it gets cold

189
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,570
Don't know what to start somewhere.

190
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:48,850
Where do you want to start?

191
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,520
We can start with planning.

192
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,809
Everything that is from waist height down and down is micro, concrete,

193
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Concrete on the cabinets.

194
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,780
It is a girl in VÃ¤rnamo who has started a company

195
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,130
Who has helped me with that bit.

196
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:09,539
It's so looks like concrete, it feels like concrete.

197
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,590
It is a concrete although you apply as color.

198
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:18,059
It is also flexible and you can paint around round corners

199
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,170
And everything.

200
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,530
I love concrete so it's really cool to have it on all the cabinets

201
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,960
Then all horizontal surfaces, powder coated sheet,

202
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:32,099
Everything up to every 3D cork I am happy with it creates.

203
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:39,610
Without it, it is a very soft sound in here.
 So the feeling now is a bit biased

204
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,159
But the feeling you come in is more apartment than a camper.

205
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,809
One of the reasons for everything taking such time

206
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,909
Is that everything is handmade.

207
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:50,580
I have not bought ready -made cabinets for there are no cabinets

208
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,940
Which is in line with the dimensions I wanted.

209
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,270
Everything from doors to cabinets.

210
00:11:55,369 --> 00:12:00,469
The body and everything is handmade by me and it is an immense time.

211
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,090
Two pieces in the kitchen that are from IKEA.

212
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,240
That's the only thing that is bought.

213
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,090
Every gadget in here I have done to get what I want it.

214
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,309
Is it difficult to get it on film should you have an outdoor feeling indoors?

215
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:22,930
After all, it is Moldak's modules that are LED panels with high resolution photo

216
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,700
In front that creates a feeling of skylights.

217
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,799
In the peripheral vision you get a volume feel.

218
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,220
But it is still just a common lighting.

219
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
The reason I have this is of course

220
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,910
Because I have covered the entire roof with solar panels.

221
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,700
There is no square centimeter to squeeze into a window.

222
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,669
And you have no window anywhere.

223
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,989
Without I have this outside the truck so we have

224
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,989
A campsite where we are standing now and this is my window out.

225
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,270
It is a bit strange that the surveillance over the toilets is right now.

226
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:06,660
It's just random.

227
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Parked is no coincidence but the problem.

228
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:11,030
I want the lake view, but it's busy

229
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,850
Of a lot of German motorhomes so there was no place for me.

230
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,049
I had to stand somewhere else

231
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,190
And then I end up in front of the toilet.

232
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,799
This is so when you are fifth on the ball.

233
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:27,040
Do you think of a good 140 wide in the box that I had

234
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,909
on previously a 120 bed.

235
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,890
So what has happened while I have lived in the box

236
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:36,309
is that I have learned very much from what works

237
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:40,780
and not working and it has made me have 120 bed in the box

238
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,830
When I discovered that 140 works.

239
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:45,270
I think it would be too crowded in the corridor, but

240
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:47,180
It will be just fine.

241
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,600
A wider bed and so I have removed ten centimeters

242
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,730
on the shower instead of a 90 wide.

243
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,890
Has an 80 wide.

244
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:57,150
It is good enough.

245
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,710
This in turn means I have ten centimeters

246
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,480
Wider kitchen counter.

247
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,280
So when I have lived in the box I have adjusted the drawing

248
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,380
So it has worked great.

249
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,650
Saw it on Youtube that the submarines have red light

250
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,989
Not to ruin the darkness so I did the same.

251
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,609
Now I extinguish here.

252
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:27,580
Then I have red led lights in two places

253
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,239
In the camper when you need to go to Pinka at night.

254
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,750
But the red light you find.

255
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,380
The fake wall I built expands 150 millimeters

256
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:46,869
and a side effect of it is that it looks like the air heat pump

257
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:49,735
is penetrated into the corner.

258
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:55,630
The invert to the solar panels get hot

259
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:59,350
and therefore I have a cooling directly from the AC

260
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,539
to an inverter that cools down the entire plant

261
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,330
So they cooperate.

262
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,270
In winter I have run air air heat pump with heat

263
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,890
So I have heat as well as any and the same thing now in the summer

264
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:14,989
Who cools just as well.

265
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,440
I am more than satisfied.

266
00:15:17,539 --> 00:15:20,739
It is almost the best on the entire building is the air heat pump.

267
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,789
The one in turn generates condensation water that I fill

268
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,179
and uses for drinking everyday.

269
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,530
Then we have the closet, what keeps it 95 % finished

270
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,630
And should be painted and clear.

271
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,410
So I do that on the journey.

272
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,460
So there's nothing I care about now,

273
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:49,059
Without it, I take it a rainy day in Poland when I can't try

274
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:51,159
To tinker with something.

275
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,369
However, we have.

276
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,010
This is the bathroom.

277
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,760
Should there be burglary here, no one finds the bathroom.

278
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,169
No, but you have no shower in the ceiling but you run with hand shower.

279
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:16,530
Then I have a loose shower curtain that you pull for.

280
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:20,869
The shower is pretty special because it is a hybrid solution.

281
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:26,010
When I shower I pull out in the closet,

282
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:32,320
Pulls out the refrigerator so I have room and can shower.

283
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,950
Now it was a strange sound.

284
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,180
This was a strange error.

285
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,599
Is good when you start driving around with that extraction fan.

286
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,000
The propeller blades are gone.

287
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,729
It's just the engine.

288
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,829
Where have the propellers gone?

289
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,339
Interesting.

290
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,939
Yes, it is a prototype.

291
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,390
The shower is a hybrid solution.

292
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,810
It has been an exciting adventure.

293
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,030
I have been very popular at Electric company so I took help

294
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,130
of they tear their hair in despair.

295
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:30,300
So what we have done now is a PLC programmed shower.

296
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:36,900
It has the opportunity to set both the time and the temperature exactly

297
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
Like I want it.

298
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,315
You have three buttons where the first one is the filling,

299
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,920
The other is the shower sequence.

300
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,816
The third is the emptying sequence

301
00:17:48,816 --> 00:17:51,760
So I want 17 seconds filling

302
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,859
to get two and a half liters of water.

303
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:00,459
If I set it with the right temperature, PLC is programmed and is quite unusual.

304
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,150
But it feels okay to shower that type of power center next door.

305
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,724
There are more who have said it.
 The electricity company calls it the death shower.

306
00:18:09,724 --> 00:18:12,670
They do not like 230 near the shower.

307
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,537
I think is messy.

308
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:20,770
No, I'm not worried about that, but the closest are the buttons.

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,199
Partly low volts and they are rubber -clad.

310
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:29,300
Then I will set a wall, an openable wall in front of the power center

311
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,369
So you stand and spray on it for something to happen.

312
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:35,469
You have to avoid that.

313
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,290
You can't go to the toilet unless you pull out the refrigerator.

314
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:42,589
Well, I have actually learned from this

315
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,579
That it is actually more space than you think.

316
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,040
I actually don't think I will pull out the fridge

317
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,580
As often as I had planned.

318
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,969
However, the wardrobe bit will of course go back and forth.

319
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:02,500
It is, as I said, that it works great.

320
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:07,119
And the need for the toilet in this is behind it.

321
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,540
Because it is the extra job to pull it out.

322
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,330
I don't think you care about that.

323
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,430
Especially not when you are in a hurry.

324
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,699
Then you have to prioritize other things.

325
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:25,450
This is my toothbrush and toothpaste and to make

326
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,260
themselves in order in the morning.

327
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,140
So there you have that part.

328
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:33,060
Directly left in the sink, you should wash and all this.

329
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,369
So this will be my bathroom.

330
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,430
Bathroom, separate toilet separately.

331
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,579
That's what I have to do now during the week.

332
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:46,199
The kitchen counter.
 The kitchen counter is the same.

333
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:50,790
Powder coated black sheet metal that is cut out for water and so on.

334
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:56,280
I got it today 3 hours ago so it remains in the car now.

335
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:59,004
Haven't been able to carry it yet.

336
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:03,930
But it is the final thing is related to the entire kitchen department

337
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:11,369
So it will be tomorrow's job the kitchen table that I talked about is burnt wood.

338
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:18,680
Powder coated steel sheet in the center and then you have the outer edge

339
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,660
with burnt wood.

340
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,540
For me, the bed and the tables are.

341
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,900
The two fixed points that I do not want to compromise with.

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,569
So therefore a large table and it is an extremely stable table.

343
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,699
It in turn means that when I work that way.

344
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,420
Folds the screen.
 Folds it out.

345
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,450
How can you sit and youtuba there?

346
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,630
Here I will sit and cut when I have more time.
 Looking forward.

347
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,770
How did it go for you to film during this project?

348
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:58,690
I have accumulated a lot of material and I have consciously chosen

349
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,180
Not to cut anything and not post anything

350
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,489
because it has been so intensely in the building

351
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:09,200
That I did not simply have come.

352
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,060
Without now as I go away, I grab the bit

353
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,709
And bet on Youtube your career.

354
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:20,790
I will share the link here too for now when I release this

355
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,679
so you are out traveling and have it cozy and stuff like that

356
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,619
And then you probably produce lots of materials too.

357
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,630
Yeah, I've started to put out material on it

358
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:36,109
and it is while I built the box so that the next change on the channel

359
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:40,060
Become the building of the motorhome and then change.

360
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:45,949
Another change later on will be more a travel related youtube channel

361
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,560
so the channel is the same, but the content will shift some neighborly dependent

362
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,349
on the fact that there are different phases of the trip.

363
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,180
Can you see you get angry and so there?

364
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,652
So I get angry.

365
00:21:56,652 --> 00:22:00,250
I have cut away everything like everything works on the first attempt,

366
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:03,329
As it always does in reality.

367
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,989
Where will be the first trip by the way?

368
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:08,089
Exotic.
 UmeÃ¥!

369
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:12,710
I'll be north and say goodbye and say goodbye to family and friends

370
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,930
And then I pull Norway south, down in Europe.

371
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,390
But I thought like this when you leave Sweden now,

372
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:23,849
Which you do soon and is away when you come back,

373
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:26,020
Then I want to know how it went, how you have been

374
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:31,229
And worked and how you met people and stuff.
 So please feel free to contact me then

375
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:32,960
So we do a follow -up to it.

376
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:38,390
Preferably because it may be interesting to see how the stuff holds together

377
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,489
And if it has become as I imagined.

378
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:42,859
I am extremely impressed!

379
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,815
Hat off!
 Thanks!

380
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:46,589
And good luck!

381
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:49,109
Great to be able to follow this, really.

382
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,979
It has been an interesting project and I have received very

383
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,670
Very new friends on the journey.

384
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,820
Very very curious people.

385
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,900
It's been fun.

386
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,310
Hello Motor Nerds!

387
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,790
Here is a short update.

388
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,339
I am in the northern Netherlands.

389
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,690
I have driven through Sweden a bit through Norway

390
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,630
And then through Denmark and passed Germany recently.

391
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,859
Have just found a motorhome in the middle of the central town.

392
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,800
It has been mixed results.

393
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,760
I have sabotaged a lot of things.

394
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,589
Things have been broken, I have had to rebuild and change

395
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:31,560
And that's part of the test process.

396
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,300
But on the whole it was very successful.

397
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,849
The difficult thing about the building I have discovered is to build just.

398
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,939
Some things are oversized and others are under -dimensioned.

399
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:43,690
And so it can be.

400
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,270
But I am very pleased.

401
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:48,520
We'll see if there will be more updates, but have gone!
