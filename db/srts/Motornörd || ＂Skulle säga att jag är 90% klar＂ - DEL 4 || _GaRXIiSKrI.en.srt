1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02.730
When there is a lot to show on this building now.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,550
Looking forward to showing all Kalle Duck Secrets.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,479
I'm going to build a camper and do it with a different approach.

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,789
Like to be a little inventor and generally crazy

5
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:23,639
So I've gone all in on crazy ideas.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,239
Hello Hello!

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,739
Hi Douglas!

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,879
How's it going?

9
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:29.869
Now it's good.

10
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:33,020
It was heavy a week ago.

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,380
Then I was pretty stressed.

12
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,849
The heat that has been here has not made it easier.

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,639
I am so happy that it is overcast now I can say.

14
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:43,970
It is almost thunder in the air so that it is now possible to breathe.

15
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:48.630
Now it is working and now I am almost done. It's nice.

16
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,554
Almost finished you say. Yes!

17
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:51.560
What does that mean?

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,650
Deadline and the budget I have withdrawn on this project,

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,030
But it usually belongs.

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,270
May 1 was set like my soft deadline and now it's last June.

21
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,580
So one week to approximately need me.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,270
Then I'm done to go.

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09.989
I would say i'm 90 % ready another week, say 95 % finished

24
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:14,860
And the last thing I do during the journey so that a week, ten days

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,930
Something is the plan. Then I stick.

26
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,029
But have you slept in it yet?

27
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:24,430
Well, it's now that everything happens.

28
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:29.069
I have built the last week, ten days that

29
00:01:29,169 --> 00:01:32,080
I have done surface layers on it.

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,260
It's Thursday today and on Monday I was

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,480
And also inspected it.

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,000
It is now that everything happens.

33
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,190
Wonderful congratulations!

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,019
Thanks! It's nice to have that bit over.

35
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52.800
I have set a deadline for myself that was not.

36
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,239
About any real reason.

37
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:57.940
Not just because I want to push myself.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01.029
It has been good and spurring.

39
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,200
But now, now that I pass on May 1st and that it was June 1st

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07.810
so there are very many who have been on me

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,729
And it has become a stress feeling.

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,779
I knew you would miss this deadline

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,839
from the first day. I also.

44
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,189
It was far too much work.

45
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,559
But the hat off!

46
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,759
You have done a fantastic job!

47
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,529
Even though I haven't seen it see it on the inside yet. I'm so damn curious.

48
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:27,139
I have closed again and do not want to show anything.

49
00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30,929
I want to watch the reaction video to it.

50
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:35,169
But before we go in and look so, so some stuff has happened.

51
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,789
On the one hand, you have no pressure left.

52
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:38,559
No, the letters are gone.

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42.009
On this page I have a few left on the other side.

54
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,509
It has been by far the most boring on the entire building.

55
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,419
There are two colors on a light blue, dark blue and the dark blue.

56
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,564
The sticker surface has crackled in the sun so you can pick square millimeters by hand.

57
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:01,213
With the nails do not go at all.

58
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04.478
Doesn't it work with razor blades either? No.

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,729
The problem is not that they are stuck.

60
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08.839
The problem is that it is so brittle.

61
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,570
It crackles.

62
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,419
It is five times five square millimeters pieces that one gets away regardless

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,099
What technology you use.

64
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:24,019
But I have tried with razor blades I tried with chemically dissolve rubber pulleys,

65
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:29,369
As you grind away and everything works and everything takes exactly the same time.

66
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,659
It doesn't matter what technology I use one

67
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,429
and half an hour per letter to get it away

68
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,599
And I have no patience.

69
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,879
Is there so much else you need to do so it's an eternal job

70
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,009
that never ends.

71
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,679
Besides now that I've removed it, the cabinet is so matte of oxide

72
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49.919
And behind it so you have stickers that are bright

73
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,949
And it is not possible to remove.

74
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,750
I have tried polish clay, I have done everything possible.

75
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,600
It ends with me having bought color and I come and paint.

76
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:04,796
Look what geeky! Fy phase what bold!

77
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:10,490
Each battery has its own information display

78
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,250
to show the charge status on it.

79
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,619
So it's 14 kilowatt hours like a Nissan Leaf in battery capacity

80
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:21,070
SisÃ¥d is 4-5 times as much as you usually have normal.

81
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,959
You have 2500 watts on the roof, which is also three times

82
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,959
More than people usually have.

83
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:30,639
There is an excess of energy.

84
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,910
That was the idea from the beginning.

85
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,000
And I thought it was so fun to drive it up there.

86
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,170
It was great fun!

87
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:44,299
130 kilos weigh the batteries and hydrome pistons

88
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,089
Draws 150 kilos each, they pallets.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,940
The spoiler is left to plastic.

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,540
But that wasn't that the Star-Link would sit in it?

91
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:57,989
I have also slaughtered it.

92
00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:02.510
The Star Link is motor controlled on a 3-foot.

93
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:06,979
But when I remove that mechanism, it's just Parabol itself

94
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09.519
The surface I saved.

95
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,290
The one in turn is only five inches thick and as I will fold into the spoiler

96
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,989
So it gets fixed in horizontal position.

97
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,269
So it is simplified and.

98
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,240
Wondering how many people in the world are like butcher Star-Link?

99
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,250
I can say that surprisingly many on youtube

100
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,529
Have I learned a lot.

101
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,380
They start to go in and solder about components and so on

102
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,100
So that people can geek down in all subjects.

103
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
On this page I have.

104
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,489
I have an electric bike in the garage for longer tours

105
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:47,269
And then my plan is that when I get somewhere in Europe

106
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,549
Then I take the scooter and raise what to ask.

107
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,399
This is Durk aluminum that I have powdered.

108
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00.640
It could not agree but mounted there an hour ago.

109
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,850
I have it down here too.

110
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,429
On the underside of the box.

111
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,089
It is like a design thing that you should have the dark

112
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,420
Because it is the same as it is on the back of the dock.

113
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,850
And you have fixed new hub caps as well.

114
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:17,919
They came there yesterday.

115
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,179
Big difference for a small money.

116
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,470
It does a lot for freshness and the whole.

117
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,799
There you have the key.

118
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,169
A and B are on the key.

119
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:29,269
Yes. Remote control.

120
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,630
It is not possible to sneak with that opener anyway.

121
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,940
No, it's a winch for a quad bike.

122
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:48,209
It is very strong and works great, but it is definitely not quiet.

123
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,779
The quality is not the best on it.

124
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,429
Then it is the disadvantage that it sits on the back of the bed,

125
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58.109
So it's basically a drum that sits on a wall only.

126
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:01.089
It has been silent it has been quieter.

127
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04.919
When you are at some campsite we'll go five in the morning

128
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07.829
and wake half the neighborhood.

129
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09.649
They have to take that.

130
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:13,989
The floor here on the door is art material called Eva.

131
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:16,709
Eva plastic or Eva rubber.

132
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,809
It is a substitute for teak

133
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:26,478
which is endangered and you have to devastate it longer.

134
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,970
Used on large luxury hunts and so on.

135
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,450
Has this type of material instead of the teak.

136
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:33,970
It's soft to go on.

137
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,339
It is soft and it is not slippery when it is wet.

138
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,820
It's easy to keep clean.

139
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,320
You can even take it if it has been given color on dirt.

140
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,970
On it you can take sandpaper and sandpaper away the dirt.

141
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,649
It is superbly good material.

142
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,250
It is certainly very expensive material?

143
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,139
No, it is mainly 3m double -sided tape that comes on a roll

144
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:59,160
Just buy a 70 wide I think it was three meters long roll

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02.609
As you roll out it just self -adhesive.

146
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,170
It was very simple and smooth.

147
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09.519
In the garage I want to try to squeeze in some features even when I sit outside.

148
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:13,380
I will be jawing.

149
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:19,359
Also fold down we have a kitchen table where you have a seat.

150
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,089
Again, it is 95 % clearly what is left to do

151
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,009
will do during the journey.

152
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:30,839
One of the examples is that the underside of the table,

153
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,100
What you see now is done.

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,400
But I will make the surface of the table in burnt wood.

155
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,559
Same as I have on the kitchen table inside the car as well,

156
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,609
So I will do it during the journey.

157
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,169
The first part is that you sit and take one berred together with someone

158
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,960
and then because I am about to tinker and stuff

159
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:55,130
And need to fix so you have to have a workbench too.

160
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,359
So then you can do so that you continue to pull it out.

161
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:04,320
Here I will have hanging off the tools and putting a screwdriver.

162
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,489
So here it is like a workbench and because there I have storage.
