1
00:00:02,464 --> 00:00:16,044
Many who start at universities come directly from high school.
 What is the biggest difference between high school and university?

2
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:22,817
There is very much own responsibility at the university.

3
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:28,587
Nobody will chatter on one when things are to be submitted, but you have to keep track of yourself.

4
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:33,593
But I think you get a lot of support in the beginning, on the civil engineering program.

5
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:41,004
You get a lot of help with the mat and you get good instructions on how the exam should go to and what tools you can have.

6
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:42,279
So you get a lot of help.

7
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:47,408
But then when you get into it you can not count on the same support.

8
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:53,412
So much own responsibility.
 What do you think Maja?

9
00:00:53,412 --> 00:01:03,067
On the teacher program we read one course at a time.
 So what is different is that you can focus on one thing at a time.

10
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:09,457
This means that you can immerse yourself in the subject and really focus on what you should learn.

11
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:16,199
I think it's good.
 Focus on one thing at a time and not 16 different subjects.

12
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:21,000
I will try to understand then when I come out as a high school teacher.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,654
But can't it be boring to just read one thing?
 Isn't it getting tired?

14
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:33,358
Each substance is still quite wide, e.g.
 religion.

15
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:40,967
The thing you read religious history to five different world religions, however, the pace becomes high.

16
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:50,580
Then you move on to eg.
 Bible science becomes the large areas of that subject.

17
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,878
High tempo but fun.

18
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:59,670
The subjects are then perhaps wider than you think of high school, so it will not be boring.

19
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,220
What did you experience as the biggest difference Alexander?

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:13,276
About the same thing.
 It is a lot of self -responsibility.
 There are compulsory parts, but you do not have to attend all lectures.

21
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:17,451
You have to spend a lot of your own time studying.

22
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:24,000
The biggest difference now is that you read things that you are actually interested in.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,290
In high school there were things that were a little less interesting, but you still had to read it.

24
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:42,806
But here you choose the subject because you are interested in it.
 Everything becomes relevant.

25
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:46,152
You read more fun things.

26
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:48,152
But is everything fun then?

27
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:53,245
There are things that are less fun of course, but that are still important.

28
00:02:53,245 --> 00:03:01,643
When you read 5.5 years you can specialize in as many different things as possible.

29
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:07,739
Everything will not be fun, but on the whole it is fun.

30
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:17,274
In high school you often know the teachers well and the classes are small.
 Is it so on lectures?

31
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:23,431
It may look very different.
 Some courses we only read the subject teachers together.

32
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:34,612
We read some courses with other programs as well.
 So sometimes we are 100 people and sometimes we are 30.

33
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:36,396
How's it for you ina?

34
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,379
I would say that we get close contact with our lecturers.

35
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:54,987
We are also different numbers, but often we have lessons in smaller groups, so you get close and get to know each other.

36
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,882
Is it so on the medical program too?

37
00:03:56,882 --> 00:04:03,390
It varies some.
 In my class there are about 150 people.

38
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,830
It will be a little difficult to have the same contact with the teachers you had in high school.

39
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:17,247
But we also have basic group opportunities, where we have supervisors who are lecturers.

40
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:21,066
So then you get closer to them.

41
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:31,955
Many teachers are part of so-called theme groups that design lectures and elements in the education.

42
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:41,371
If you are involved you can meet them, so there are many different ways to get similar contact as in high school.

43
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:48,200
Many teachers are very committed.
 There is always a conversation between teachers and students, which is important.

44
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,047
It sounds like it can vary between larger and smaller classes.
