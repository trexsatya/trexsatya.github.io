00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:04,729
  Hi, Elza here from Elza's bookshelf.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:11,806
I have been to the Book Fair and I have gone bananas. I bought, I don't know, wait to check, nine books.

3
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:16,529
  It's been a long time since I have bought so many books.

4
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:24,011
I think it is to compensate that I am a reading, because I comfort myself by buying books.

5
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:34,000
  You know that buying books and reading books are two completely different hobbies and I love them just as much and I have them just as much.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
  But now I think I show which books I found and found at the book fair simply and there are a lot as I said so we start at once.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,351
  The first book is a non -fiction book that I wanted to read for a long time and the author stood there, went ahead and said hello and asked if I could get a signed and I got that of course.

8
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:57,321
  I'm talking about the moms by Alexandra Pascalidou.

9
00:00:57,694 --> 00:01:05,000
Very nice like that, the whole page. It was really nice to talk to her, really cool.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
  She has just come out with the dads but I haven't read the moms yet so I thought I would.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
  I know it exists as an audio book too but this is a pocket so it can be quite nice but it feels very good to have it.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
  I feel that I am in a period that is starting to get hungry and snail at non -fiction books.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The second book I will show is a book I got because I bought the gold card and then you got a goodybag and in it there was a book.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
  It is a book that I have seen a little everywhere, songbirds by Christy Lefteri nominated 2022 for this year's book.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
  I don't know what it is about actually. It's about Cyprus anyway, maybe.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:04,000
  I have not read, I know she has another book that was quite popular too. You have seen a little here and there on Bookstagram and on Booktube.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
  But I haven't read anything from her. I think this one is so good looking so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it in the box simply.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
  I have said that I have kind of ended with Swedish decks but it is a writer like me ...

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
  I do not follow many writers on Instagram but I follow her and I am very curious about her books.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
  So I saw this and thought, okay, I give it a chance.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
  I'm talking about Anna Bågstam, the eyewitness.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
  This is the first book in her series. I don't know, brutal murder, Öresund we are.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
  It is a tempo and exciting dick that takes place in the Öresund district.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
  Harriet.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
  Honestly, this sounds like a classic Swedish cover that I've ended up with.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
  Which I just don't want anything more and read anything more.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
  But, but, I like the author and I have only heard good things about this one.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
  So I and Swedish decks are on a break and we start flirting with each other again.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
  Yes, me and Anna.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
  Then a book that I became overjoyed when I saw.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
  And it was no doubt that it should accompany me home.

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
  A Tunnis, which I have seen a little here and there.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
  But as my favorite Booktuber Books with Emily Fox.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
  She is chatting about this book, she thinks it's amazing.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
  And I'm sick of it.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
  I WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN MEN BY JACQUELINE HARPMAN.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
  Harpman maybe.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
  And this should apparently be some kind of dystopia.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
  A number of women are locked in the basement.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
  And then a lot of things happen.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
  Apparently you should not know much about this book more than that.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
  That it should be perhaps something feminist touch, as socially critical in that way.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
  In addition to being sick looking, it is thin.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
  And I have heard her chatted about this book.

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
  So I think I have to give her a chance.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
  And it sounds like a book I would like.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
  And I love when people say they don't know much about this book.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
  Just know this and read.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
  Then I immediately get curious and gladly pick it up.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
  So this one had to come home with me.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
  I have a relatively new favorite author and horror.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
  And I have read a book by her, which I have chatted about a lot on this channel.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
  And then I have read a short story collection.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
  And then I found another short story collection that I have not read.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
  I'm talking about Mariana Enriques and The Danger of Smoking in Bed.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
  A small short story collection.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
  Maria Enriques is she who has written our part of the night.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
  I love that book.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
  The horror that is so amazing.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
  Oh how good it is.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
  Oh god it is so good.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
  I recommend everyone to read it of course.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
  Although those who do not like horror can probably appreciate this one.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
  But it is incredibly unpleasant.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
  Trigger alert for a bit of most.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
  But it is so, so well written and so good.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
  And I have read a short story collection.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
  And now I own this one too.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
  The one I read was Things We Lost in the Fire.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
  And it is in Swedish.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
  Things we lose in the fire I think it's called in Swedish.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
  This I do not know if it is in Swedish.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
  But I have it in English and I probably want to buy this one.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
  The second short story collection that looks a bit like this one.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
  Fantastic.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
  I'm so peppy on this one.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
  A bit nervous.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
  But I love Mariana Enriquez's way of writing.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
  And her way of putting the mood on things.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
  It is an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,502
  I love her.

82
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:03,000
Another book I bought was also a bit of a chance.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
  But I've seen it a little everywhere and want to read it.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
  But I have been like this, I should not, I should not.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
  But of course I should.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
  We talk about The Seven Moons by Mali Almeida.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,111
  Shall we see. Shehan Karunatilaka

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
  I apologize so much that I slaughter this name.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
  Great name.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
  I apologize so much so much.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
  At least this one.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
  Check out how good it is.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
  Check out how good it is.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
  And this is the typical trope I like.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
  We can accompany Maali.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
  I think this person dies quite brutally.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
  But end up in the afterlife.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
  And there has this person, Maali has seven months.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
  Seven days, seven moons.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
  To be reconciled to the people she loves the most.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
  He loves most I even think.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
  And yes, it's vague.

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
  As you know, vaguely.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
  I think it's all about that.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
  I read a little quickly in the back page.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
  Got such a feeling.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
  Magical realism.

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
  After life.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
  Feeling.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
  And thought this seems to be a book for me.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
  I chance.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
  And so it says it's a book.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
  The Book Pricer 2022.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
  So this one won.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
  Book Pricer.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
  Price until 2022.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
  So why.

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
  Oh here comes a receipt too.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
  So why not anyway.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
  And so check.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
  I mean check.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,699
  Check it out.

123
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:37,000
Another chance?

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
  A book that I thought sounded so fun.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
  And I don't know.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
  I have said that I do not like cozy books.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
  But I've started.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
  Think they are right okay anyway.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
  At least this year.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
  So I found a book that seemed very fun and very funny.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
  And it's called.

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
  The cat who caught a killer.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
  By L.T. Shearer.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
  Maybe you speak it now.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
  I don't know that much more than that.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
  We can accompany a woman.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
  One.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
  In all cases.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
  A cat helps a woman solve a murder.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
  I mean the title says everything or how.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
  So I think so.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
  I think it seems so cozy.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
  And I enjoy reading.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
  Books with animals like.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
  Who has one.

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
  At least animals I like.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
  Who has as well.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
  Aben that has a chapter or a character and such.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
  And cats are cozy I think.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
  I am both a cat and a dog person.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
  And of course.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
  Must test.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
  Must test.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
  Okay next book.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
  I bought for two reasons.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
  Like the idea itself.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
  The title itself.

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
  You will grasp.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
  And.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
  The cover.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
  Look.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
  On this cover.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
  So I die.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
  How good it is.

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
  The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea.

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
  Axie Oh.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
  Oh maybe.

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
  Axie Oh.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
  Perhaps.

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
  Again.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
  Sorry.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
  Okay I don't know anything about this book.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
  It's fantasy.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
  I hope it.

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
  Check.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
  You see some fish and choices.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
  Here is a choice.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
One more choice.

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
  So.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,660
  I mean I'm lost already there.

181
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,409
  It feels like she's going to fall into the sea. Is about the sea.

182
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:24,000
  I do not know.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
  It sounds so.

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
  I chance.

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,473
  Check out how good it is.

186
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,574
  So it's at that level.

187
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:36,089
  In fact, I don't really know what this is about. More than it is very nice and the title attracts me.

188
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:45,067
  Another thing that I do not like is to back the text. When it's just a lot of quotes of people who like it.

189
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:50,475
  But what is it about. I do not know. It says so beautiful, she says this one. Enchanting says this one.

190
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:58,594
  Tale of blah blah says this one.But I so. What does it mean? And so it just stands. Don't Chase Fate. Let Fate Chase You.

191
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:05,000
  What does it mean? Where are we somewhere in this story? Who is it about?

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,545
  What happens?

193
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:10,715
  What should we solve? I do not know anything. And there is nothing.

194
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:12,832
  There is nothing.

195
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:15,000
  And then you should browse somewhere.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
  And find either back or here.

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
  There are a lot of things.

198
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
  But as I said I don't know.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
  I do not care.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
  It is good looking.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
  The title attracts me.

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
  It had to come home.

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
  So.

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
  So.

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
  Why do I have to explain myself?

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
  Why do I buy books?

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,517
  I bought it. It was fine. Let me be.

208
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:37,865
The last book, another non -fiction book that I really want to read and is curious about.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
  It is the Kurge track by Joakim Medin.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
  Sweden, Turkey and the price for a NATO membership.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:57,000
  This whole NATO process when Sweden wants to join NATO and Turkey make demands and say they have to disclose some of our citizens.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
  And what's going on there.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
  I am the very curiosity of this.

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,832
  How could we do that? I believed better about us. Sweden.

215
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:11,850
  I just think this seems so interesting. It happens so much.

216
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,000
  And I haven't heard much about this.

217
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
  And he has dug in this.

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
  The journalist.

219
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
  So I was curious and thought I would learn a little.

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,500
  A little general education simply.

221
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,000
  So corner.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
  There were a lot of books.

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
  All these I am super pepp to read and really curious to read.

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
  And of course I'm curious about which of these books you like.

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
  Who are you curious about?

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
  Who have you read?

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
  And what do you think about them?

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
  Help me somehow find a way in.

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
  Which one to start on.

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
  Come on that maybe I should show them.

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
  This is how you have them.

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
  Of course, as usual, I am very curious about what you think about them here.

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
  And if you have read any of them.

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
  We are heard in the comments section.

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
  We will be visible next Monday.

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
  Don't forget to give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel.

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
  If you don't already.

238
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
  Farewell.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
  Bye!
