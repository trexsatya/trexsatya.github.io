1
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.280
What will happen to me later, then?
 When you're gone, I mean.

2
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.400
How the hell should I manage?
 Can, for the hell I can just die too ...

3
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.640
Maybe I should go to the doctor again and ask for a second statement.

4
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.560
Imagine if they were wrong for the first time.

5
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.960
It does not hurt to ask for a second statement.

6
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.640
Leif, you haven't lied again?

7
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.600
This is not the first time you are lying that you are going to die.

8
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.680
Lied and lied ... maybe I drew a white lie.

9
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.640
So you are not going to die?
 For hell, Leif!

10
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.640
Take it easy.
 Yeah, I overreacted maybe-

11
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.560
-But the doctor said "change your liver".
 It can be interpreted freely.

12
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.880
My God, you are too fucking nymphomaniac!

13
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.080
-Hypocondrics, it's called.
 -You have lied about you to die.

14
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.360
I have stolen money from a fucking robbery and thought you are going to die!

15
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.120
But I'll die.
 Once, once I'll die.

16
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.800
All people die, so it might be good that you had to prepare yourself.

17
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.840
Yes, but ...

18
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.080
Yes, but sorry, then.
 Sorry for ...

19
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.720
I'm just human, me too.

20
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.160
Good morning, thick-Leffe.
 Did you sleep well?

21
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.840
Yes you, thick-leffe ...

22
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.880
I have been questioned by this new cop in Sörbäcken.

23
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.520
She has imagined that I am behind some fucking bank robbery.

24
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.520
The train station!
 Run, then!

25
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.200
I've robbed a bank!

26
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.200
I've never seen so much money.
 I have goose bumps in every corner.

27
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.080
Is it Biggest Loser final in town?
 Nämen ... thank you, Leif.

28
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.880
The banknote has a serial number.
 The banknote comes from the robbery in Sörbyn.

29
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.920
I got it in gear on the station.

30
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.960
Have you robbed a bank?

31
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.000
Are you absolutely sure it was him?

32
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.800
-What quick you were.
 -Police, open the door!

33
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.880
First you will give me the money.
 Then you can go to the police.

34
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.600
Although it is not possible.

35
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.440
The money is gone.
 The police took the caravan, and the money was there.

36
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.760
-Have I gone here unnecessarily?
 -No but...

37
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.920
What if I dump you in the lake?

38
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.040
Okay, the can, the money is.
 We have dug them down.

39
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.000
Have you seen!
 2-0 to albinon.
 Pack your stuff, so we get.

40
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.080
-What the hell did you tell you so?
 -I tried to buy us more time.

41
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.960
And pull out on the suffering?
 It's great.

42
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.080
Come on now, for the hell!
 Touch the fat pork.

43
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.640
Yes ... it was there.

44
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.400
Do you think I'm totally fucking stupid?
 I know you are trying to fool me.

45
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.000
Do you know what I do with such?

46
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.360
Do it then!
 You who should be so tough.

47
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.120
What the hell is it with you?

48
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.360
Move!

49
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.240
-What the hell is he talking about?
 -It's his liver.

50
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.440
-What is it for the liver on the liver?
 -It's totally fucking rotten.

51
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.120
The doctors do not want to give me a new one, so I have three months left.

52
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.040
Dad also died.

53
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.120
Yes, I regret.
 But it is just to like the situation and go home.

54
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.280
You can hope that you will be able to die before the Kronofogden takes the kitchen.

55
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.320
Do you have Kronofogden on you too?

56
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:28.280
Yes.
 If we do not fix 600,000 in a week, they will take the house from us.

57
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.440
Welcome to Leif Öhman's fucking pissuniversum.
 I just want to go home.

58
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.200
For hell, uhman ... Are you going to give up so damn easy?

59
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.360
The whole fucking life I have tried to fix food in mouth on us two-

60
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.480
-But now it's run.
 We are absolutely fucking pan.

61
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.760
For hell, where do you have the fighting glow?

62
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.800
You should die, and you intend to let the state take your house anyway.

63
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.600
I have a contact in Luleå who can fix some job for us.

64
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.920
It's not necessary.
 It will surely work out.

65
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.960
What do you think the father would have done if he had been given the same chance?

66
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.120
Would he give up and let the brother continue without a roof over his head?

67
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.280
-Do you want to die like a mes?
 -No, I don't want to die like a mes ...

68
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.800
What did you say?
 Do you want to die like a mes?

69
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.520
No, I don't want to die like a MES!

70
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.400
How nice.
 Then we go and talk to my contact.

71
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.760
I don't want to travel with the madman.

72
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:05.440
How would I know that his dad died of cirrhosis?
 We must escape.

73
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.840
-Yes, we really have to.
 -Then so, boys.
 Now we go to Luleå.

74
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.000
-Hello.
 -Jokkmokk police called earlier.

75
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.640
-They have seen Volvon drive towards Luleå.
 -Have you put someone on it?

76
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.000
No...

77
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.640
Hell!
 Is it just me working here?

78
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.360
Now you understand why I'm here.
 You owe me a lot of money.

79
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.680
You will never forget anything.
 You are like you.

80
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.960
I know I said it was not a rush, but ...

81
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.360
I get your thing.

82
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:23.440
There is a guy.
 His name is the herring.
 He owes me 600,000.

83
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:30.200
I owe you 500. Get them, and then you have to keep the rest.

84
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.680
Okay.
 We'll fix it.

85
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.840
Okay.
 It's good that you are three.
 He can be a little difficult, the herring.

86
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.360
He lives up on ...

87
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.520
What are you doing?

88
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.720
Nothing...

89
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.920
You just laid under the chair.

90
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.280
No, I did not.

91
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.560
Stand up.

92
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.040
Come here.
 Come.

93
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:54.320
-What's that?
 What's that?
 -It's cords.
 Okay.
 Damn ...

94
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.960
-Take it up.
 Pick it up, I said.
 -Okay.

95
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.080
Keep it up.

96
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.800
-Do you know how much bacteria it has?
 -No.

97
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.960
Stand up.

98
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.000
-Sit down.
 -Okay.

99
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.600
Creep...

100
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.280
-Where were we somewhere?
 -Sill owed you 600,000.

101
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.960
The herring owes me 600,000. You pick them up and keep everything.

102
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.320
I know he has the money at home.

103
00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.520
-Sisten that you do not struggle with Anders.
 -You know me.

104
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.280
Stick.
 Dirt.

105
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.040
And touch nothing on the way out.

106
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.040
Billy, you follow me, and Leif stops and guard.

107
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.720
Billy, you can hang with the can.

108
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.840
-And why should I do it?
 -You put us in this situation.

109
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:44.440
Look -cooked eggs ... The brother is dead.
 Shouldn't he suffer that?

110
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.840
-Yes, though he's not even ... -But, please the egg ... I'm dying.

111
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.240
-Yes yes, okay!
 -Good.

112
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.120
Tjena, the herring.
 Calm and nice now.
 Into the apartment.

113
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.280
You owe Anders's money.

114
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.880
Your fucking idiot, don't trust Anders.
 I have no fucking money.

115
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.080
Billy, search the apartment.

116
00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:58.360
No problem.
 I'm just going to the herring and talk a little.
 It is quiet.

117
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.200
Cursed ...

118
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.240
For fuck, Billy.

119
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.640
Where the hell is the money?
 You're lying!

120
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.320
Damn Luffare!

121
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:18.480
-Are you an idiot?
 Remove the money.
 -I don't have them, I say!

122
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:53.440
So you come home to my fucking home and lace my money?

123
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.680
Damn stupid.

124
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:06.240
Anders has deceived you.
 Go home to Norrland instead.

125
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:14.040
Do you think you own the whole world?
 Do you know who I am?
 Fucking herring!

126
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.880
Cursed ...

127
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.680
-What are you saying now, your little scarf?
 -Leif, behind!

128
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:59.680
Put down the weapon before I shoot the pick off you.

129
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.120
Stand still, fucking drug.

130
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.360
-I saw, the can?
 -Yes.
 Remove us.

131
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:22.120
-Fan, what a satan bang!
 Did you see?
 -What fucking dream team we are!

132
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.520
-Staff at the station.
 -Not now, Billy.

133
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.520
I'm about to shit.
 Should I shit in the glove compartment?

134
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.560
-Let him shit.
 It's the nerves.
 -Okay then.

135
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.600
Leif, you saved my life in there.

136
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.440
Well ... that's what happens.

137
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.320
Not anyone has such stakes.
 I will never forget it.

138
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.240
Thanks.

139
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:26.320
Hell ... It's that new thing from Sörbyn.

140
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.680
-What the hell ... -What hell is she doing here?

141
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.000
-Ring Billy.
 We have to knit.
 -Damn...

142
00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.240
-Hurry up.
 -Yes.

143
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.760
He has forgotten the phone in the car, the pea iron.
 Damn!

144
00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:02.080
Hey.
 Two grilled with mustard and ketchup.

145
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.760
I am at the station at the 76th north of Luleå.

146
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:17.040
I have been aiming for the suspected Volvon and the robbers.
 Request reinforcement.
 Come.

147
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.720
-I send all cars directly.
 -See them to rap.

148
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.720
What the hell are you doing, Billy?

149
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.440
-Where fuck is he?
 -It takes time to squeeze the sausages.

150
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.760
Turn on some extra mustard so it runs.

151
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.440
-Yeah, is it sausage day?
 -Yes.

152
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.400
There are few things that hit a grilled with bread, actually.

153
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.400
Yes, that's why I take two.

154
00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.800
Just.

155
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:05.040
-Is it your 740 out there?
 -Is there something fucking "Joppardy" game?

156
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:11.000
-Yes, it's mine and the brother's 740. -o, good car.

157
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:17.600
-Here are the sausages.
 -Thousand thanks.
 You can keep the gear.

158
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.800
Oh, thank you so much!

159
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.800
-WAVA, you forgot this.
 -You can actually keep it.

160
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.240
I am a police officer.

161
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:35.120
I know that you are called Billy Öhman and that you stole the change at the robbery.

162
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.480
I also know that you were involved in a money -dread in Luleå.

163
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.400
They pull north.
 I follow.

164
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:13.160
-There are two cops after us.
 -Stay.
 It's just as good to admit.

165
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.840
-No, dammit!
 Drive now, Leif.
 -I drive!
 Take it easy.

166
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:26.160
-Come again, uhman!
 Gas, for hell!
 -We drive away!

167
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.560
Gas!
 Shake off the snug devils!

168
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.560
-Leif, brake.
 -Drive, drive, drive!

169
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.040
The cock!

170
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.960
-Brake, Leif!
 -Drive, then!

171
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.760
I dropped them.

172
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.120
Ouch...

173
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.520
-Take it calmly, Leif.
 -I am I alive?

174
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.480
-You live, but you've been sedated.
 -No...

175
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.360
Billy, he's dead.
 Billy is dead!

176
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:47.320
Billy is doing well, but we have had to interrogate him for a few days.

177
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.000
-Can I talk?
 -Obvious.
 - The doctor is coming soon.

178
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.120
How's it, Leif?

179
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.280
-I do not really know.
 -It was a fucking story, huh?

180
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:15.000
I don't remember much.
 I had something wrong with the brain.
 Memorial loss.

181
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.680
You don't have to lie anymore.
 He has already admitted everything.

182
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:28.880
-What then "recognized"?
 -The bank robbery and the money back.

183
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.040
-Iven pea -brain.
 -In fact.

184
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.800
The can was very cooperative.

185
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.320
-Wo?
 Dunk, right?
 -Yes, he acknowledged everything.

186
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.800
He had threatened you with a gun.

187
00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:02.400
He had forced you to perform all these criminal acts.

188
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:09.640
Yes, just that ... now I'm starting to remember a little there.
 Right...

189
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:16.440
Now you have to focus on resting yourself, and you will get through this.

190
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.240
-You are strong, Leif.
 -Yes.

191
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.480
Then we say so.

192
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.040
The guys gravel ...

193
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.040
Yes ... yeah, so you should stay here now for a while, then?

194
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.600
Yes, six years I will shake grates.

195
00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.400
The can, why did you put everything on?

196
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:09.040
Leif, you saved for my life.
 That's the least I can do.

197
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.640
You two had not passed a day here-

198
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.960
-But for me it's like a second home.

199
00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.000
Yes, you may be right.

200
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.640
The money, then?

201
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.800
Come here.

202
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:47.120
These are coordinates.
 They will solve your problems with Kronofogden.

203
00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.600
Okay.

204
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.840
Now you have to live in peace and quiet your last time in life.

205
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.520
Billy does not need a lot of debts.

206
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.040
Damn ... thank you, the can.

207
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.120
Thanks, the can.

208
00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.560
Damn, Leif ... I'm sorry if I have been so piggy to you all year-

209
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.240
-But it's nothing personal.

210
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:52.480
It resolved pretty well in the end.
 The debt is paid, and the house is ours.

211
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.440
Yes, damn what a nice.

212
00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.480
I never want to leave Sörbäcken again.

213
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.240
Ever.
 It's damn the best place on the whole globe.

214
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.280
Yes, that's fine.
 It's damn nice, Billy.

215
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.640
-What the hell do you want?
 -I wanted to hear your voice in there.

216
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:27.040
-I said I would put you there.
 -You know that I handed in myself.

217
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.920
What about Billy?
 It must be tough when Leif is gone.

218
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.880
-What do you mean?
 -His liver must have been put off now.

219
00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.280
His liver?
 No, he's not sick.

220
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:50.560
I saw him at the pizzeria.
 He stood and pushed for mash.

221
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.560
-So he's not sick?
 -No.
 Who told you that?

222
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.040
Hello?
 The can?

223
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.520
Hello?

224
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.320
