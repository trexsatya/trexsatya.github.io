00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:04,883
Hey my friends! Good morning!

2
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:07,935
It's early in the morning.

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,093
It's half past seven.

4
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:16,222
It's Friday today.

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:21,622
Tomorrow it's Saturday.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:34,218
My kids eat candy on Saturdays.

00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:39,908
Saturday candy

8
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,658
I'm on my way to work.

9
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:57,000
But first I will shop.

10
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:03,444
I'm going to buy candy.

11
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:07,494
Follow!

12
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:23,484
Open every day

13
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,083
sweets

14
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,857
a lot of sweets

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,810
loose weight candy

16
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:19,180
Now I have to weigh sweets.

17
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:38,461
Now I go to the checkout.

18
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:47,063

20
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:13,497
a receipt

21
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:29,143
I shop on Friday morning, then there are not that many people.

22
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,457
There are not that many people in the store.

23
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:43,159
On Saturday and Sunday, there are a lot of people in the store.

24
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:45,294
Everyone is shopping.

25
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:50,600

26
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:58,140

00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,000
We read together.

30
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:16,151
I have to hurry to work.

31
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:19,663

32
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,668

33
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:01,959

34
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:10,542

00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:26,418
not every day

37
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:35,162

39
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:05,124
