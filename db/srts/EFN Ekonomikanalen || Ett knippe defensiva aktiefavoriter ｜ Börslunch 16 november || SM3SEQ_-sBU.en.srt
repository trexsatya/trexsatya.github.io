1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.960
Here I sit with a pattern card.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.960
Thanks to such, we can enjoy the stock exchange lunch.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.080
Today is Friday, extra fun.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.400
The Stockholm Stock Exchange is up 1 %

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.280
Despite Brexitoro and possible confidence vote against May.

6
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.560
Intendo goes worse for, down 9 %.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.080
Nibe is noticed among today's winners after a strong report.

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.400
I got a little heavy heapon because I'm so excited.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.320
You are like a waiter with the tray.

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.920
We will talk about a bunch of companies with defensive growth.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.520
It together with Fredrik Skoglund, welcome

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.680
And Viktor Hansson, welcome.

13
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.560
But first I want to ... Viktor Henriksson.
 I'm just kidding.

14
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.920
I am so happy that we have his stove here

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.880
CEO of NCAB.
 Tell us what it is Gabriel waved.

16
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.200
It is a pattern card used in different applications.

17
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.040
It was a nice introduction.

18
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.360
In this studio there are hundreds of different pattern cards.

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.120
Where to buy them

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.080
We buy them in China.

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.520
97 % of our turnover comes from factories in China.

22
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.880
Approved by us.
 We use around 12 factories.

23
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.960
Then we sell them all over the world.

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.560
We focus on "high mix/low volume".

25
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.200
So we are niche and like high tech products.

26
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.200
We like short series where we can have many article numbers.

27
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.360
Why do you want low volume

28
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.920
There are no margins in high volume.

29
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.200
We like margins.

30
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.160
And fine margins are in the report.

31
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.160
Yes, great fun.

32
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.920
Tell me, how ...

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.720
We have ... now let's see ...

34
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800
Is the second report

35
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.120
Then the listing

36
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.400
Yes.
 42 % in increased profit.
 We are very happy about that.

37
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.040
So is us.
 Länsförsäkringar is a shareholder in NCAB.

38
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.640
They beat the result at Bottomline by 30 %

39
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.720
Compared to Carnegie's estimates.

40
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.600
These are everywhere.
 It's a pretty small cost

41
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.200
To make products, but high risk that it will be wrong.

42
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.520
Therefore, it is important that they have the right quality.

43
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.480
That is why we have invested in NCAB.

44
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.600
You look a little tired ... the order intake in the future ...

45
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.000
Q4 is a bad season and has always been a little worse

46
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.640
Regarding the Revenue.

47
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.240
But order intake is usually decent.

48
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.840
It depends on when the Chinese New Year falls

49
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.000
And the factories close in China.

50
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.440
Customers take it for it and order a little before.

51
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.720
We don't really know when the orders arrive.

52
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.480
We don't really know what's going on with the business cycle.

53
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.200
For us, the focus is new customers and markets

54
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.840
And work on our strategy.

55
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.160
The boom is one thing, but customs in the United States you live with.

56
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.080
The United States is a major market.
 Everything has become 10 % more expensive.

57
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.120
20 % of our turnover is in the United States.

58
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.880
We pay 10 % customs on everything we export there.

59
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.040
This we pass on to the customers.

60
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.720
It has been painless so far.

61
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.840
It is regrettable.

62
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.960
We do not know what will happen.

63
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.880
But it can be positive for us.

64
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.080
The point is that Americans should produce more circuit boards.

65
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.680
Then they need pattern cards.

66
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.680
And American PCBs do not have capacity.

67
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.160
So it can be something positive about this.

68
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.240
Do you own NCAB, Viktor

69
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.320
Not at the moment.

70
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.360
But I have looked at the company on several occasions

71
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.680
And it is a very nice and well -managed company.
 Impressive.

72
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.600
Do you have any question you just praise.

73
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.240
You are a little faster to a better margin in Europe

74
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.360
than thought previously.

75
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.960
Are there any structural differences to

76
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.120
Why the margin in Europe cannot reach the Nordic region?

77
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.680
In the Nordic countries we have been around for a very long time.

78
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.280
We have customers that we have worked with for a long time.

79
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.560
In Europe, we focus a lot on new customers.

80
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.600
Before you get to know the new customers, it costs.

81
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.760
One may have to reduce the margins at the beginning

82
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.320
And invest a lot in technology and advice.

83
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.600
We have a strategy to grow hard in Europe.

84
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.800
Then the margin will be lower in Europe.

85
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.560
If you close the crane and fail to grow

86
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.880
And hire people, you can get the margin.

87
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.840
Big thanks for coming here.
 Very interesting.
 Good luck

88
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.880
Thank you.

89
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.280
Now we will move on to Tele2.

90
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.840
The course on Tele2 has backed from 120 to 100.

91
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.800
What do you say, Fredrik

92
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.800
It has been very strong compared to the stock exchange.

93
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.120
It's probably a little profit home.

94
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.520
When Comhem and Tele2 went together

95
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.960
Blanked some Tele2, bought Comhem and received shares.

96
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.800
I'm a little more worried in the short perspective.

97
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.320
They will be notified of sales in the Netherlands.

98
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.000
If it does not go through, the dividend will not be as strong.

99
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.000
It should leave Carnegie's small company index.

100
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.680
It can give some pressure on the share in the short term.

101
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.440
Viktor, are you more positive

102
00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.800
I was thinking yesterday for the program ...

103
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.160
The stock exchange is economic -drunk right now.

104
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.800
The Stockholm Stock Exchange is quite cyclically sensitive.

105
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.880
Maybe the stock market has been a little too worried about the business cycle.

106
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.200
It feels like you are praising a giant efficiency.

107
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.520
Maybe you should start looking at cyclical companies.

108
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.760
What is on the stock exchange of defensive nature

109
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.360
There is not much to choose from.

110
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.960
I produced some such companies.
 There is Tele2.

111
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.320
It is a heavenly well -managed company for an attractive valuation.

112
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.200
They are going to be out of the small corporation index

113
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.040
And some business must be approved.

114
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.160
I think there is an upside to the merger with Comhem.

115
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.880
Synergies.

116
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.400
Those synergies will probably increase pretty soon.

117
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.520
Maybe in connection with Q4 at the beginning of next year.

118
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.360
There is the potential to save more than they have gone out with.

119
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.320
We will probably see increased profit forecasts at the beginning of next year.

120
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.720
Then the share becomes even cheaper than now.

121
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.160
It is a well -managed company that is not affected by the business cycle.

122
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.960
Good direct return and places in a defensive portfolio.

123
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.200
Interesting.
 You have an exciting list of companies.

124
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.640
Next is a relative, Millicom.

125
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.800
Like, stuck in South America.

126
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.880
Exactly.
 Millicom is a cousin to Tele2

127
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.720
with the same principal and founder-

128
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.160
But Millicom operates in emerging markets -

129
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.360
Especially in Latin America.

130
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.160
It is high risk, but also high growth

131
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.640
and lower valuation.

132
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.880
They are in the process of becoming a cable and broadband operator.

133
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.200
It has high values here at home.

134
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.040
Why does it go badly in terms of course

135
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.080
It has been stock exchange and the growth market has been moved.

136
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.640
And there seems to be Millicom.

137
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.360
But I think they will succeed in the future.

138
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:36.520
On 5 times the operating profit should be able to be praised.

139
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.520
Have you looked at Millicom

140
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.680
A little.
 I think it is very cheap.

141
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.000
Tele2 may be a couple of years ahead of Millicom

142
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.760
in his transformation.
 Kinnevik probably makes a similar trip -

143
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.800
with Millicom.
 It looks very cheap.

144
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.520
Speaking of cheap, Kinnevik and travel: MTG.

145
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.320
A lot to talk about.

146
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.400
I wrote it on the list for Fredrik to come.

147
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.800
And he was so happy.

148
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.040
It's also cheap.
 Today you get MTGX for free.

149
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.560
Only Nordic Entertainment Group is worth the stock price.

150
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.320
And so MTGX will be knocked off in early 2019.

151
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.000
Esport is still exciting.

152
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.360
And innogames, a gaming company within MTGX

153
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.360
delivers amazing numbers.

154
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.440
The valuation is zero is well, to say the least.

155
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.480
The year has been dramatic for MTG.
 First sales

156
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.320
of the television channels to Tele Denmark which was positive -

157
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.720
But was blown off and thus lowered the course.

158
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.120
Then Kinnevik distributed all mtg share -

159
00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.440
to their shareholders.
 And some of them-

160
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.360
Do not want the share, which gives price pressure.

161
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.960
And this summer, Telia bought TV4.

162
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.400
So business is done with television channels, even internationally.

163
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.840
So the availability of MTG's television channels

164
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.360
can be quite attractive.
 And things can happen there.

165
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.400
Happens nothing, it won't be bought

166
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.600
Is it probably a stable business that provides good cash flow -

167
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.040
And as many want to own.

168
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.560
MTG may be new hoist.
 Everyone talks up mtg

169
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.000
And then things don't go so well.

170
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.920
No I do not think so.
 MTG's underlying “Business”

171
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.840
The advertising market, is super strong.

172
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.840
They can sell out all 2019 now, if they want to.

173
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.720
Prices rise.
 It's different.

174
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.760
Good underlying growth and a strong CEO: Anders Jensen.

175
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.240
He becomes CEO of Nordic Entertainment and becomes enough

176
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.280
well -received both among international -

177
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.200
And Swedish investors.
 The comparison is probably bad.

178
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.560
You are positive, both to Tele 2 and MTG.

179
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.880
Kinnevik, then, instead

180
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.120
Kinnevik has been hit

181
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.640
because Zalando has not praised the market lately.

182
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.240
But that's probably an opportunity.

183
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.240
We move on to security and cash handling.

184
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.680
You like Loomis.

185
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.640
Yes, a safe and stable company that is not affected

186
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.920
of business cycle and commodity prices.

187
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.800
Many are skeptical of cash

188
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.600
And think they should disappear.

189
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.600
In the really long term it can be like that

190
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.880
But Loomi's sales are increasing year by year.

191
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.800
Like the profit.
 So it is not noticed in Loomi's numbers.

192
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.760
Sweden really is before

193
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.120
On the way to a cashless society.

194
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.440
USA is Loomi's most important market

195
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.840
And the amount of dollar bills in circulation increases year by year.

196
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.480
And in many other markets, cash is required

197
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.840
It is noticeable when traveling.
 The safe they set out -

198
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.120
In customers in the United States is a gold egg: SafePoint.

199
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.280
Recurring, secure revenue.

200
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.280
Loomis should be valued higher.

201
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.600
Wanna comment on Loomis ebitagraf?

202
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.560
Carnegie's skilled analysts covering Loomis

203
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.920
Have produced it.
 This year, Loomis has costs -

204
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.120
for restructuring.
 The French business-

205
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.240
has been restructured, for example.

206
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.560
But you will not get that in 2019.

207
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:05.760
Other costs also disappear in 2019.

208
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.480
So profit growth for 2019 looks pretty good.

209
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.840
The underlying is also growing and profit.

210
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:20.520
Given it seems valuation on the 2019 profit cheap.

211
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.120
The table would show that.

212
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.320
Do you like security

213
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.560
Yes.
 I like companies that grow profits.

214
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.960
So does Loomis 2019.

215
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.840
Many are negative and believe that cash should disappear.

216
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.280
Systembolaget and 7eleven rolled out SafePoint 2018.

217
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:47.440
In Sweden.
 They seem to feel a need for it.

218
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.600
For many Swedes are skeptical.
 It's probably wrong.

219
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.400
They believe that Swedish conditions apply globally.

220
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.640
Maybe it is the same with MTG and TV3.

221
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.520
"TV3 has bad programs."
 But the business is going well

222
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.680
And, as I said, the advertising is sold out.

223
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.880
It is dangerous to start from yourself.

224
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.200
A few words about Securitas.

225
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.320
What are the winners and losers of digitalisation

226
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.480
Securitas is potentially, among Sweden's larger companies

227
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.600
The biggest winner on digitalisation.
 Long-term-

228
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.040
If it becomes segways with cameras that round.

229
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.120
Then Securitas does not have to pay wages, a problem today.

230
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.760
But Securitas also increases profits.
 Digitization

231
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.560
Has reached 20 % of sales, 80 % is staffing.

232
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.520
In five years it will be 5050 and then the margin becomes -

233
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.040
A completely different than today's.

234
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.560
Good.
 Should we move on ...

235
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.680
Do you have some real estate

236
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.000
Is it defensive

237
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.480
Yes.
 Partly there are assets to take on, you see the houses

238
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.640
And it is safe to have an asset in the balance sheet.

239
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.880
And the rental market is strong now

240
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.880
Especially for offices in Stockholm.

241
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.600
Much is needed for that demand to be broken.

242
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.880
We also know that getting new premises is coming.

243
00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.640
But is it defensive after the long rise

244
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.280
Now that interest rates are going up?
 Could it be better?

245
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.320
But should interest rates rise so much

246
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.160
Now we are worried about a steep falling business cycle

247
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.720
But also too strongly rising interest rates.

248
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.320
It is probably not so.

249
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.480
The interest rates may not rise so much

250
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.280
When the economy weakens.

251
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.760
The real estate companies borrow money cheaply now.

252
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.320
The real estate companies' financing costs

253
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.480
Probably not so much change in the future.

254
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.680
Renters rise, interest rates fall and the profits rise.

255
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.760
It works for me.

256
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.000
We have a graph of it.

257
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.480
Fabege and atrium.
 Are there two favorites

258
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.560
I like them

259
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.720
to exposure to Stockholm's office rental market -

260
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.160
are high.
 And they are valued with good substance discount.

261
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.200
They are well maintained

262
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.360
And the project portfolios seem interesting.
 They are to build-

263
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.200
Attractive houses on its fine plot.

264
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.400
Balder's very high value increase in Q3

265
00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.240
was a result of re -evaluated projects.
 We'll probably see -

266
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.400
Same thing in Fabege and Atrium in the Q4.

267
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.920
Telecom, security, real estate ...

268
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.280
Should we finish with chicken for dessert

269
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.680
Is it defensive

270
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.200
Chicken is food, which we need regardless of business cycle.

271
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.880
Chicken is a basic commodity in many households.

272
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.600
And chicken sales are increasing well in Scandinavia.

273
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.600
Scandi Standards Sales have increased organically

274
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.600
around 9 % this year.
 A fairly strong growth.

275
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.560
In Scandinavia we eat less chicken

276
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.080
than in the rest of the Western world.

277
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.000
So there is structural growth.

278
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.680
Focus on health and the environment also benefits chicken.

279
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.120
Scandi Standard has had a difficult period

280
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:36.000
With bird flu and campylobacter that cost money.

281
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.160
But next year seems to be clean and nice, pepper, pepper ...

282
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.520
... for Scandi Standard.

283
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.360
And we get it on 10 times the profit.

284
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.480
Internationally traded this kind of company

285
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.920
on much higher values.
 Interesting.

286
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.400
Best buying tip today

287
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.040
Maybe not, but that's good.

288
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.720
I like chicken.
 Given the summer drought

289
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.200
Will it probably be painful about beef in 2019-

290
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.280
And it benefits the chicken even more.

291
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.480
We should have had a recipe.

292
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.160
Stop cackling now ...

293
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.080
We take a break, but are back on Monday.

294
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.880
Join us then.
 Thanks to our viewers and our guests.
