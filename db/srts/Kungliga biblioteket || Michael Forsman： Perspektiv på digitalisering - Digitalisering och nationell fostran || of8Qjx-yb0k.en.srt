1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07.840
- My name is Michael Forsman and I am an associate professor of media and communication science.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,620
I am also the leader of the circle south, something that I look forward to.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,820
We'll see you this afternoon and talk about the texts.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21.560
I think they were excited, and are linked to what we have heard.

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:29,540
I will also do that, though in other words and in different form.

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,360
It doesn't feel okay, but I do it anyway.

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,380
In addition, I have a script that I was going to read from.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45.560
I can tell you that the self -test found in Digiteket,

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,140
the platform that is within the framework of digital first,

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55.560
has been developed for you to develop digital skills in the profession.

11
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,000
I have done that test. I became a "beginner".

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02.040
It may be good to know.

13
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.600
Through the test I also got to see what is expected of you.

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:13,200
The test is based on skills that you should have, and may need to develop more.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,000
You should be able to handle information, but also source criticism and computer science.

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,400
It's not just about your skills, but also about helping others

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,620
Who comes and is a village in this.

18
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,360
It's something I see in some of the texts we're going to talk about.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:45,320
You are part of a national project where we all join.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,340
The government writes like this in its overall digitization strategy:

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,240
"Sweden will be the best in the world in utilizing the possibilities of digitalisation."

22
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,580
Here we enter the skeptic track.

23
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,660
It is a name that can be interpreted in different ways.

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,520
There is a book called "Skeptic School" that indicates that

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,740
It is important to be critically examined in issues of source criticism.

26
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,420
But we go more in the philosophical direction.

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,820
The skeptical method is about a kind of theoretical provocation

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,480
in relation to observations we make.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,060
It's not just reviewing validity and truth,

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,020
Without also provoking our ways of thinking about facts.

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,220
We can do this with theories, but also by reflecting practical experience.

32
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,520
The goal is not to be for or against, but to induce underlying structures.

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,840
To become aware of how we think, because there is a limitation in our own thinking.

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,340
It is the credo's credo, according to Kant.

35
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,340
"Enlightenment is man's exit from her self -inflicted un carerion."

36
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,540
We need to think about concepts and our own thinking.

37
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08.920
I will talk a little about that.

38
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,360
A few more words about the skeptic track.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,080
One should watch out for cynicism, nihilism and dogmatics.

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,220
All of them can be linked to skepticism.

41
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:25.560
Being skeptical is about opening new perspectives and opportunities.

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:34,080
To be skeptical of the management culture that comes with digitalisation

43
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,660
is not about being a technology opponent.

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,320
Some kind of luddit, like those who gave up on textile factories

45
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,980
who were considered to threaten previous forms of knowledge and work.

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,800
However, I am inclined to agree with technology conservative media ecologists.

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:05.040
For example, Neil Postman, who urged us to switch on our "Bullshit Detecor"

48
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,900
When technology propagandists say: "The future is already here",

49
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,260
With the implied sentence: "You don't seem to have understood it".

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,160
Postman, and even contemporary critics of, for example, the school's digitization,

51
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,180
Know that technology is not neutral, that it is embedded in a historical context.

52
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,260
That it is always constructed and understood in a social, cultural context.

53
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,640
That it is always linked to questions about power.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39.540
As a skeptic should we ask the question: to what problem is this a solution?

55
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,280
What interests are pushing, and why?

56
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,120
What curricula do follow with the technology?

57
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,860
What is the price for implementing this? Could it have effects other than those intended?

58
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,940
In this way, the skeptical attitude becomes productive.

59
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05.220
I can see that our skeptic track becomes technology progressive

60
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,500
And about how technology can better help the profession.

61
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14.560
Alternatively, to have the technology redo the profession in a fruitful way.

62
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:23,220
The important thing is to see what the indispensable values in the librarian profession are.

63
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:32,160
After this introduction, I was thinking of linking to the "Floska apparatus".

64
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,300
Policy, concept formation, manuals, directives of various kinds.

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,700
I have previously researched different things.

66
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,940
Children and young people in media, popular culture, public service and other things.

67
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,020
I have also worked in teacher education for twenty years.

68
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,220
Currently I am finishing a project called

69
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01.660
"Media citizen's education and the school's medialization - curricula, teaching materials, teacher education."

70
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07.460
There I and a colleague look at the curriculum 62 and Lgr 11.

71
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:15,380
How to write about teaching technology there, but also about media society and media education.

72
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,120
There are no new questions about the need for this knowledge.

73
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,720
There we have coined the term "media citizen".

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,660
There is a thought about the good media citizen who is involved and reviews information.

75
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,720
I don't mind, but it's an interesting historical construction

76
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,260
made in curricula, teaching forms or food

77
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,420
which is given to the school from external players.

78
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,520
Today it is Apple, Google and Microsoft.

79
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,920
Previously, it has been the Swedish daily press, public service and the Swedish Film Institute.

80
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Many people work against the school with new technology or media issues.

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,520
It is about raising media citizens for the deeply medialized society

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,280
Where media is everywhere, and it can be perceived as media being everything.

83
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:22,420
You can take the idea of ideal citizens and curriculum for what we should work with.

84
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:35,680
There is a kind of curriculum in the profession that is confronted with the management culture.

85
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,240
They do not fully meet each other.

86
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,380
Digitization in libraries is about many things.

87
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,860
Some are to digitize collections, and manage a lot of information.

88
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,660
Another is that the library gets a new function in society.

89
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02.040
It seems that both processes are in motion.

90
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07.820
"Digitally first - the user in focus" it says on the logo

91
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,720
which is an emblem for the national competence lift for library staff.

92
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:20,100
The logo is stylish, simple and fun. It is available with pink and light green background.

93
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,940
The circle expresses harmony and wholeness, but also movement, as a globe that rises.

94
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,840
A balloon that lifts, a ball that rolls.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,240
“The user in focus”. We are all users in society.

96
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,020
That is why we are all in focus.

97
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,380
"Digitally first" is a call, a finding and a reminder.

98
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,740
It also indicates order. First comes digitization.

99
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,500
Here we have to ask ourselves what comes next.

100
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,240
In this context, other symbols are also used that will make us think right.

101
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02.860
It is about tools, it is something to be created.

102
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,220
Magnifying glass, there are problems to be solved.

103
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,820
It is a kind of visual ability to be sharpened.

104
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,180
Digitally first began with what was called a mobilization phase,

105
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,520
Which leads the thoughts to citizenship and renovation.

106
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,840
Everyone is going, and maybe no one gets away.

107
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,240
But this is also a community that has a future.

108
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,320
Now it becomes a college talk with the concept of "digitization".

109
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,620
Above all this lies a top down process where the term digitization is used.

110
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,620
I have been to many fairs where new technology is presented.

111
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,980
Many teachers talk about their "best practice".

112
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:59,400
All respect for it, but one wonders where the concept begins and ends.

113
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,440
From the beginning it was about an idea of a technical transformation

114
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,280
Where you still think about the relationship digital -analog.

115
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:16,600
That question is about to be overplayed, except that robots will possibly replace people.

116
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,000
Otherwise, much of what we are doing is already digitized.

117
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,500
It is also a social transformation.

118
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,200
In English you distinguish on "Digitization", the technical change,

119
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,260
And "digitalization", which is the social transformation.

120
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,220
It is the one who does something with our work and everyday life.

121
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,760
Where the technology is involved and affects.

122
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,740
One can think of a concept from the literary scientist Fredric Jameson.

123
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,420
It is a kind of culturally dominant.

124
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:56,140
It is a concept that you have to include when you think about the contemporary and the future.

125
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,260
Questions about work and citizenship.

126
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02.440
You can't think about it without thinking digitalization.

127
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,260
With the cultural dominant, norms and ideas follow.

128
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,820
You talk about sociotechnological notions about a future.

129
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,300
That technology will solve different types of problems.

130
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,460
For example, gaps or problems with inclusion in democracy.

131
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,360
We think the technology will do good things with this.

132
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,720
These pictures are often bright and problem -free.

133
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,120
There are other types of performances that are more alternative.

134
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,880
There may be another future that is connected.

135
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,840
There are very dystopian images of the technologized future.

136
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,080
Where the machines have taken over.

137
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,920
Jonna described how the children become pulp.

138
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,860
There is a concern, but also a learning process that we all have to go into.

139
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:11,420
I who are getting older think that sometimes it is a personal challenge to keep up.

140
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:20,300
The learning process is something that we must all be included in.

141
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,780
One can also think that digitalisation is about a national project

142
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,680
that has to do with citizenship.

143
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,120
A kind of education by us in a national community.

144
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:39,640
Sweden will be the best in the world in utilizing the possibilities of digitalisation.

145
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,400
One concept that recurs is "digital competence".

146
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,620
It is a key term in questions about learning processes.

147
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,900
There are several different definitions and descriptions.

148
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,780
This is how it says in the government's digitization strategy:

149
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:03,320
“Digital competence means that everyone should be familiar with digital tools and services

150
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09.400
And have the ability to follow and participate in digital development based on their conditions. "

151
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:18,800
There is a feeling that we are different, but also a requirement to be involved.

152
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:29,480
Something similar is found in Lgr 11, where the school's digitization was made.

153
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,940
They have wanted to press to make more happen.

154
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,580
I have no objections, but it is interesting to look at.

155
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,060
There are other ways of describing.

156
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,520
Beyond this one can find endless amounts of documents

157
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:55,320
With definitions, descriptions, modules, indicators, dimensions of digital competence.

158
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,880
24 Competences in 5 different areas, and so on.

159
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,260
Digital skills can be all this, and there is a lot we should include.

160
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,300
It is almost a stress when looking at the concepts.

161
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:17,480
The term "digital competence" comes from "digital literacy",

162
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,980
Which was a word that came in academic circles in the 1990s.

163
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:31,620
Around the beginning of the 1990s, the EU and the OECD became fond of the concept of "digital competence",

164
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,020
And connected it to what is called "21st century skills".

165
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,780
An assumption of what people need to be able to do if they are to be in this century.

166
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,480
One of these skills is digital competence.

167
00:14:49,560 --> 00:15:02.060
The concept is often linked to employability, innovation, competitiveness

168
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05,280
And to the demand for lifelong learning.

169
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:14,220
We must never stop learning the things that are partly prescribed that we must learn.

170
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,920
It is also linked to a living democracy and dynamic cultural production.

171
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:29,980
The term "digital competence" and other terms are so -called "loose concepts".

172
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:37,120
A kind of liquid signal word, which means they lack a fixed definition.

173
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,960
At the same time, everyone can use them, and no one can help but use them.

174
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:51,420
They become points for policymakers in different contexts based on their interests.

175
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:58,180
They are not only descriptive, but also prescribing and regulating.

176
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:05.800
It is interesting when you meet this type of terminology.

177
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,340
The concept of competence may be worth a few more words.

178
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,340
The American concept of "Human Resource Management" came into Sweden in the 1980s.

179
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:24,680
On the one hand, there is the functional, requirements -oriented side that is linked to what Jonna talked about.

180
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,640
Competence is what can be measured.

181
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:39,180
Then there is a more dynamic side that you fish for in the steering documents

182
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,640
Which is more about judgmental ability.

183
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,020
What Eva Swartz writes about in the anthology Librarian's practical knowledge.

184
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,220
A kind of fronesis, judgment knowledge, even education.

185
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,560
I'll stop right away.

186
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:01,000
Another term that has been close to the libraries is "media and information expertise".

187
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:09,500
That term comes from UNESCO, which in the early 1980s began discussions about

188
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,020
What happens to children and young people in a medialized world.

189
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,740
How can we protect and empower them in relation to those

190
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,220
Risks and opportunities that new technologies bring.

191
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,860
Of course, these are important issues.

192
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:39,480
In 2011, a global curriculum was launched for all teachers in the UN Member States,

193
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,220
It is about teachers becoming more media and information experts.

194
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,000
The concepts "digital competence" and "media and information expertise" have been supported and wet.

195
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,380
They show up in different contexts, and the authorities have their favorites.

196
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,840
The concepts are overlapping. What sets them apart?

197
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,480
UNESCO presents five laws for media and information skills.

198
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,000
If you follow them, it will go well.

199
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:21,300
It brings me back to the idea of education by citizens.

200
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,880
I don't know about this conceptual outing and skeptical reflections

201
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:40,120
Around policy and logos are relevant to our meetings.

202
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,040
There we should be down to earth and concrete around everyday situations

203
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:56,040
And how they can be experienced and grow into new reviews.

204
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,100
I have certainly missed important aspects along the way.

205
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04.560
Library is a new area of research for me.

206
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:15,640
My impression is that a library is on its way into a structural transformation that has been going on for a while.

207
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,640
Where the library's autonomy is under pressure.

208
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,140
Where the libraries are changing as a physical and cultural place.

209
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,660
Where the librarian profession is changing

210
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:36,660
And where different sociotechnological notions of the future are produced from different directions.

211
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:47,080
Here, concepts such as "Digital Competence," Mik "," Digitally first "will be signal words.

212
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,180
What do they signal, and is it red or green for me?

213
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,580
Everyone has to decide on it.
