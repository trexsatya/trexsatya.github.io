1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02.333
About the Social Insurance Office.

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:06.466
The Social Insurance Agency, one of Sweden's largest authorities

3
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:10,633
with just over 14 \ H000 employees and offices in 60 locations.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,266
We are going on behalf of Parliament

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:16,700
and government manage social insurance.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,900
We do this by investigating and deciding on the right to compensation

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,700
As well as coordinate rehabilitation efforts to help those who are on sick leave

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,733
to get back to working life.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Here is the state value base.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,233
It describes how we who are employed at the Social Insurance Office should relate

11
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:42,300
ourselves to the power and responsibility we have as employees in the state.

12
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:44.933
The state value base originated in

13
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:50,466
The first chapter of the form of government and applies to all government employees.

14
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,333
To understand what this means

15
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55.866
Should we briefly go through each concept.

16
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:59.733
Democracy is about everyone's equal rights and value

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,200
And about the possibility of being involved and decide.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07.266
It is we who vote who decide who should govern the country.

19
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:10,000
It is since the people elected in the parliament who understands

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,933
Decisions on laws, often based on proposals from the government.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,466
State employees therefore need to have understanding

22
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:21,400
For citizens, the authority's client.

23
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:23,700
The activities of an authority

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,033
must have support in law or other constitution.

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,866
This means that the Social Insurance Agency may not take any action

26
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:36,266
Or make a decision if we do not support it in laws and regulations.

27
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:41,133
This is called the principle of legality and encompasses all forms of public

28
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:47,233
Power of power, including handling in cases at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.

29
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,666
To understand how the rules should be applied in our business

30
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:53,600
Do we have the support of guidelines and processes

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,366
and other governing documents.

32
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:58,433
Citizens' right

33
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:02.966
to free opinion formation, freedom of expression and access to information

34
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:06.833
is crucial for democracy to work.

35
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,733
Everyone has the right to freely express themselves

36
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:12,400
in speech, writing, picture or otherwise.

37
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,666
This applies to both us as government employees

38
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:20,466
And the people we meet and whose cases we handle.

39
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:24,000
We must take into account that all people are different.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,200
We shall respect their personal integrity

41
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,300
And we do not discriminate against anyone.

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,866
Respect for the equal value of everyone is basically about respecting the human

43
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:37,866
the rights that in itself form the basis of it

44
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,133
Democratic society.

45
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:45,100
Efficiency is about managing the state's funds,

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,433
But even about handling cases quickly and easy.

47
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:51.433
At the same time as the laws are followed.

48
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,400
Service means doing it

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,700
as simple as possible for the people we meet,

50
00:02:56,766 --> 00:03:01,000
that we have flexible processes and good accessibility.

51
00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:03.266
Good service simplifies for all

52
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07.133
And make us save on our resources.

53
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09.600
An authority is obliged to be factual

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
and impartial in their business.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,366
Objectivity means that unkind circumstances do not

56
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:21,533
may form the basis for the assessments made and decisions that are made.

57
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:26,366
People should be able to trust that the handling or outcome of a decision

58
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:30,100
not affected by the arbitrar of an individual employee,

59
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:34,466
own perception or personal ideas.

60
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:37,733
The Social Insurance Office is governed by the Public Authority,

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,366
The instruction for the Social Insurance Office

62
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:43,733
and the government's annual regulatory letter where goals,

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,500
Budget and how the budget is to be distributed is evident.

64
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,433
It may also be added to special government assignments

65
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:55,400
Where the government gives the authority the task of investigating various issues.

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,100
As you have already heard, the Social Insurance Office must

67
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,300
Operations have support in the legal system.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,100
Two laws that are good to know are the Administration Act

69
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06.666
that form the basis of how one

70
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,733
Managing Authority shall act in relation to individuals

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,200
and the Social Security Code, which is the law that regulates

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,700
Most compensation paid by the Social Insurance Office.

73
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:23,166
The government must never control how the authority exercises the laws.

74
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:26,033
It is the courts that try this.

75
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:30,000
If there is scope for interpretation on how the legislation is to be applied is

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,833
it practice, that is, indicative decisive

77
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:38.033
from the Supreme Administrative Court, which becomes governing.

78
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:43,400
The decision becomes normative for how the legislation will later be interpreted.

79
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,533
Here is part of the insurance and remuneration such as social insurance

80
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49.033
encompasses.

81
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:51.633
For example, there are compensation for families with children,

82
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,700
sick and people with disabilities.

83
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,966
In addition, the Social Insurance Agency pays out

84
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:02.666
Several of the remuneration decided by the Employment Service.

85
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05.266
Every year, the Social Insurance Agency takes approximately

86
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:08.966
21 \ Hillillions decisions on grants and remuneration.

87
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:11,100
At fk.se you can read more about the

88
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,400
Various compensation.

89
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,133
Social insurance is

90
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:20,000
not linked to citizenship but what determines if you are insured

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,600
In Sweden, whether you live and work here or not.

92
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,200
Some of the insurance can be

93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Take part in by being registered in Sweden.

94
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,033
They are called settlement -based benefits.

95
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,466
Other Insurance assumes that you work or have

96
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:42.666
Worked in Sweden. These are the work -based benefits.

97
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:47,700
In addition to being insured in Sweden, one also needs to meet the conditions in question

98
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,700
for the compensation you applied for.

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,166
Each year pays the Social Insurance Office out

100
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:59,400
Over 4 \ h% of Sweden's gross domestic product, GDP.

101
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,533
Just over half of the payments go

102
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,766
to the sick and people with disabilities.

103
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08.833
Just over a third to children and families and the remaining part

104
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,600
Goes to other remuneration in primarily the labor market area.

105
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,766
Here we see some of the insurance policies that can

106
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:21,400
become relevant if work ability is impaired due to illness.

107
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:26,366
It is sickness benefit, activity compensation and sickness benefit.

108
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:30,900
These remuneration can be obtained in the scope whole, three quarters

109
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:34,433
half and a quarter.

110
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,366
Sickness benefit should compensate

111
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:39,366
loss of income due to illness.

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,966
About 600 \ H000 people receive sickness benefit each year.

113
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:49.266
Most people are sick for a shorter period and then return to their work.

114
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,800
For some, there is a need for rehabilitation

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
action during sick leave.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57.633
We will delve into the rules on sickness benefit in the film called

117
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:02,200
Sickness benefit and preventive sickness benefit.

118
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03.933
Activity compensation is one

119
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:08,500
time -limited compensation for those who are between 19 and 29 years old

120
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:12,333
And that will not be able to work for at least one year.

121
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:15,900
Activity compensation can be given between 1 and 3 years

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,600
And every year, approximately 6700 new activity allowances are granted.

123
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,966
As the name suggests, there should be some kind of activity.

124
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:29,333
It can be work -oriented, medical

125
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:34,133
Or of a leisure nature and it should have a positive impact on the person.

126
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37.933
One can also receive activity compensation for extended schooling

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,800
If the disability you have makes you need longer

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,333
to complete their schooling in elementary school or high school.

129
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,700
Sickness benefit is granted so far and may be relevant

130
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,266
If you will not be able to work more or just be able to work part -time.

131
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,133
Sickness compensation can be granted from the age of 30

132
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:02.933
Until you can take out old -age pension.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,300
There is an opportunity to receive sickness benefit from 19 years

134
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,100
If it is already clear then that the person will never be able to work.

135
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,066
Each year is granted approximately 5300

136
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:17,633
persons sickness benefit.

137
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,900
When the Swedish Social Insurance Agency assesses whether the individual is entitled to activity compensation

138
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,600
or sickness compensation we look at the ability to work

139
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:30,833
in relation to the entire labor market, also protected employment.

140
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:34,333
This applies to everyone under 61 years.

141
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,466
For those over 61 years there is a special rule that means that work ability

142
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:43,400
only tested against such work as the person has experience with

143
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:47.833
and worked with over the past 15 years.

144
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:52.066
The Swedish Social Insurance Agency meets citizens and partners

145
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,200
in digital meetings when appropriate.

146
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,600
Digital meetings make it easier for more people to participate

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01.333
and thus increases accessibility.

148
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:05.866
If there is a need, we can have meetings where we meet physically.

149
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:10,833
On the Swedish Social Insurance Agency's website there is information about the different benefits

150
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,533
But also digital self -service around the clock.

151
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:17,966
For example, via My pages you can report sickness

152
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:21,866
themselves and follow status in their case.

153
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:25,566
For those who work in healthcare there are special pages

154
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:29,366
Which provides information about things that you often ask from healthcare.

155
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:32,800
You can also contact a partner customer center.

156
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,000
There it is possible to if necessary

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,066
Leave a message to insurance investigators in a specific case.
