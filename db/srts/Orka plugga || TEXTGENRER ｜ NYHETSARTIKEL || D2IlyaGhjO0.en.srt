00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,280
NEWS ARTICLE

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,000
A news article is a text 
that describes a particular event.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,600
The introduction 
has to catch the reader's attention.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,800
The article's headline and the lead 
are followed by the body.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,000
You can also use pictures, charts, 
and explanatory fact boxes-

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,840
-to help the reader understand.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,280
Keep this in mind 
when you're writing a news article.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,240
Including interviews 
makes the article more substantial.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,400
They can, for instance, be in the form of 
eyewitness accounts or expert opinions.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,440
Your job is to relay an event to the public-

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,080
-so people have to understand and want 
to read the article. Explain difficult terms.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,520
Don't include your personal opinions, 
and stay objective.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,920
Describe what has happened, 
not how you feel about it.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,520
Articles should ideally include more than 
one perspective on the issue at hand.

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,040
Account for the event chronologically.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,560
How did it start? What happened 
during and after the event?
