00:00:00,365 --> 00:00:01.365
Hello Hello

2
00:00:01,955 --> 00:00:05.075
Here comes some more about the subject

3
00:00:05,075 --> 00:00:08.165
verbal interaction

4
00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:11,225
to get better at talking, on talking

5
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:13,045
to converse

6
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,635
In a new language, such as Swedish

7
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:19,395
and how to train on it

8
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:22,495
and what is good to think about

9
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:24,405
and

10
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:27.805
this may really be the most

11
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,785
Basic of what I talked about so far

12
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:33,865
and it is simply that

13
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:36,675
yourself contribute to

14
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:39,715
the conversation, that

15
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:42.705
say things that the other can

16
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,085
answer, to give things

17
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47.515
To contribute things

18
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,725
to throw things into the conversation

19
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:53,635
to open the call

20
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:56,475
with interesting things as it is possible for the other to

21
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59.555
give response to, to react to

22
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02.615
to reflect

23
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:05.605
but also to spin on

24
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:09.105
As I talked (about) in the last video

25
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:12,465
Because if you just say

26
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:15,575
the most mundane phrases

27
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,645
If you just ask "How are you?" and "How's the situation?" and

28
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,725
"How's your family?"

29
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:23,435
"It's cold today", such things

30
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:27,265
It is not possible to continue a call very long

31
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:30,145
If it's the only thing you

32
00:01:30,345 --> 00:01:33,585
gives, if that is the only thing you say

33
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:36,585
Without I have thought about it that

34
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:39,435
So, I try to think about, when I talk to

35
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:42.555
Friends and colleagues and so on, how do we do?

36
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:46,275
and very often a small conversation begins with that

37
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:49,455
someone, myself or someone else,

38
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:52.635
Make a very common statement of claims

39
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,555
"I saw....

40
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:56,985
on TV yesterday ”

41
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:00.455
"There is a new series on Netflix"

42
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:03.945
"I met it and that person yesterday"

43
00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:07.895
“We trained on

44
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,375
verbs in the classroom today ”

45
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:13,355
And then my colleague replies: "Well what is the series?"

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
or my buddy: "Oh, grammar is hard"

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,940
Or: “Yeah, did you meet him ....

48
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,620
I know him too. He ........ ”

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,880
and a lot of these things

50
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,945
As I talked a bit about, to ask

51
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:35,165
"what have you done this weekend?" and then answer that

52
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:38.565
That's how you get to know people, I think anyway

53
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:41,295
I do not know if

54
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,715
I talk a little about having read a book

55
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:47,625
Someone asks: "What have you done this weekend?" - Yes, I bought a new book

56
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,560
It seems good. Yes then I may notice that.

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55.880
one of my colleagues, she also likes to read

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,685
So then we start talking books with each other

59
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:01.255
and then there will be a longer call

60
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:04.065
and someone else is interested in music

61
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:07.135
and a third is interested in talking about the job and so on

62
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:11,105
It is based on you throw in something

63
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:14,355
you give a small hook that the other can

64
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:16,935
spin on / build on

65
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:20,825
yeah so to, think a little bit about it

66
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,585
were you around you

67
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:26,655
in your life? What are you doing?

68
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:29,725
What are you interested in? What do you think about?

69
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,885
What are you planning in the future?

70
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:35,035
As you can mention

71
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:38,125
in a call or when you meet someone

72
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,235
it doesn't have to be much to

73
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:43,475
it will be more anyway

74
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:46,315
you need to start somewhere and the first step is to say

75
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:48,955
something more than just these usual greeting

76
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,105
the phrases

77
00:03:51,025 --> 00:03:53.535
for they do not lead so far

78
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:55,255
and

79
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:58,375
There are those who are not so good

80
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01.315
In a language that does this anyway

81
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:04,175
It's not about what level of language you are

82
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07.225
Just ... really ...

83
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:10,195
Without you can do this with quite a bit of language

84
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:13,855
you can do it with almost no language at all

85
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:16,595
by

86
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:19,735
Pick up your mobile and show a picture

87
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,295
There is something to start talking about

88
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,995
so find ways to

89
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:28,705
show yourself, to bid on yourself

90
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:30,205
to tell something small

91
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:32,715
about yourself as the other can answer

92
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35.015
In order to build more calls

93
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38.515
and I know it's scary in the beginning, I know it's

94
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:40,795
hard. It's easy for me to say that

95
00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:43,695
But it can be difficult to do it in a new language.

96
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:46.605
But I think it's a way forward

97
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:49,755
and I think you can train on it by thinking about

98
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:52,725
what you can and want to tell

99
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56.905
Yes, so think about it

100
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59.495
And as usual

101
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:01,525
Comment, discuss

102
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:04,355
This is how we are moving forward by communicating with each other

103
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:07.135
and I need your

104
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:10,205
your reflections, your response to

105
00:05:10,205 --> 00:05:13,435
Get ideas for new videos and think further

106
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:17,075
So I am very happy and grateful for all the comments I get

107
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:20,355
I try to answer everything

108
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:23,315
I might miss sometimes and sometimes I just like

109
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:26,485
I promise, I read all the comments so that

110
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29.605
Yeah don't be afraid

111
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:30,715
Write and comment

112
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,585
and so we will see you so soon again I hope

113
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:37,265
Have a good one; bye
