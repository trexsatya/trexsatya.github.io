1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,320
My name is Bao Shou Mei.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,560
I was born in 1966.

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,480
Already in 1978, people could start doing business.

4
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,560
You could start making money on your own, on a small scale.

5
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
But the agricultural land was not divided between the families until 1980.

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,840
When the agricultural reform came into force, the soil was immediately divided.

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,680
We were all part of different production groups.

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,200
So then the production group's land was taken and distributed between the families.

9
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,240
It was distributed on the basis of how many people the household consisted of,

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,360
So how much country you got depended on how big the family was.

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,080
At that time we were eight people in our household.

12
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
There are quite a few.

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, we were eight people, so we got over 10 mu land.
 (about one hectare)

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,480
Families who had sons were easier to work in the fields.

15
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,840
In my family we were only girls who could do the manual work, which was quite tiring.

16
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,520
But all my sisters gave everything they could.

17
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,360
By that time my two older sisters were already married into other families,

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,400
But now we were free to do agricultural work as we considered appropriate,

19
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,640
And they could come to our home and help us if they wanted to.

20
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,480
So they came with their men to help.

21
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,160
My father passed away 24 years ago, almost 25 years ago.

22
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,520
I miss him very much.

23
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,560
While children in other families often went hungry,

24
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,880
He let me and my sisters never starve.

25
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,760
In secret he brought eggs into town -

26
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,200
At that time you could not do any kind of business.

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,560
If you were coming up, you ended up in real trouble, and became publicly shameful and spoiled.

28
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,280
But my father secretly took our family's eggs into the city,

29
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
and switched them to cornmeal.

30
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,920
We never had to go hungry.

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
He was so amazing to us, his daughters.

32
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,040
When other families did not have the opportunity to eat meat,

33
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
He made sure we got meat to eat.

34
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Although it was very little, he made sure we at least got it bad.

35
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,040
So in this way we all endured.

36
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,720
When I came to this family, when we got married,

37
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
We had a home with two rooms.

38
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,320
One of them was a new room, prepared for us, the newlyweds.

39
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,960
We got married in 1988, and the house was built in 1987.

40
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,680
It was built of wood, but of wood with very poor quality.

41
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,640
It was a very simple house.

42
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,560
The worst kind of house.

43
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,560
When I got married into this family, life was still not very good.

44
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,040
But I changed their lives.

45
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,040
I started raising a pig.

46
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,520
Then I sold the pig and used the money to buy a small donkey.

47
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
When we had bought the little donkey,

48
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,200
we could use it to transport detergents.

49
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,800
We went around to other villages,

50
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,760
For example, villages up in the mountains,

51
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,880
And replace washing powder with potatoes.

52
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,160
We then sold the potatoes and thus earned money.

53
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,880
But then the donkey became older and was not as helpful.

54
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,560
So we bought a large muzzle and a horse carriage.

55
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,080
In this way we could transport even more.

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,360
We saved money that way for two years, and then we were finally able to build a new house of pine.

57
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,080
Our children were also a little older at that time,

58
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,280
So we could be away from home longer moments then,

59
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,680
Which made it easier to save money for the house.

60
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,320
It must have been in 1997 or 1998.

61
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,600
It was the same year that Hong Kong was transferred to China!

62
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,200
I remember we had a small TV in our house when it was built.

63
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
We took the TV with us to my husband's brother's house,

64
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,240
And together we all watched the news on this TV.

65
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,000
When we built the house, we got compliments from everyone.

66
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,920
The house was built entirely in wood.

67
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:56,120
But after a while, everyone else started building brick houses.

68
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,920
So we started to think that we also wanted to build such a house.

69
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,320
But it would be a shame to tear down the wooden house.

70
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,600
It was only a few years old then.

71
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,680
When we built it we said it was a house we could get old in.

72
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
That our children could live there until they became old.

73
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,440
Everyone in the village said it.

74
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,800
It would have been a shame to tear it down.

75
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:31,800
So we decided to change some of our arable land to a piece of land where we could build this new house.

76
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,880
We started preparing to move here and build a house here instead.

77
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
We built the house in 2010.

78
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,200
If you compare my life as a 12-year-old and my children's lives as 12-year-olds,

79
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,520
you can find both similarities and differences.

80
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,600
One difference is that they both went to school.

81
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,680
None of my sisters went to school.

82
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,120
My husband did not go to school.

83
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
But my two children went to school.

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:43,040
When I was young, maybe seven or eight children out of twenty went to school.

85
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,800
The rest of the children did not go to school, but worked in the fields in the work team.

86
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,640
But when we had children,

87
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,880
Had China had new strategies to get rid of illiterate.

88
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Every child would then go to school.

89
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,200
So when my children grew up, everyone went to school.

90
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,120
When I was growing up, each family had only a small house.

91
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,960
If it was a family with many sons, but they were not married yet,

92
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,480
Sleep everyone on the big kang together.

93
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:54,520
In winter it was heated with dried leaves and straw.

94
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,160
When it was heated, everyone slept there together.

95
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
It was the same throughout northwestern China.

96
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,160
When we cooked, we did not use electricity.

97
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,840
We burned straw for cooking.

98
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:45,080
We had a stove of earth,

99
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,280
A large wok and a bellows.

100
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,800
We used the bellows to keep the fire alive.

101
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,760
One person stood with the bellows while another cooked the food.

102
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,800
When we ate we did not have a kitchen table.

103
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,240
Just a small table that we put on the kang.

104
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,640
The elderly sat on the kang and ate.

105
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,160
The really small kids also sat on the kang.

106
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,320
The older children just took their bowls and sat anywhere.

107
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,400
As long as they got food it was good.

108
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,400
When we were young,

109
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,800
We drank spring water.

110
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,840
At that time, the water was not contaminated, it was very clean.

111
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,720
The quality was also very good.

112
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,960
We simply dug a well next to the river.

113
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,920
And then we drank the water from the well.

114
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,800
I never left the village, I've always lived here.

115
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,240
When I was 40 years old or almost 40 years old ...

116
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,320
When I was 38 ... I forgot!

117
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,200
It was about then that the water was contaminated and we could no longer drink it.

118
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,160
If we drank our spring water, it was bad for health.

119
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,040
The government built water pipes so that we all had running water instead.

120
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,280
This water came from the mountains.

121
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,680
Then we all had running water at home to drink.

122
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,160
We didn't have to go to pick up water anymore.

123
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,400
At home we only used running water, it was really comfortable.

124
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,560
At that time, we did not have all these ideas about not having enough.

125
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,840
Not having enough money, or not having enough of this or that.

126
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
We didn't think so.

127
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,720
If you had enough to eat in the morning, but not in the evening -

128
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Then you ate happily in the morning.

129
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
And when you had eaten up your breakfast,

130
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,600
Did you go out and tried to make sure you could get something to eat for the evening.

131
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
It was a common situation for families here.

132
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
But people were still happy, very happy.

133
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,240
Every day it was laughter and smiles.

134
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,480
Both among adults and children.

135
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
So how do you think it's today?

136
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Nowadays I think ...

137
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:41,960
People who are forward -looking, they make money quickly.

138
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,320
But whether you make a lot of money or if you are fighting, people are still the same ...

139
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
The atmosphere is no longer filled with joy.

140
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,320
It's really unusual.

141
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Now it's just about money every day.
 Money, money, money.

142
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,640
People who do not have money, try to make money, and always think about money.

143
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
People who have money, they think ...

144
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
... also just for money!

145
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Everything is about money, yes.
 That's how it is!
