1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,320
My name is Bao Shou Mei.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,560
I was born in 1966.

3
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,480
In 1978, people could already start doing their own business.

4
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,560
You could start making money on your own, small scale.

5
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
But the farmland was not divided up between the families until 1980.

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,840
When the agricultural reform happened the division of the land took place at once.

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,680
We were all part of different production teams.

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,200
So they took the land of the production team and distributed it between the families.

9
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,240
It was distributed according to how many people was part of the household.

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,360
How much land you got depended on how big the family was.

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,080
At the time we were eight people in our household.

12
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,360
That's quite many.

13
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, we were eight people, so we got well over 10 mu land. (about one hectare)

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,480
Families that had sons
had it easier to work the fields

15
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,840
In my family we were only girls to do manual labour, which was quite tiring.

16
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,520
But all my sisters would give it their all.

17
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,360
At that time, my two older sisters were already married into other families,

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,400
But now we were free to do farm work as we saw fit,

19
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,640
and they could come to our home and help us if they wanted.

20
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,480
So they came with their husbands to help us out.

21
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,160
My father passed away 24 years ago, almost 25 years ago.

22
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,520
I miss my father very much.

23
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,560
While children in other families would often go hungry,

24
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,880
He never let me and my sisters go hungry.

25
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,760
Secretly, he would take eggs into the city -

26
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,200
At that time, you couldn't do any type of business.

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,560
If you got caught, you would get into trouble and get shamed publicly.

28
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,280
But my father secretly brought our family's eggs into to the city,

29
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
and exchanged them for corn flower.

30
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,920
We never had to go hungry.

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
He was so good to us, his daughters.

32
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,040
At times when other families could not eat meat,

33
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
he would give us meat to eat.

34
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Even if it was very little, he would still make sure we got some.

35
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,040
So we all endured that way.

36
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,720
When I came into this family, when we got married,

37
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
We had a home with two rooms.

38
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,320
One of them was a new room, prepared for us, the newly weds.

39
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,960
We got married 1988, and the house was built in 1987.

40
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,680
It was built with wood, but very bad quality wood.

41
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,640
It was also a very simple house.

42
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,560
A house of the worst kind.

43
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,560
When I married into this family, life was still not very good.

44
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,040
But I changed their lives.

45
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,040
I began raising a pig.

46
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,520
I then sold the pig, and used the money to buy a small donkey.

47
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
After we bough the little donkey,

48
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,200
We could use the donkey to transport washing powder.

49
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,800
We would go to other villages,

50
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,760
like villages up in the mountains,

51
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,880
And exchange the washing powder for potatoes.

52
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,160
We would then sell the potatoes and make money from that.

53
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,880
And then slowly the donkey got older and wasn't as helpful anymore.

54
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,560
So we bought a big mule, and a horse cart.

55
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,080
That way we could transport even more.

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,360
We saved up money like that for two years, and then we could build a new house of pine wood.

57
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,080
Our children were also little older at that time,

58
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,280
so we could be away from home for longer then,

59
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,680
which made it easier to save up money for the house.

60
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,320
That must have been in 1997 or 1998.

61
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,600
It was the same year that Hong Kong was transferred back to China!

62
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,200
I remember that we had a small television in our house when it was built.

63
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
We brought the TV with us to my husbands brothers house,

64
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,240
and we all watched the news together on the TV.

65
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,000
At that time, when we build the house, everyone would compliment us.

66
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,920
The house was built all by wood.

67
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:56,120
But then everybody started building brick houses.

68
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,920
So we began thinking that we wanted to build one of those too.

69
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,320
But it would be a shame to tear down the wooden house.

70
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,600
It was only a few years old.

71
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,680
When we built it, we said we could grow old there.

72
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
That our kids could grow old there.

73
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,440
Everyone in the village was saying that.

74
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,800
It would have been a shame to tear it down.

75
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:31,800
So we decided to change some of our land for a place where we could build this new house.

76
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,880
So we started to prepare to move to this place and build a house here instead.

77
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
We built it in 2010.

78
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,200
If you compare my life as a 12 year old and my children's lives as 12 year olds,

79
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,520
there are both similarities and differences.

80
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,600
One difference is that they all went to school.

81
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,680
None of my sisters went to school.

82
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,120
My husband also didn't go to school.

83
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
But my both of my children went to school.

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:43,040
When I was young, there would be maybe seven or eight kids out of twenty that went to school.

85
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,800
All the rest didn't go to school, but did manual work in the work unit.

86
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,640
But when we had children,

87
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,880
China had new policies to whipe out illiteracy.

88
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
And every child were to attend school.

89
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,200
So, when my children grew up everyone went to school.

90
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,120
When I grew up, every family had just a small house.

91
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,960
If it was a family with many sons, but they were not married yet,

92
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,480
Everyone would sleep on the big kang together.

93
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:54,520
In winter time it was heated up with dried leaves and straw.

94
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,160
When it was heated up, everyone slept there together.

95
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
It was the same all over north-western China.

96
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,160
When we cooked we didn't use electricity.

97
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,840
We burned straw for cooking.

98
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:45,080
We had a stove made of soil

99
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,280
a big wok, and a bellows.

100
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,800
We would use the bellows to blow on the fire to keep it going.

101
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,760
One person would use the bellows while another would be cooking.

102
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,800
When we ate we didn't have these kitchen tables.

103
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,240
Just a small table that we put on the kang.

104
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,640
The older people would sit on the kang and eat.

105
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,160
The really small children would also sit on the kang.

106
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:23,320
The older kids would just take their bowls and sit wherever.

107
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,400
As long as they were fed that was fine.

108
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,400
When we were young,

109
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,800
The water we drank was spring water.

110
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,840
At that time there was no pollution, the water was very clean.

111
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,720
The quality was very good too.

112
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,960
We would just dig a well next to the river.

113
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,920
Then we would just drink the water from the well.

114
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,800
I never left this village, I've always lived here.

115
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,240
When I was 40 years old, or almost 40 years old...

116
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,320
When I was 38... I've forgotten.

117
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,200
That's about the time when the water got polluted and we couldn't drink it any more.

118
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,160
If we drank our spring water then, it was bad for our health.

119
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,040
The government build water pipes so we all had running water instead.

120
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,280
This water came from the mountains.

121
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,680
After that we all had running water to drink.

122
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,160
We didn't have to go fetch water anymore.

123
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,400
At home we just used running water, it was really convenient.

124
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,560
At that time we didn't have all these ideas about not having enough.

125
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,840
Not having enough money, or not having enough of this or that.

126
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
We didn't think like that.

127
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,720
If you had enough to eat in the morning, but not in the evening -

128
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Then you would eat happily in the morning.

129
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
And when you had finished the food in the morning,

130
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,600
you would go out and try to make sure you could get something to eat for the evening.

131
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
That was a common situation for families here.

132
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
But people were still happy, very happy.

133
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,240
Every day people were laughing and smiling.

134
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,480
Both the adults and the children.

135
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
So what do you think it's like nowadays, then?

136
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I think nowadays...

137
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:41,960
People who are forward thinking, they earn money fast.

138
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:50,320
But regardless if you make a lot of money or if you struggle, people are still the same.

139
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
The atmosphere is not as joyous any longer.

140
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,320
It's really uncommon.

141
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Now everyday is just about money. Money, money, money.

142
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,640
People who have no money, are trying to earn money, always thinking about money.

143
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
People who have money are also...

144
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,800
...all about money

145
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
All about money, yes. That's what it's like.
