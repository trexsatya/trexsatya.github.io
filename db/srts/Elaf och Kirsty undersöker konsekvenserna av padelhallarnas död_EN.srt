1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,040
The news has probably reached us all.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
Some of Sweden's most important nodes disappear:

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,560
The paddle halls.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,920
That's right. More than half of the country's paddle halls are expected to go bankrupt.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,400
We will see how the Swedish people will survive this.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,680
- Did you know what paddle is? -Yes, I know that.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,200
- One you have when paddling. - No, no, not that paddle.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,400
- Do you play paddle? - under Covid, but I quit.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,560
It was a trend instead of sports.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,840
Which are you worried about to die first, the paddle hall or you?

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,320
What do you think they will use for apologies when they have been unfaithful -

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,760
- Now when they can't use paddle?

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,080
Are you from SVT?

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,560
Yes.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,400
Oh!

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Did you learn Swedish by playing paddle?

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,160
Yes ... or, I knew Swedish before too.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,880
- But it helped, like? - Yes, you can say that.

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,240
- Do you play paddle? - No, fuck!

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,480
- Is it a shit sport? -Yes.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
- Are you glad it dies out? -Yes.

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,680
Do you think gang crime is now increasing when so many paddle halls are closed?

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,680
But are you worried about all Sweden's middle managers?

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Middle managers? Yes, that was another issue.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
How does it feel now that you need to spend more time with your family?

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,640
â€“Wa? - For the paddle halls close.

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,800
No, people do not seem to care about this extensive change in society.

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,520
No, and what it can have for consequences can only be time.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,080
Back to you, Messiah.
