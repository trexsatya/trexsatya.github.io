1
00:00:01.075 --> 00:00:01.734
This


2
00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:02.515
💦💦


3
00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:03.434
that- öhöhö


4
00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:06.868
Unless someone picks a fight with the coRRrnified layer...


5
00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:08.725
Here comes winter!


6
00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:10.287
OOHH I'm so thirsty!


7
00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:12.458
Where is there water, where is there water?


8
00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:13.937
And then it starts looking.


9
00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:14.551
Uhrrrr!


10
00:00:14.763 --> 00:00:17.458
Then we would collapse like empty bags.


11
00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:19.355
Now there's


12
00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:20.336
𝐟 𝐚 𝐭


13
00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:22.234
around all the cells.


14
00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.379
Blä-lä-lä-lä-lä


15
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:24.709
stab


16
00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:25.092
stab stab


17
00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:25.443
stab stab stab


18
00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:25.793
stab stab stab stab


19
00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:27.763
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!


20
00:00:27.763 --> 00:00:30.468
The whole house is full of childhood diseases.


21
00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:31.925
But it's not allowed scratch!


22
00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:32.601
No! 😤


23
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.337
And then I recommend


24
00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:36.120
that you only eat


25
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.718
mashed food.
(mm yum)


26
00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:39.730
All the antibodies start going


27
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.951
to a scarlet fever school.


28
00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:44.794
Cold...


29
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:46.069
Hi!


30
00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:47.601
Cold.


31
00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:51.634
Now check out all these yellow blobs.
🟡🟡🟡🟡🟡


32
00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.835
We say I poke myself in the eye.


33
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Remember that this is a yellow blob. 🟡


34
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.084
But now!


35
00:00:57.084 --> 00:00:59.234
Now the body gets angry!


36
00:00:59.234 --> 00:01:00.317
Eg-hu! Eg-hu eggh!


37
00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:02.109
39 degrees!


38
00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.267
Now it's hot!


39
00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:05.034
So it's good to have a fever.


40
00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:05.566
Oh man,


41
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.295
then you get an earache too. 🙄


42
00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:08.000
snort


43
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.939
Oh yes!


44
00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:09.645
snort


45
00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:10.748
Aah!


46
00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:11.088
mini-snort


47
00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:11.751
Mm :)


48
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:12.644
Thank you Eva!


49
00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:13.718
Yes, you're welcome.


50
00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:14.967
You have time to- hhnh


51
00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:16.951
blow your nose a lot of times.


52
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.842
The immune system!


53
00:01:18.842 --> 00:01:19.518
Ha-ha! &gt;:D


54
00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:20.980
The bonk-bonk line.


55
00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:23.151
Bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk!


56
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:25.135
And bonk bonk bonk- meh!


57
00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:26.312
But whoops!


58
00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:27.551
What the, what happened here? :O


59
00:01:27.818 --> 00:01:31.351
Yeah, hehe, these guys don't know much.
(a bit like me :') )


60
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.918
Hoh! :O


61
00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:34.609
He recognizes this one!


62
00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:35.975

65
00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:36.847

71
00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:41.256

72
00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:42.000
blööghhh!


73
00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:42.706

74
00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:43.751
AHH! Hahah!


75
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:45.302
You want to swim on Saturdays,


76
00:01:45.302 --> 00:01:46.479
you want to go to parties


77
00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.148
TOOOT


78
00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:48.117
and then you want-


79
00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:49.792
So it's important


80
00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:51.097
to take it easy


81
00:01:51.662 --> 00:01:54.464
and just look at the clouds.


82
00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:55.601
Hmmm! :)


83
00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:57.486
And then another thing.


84
00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:59.317
Eat with cutlery.


85
00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:00.296
Now I'm going to sneeze


86
00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:01.362
ATCHO


87
00:02:01.362 --> 00:02:02.189
ATCHO-


88
00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.112
ATCHO!


89
00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:03.612
hm


90
00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:05.401
Why do you have to sleep?
(I'm literally transcribing this at 05:03 i'm sorry Eva I've let you down)


91
00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:06.668
What the! &gt;:o


92
00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:07.832

93
00:02:07.832 --> 00:02:09.188
(more chaos)


94
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.868
Yes, then you can wake up! 😊
(thank you, oh almighty Eve, for letting me wake up)


95
00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:14.427
Bob the Box is going to kindergarten.


96
00:02:14.427 --> 00:02:15.120

97
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.668

HMMHMM!


131
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.694
Like that! But that's how it is with warts.


132
00:03:07.694 --> 00:03:08.551
It's life.
( :I )


133
00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:09.927
Goodbye water wart.


134
00:03:10.343 --> 00:03:12.899

And I will NOT slip. &gt;:I


140
00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:25.067
It feels like- you feel like a big pillow, actually.


141
00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:26.378
Ooh pillow!


142
00:03:26.378 --> 00:03:27.042

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:29.575
Wet in the bed?


146
00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:30.922
Did you think I peed myself?


147
00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:32.551
Noo, it wasn't like that at all.


148
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.117
It gets squeaky and so aa

Let the hands fall ouuuu!


154

Yes! It continues here.


159
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.234
The poop rally continues!
🏎️💩


160
00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:56.918
The journey in the small intestine is over.


161
00:03:56.918 --> 00:03:58.608
-looks like this.


162
00:03:58.608 --> 00:03:59.401
Heheha!


163
00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:02.588
