1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.320
It started well with a general fascination for older buildings, old houses.

2
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.280
I went to a building maintenance training, ended up with a tile stove maker

3
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.920
And a little on that road it was.

4
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.040
My most common mission is to redo an existing stove.

5
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.760
"Setting" means to tear and wall.

6
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.400
A little nice, I think, to work with tiled stoves

7
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.360
It is probably partly the contrasts.
 It's pretty heavy, dirty and tiring -

8
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.560
But it will be such an incredibly beautiful end product.

9
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.240
The tile stove itself can last for hundreds of years

10
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.480
Then you have to change it and replace the brick inside.

11
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.840
A life span between the turnover of between 30 and 100 years.

12
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.440
It depends terribly on how it is fired.

13
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.560
Glaze is extremely permanent, so the colors are the same since they were created.

14
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.240
I think such details are nice.

15
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.920
I think the tile stove professional will live on.

16
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.880
I don't see that it would change.

17
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.800
It is rather greater demand now than it has been a few decades.

18
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.720
People realize the value in having a heat source

19
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.120
That makes you basically independent of the outside world.

20
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.880
Once you have received in clay use in all joints

21
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.440
So you go on and mushrooms to it all.

22
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.160
Removes superfluous.

23
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.160
When I am going to join an oven, I start by scratching the joints from old joint

24
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.560
And I do that with a regular break knife, or some thin blade.

25
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.200
It is important that you do not break sideways, because then the glaze can danger.

26
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.520
Without pulling straight, along the joints.

27
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.480
The texture of the joint should be a little creamy.

28
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.560
Pretty firm, but not too hard.

29
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.640
Now I join this oven with a mixture of just chalk and water.

30
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.080
Realize about your oven is something that you can advantageously do yourself.

31
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.320
And how often one does it is entirely up to each

32
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.240
But preferably when the fire season is complete, you have a nice oven all summer -

33
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.440
And this fall.

34
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.240
So there, it was good.

35
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.680
The funniest little part is to be done with an oven.

36
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.920
Because it is so incredibly satisfying to see the pre -joined oven in front of it.

37
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.200
Take that last photo, and see how damn nice it was.

38
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.720
I like that very much.
 To be done.
