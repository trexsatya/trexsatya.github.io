00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06.860
We have filmed a lot in Rinkeby to change the media image.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,640
In the media, Rinkeby is always portrayed to be a "no go zone".

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,040
You can't go there, it's dangerous and it's always just a lot of negative things happening there.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,740
There is never anything positive that comes from Rinkeby and I think it is very shame.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,260
When we have talked to people living in Rinkeby, everyone really says that the media picture is very skewed.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,720
Their everyday life is not reflected in the media reporting at all, but their reality is quite different.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37.620
Some think it is completely different and that they feel that the media invents.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,820
It has been very interesting to make these videos and we have received a lot of response.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:51,420
We have received both positive and negative comments and I really encourage everyone to comment on your thoughts.

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,740
Even if you do not feel the same, it is through conversations that you move forward in some way.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,700
Some of you have commented that we should talk to the police in the area.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,120
They have an overall picture, are there every day and see the worst.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,020
I have got in touch with a guy named Hanif who is a police officer in Rinkeby and I will meet him.

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,860
Now I'm going to Rinkeby.

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,860
-I met Rickard here. You have lived here, right? -Yes exactly. The first year as newlyweds me and the lady.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,780
-Do you well thrilled then? -Yes I did.

17
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,600
Then we moved because we would plug and such, so now we live in SmÃ¥land.

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,660
-Do you find that the media image of Rinkeby is correct? -In Rinkeby lives the people and people are who they are.

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,520
Some are Koko and some are very wonderful, it is mixed here just like elsewhere.

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,340
There are absolutely problems, but there are opportunities as well.

21
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,600
Great fun!

22
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,700
Rickard arrived because he saw the video, damn fun!

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,580
-A small sequel. -Yes, exactly so now we're going to film with Hanif.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,800
-How long have you worked as a police officer? -I have worked for seven years as a police officer.

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59.060
Rinkeby is one of the areas I worked within.

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,680
What is the best thing about being a police officer?

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08.920
The best thing is that you represent society and to help everyone who needs our help.
