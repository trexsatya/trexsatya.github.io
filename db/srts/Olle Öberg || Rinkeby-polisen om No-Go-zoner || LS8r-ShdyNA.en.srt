1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,860
We have filmed a lot in Rinkeby to change the media image.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,640
In the media, Rinkeby is always portrayed to be a "no go zone".

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,040
You can't go there, it's dangerous and it's always just a lot of negative things happening there.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,740
There is never anything positive that comes from Rinkeby and I think it is very shame.

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,260
When we have talked to people living in Rinkeby, everyone really says that the media picture is very skewed.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,720
Their everyday life is not reflected in the media reporting at all, but their reality is quite different.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,620
Some think it is completely different and that they feel that the media invents.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,820
It has been very interesting to make these videos and we have received a lot of response.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:51,420
We have received both positive and negative comments and I really encourage everyone to comment on your thoughts.

10
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,740
Even if you do not feel the same, it is through conversations that you move forward in some way.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,700
Some of you have commented that we should talk to the police in the area.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,120
They have an overall picture, are there every day and see the worst.

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,020
I have got in touch with a guy named Hanif who is a police officer in Rinkeby and I will meet him.

14
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,860
Now I'm going to Rinkeby.

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,860
-I met Rickard here.
 You have lived here, right?
 -Yes exactly.
 The first year as newlyweds me and the lady.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,780
-Do you well thrilled then?
 -Yes I did.

17
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,600
Then we moved because we would plug and such, so now we live in Småland.

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,660
-Do you find that the media image of Rinkeby is correct?
 -In Rinkeby lives the people and people are who they are.

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,520
Some are Koko and some are very wonderful, it is mixed here just like elsewhere.

20
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,340
There are absolutely problems, but there are opportunities as well.

21
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,600
Great fun!

22
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,700
Rickard arrived because he saw the video, damn fun!

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,580
-A small sequel.
 -Yes, exactly so now we're going to film with Hanif.

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,800
-How long have you worked as a police officer?
 -I have worked for seven years as a police officer.

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,060
Rinkeby is one of the areas I worked within.

26
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,680
What is the best thing about being a police officer?

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,920
The best thing is that you represent society and to help everyone who needs our help.

28
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,960
How come you stand up and help me with this Youtube video today?

29
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:22,780
I don't really see that I help you, but I see that we can get our message out what the area looks like.

30
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,660
People can get a different idea if I can join in and tell from my point of view.

31
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,440
Do you think the media image shown today in, for example, American or Russian media that has been here-

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,300
-Do you decorate that it is well in line with everyday life here?

33
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,760
No it does not.
 The media image is not representative of the area.

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,680
I think it is very much about sensation journalism-

35
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,240
-There they have to sell stuff quickly and that is why they report as they do.

36
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,860
I don't think that's right.

37
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,540
We have a big assignment and it extends all over the area.

38
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,340
Rinkeby is just part of it, but if we have time we try to patrol.

39
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:25,600
But we should be there for everyone, not only in Rinkeby but it should be in Tensta, Kista and Husby.

40
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,660
After all, it gets divided.

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:38,400
-But do you feel that you would need more resources?
 -Yes, we would have to be more police officers on the street.

42
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,860
Then it is like this that if we are more police officers on the street then we will report more wrestling-

43
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,140
-And we report more crimes, we must have more police officers who handle the reports.

44
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:57,680
Everything is connected so that more police officers outdoors result in more police officers and investigators inside.

45
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,560
I think that for many here above all they would think it was nice if we were present all the time.

46
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,340
Many times I need to report inside station or do other stuff.

47
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,080
If we could be out and show ourselves all the time, I think many would appreciate it.

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,740
-Yes really, you get a different relationship with the police in some way.

49
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:25,020
-Definitively and that is what I really believe in trying to create a relationship with all young people here.

50
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,500
If you are outsiders and will tell someone then it will not listen to you the same way-

51
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:38,540
-As if you were to be a friend or family, you create a relationship then you also tend to listen more to us.

52
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:47,140
The thing about relationship creation is one of the most important factors and it has been neglected a bit.

53
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,420
We work more with efforts and that you go out when something happens instead of being here.

54
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,820
-Then maybe you just see the police when something happens?
 -Exactly!

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,280
If you are a youth, you should also meet the police when nothing has happened, right?

56
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,360
Than only when something happens.

57
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,520
Then you get good contact with the police and then you get a different view of the police.

58
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,800
We are not really inside evil people, we just want the area well as well.

59
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,520
I thought we would address the concept of "no go zone" said in the media.

60
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,120
Do you think this is a "no go zone"?

61
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,960
No I do not think so.
 You notice yourself, it's a nice day and everyone is here.

62
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,360
Everyone is more than welcome here and we need more people moving and want to live in this area.

63
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,400
But of course there are problems?

64
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Definitely and it is important to remember that everything is not gold and green forests.

65
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,920
We have problems with drug sales that bring lots of problems.

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,360
This means that you are exposed to threats and violence.

67
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,560
You can get rid of your belongings if you question a person who is doing drugs.

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,320
-It's criminal gang that is here as well?
 -Yes exactly.

69
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,080
It is an open drug sale that to some extent what I experience has been shot back-

70
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,440
-Do the reason why we have received lots of surveillance cameras.

71
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,000
It is much better atmosphere now than before, but now they hang around at other places.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,840
It is one of the problems we have and we also have problems with gang crime.

73
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,440
There has been an explosion in terms of the number of murders.
 In these areas, many people have died.

74
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,640
I think it is highest in the whole country number of people who have been murdered.

75
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,800
I myself have been involved in trying to save people's lives and seen how they died in front of me and it is terrible.

76
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
It is one of our problems.

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,040
But the risk of an ordinary citizen, should you be afraid when you come here?

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,440
I don't think you should be afraid but there is an increased risk I would say.

79
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:09,520
It is not completely problem -free, especially in the evening as ordinary people are not so much out.

80
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,720
But what are these problems because do you think it will be gang crime and some become criminals?

81
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,320
It is some kind of exclusion, you feel no hope and do not believe in your ability to succeed.

82
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:35,080
You do not have the right role models.
 You see that some sell and make money and think that is the way to go.

83
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,800
It is very easy to end up there.

84
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
That's one of the problems.

85
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,400
Is it young ages too or?

86
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:50,640
Above all, many people at a young age are 10-12 years old until you are around 20 years old.

87
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:59,680
Eventually, hopefully you leave the criminal track as soon as you meet wife and get a family.

88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,960
Most leave the crime.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,960
What do you think you should do more?
 I guess the police need more resources and such, what do you think?

90
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,600
We need to work in two places I usually say.

91
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,760
We need to work with the social stuff, trying to make people feel involved in society, try-

92
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:26,360
-He more role models, be present, create a good relationship and make people feel hope for the future.

93
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,440
But then we also need to sharpen and screw to certain legislation.

94
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,280
If you commit crimes, if you throw stones at police or threaten someone, there should be consequences.

95
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,000
It should not take that long.
 If you are suspected of crime, it should not take a year before you are sentenced.

96
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,160
If you are convicted of a crime over and over again, it should not be enough to get a conditional sentence.

97
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,200
It must be screwed up so we can signal to everyone else that if you do not take care of it, there will be consequences.

98
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,520
You said earlier that is what many want here?

99
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:07,600
Definitely.
 Most people here fight extremely hard and struggle every day.

100
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,960
I usually say that if you own a store here then you wrestle with much more problems and-

101
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,640
-You struggle even harder to get it together and get your business going around.

102
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,120
Many people fight hard.

103
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Then they also want results, they want help from us.
 If we can't help the citizens, we will fail them.

104
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,520
From time to time, I can see that it feels like we from society fail some citizens when we are not enough.

105
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,520
It is very frustrating as a police officer.

106
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,160
It doesn't matter to wear uniform and walk around if you can't really help people.

107
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,360
But sometimes do you feel that you help?

108
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,040
Yes, we do our best.

109
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,000
We do as best we can, but we are not enough.

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,520
There is a lot that we wish we could do more, but which we can't do.

111
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,640
But to politicians, what would you say to them?

112
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,680
So what to do, what to invest in and such.

113
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:13,720
Most often you should listen to research.
 It is not just enough to think of yourself, their party and their own budget.

114
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,000
You can think of: "What can we do for real for our area?".

115
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:26,520
It is very important to remember that what is happening in our suburbs is not just the problem for those who live here.

116
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,720
That is all of Sweden's problems.

117
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:37,200
If you feel bad and do not enjoy here, there can be consequences for other people in other areas.

118
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,240
It is something we have to work with, the whole community.

119
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,640
Are you thinking about radicalization?

120
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,840
For example, or even if included in gang crime, crime will not only hit this area.

121
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,600
It will hit you who have a home in Djursholm and you can be exposed to crime there.

122
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,880
-It will be rings on the water as well?
 -Exactly!

123
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:05,000
So as I perceive it is growing more and more, we will have more exclusion areas.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,640
We do not have police officers so it is enough so we have to invest in this and work harder to reverse the trend.

125
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,840
What would you say to those who have never been to Rinkeby?
 It is a question I have asked almost everyone.

126
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:27,640
Of course, it would be great fun if you could come here really.
 Everyone is welcome and it is very nice.

127
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,520
I can sometimes feel that there is an incredible warmth and joy.

128
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,200
I've known the same thing.
 When I was here last time and walked around with a camera came a guy.

129
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,160
He said, "What are you doing? Are you filming?"
 And I replied that I film a little and hang here.

130
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,160
I first thought he would be very skeptical of me because he had a little tough attitude-

131
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,440
-But he told me "Everyone is welcome, Väkommen!".
 I became so happy.

132
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,600
Really, it is a very black and white image you get in the media.

133
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,440
I don't want to paint this area as just negative or just positive.

134
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,600
We have our problems, but come here and get your own opinion and give all people a chance.

135
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,120
Even if you come from Rinkeby or whatever, it's nice people.

136
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:15,480
Many who are fighting against, even though they are poor, they fight even harder against all the prejudices that exist.

137
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,200
Many people fight really hard to get their everyday lives together.

138
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,360
So come and visit us!

139
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,960
Something I think about is that you have to give everyone a chance.
 One does not have to have so much prejudice-

140
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,240
-And also try not to see people from here as a problem but rather as an asset.

141
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Really be postitive and welcoming, so you do much easier for many who live here.

142
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:48,120
They need to feel more welcome in Sweden than they just stay in Rinkeby.

143
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,560
The truth is that many just want to stay here because here they can chill, be comfortable and be seen as they are.

144
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,640
If they step out and are in town, they can be seen as a problem, that many people think "what is this for people?".

145
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,520
Many people perceive it as hard and you make people a disservice.

146
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:20,360
Give everyone a chance and come here, get their own opinion and there are nice people here I think.

147
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,080
I think so too.
 You seem nice too, you and your colleagues!

148
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,760
-Ha it good!
 -Good work!

149
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,600
Good luck, hello!

150
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,240
It was really crap to meet Hanif.

151
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:43,560
Which fire soul really is passionate about the area and that Rinkeby should be better and against prejudice and such.
