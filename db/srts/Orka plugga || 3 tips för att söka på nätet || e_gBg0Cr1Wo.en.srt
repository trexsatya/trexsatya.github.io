00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,520
When searching for facts and information to a task-

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07.680
-Is, for example, environmental impact-

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,480
-Can it be good to know basic search techniques.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,000
These help you get the best possible result.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,040
Here are three tips on how to optimize your search.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,280
When to search for a concept consisting of several words-

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,960
-Can it be good to write the words within quotation marks.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31.560
Then you limit your search to just show out results-

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,720
-which contains the words in sequence.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,280
If you write "global warming", you will get results with the concept.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,520
Instead you search for “global warming” without quotation mark-

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,200
-can some search engines display results where either "global"-

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,800
-or "heating" is included.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,080
A method that can help you get a wider search-

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,800
-In some search engines are truncation.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,680
By adding a star to the word stem-

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02.640
-Do you hit all words with the same beginning as your keyword.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,960
For example, you search for "environment*"-

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,160
-can you get search hits as "environment", "environment"--

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,840
-"Environmental issues", "environmental impact", etc.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,280
In many search engines you can control how you want to combine your keywords-

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,080
-by using booles search.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,280
It means you write the words:

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,440
"and", "or", or "note" between your keywords.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
For example, if you are to search on-

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,240
-My environmental impact in Sweden you can write:

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,120
"Environmental impact or climate change or carbon dioxide emissions and Sweden".

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,480
In order for the search engine to know which word-

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,200
-which should be searched together with the word "or"-

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,720
-Do you turn the words into a bracket.

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,760
Then you get search hits containing "Sweden"-

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,240
-and some of the words “environmental impact”-

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,720
-"Climate change" and "carbon dioxide emissions".

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Thus, to optimize your search you can use:

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,480
Drawing, truncation and booles search.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,400
These are some tips to help you find-

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,080
-This you are looking for on the internet and can make you save time.
