00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,700
What is this? What is this?

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,800
Hello?

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,500
What the hell is this a fucking joke?

6
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,816
Seriously! Hello?

7
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,877
Away with you ball fucking!

8
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,460
I don't get any air, help me!

9
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,840
Kent's cat and party?

10
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,160
I don't remember this.

11
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,280
I don't remember anything.

12
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, it's so hot.

13
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59.707
Oh, it's so hot.

14
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07.920
"The Blue Man"

15
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello?

16
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,260
Hello?

17
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,240
Hello! Hello!

18
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
Hello! Hello!

19
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,730
Thank goodness, damn what happy I am.

20
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,640
I come from inside the forest here.

21
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,510
I'm stuck in this damn costume. I don't know where I am.

22
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,100
This costume, it's so damn hot.

23
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,530
It's a fucking circus everything together.

24
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,463
What the hell…

25
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,750
No, but what are you doing? Hello?

26
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00.820
No, stay! I must have help getting rid of my suit. I don't get out of it myself.

27
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,520
No, wait! You can't just leave me here.

28
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,050
What the hell...

29
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,300
Quiet. Sit, sit ...

30
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:20,550
I'll just go and, if you ...

31
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,170
No, his still.

32
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,521
Schas, disappear!

33
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,720
Why do you have to follow me for?

34
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42.560
My God what a fucking day, that's not true.

35
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,790
Okay the cat.

36
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,900
What are you called now?

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,440
"Sailor Moon"? Okay?

38
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,080
Wow, wow, wow ...

39
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56.060
Take it easy.

40
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,290
Listen to me now.

41
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,550
I go away and then I ask someone to help me out of the suit.

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03.451
Then I'll come back to you. And helps you.

43
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,010
Is that good?

44
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,700
Great!

45
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,660
What the hell...

46
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,720
“I'm Allan Svensson, this is Dagens Nyheter

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,000
The investigation on the brutal politician murder is still taking place behind locked doors. "

48
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,380
Hello! Hello!

49
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,910
Hello! Do you only have time for a little while? I would really need help getting out of this suit.

50
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,960
What the hell...

51
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:54.540
Excuse me. I know I look the right foam. But I don't get out of this damn stuffed animal myself.

52
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,870
Oh, thank you as hell. It's so sickly hot ..

53
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01.660
Smurf devil!

54
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05.920
What the hell! Can't I just borrow a phone anyway? Huh?

55
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,640
Satan's phone ...

56
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,660
Look for fuck, so I can fit.

57
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,860
"I love you for who you are"

58
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,700
Hörredu, it's closed.

59
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,980
Leffe for fuck! Lol!

60
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,260
"Front and back!"

61
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,220
"Come on girls. Front and back."

62
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,180
Where is the brake?

63
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,320
Where is it?

64
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,620
Oh fuck.

65
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,020
Hell, Sailor Moon. Sorry.

66
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,960
Sorry, damn. You must be completely destroyed everywhere.

67
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,550
But what the hell should I do now?

68
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45.560
Okay, now I'll help you here.

69
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,880
Okay, there is no danger. No problem. No danger.

70
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,760
Huh?

71
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,020
Myspace?

72
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,280
Huh?

73
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,510
No, but what? Is there another cat?

74
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,800
Are you Sailor Moon? Who is it over there then?

75
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,500
Oh my God.

76
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,940
Okay?

77
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,220
Excuse me but .. I will .. no but ..

78
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,480
No but..

79

No, then you. Take it easy. Take it easy.

80
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,340
Excuse me, but who are you?

81
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07.560
Where did you come from?

82
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,920
Hörredu, can't you just help me remember a little?

83
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02.440
It feels like everyone else knows a lot of things about me and I kind of are the only one who knows nothing.

84
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,540
Why are you so kind to me? Huh?

85
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,860
I can be just what the hell inside this ...

86
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,540
I may not be like this at all ...

87
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,420
Blue...

88
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:10,440
The bear sleeps, the bear sleeps, in his calm nest.

But you can, however,, but you can never believe him.

92
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:46,660
He is not dangerous, only one is serious

93
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:54,760
But you can, however,, but you can never believe him.

94
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,030
Come all children. Now it's play.

95
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:07,400
But you can, however,, but you can never believe him.

96
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,270
You are not welcome here.

97
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,480
No!

98
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,740
Help!

99
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:49,860
"I am so happy I have a friend. His name is Otto and will then"

100
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,720
"I love life, it's me in love"

101
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:09,900
Blue Dabadi Dabad. Blue Dabadi Dabad. Haha Blue Dabadi-Dabada ...

105
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,940
Listen, stop putting off with this. I'm not a fucking stuffed animal.

You, you will never believe this.

111
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,560
I drive around looking for you.

112
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,660
And so damn suddenly I get to see the Negro fucking kid running around in the woods. HA!

113
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,580
The damn rat must have been infected from the party.

114
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,860
Damn lucky that I found her huh!

115
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,380
Wait, you I'm just going to buy some cig. Then we pull back.

116
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,620
Add the hell fucking rat. Come!
