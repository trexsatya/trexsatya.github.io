1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:03,910
Move them around,
move them around, move them around.

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,948
Hot dog-flavored chips.

3
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:24,200
Hey, hey!

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,400
In our previous video, we asked you guys
what videos you want to see.

5
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:32,000
We got a lot of different requests.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,836
- Kung Fu!
- Kung Fu? Yes, maybe.

7
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,546
Oh.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,691
Ouch, ouch... Hey, you!

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,960
Many of you want to see challenges.

10
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:51,320
- Challenges.
- Yes!

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,480
We have done "Gummy vs. Real Food" before.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,363
But we have noticed that there are so many exciting chips flavors
here in Portugal, so today we are going to do...

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,420
Kung Fu!

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,760
No, not again.

15
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:11,846
We are going to do Chips vs. Real Food!

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
- Are you excited?
- Yes!

17
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,720
- Shall we begin?
- YES! 

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,779
- Okay!
- YES!

19
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,877
Ketchup-flavored chips...

20
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:25,440
...or ketchup.

21
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,320
Here you go.

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,920
- Harry, shall we move them around?
- Okay, one time.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,380
Move them around,
move them around, move them around...

24
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,996
Okay, ready?
1, 2, 3.

25
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,001
Ketchup?

26
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:04,988
Ketchup chips?

27
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:11,254
Yes. It's ketchup-flavored chips,
or ketchup.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,787
Okay!

29
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:23,274
- Do they taste like ketchup?
- A little. Maybe you should dip them in ketchup?

30
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:26,529
That made them taste a little better.

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,000
- Can I try?
- Mm.

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,831
They're delicious!

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,692
Don't take from someone else's plate.

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,072
- Okay, next one.
- Yes, next one.

35
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:50,461
Parma ham-flavored chips,
or parma ham.

36
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,435
- Bon appÃ©tit.
- I don't want to move them around.

37
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:14,316
- No, Harry.
- I don't want that either. 1, 2, 3!

38
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:19,720
- Ham?
- Ham chips? What the...

39
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:22,591
I mean...

40
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,029
Oh my God.

41
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,466
Try it.

42
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,590
Next chips.

43
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,720
Was the ham good?

44
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,461
No. Yuck.

45
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:51,640
This wasn't really a hit, was it?

46
00:03:51,960 --> 00:04:00,138
But guys, another thing. A challenge has to have a winner,
and I don't really know how we should rate this.

47
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:06,648
We could go with whoever gets the most snacks wins.
Or we could let the viewers decide.

48
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:10,200
- Yes. What do you think?
- Most snacks.

49
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,717
- But then you'll win!
- How do you know that? We have many left.

50
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,001
Yes, we actually do. We have many left.

51
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,387
If you have any ideas,
please comment them down below.

52
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,455
Or if you think that someone won,
you could leave a comment.

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,754
Comment down below!

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,888
But you have to wait to comment
until you've seen everything.

55
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,121
- Yes.
- Yes.

56
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,421
- Jinx.
- Jinx.

57
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:46,521
- Jinx.
- Jinx.

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,573
- Jinx!
- Jinx!

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,442
Paprika-flavored chips,
or bell pepper.

60
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:11,160
And since there's some red paprika powder in the picture here,
we'll put some paprika powder on the bell pepper.

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Here you go.

62
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,176
- No, Harry, don't peek.
- No, I'm smelling it.

63
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,158
- I want to switch.
- I don't want to switch.

64
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:33,619
- Okay.
- 1, 2, 3.

65
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,120
I knew it.

66
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,229
- Bell pepper?
- With something on it.

67
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:51,115
- What's that?
- Something. Yuck. What is this? A bell pepper with something on it.

68
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,560
Try it.

69
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:58,718
1, 2, 3.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,302
They're all right.

71
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:16,659
- Try mine.
- Okay.

72
00:06:21,144 --> 00:06:23,144
Ouch!

73
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:30,600
Eww, how gross! Can I have water?
Mommy, can I have water?

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,514
I also hate bell peppers.

75
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:42,793
Pizza double pepperoni-flavored chips,
or pizza double pepperoni.

76
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,800
Oops! Here you go.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,880
Thank you.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,070
- I don't want to switch. This smells like something good.
- Move them around, move them around...

79
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:02,800
- Stop smelling it!
- I don't remember what it smells like.

80
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:06,617
- Shall we move them around?
- No!

81
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,600
- Move them around, move them around...
- No.

82
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,831
Okay, then.

83
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:15,706
1, 2, 3.

84
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:23,284
- Pizza!
- Pizza! Wait, so this has to be pizza chips.

85
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,400
- Pizza, pizza, pizza...
- Okay, shall we eat?

86
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,320
- Yes.
- 1, 2, 3.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,200
They were pretty good,
but they don't taste like pizza.

88
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,577
Corn-flavored chips, or corn.

89
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:06,730
- That pizza is probably my new favorite pizza.
- It's called pepperoni pizza.

90
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,809
Tasty as heck.

91
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,400
Double pepperoni pizza.
This, however, is something else.

92
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,600
1, 2, 3!

93
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,320
- What's this?
- Corn chips.

94
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,482
Corn! Corn! Corn!

95
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:32,040
They're so good!
They taste like little corn!

96
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,051
No. Okay, then.

97
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:42,567
- Do you like corn?
- They taste like little corn. I love corn.

98
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,218
These chips are so cute.
They're my new favorite chips.

99
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,880
- Good! So they're good?
- Mm.

100
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,695
Nice. Have you been keeping track of
who has gotten the most chips?

101
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,880
- Me! Me! Me!
- You?

102
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,080
I think it's Harry.

103
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,123
Now that we are halfway through our challenge,
I thought we would answer a Question of the Day.

104
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,971
Yes!

105
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:18,155
Where do you two want to live when you are old?
Well, not old. When you grow up.

106
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,860
Tokyo in Japan. In a high-rise.

107
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:27,491
Oh. Then we all have to move to Tokyo.

108
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,400
- Or only Harry.
- Mm.

109
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:38,040
I think I would rather...
Well, I'd like to live... everywhere. For different periods of time.

110
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,080
I don't want a permanent place of residence.
I want to be able to, like...

111
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,755
You guys get what I mean.

112
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,949
- You want to be able to travel and discover the world.
- Yes!

113
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,388
Okay. Next round?

114
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,581
- Yes!
- Okay.

115
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
But...

116
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:03,418
But, hello...

117
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,950
- What are you doing?
- I did that too.

118
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:17,145
Hot dog-flavored chips, or...
a hot dog.

119
00:10:19,597 --> 00:10:23,600
Move them around,
move them around, move them around.

120
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,211
Move them around,
move them around, move them around.

121
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:33,160
There.

122
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:42,960
Move them around,
move them around, move them around...

123
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:47,253
Okay. 1, 2, 3!

124
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:55,159
Hot dog.

125
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:00,280
Hot dog-chips. Okay.

126
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,031
They're really good! 

127
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:09,648
Cold hot dog.

128
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:17,840
Yes, unfortunately, the hot dog has gotten cold.
Hope that's okay.

129
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:26,430
It only has mustard on it, and that's because
the hot dog on the chips bag only had mustard on it.

130
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,547
These were really good!

131
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,400
I would definitely buy these chips.

132
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:46,718
Sour cream and black pepper-flavored chips,
or sour Cream with black pepper.

133
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,075
There we go.

134
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,720
No, you have to headbutt.

135
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,541
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

136
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:10,572
Yes, we are ready.

137
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Here you go.

138
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:22,263
Move them around,
move them around, move them around...

139
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:26,370
Okay. 1, 2, 3!

140
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,785
What flew off?

141
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:36,496
Oh... I accidentally...

142
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,400
- I mean... What is that?
- I don't know.

143
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:49,196
- Like, sour cream and something.
- Sour cream and pepper, I think.

144
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,823
Not that bad, actually.

145
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,673
Try it.

146
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,680
Mmm.

147
00:13:08,967 --> 00:13:10,272
Eww.

148
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,536
- I wouldn't buy any of this. Never in my life.
- I'd buy that and that. I think both were really good.

149
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:19,960
- For real?
- Mm.

150
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,840
Okay. Next chip flavor.

151
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,794
Large cheese puffs,
or a large cheese.

152
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:46,509
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

153
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,867
1, 2, 3.

154
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,880
Cheese! Cheese!

155
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,960
Mommy... you know that
Alma is crazy about cheese.

156
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,096
I like these, anyway.

157
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:14,927
- Aren't these two very classic? These with cheese, and that.
- Yes. Are they boring?

158
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,973
They're really good.

159
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,170
- Can I try?
- Mm.

160
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:26,257
- It tastes like regular cheese puffs.
- I'll try this.

161
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,195
Dang, what a big bite.

162
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:42,190
I'm going to get a cramp in my teeth.

163
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,430
I have to spit it out!

164
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,351
No, just kidding.

165
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,489
- Now you have almost had dinner, it seems.
- Yes.

166
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,400
It looks like you guys are starting to get full.
Those bites certainly weren't small.

167
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,000
Now it's only one chip flavor left.

168
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,200
- Shall we go for it?
- Yes. Moment of truth.

169
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:24,316
Moment of truth...
That sounds like a Thor movie. Really cool.

170
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:35,587
Red chili-flavored chips,
or red chili.

171
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:53,040
I thought you guys got like this when we try candy,
but it seems to be the challenge itself.

172
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:03,945
Move them around,
move them around, move them around...

173
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,630
1, 2, 3!

174
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:13,000
No! No! I mean...

175
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,720
I refuse this.

176
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:18,880
- What? That's fine, no?
- I've tried these, they're so spicy.

177
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,295
- You can do it!
- Sure. Let's do it together.

178
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,369
- Here.
- Okay.

179
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,157
- 1, 2...
- What about Harry? Here.

180
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,280
- No, I eat my own thing.
- He has chips.

181
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,952
1, 2, 3.

182
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,741
- How are your chips?
- They're all right.

183
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,720
Isn't it spicy?

184
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:08,160
No. I think I'll try one. It's probably going to burn
the tongue. Have you tried chili before?

185
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,060
Mm.

186
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,532
- Does it hurt?
- No.

187
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,844
- Is it warm?
- No, it's fine.

188
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:27,737
- What's up, Harry?
- I ate one.

189
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,382
Whoa.

190
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:41,594
I will never do that again!
That was awful!

191
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:50,765
That was very spicy.
I think I lost count of who got the most chips.

192
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,982
- My breath is still warm.
- Yes. It almost makes your eyelashes curl like little roller blinds.

193
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,400
I think I have won because I ate this thing,
and I put on the biggest show today.

194
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,302
Oh, really? I think the viewers should get to decide who won.
What do you think, Harry?

195
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:15,001
Same. The viewers.

196
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,938
This spicy ending kind of took it out of us.

197
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,568
Shall we...
Hey, I don't want any more!

198
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,041
- Shall we say thank you for today?
- Yes!

199
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:34,200
Thank you for watching this video!

200
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,000
Bye-bye!

201
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,720
Oh my God...
Okay. Bye-bye!

202
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,925
BYE-BYE!
