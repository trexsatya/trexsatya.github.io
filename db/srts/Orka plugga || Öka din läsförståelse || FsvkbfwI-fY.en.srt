00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,000
<i>An information text is full of facts.</i>

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,080
<i>It can be difficult</i>				
				<i>to remember everything in a text.</i>

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,600
<i>But there are strategies</i>				
				<i>that can help you-</i>

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,920
<i>-and that also make the book</i>				
				<i>more interesting.</i>

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,320
<i>Your first step is to decode the book:</i>				
				<i>to get an idea of its contents-</i>

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,040
<i>-before you start reading it.</i>				
				<i>This is how:</i>

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,480
<i>Look at the cover. What does it say?</i>				
				<i>Read the text on the back of the book.</i>

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,080
<i>Check the table of contents.</i>				
				<i>What's the book about?</i>

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,560
<i>Browse through it. Look at the pictures</i>				
				<i>and the infoboxes. Read the captions.</i>

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,000
<i>Look for summaries</i>				
				<i>and words in bold or italic print.</i>

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,480
<i>Decoding a book is giving yourself</i>				
				<i>a pre-understanding of the subject-</i>

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,360
<i>-and acquainting yourself</i>				
				<i>with the subject.</i>

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,280
<i>So, when you start reading the text,</i>				
				<i>you know a bit about the contents-</i>

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,440
<i>-which helps the learning process.</i>

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,360
<i>Besides browsing through the book, you</i>				
				<i>can read newspapers and magazines-</i>

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,600
<i>-watch films and YouTube clips</i>				
				<i>and search the Internet for more info.</i>

17
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,840
<i>Thanks to your pre-knowledge-</i>

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,480
<i>-your new knowledge</i>				
				<i>will be both deeper and greater.</i>
