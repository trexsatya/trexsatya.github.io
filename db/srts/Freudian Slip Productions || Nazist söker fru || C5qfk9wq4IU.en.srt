00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
"Nazi Wants A Wife"

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,680
During this season, we'll be following the nazi Johan

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,020
I begin this adventure by heading to him in Stockholm

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,780
The dream would be to find someone with whom I can share my hatred

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,380
Hello Johan!

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,080
Hi

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,560
What have you been up to recently?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,080
Resisting

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,720
Yeah? I've brought three letters for you

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,640
I don't really have any specific requirements

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,800
As long as she's an Aryan, submissive, Holocaust-denying girl-

12
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,315
that takes care of the household

13
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:37,885
She seems like a good choice, right?

14
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:40,845
NOTE: "The image got way darker when I scanned it"

15
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:42,115
Well, I sure hope so...

16
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:46,415
She has not been charged with hate speech

17
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:48,675
Smells a bit PC, doesn't it?

18
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:50,345
You think so?

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,100
It's difficult; you don't want to get too madly in love-

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,800
and lose focus on the fight against the traitors and the Jewish conspiracy

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,400
What do you think about her?

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,800
Tall, a beautiful, wide skull

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm interested

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,940
I'm looking for someone with whom I can develop my nazism

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,640
"Mein Kampf" is to meet you. Hell Lisbet

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,780
She may actually be the one

27
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,540
Is that true? -*Nods*

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,280
Exciting! -Yeah

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,560
I'm pleased with the girls I selected

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,120
I rate them 8/8

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,300
It's time for a speed-date, and the girls have arrived in Stockholm

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,640
I truly hope I'll be able to show Johan how nazi-like I can be

33
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,700
Hi

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,820
Thank you. -You're welcome

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,000
I appreciate the gift. Adde was given a similar one by Eve

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,860
You wrote a good letter

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,900
But you didn't attach a family tree.

38
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,340
Oh...I'm sorry

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,200
And you wrote that you're not a nazi, but is interested in it?

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,380
Yes, I got extremely inspired when I heard you talking about the persecution of homosexuals

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,740
And the cleansing of racial strangers and people with opposing views

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,720
She's probably got a little bit of nazism in her, that girl.

43
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,080
So, would you be prepared to move into my place and start doing some nazi shenanigans?

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,720
Yeah, I think that'd suit me

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,280
Johan makes me feel like I'm in the Third Reich

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,500
I want to see Johan because he seems agressive and hostile

47
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,860
And I hope I'll be getting the chance of passing on his violent genes

48
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,360
So, do you think this body will be able to birth four children?

49
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,620
Yes, I think so

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,400
That'll be needed in the fight for the survival of our race

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,860
Absolutely!

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,180
Are your period cycles normal?

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,760
It was kind of awkward in the beginning. You don't want to be too pushy

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,280
You want to give them some Lebensraum

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,460
But have you been in many relationships before?

56
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,280
What is this? The Nürnberg Trials?

57
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
*Mutual Laughter*

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,840
Then sparks started to fly. For sure

59
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,820
I think time's up now.

60
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,940
Nooooooo, I want to continue talking

61
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,500
We'll have to do that later

62
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,300
Ja, Mein Fürher ;)

63
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,665
There was truly a flirty atmosphere

64
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,340
And we were arguing a little too

65
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,900
He thinks that we should deport every adopted child-

66
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,940
while I'm of the opinion that it depends on a case-to-case basis

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,220
So that spices up our relationship a bit

68
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,440
But, like, I strongly like that he's more filled with hatred in real life

69
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,520
Yeah, right?

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,640
And those Aryan arms, man I just want to squeeze those!

71
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Eh, yes please!

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,740
In next week's episode: Sara's sad because Johan brings Lisbet to the Goebbels festival

73
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,820
And Johan and Lisbet fight for the first time

74
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,360
We were going to have a cozy evening and see the first half of Schindler's List!

75
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,120
Do you think bombings plan themselves?
