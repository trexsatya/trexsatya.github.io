1
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:09,843
We drive to Kolmården.

2
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:14,767
It's a zoo.

3
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,186
Come along!

4
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:33,351
Are you tagged?

5
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:44,276
Kolmården is the largest zoo in the Nordic region.

6
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,338
Now the adventure begins!

7
00:01:14,597 --> 00:01:17,102
Here are elephants.

8
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:23,077
I think this elephant is pregnant.

9
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:27,341
She has a big stomach.

10
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:40,643
At Kolmården there are many animals.

11
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:45,276
There are many animal species.

12
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:53,061
How many animal species are there at Kolmården?

13
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:58,460
Search for their website and write in comments!

14
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:53,759
At Kolmården there are many aquatic animals.

15
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,965
There are dolphins too.

16
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:09,218
Excuse me, may I ask you one thing?
 Where is the exit?

17
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,926
The output is over there!

18
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:17,024
Then we go there!

19
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:38,012
There is a playground at Kolmården, a large playground.

20
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:56,836
"Thanks for keeping your distance!"

21
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:04,216
There are hand spirit stations everywhere so you can spread your hands.

22
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:16,622
There are many rides for children and adults.

23
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:44,592
You can look at theater.

24
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:52,608
At Kolmården there are rides for brave adults and brave children.

25
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,027
I'm not brave, I dare not go this attraction.

26
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:04,335
We look at the map.

27
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:13,841
Another favorite is safari.

28
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:22,401
First, we disinfect our hands.

29
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:27,789
Then you have to stand in a very long queue.

30
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:40,564
We sit in a gondola.

31
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,196
The cable car is very long.

32
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:56,159
You sit in the gondola, look out ...

33
00:06:56,291 --> 00:07:02,010
You look at all animals and rest.

34
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:07,291
It takes about half an hour to ride the cable car.

35
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:16,487
Here we are the guests of the wild animals.

36
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,557
There are many different animals.

37
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,628
So exciting!

38
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:38,581
Have you ever been to Kolmården?

39
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:42,000
Or do you want to go there?
