1
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.120
Leif?

2
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.880
Leif!

3
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.320
Hi, Irja.
 Nice ... oh, take it easy.

4
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.440
You are so handsome, so beautiful!
 And so sexy ...

5
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.480
Yes it's me.
 I mean, you are also beautiful.

6
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.280
- Wear, to the lady.
 -What rare!
 Thanks, Leif.

7
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.200
Is this your brother?

8
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.840
- Hi, my name is Billy.
 -Hello.
 Irja.

9
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.480
Yes, now we go home in the vehicle, and then I'll show you the house.

10
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.240
Come now, Irja.

11
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.400
Yes, yes ...

12
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.640
Here in the kitchen we eat a lot of good food with our friends.

13
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.720
What a beautiful house!
 I love it.

14
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.360
-Do you like it?
 - Yes, and the furniture is so beautiful.

15
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.600
I have built a lot myself.

16
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.240
You have to be tired after such a long day.
 I think you will like the next room.

17
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.320
-Oh really?
 - Yes, you ... yes.

18
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.720
-This way.
 -Is this?

19
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.080
VoilÃ !
 Here's your bed.

20
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.280
-It is so pretty!
 - Yes, it's bedded to you.

21
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.680
- Where are you going to sleep?
 -On the sofa.

22
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.120
So you get the room for yourself.
 I'm a bit of a gentleman.

23
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.280
No no!
 I want you to sleep with me.

24
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.080
Oh really...?
 Okay.

25
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.480
I want you with me in bed.

26
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.200
Yes, but ... oh, shit ...

27
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.200
I have to shit ... no, brush my teeth.

28
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.040
- Did you have to brush your teeth?
 - Put yourself, I'll be coming soon.

29
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.200
-Are you coming back?
 -Yes...

30
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.840
Do you want children?
 Do you want that?

31
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.760
Then we start.
 God damnit!

32
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.120
- Hi, Baby ... - Hi ... Raring.

33
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.040
Time to go to bed?

34
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.880
No, I'm just joking.

35
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.960
Good night, Irja.
 Nice to have you here.

36
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.240
I would really like to do it with you, Leif.

37
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.960
- But I have menstruation.
 - Yeah?
 Okay.

38
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.960
No problem.

39
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.920
We don't have to.
 It is quiet.

40
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.440
But tomorrow it is over.

41
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.640
And then it's just you and me.

42
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.720
- The night long.
 -Okay...

43
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.200
Good night, Leif.

44
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.280
- Good morning, Billy.
 - Hi, Irja.
 Do you bleed?
 Where are you bleeding?

45
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:31.200
- If you bleed a lot, I have patches ... - but stop, for damn!

46
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.240
- What did he talk about, baby?
 - He has a child's brain.

47
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.600
But the body is big, so ... he's crazy.

48
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.360
It is quiet.
 You can sit down.

49
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.400
-Thanks.
 -No problems.

50
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.680
- Okay ... there will be no picnic today.
 -Are you sure?

51
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.080
- Go into the house, you are kind.
 -Okay.

52
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.640
Why are you so tense, baby?

53
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.840
It's nothing, I'm fine.

54
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.640
Maybe I can help ...?

55
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.920
Yes, now we are alone again.

56
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.560
Wait.

57
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.360
- Have you been a naughty boy, Leif?
 - Yes, I've been a little naughty and crazy.

58
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.240
A tuffing that you like hard hold?

59
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.320
Yes a little...

60
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.680
You really like hard time, I feel.

61
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.960
- Have you been a little naughty?
 -Yes some...

62
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.640
- Have you been a little disobedient?
 -Yes...

63
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.800
Death!
 Fuck off!

64
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:29.280
Come on, I need ammunition.
 Yes good!
 Bomb that bastard!
