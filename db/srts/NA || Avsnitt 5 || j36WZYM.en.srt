Jackson's Five's sixth member, Filip Dikmen.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.840
Last but not least, program manager - guru, the gold boy with the dreadlock:

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.440
Ahmed Berhan!

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.880
You look at IFS that made the whole country dance Dabke and eat pipas.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.880
My name is Ahmed Berhan and I am your host.

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.440
Here are our competitors:

15
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.040
She is from blue, but rips pink, no less than Therese!

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.600
She loves cooking and food traditions and rips green.
 Lovisa!

17
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.880
Fire for fire, our firefighter today.
 Orange Pulpet: Lucas!

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.440
We start the competition.

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.040
You choose a panelist and decide whether the panelist is lying or not.

20
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.400
We start with you, Lovisa.
 You are plugging into a nurse in psychiatry.

21
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.760
Which of your future patients do you want to start with?

22
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.000
I feel that Zeina should speak the truth, otherwise so ...

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.520
I bought all her books.

24
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.760
-Zeina, welcome back.
 -Thanks.

25
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.680
This Greek ... one had used his picture -

26
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.880
- And put it on a pack of Turkish yogurt.

27
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.200
Greeks and Turks are sensitive.
 He was told and sued the company.

28
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.520
It feels like I've read this.
 I think you speak the truth.

29
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.240
You trust Zeina?
 Congratulations!
 You've received your first point.

30
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.640
That's right.
 The yogurt tour was not Turk, but Greek.

31
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.280
But he is the yogurt tour.

32
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.960
The man sued the dairy company of SEK 50 million in Athens District Court -

33
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.040
- And finally got two million.

34
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.160
He found out that a friend who lived in Sweden had traded -

35
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.320
–And suddenly: "It's stavros!"

36
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.920
Lucas, your turn to drive.

37
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.400
Before we take the question.
 You work both as a firefighter and a photo model.

38
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.520
How much do you earn on Onlyfans?

39
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.640
It depends on whether we have the hose outside or inside.

40
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.160
-Bravo!
 --Fire for fire.

41
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.160
It feels like he didn't attend Paradise Hotel.
 He just: "Ifs!"

42
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.280
Awesome, Lucas.
 Your turn to drive.
 Who do you choose?

43
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.320
The debutant: Flakrim.

44
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.440
Kumla.

45
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.480
Just kidding.

46
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.040
It is the municipality of all classical place music:

47
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.840
It is actually Botkyrka that has the highest proportion.

48
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.240
I trust you.
 You must not lie directly.

49
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.640
- You trust too much on Albaner.
 - You are the first one I trust.

50
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.160
-Oh!
 - So the last.
 No problem.

51
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.360
But Lucas, do you know what?
 You've received a point.
 Congratulations!

52
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.600
True.
 Botkyrka south of Stockholm has the highest proportion of foreign -born-

53
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.920
- With 43.3 percent.

54
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.440
Therese, you are from Kista.
 You are used to being surrounded by black shells.

55
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.640
- What of the panelists are you chewing with?
 - Filip.

56
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.360
I feel he can check away ...

57
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.400
Filip did a DNA test and found out he was a 23 % Nigerian.

58
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.480
He came back with Afro.

59
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.080
- You know I came here normally.
 - What is it too abnormal with Afro?

60
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.520
We put it aside.
 I came up with the attitude to fix myself nicely.

61
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.840
But when I heard Mike's Swedish I got a shock and my hair got up.

62
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.040
Your Swedish is worse this year than last year.
 How fuck is it possible?!

63
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.120
It goes back every year.
 Do you understand?

64
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.160
Filip?
 My question to you:

65
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.280
The list does not want to come out in public.

66
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.360
BSBS, the blators that built Sweden, is a hip-hop collective from Skåne-

67
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.360
-Popular in the 90s.
 Timbuktu was one of the members.
 He went solo then.

68
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.440
Beyonced up in his bitches.
 "Single Ladies, Single Ladies!"

69
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.280
Timbuktu?
 No!
 It's false.

70
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.840
She refuses to believe that Timbuktu hung with other black shells.

71
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.800
- "Not my Jason."
 -Just.
 - It's false, Filip.

72
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.920
Congratulations, Therese.
 You have also received a point.

73
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.960
The blators who built Sweden are a TV4 documentary by Leif GW Persson-

74
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.400
- In labor immigration after the Second World War.

75
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.440
First round.
 Everyone combed home one point.
 Great!

76
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.760
- Lovisa, take it further.
 –Evelyn.

77
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.480
Thanks.

78
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.520
–Evelyn?
 -Yes.
 Hello!

79
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.280
My sexual preference.

80
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.760
No, this is Bengali Marriage Fishes.

81
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.280
Wedding fish.
 It is a Bengali tradition-

82
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.600
- Dressing up two fish like the bridal couple.

83
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.880
How to give them to the bridal couple.

84
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.520
You said you liked cooking and cooking traditions.

85
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.440
But this was a little premium.
 I think that's true.

86
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.600
- You trust Evelyn?
 -Yes.

87
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.280
You think the fishermen are part of a Bengali wedding tradition.

88
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.000
-Congratulations!
 You've got one more point.
 -Thanks.

89
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.080
It's true.
 The fishermen symbolize luck, happiness and success.

90
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.320
Lucas, who are you trying to?

91
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.000
Evelyn was taken now, so Elaf.
 I had my favorites.

92
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.560
- We were the second choice?
 Thanks.
 –As it should be.

93
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.680
ELAF?

94
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.720
Within cat policema.

95
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.680
- Customize her.
 -Oh my God.

96
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.040
-Go!
 Give The Fuck Off the Stage.
 -Elaf, Elaf!

97
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.360
The correct answer is in Islam.

98
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.920
It is said that Prophet Muhammad had a cat.

99
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.960
Muslims like cats lick a lot, lick themselves pure -

100
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.280
- So they even have to hang out in the mosque.

101
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.560
It feels like a long shot, that, that is.

102
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.040
It doesn't feel like a good start to our relationship, that you lie to me.

103
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.960
He treats this as Paradise Hotel.

104
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.480
It's okay, it's okay.

105
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.560
-Stir the pot.
 - I posted it.

106
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.720
- Lucas, you think Elaf is lying?
 -Yes unfortunately.

107
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.880
-You are wrong.
 –Wa?
 Is it true?

108
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:32.120
What Elaf said is true.
 The cat is considered ritually clean, welcomed in the home -

109
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.120
- And even in the mosque.
 Who could believe that Muslims were cat people?

110
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.480
We all learn something.
 Let's move on.

111
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.040
--Therese?
 -Yes!
 - Kenxo, do we drive?

112
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.560
In recent years, the American hose "Down Low" has found its way into the resort.

113
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.360
That's when you're in the wardrobe.

114
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.240
There is someone who is hiding, a little hide and seek, you are wanted -

115
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.480
- Have a low profile, you are down low.

116
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.960
Laugh, then.

117
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.720
No.

118
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.320
- Have you heard of the expression?
 -No.

119
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.560
Admittedly, many may be hiding in both the closet and the police -

120
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.440
- But ... no, it's false.

121
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.000
You don't think anyone is wanted?
 It's false.

122
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.600
You think Kenxo is lying.

123
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.400
You really are from the resort.
 You are absolutely right.
 Congratulations!

124
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.560
Another point to Therese.
 But he still gave you a little hint.

125
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.760
"DL" is that you are in the wardrobe.
 You are gay, but have not come out.

126
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.840
The whole of Södertälje, that is.
 Been there, done that.

127
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.680
!
 We have 2–2–1.
 - Lovisa, should we see if you manage to get a full pot?

128
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.920
-Yes.
 - What do you put your card on?

129
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.680
- Megic Mike I drive.
 -Ooh!

130
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.240
Megic Mike, thanks for making TV history-

131
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.200
- As the first brother in SVT who has Durag on.
 Heavy you are.

132
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.200
Mike!

133
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.080
He distributed genital herpes.

134
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.520
He wanted to cut -

135
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.480
–And got a recommendation from a Swedish music producer -

136
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.880
- Cutting at Salong Shadow Mikael in Rinkeby.

137
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.000
- Are you a UsherFans, Lovisa?
 - I have never listened to him.

138
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.160
- you?!
 --Wow!

139
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.360
Gasps in black skull.

140
00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.080
- Do you never have ...?
 -Don't you be here in the 21st century?

141
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.920
But I ... I don't know.
 I'm a little too Swedish maybe.

142
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.600
Lovisa, what do you think?

143
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.880
Was Usher in Rinkeby/Tensta to fix a fade at Shadow Mikael?

144
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.800
–EVER ... no.
 I think he is lying.
 - You think he is lying?

145
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.040
Sometimes Ignorance is a bliss.
 Congratulations, you've got one more point.

146
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.760
Usher had been at a conference and wanted to form his own perception -

147
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.560
-If the No Go zones Rinkeby and Tensta.

148
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.240
Lovisa managed because she did not know about Usher Fade or Shadow Mikael.

149
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:45.400
- And that Mike sat like this.
 - She cheated, bre.

150
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.680
- We move on to Lucas.
 --Assia.

151
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.840
A classic Roman coffee is ... Take a cinnamon bun, on the fallow sausage -

152
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.120
- On it you place tomato and then you put raw yellow onion over.

153
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:13.400
When you want home cooking and coffee at the same time.
 I hadn't done that.

154
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.200
-You're lying.
 -Okay.

155
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.000
Take two sides from a cookbook and just merge?

156
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.360
Unfortunately, Lucas.
 No points for you, because it was true.

157
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:34.160
–Tu-you-you-you-you-is that true?
 How?!

158
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.160
It's true.
 Cinnamon bun, raw fallow sausage, tomato slab and raw onion -

159
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.480
- Is a Roman specialty and shows up in Zeina's next book.

160
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:52.720
He Lucas talks too low.
 - You are a firefighter.
 Raise your voice.

161
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.440
You talk unclearly, can you talk more clearly?

162
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.720
Megic Mike thinks it is the firefighters who scream, "It is burning! Help!"

163
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.000
Let's move on.
 Lovisa has received three questions.
 You have three points.

164
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.680
Lucas, you only got one point.
 Unfortunately, you will not go to the next round.

165
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.000
Even better!
 Oaah!

166
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.960
Therese, you still have a question left.

167
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.280
But, as you notice, all panelists are consumed.

168
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:40.320
Therefore, your last panelist will be randomly selected.

169
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.880
- Feel illuminated.
 - Is the spotlight wanted?

170
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.920
Yasin village and Jaffar village are two Swedish rappers.

171
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.800
Both love the kids in Bullerbyn.

172
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.520
No, you joke aside ...

173
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.080
Megic, Yalla.

174
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:32.160
No, actually ... it's a common surname in Somalia.

175
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.520
Very common.
 Like Svensson and things like that.
 Stuck in Somalia.

176
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.280
I'm finished.

177
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:50.160
Yes, you ... well.
 I'm sorry, I like you, but it's false.

178
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.400
-Do you think?
 -Yes.

179
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.920
You don't think the village is a common name in Somalia?

180
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.680
You do that right in. Congratulations, Therese!

181
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.320
You got one more point.
 False.

182
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.960
They have the village in the artist names because they come from Rinkeby, called the village.

183
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.600
They are also included in the collective village block.

184
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.640
Therese and Lovisa, you have moved on to the final round.
 Congratulations!

185
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:30.880
Now it's time for the final round.
 It's about coming first to five.

186
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.000
The difference is that if you answer the wrong, the point goes to the opponent.

187
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.760
- We start with you, Therese.
 - Whoho!
 Assia.

188
00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.600
Assia.

189
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.520
To mecca it is ...

190
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.400
When we Muslims see someone as Ken, we have to turn to Mecca directly.

191
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.600
Yes, I'm gay!

192
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:06.600
I notice that Assia wants to get rid of her job at P3.

193
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.800
Of course, it is ... In old hose you think "Mecca with the car".

194
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.920
But it has been given a new purpose.
 In newer hose and out in the resort -

195
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.480
- You use it to say that someone does religious things, like praying.

196
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.760
For example: "Where is Ahmed?"
 - "He's out and mecca."

197
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.800
It must be slang for something else.
 I think it's false, Assia.

198
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.760
I'm getting curious.
 What would it be like?

199
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.960
- Maybe something that you should not do.
 - The man, she has lived!

200
00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.000
Therese moved to Kista for a reason.

201
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.640
You know what?
 Thanks to your experience, you have received a point!

202
00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.840
Of course, it is Assia so false.
 To mecca means to roll a goose.

203
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.960
- What is a goose?
 What is a goose?
 --Äzi.

204
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.720
You have not clarified that it is grass -related.

205
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.640
- You answered hose with hose.
 - Welcome to Ifs, brother.

206
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.480
Filip is right.
 It's about rolling a marijuana cigarette.

207
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.200
Public Service, Ladies and Gentlemen.
 - Lovisa, your turn.

208
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.760
- What do you choose?
 - Flake.

209
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.840
Flakrim, image question.

210
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:45.320
These are the Iranians who root your mom on subscriptions.

211
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.360
"It's just going into Bank ID ..."

212
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:54.720
No.
 There are two well -known spy brothers.
 They are known as Alan and Nami.

213
00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:01.720
They spied on the Russian state and worked for the Swedish police and Säpo.

214
00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.680
- Loova?
 - I trust him.

215
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.720
- I think it's true.
 - It's the spy brothers you read about?

216
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.680
Wrong.
 The Iranians we are looking at are Alan Mamedi and Nami Zarringhalam.

217
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.880
The founders of the app TrueCaller.
 They are on Sweden's list of new billionaires.

218
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.480
As a result, Therese has received one more point.

219
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.520
Congratulations!
 Should we see if you bring home a third point?

220
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.840
- velyn, now we drive.
 -Hello.
 Okay.

221
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.600
Evelyn?

222
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.200
To protect himself from Paolo Roberto.

223
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.360
Metal Protection.

224
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.720
It's a cultural thing.
 In order to protect their shy-

225
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.120
- You have a piece of metal there to protect yourself from evil spirits.

226
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:08.400
It is common in several cultures to have metal as protection against evil.

227
00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.440
Is that how to do?

228
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.920
I recognize it with spoon, but don't remember why.

229
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:21.840
- Where do you put it?
 Front or rear?
 - Between, I think.

230
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.480
- It's a completely different program.
 - Spare it to the after -talk.

231
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.640
- What do you know about Evelyn's explanation?
 -It's true.

232
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.200
You put a spoon inside the panties to protect yourself from evil spirits.

233
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:43.400
It's not true.
 It's false.
 - Congratulations, Lovisa!
 You got a point.

234
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.040
It was a British campaign-

235
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.600
- Auditated to young women at risk of being married abroad.

236
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.960
It gave the security check a reason to take them aside and talk.

237
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.760
- Loova, who do you choose?
 - Filip.

238
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.640
Brother...

239
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.720
The plastic operated part.

240
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.480
The finest you can say in Persian is liver.
 "You're my liver."

241
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.880
Why don't you know.

242
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.000
But it may be the only part that is genuine after all plastic surgery.

243
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:30.240
"You are my liver" is the finest you can say in Persian.

244
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.320
I trust him.
 The world is weird, so I think ...

245
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.760
Why not?
 There are such strange things.

246
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:45.120
I love your honesty, Lovisa.
 Congratulations!
 You've got one more point.

247
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.080
"You are my liver" is a compliment, an expression of love in Persian.

248
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.360
To a family member, a partner or friend.

249
00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:00.680
If any other culture talks about it, then they are about to chal it.

250
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:06.000
As we see now, it says 2-2 between you.
 It's tight.
 It's najs.

251
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.920
-Oh!
 "It's najs that it's tight."
 - Watch you!
 Cew it out!

252
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.600
- This is a family program!
 - You were the one who said it.

253
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.360
There is a word in Arabic that is not in Swedish.

254
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.800
-/ Ululates/ –A'eeeb.
 A'EEB.

255
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.600
- You are pressed!
 - Can you translate A'Eeb?

256
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.720
-"Ashamed!"
 - "Shame", but still not really.

257
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.280
I have a word for it, in Swedish.

258
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.800
-/ pronounces it soft/ Aejba.
 - Man, in Swedish?

259
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.960
It's called Aejba.

260
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.640
--Therese, your turn to choose.
 -Elaf with the lovely dialect.

261
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.400
Thanks so much!

262
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.520
Balkan moms say that Promaha is the main cause of death.

263
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.480
It is actually cross drag.

264
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:13.800
Balkan people are afraid of the air that pulls between two windows -

265
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.840
- And think it can make you really sick or kill you.

266
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.320
My first thought was when the sons moved away from home.

267
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.000
-The other one.
 -Okay.
 I think that's true.

268
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.120
- Do you have great fears for crosses?
 -Yes.

269
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:38.560
Why?
 Congratulations, Therese.
 Another point.
 It's true.

270
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.600
Promaha means cross draws.
 Balkan moms want to avoid this at all costs.

271
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.800
They think it can make you seriously ill.

272
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.440
Lovisa, which of our panelists do you choose?

273
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.920
Zeina.

274
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.120
-/ Ululates/ - They have mucked the whole.

275
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.880
Zeina ... - Zeina lost so many sponsors recently.

276
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.520
She smokes Alhamdulillah Kush.

277
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.360
Ooaah!

278
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.760
Did it go well?
 Is it safe?

279
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.120
-It went well.
 -Are you okay?

280
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:34.080
-What happens?
 -Yes I am fine.
 I feel good!

281
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.840
I feel good.
 The chair is not feeling well.

282
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.600
Zeina?

283
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.440
It's a slang word.
 That's when you are away.

284
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.840
"He is Alasas. He has tagged with SAS."

285
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.480
-It's true!
 Ala-sas.
 -No.
 No.

286
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.200
You respond with the entire chest.
 You can't even whisper.

287
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.400
No, I think she is lying.

288
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.240
-In order to...?
 –Sas, so ...?
 No.

289
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:26.240
What else would it be?
 "I am Alasas. I have tagged with SAS."

290
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.240
Think Zeina on a flight!
 SAS ...

291
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.920
Random ... thus, random control every time.

292
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.960
Lovisa?
 You say what Zeina said is false.

293
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.240
You choose not to believe her?
 You did that right in.

294
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.840
You've got one more point.

295
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.880
Alasas corresponds to "as if" or "yeah, right".

296
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.920
You do not believe in what you hear, like you have traveled with SAS.

297
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.560
!
 Right now it is 3–3.

298
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.000
--Therese, are you going to pick a four?
 –Yes.
 Kenxo.

299
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.000
If a Latin American invites you to a quinceañera ...

300
00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.360
Quince is 15 in Spanish.
 Quinceañera is when you have been married for 15 years.

301
00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:26.200
It is when you gather the family at a big barbecue party.

302
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.200
It's like a wedding grill party.

303
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.880
- I think it's false.
 - You think it's false?

304
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.960
Congratulations, you've got one more point.

305
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.400
Quinceañera is definitely not that you have been married for 15 years.

306
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:50.520
You celebrate the girl's 15th birthday, the transition between childhood and adulthood.

307
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.480
Lovisa, now it's your turn.
 As you can see, it says 4–3.

308
00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.480
This means that if you answer wrong, Therese has taken home the whole thing.

309
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.000
Megic Mike may be.

310
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Listen, Lovisa!
 If you cheat, I swear, it won't go well.

311
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.280
Brother, sit down so you don't break another chair.

312
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.520
Mikey Mike!
 Your South Korean buddy will give you a move -in present ...

313
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.600
When you move into new, you get toilet paper.

314
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.880
If you have lots of friends, you get lots of toilet paper.

315
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:39.120
But if you don't have ... it will be difficult to dry the ass.

316
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.920
-What are you saying?
 Do you believe in Mike?
 -Yes I do.

317
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.160
-Why?
 - Furray country maybe.
 I guess.

318
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.480
The kindest prejudice I've heard.
 It is a clean country.

319
00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:00.280
Therefore, it is reasonable to provide toilet paper.
 You got one more point.

320
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.080
In South Korea, Jipdeuri is called the move -in party.

321
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.800
The most common gifts are toilet paper and detergents.

322
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.560
It is not considered clean to use toilet paper.

323
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:21.040
You should wash with hose or ... but that is good.

324
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.880
