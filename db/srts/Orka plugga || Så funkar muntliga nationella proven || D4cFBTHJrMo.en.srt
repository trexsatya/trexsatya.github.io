00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,400
Each fall there are oral national tests in Swedish, English and math-

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,480
-For all students in nine.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,640

00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,400
It is important to listen to the others and build on their reasoning.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,760
Then the discussion is broadened and deepened.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,400

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
In English, focus is on oral ability-

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,520
