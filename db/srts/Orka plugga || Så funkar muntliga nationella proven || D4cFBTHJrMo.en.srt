00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,480
Every autumn, 
there are oral national tests in Swedish-

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,640
-English and Maths 
for all students in Year 9.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,520
But what do these tests look like, 
and what's being assessed?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,280
In all three subjects, 
the tests are done in smaller groups-

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,280
-and one or two teachers listen in.

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,400
The aim is for you as a student 
to show your ability to discuss-

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,960
-and conduct a line of argument. 
It's important to participate actively-

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,280
-and contribute to a deeper, 
broader discussion.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
Putting your thoughts into words 
in a clear way-

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
-presenting your statements 
with well-founded arguments-

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,080
-and sticking to the subject.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,040
Also adapt your language to suit 
the subject and the rest of the group.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,480
It's equally important to listen to 
the others and build on their reasoning.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,600
This broadens 
and deepens the discussion.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,960
A tip to show you're really listening 
is to ask follow-up questions-

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,600
-and show with your body language 
that you're committed.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,040
Remember to keep the tone pleasant 
and show respect for others' opinions.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,200
It's also important to let everyone speak 
and wait your turn to talk.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,800
All of these are examples 
of what your teachers will observe-

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,080
-and consider in their assessment 
of the test.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,520
In Swedish, you'll take turns 
to lead the conversation.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,160
You start by presenting 
the discussion topic.

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,760
Then you're responsible 
for letting everyone speak-

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,120
-and finishing and summarising 
the discussion within the allocated time.

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
In English, the focus is on the ability 
to express yourself verbally-

26
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,760
-and the skill and variation 
with which you can use the language.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,640
It's important to stick to English 
and not mix in any Swedish words.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,040
You'll get cards with different topics, 
which you take turns to read out-

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,240
-and which are then discussed 
in the group.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,000
In Maths, each person 
gets to discuss certain exercises-

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,320
-and the rest can then ask questions 
or offer their own interpretations.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,560
The teacher will assess 
your problem-solving-

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,760
-and how well you use 
correct mathematical concepts.
