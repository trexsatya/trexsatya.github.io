1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,100
The only one of the ancient philosophers whose importance can be compared to Plato's disciple is Aristotle.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,540
He was the scientist whose theories were dominant for more than 2000 years.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:21,580
If you can say that Plato can say that subsequent philosophy history was only footnotes to this one,

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,720
Can we call Aristotle for the father of science.

5
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,500
He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece.

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:37,000
As a 17-year-old, he traveled to Athens to study philosophy at Plato's academy.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,340
There he came to stay for 20 years - first as a student to Plato, then as a acclaimed teacher and researcher.

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,340
After Plato's death, he came to leave the academy to start his own school - lyceum -

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,140
which over time came to be a much larger and wider than its predecessor.

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,940
In their early writings you see a clear admiration for Plato's thoughts,

11
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,900
But since then he will deviate more and more from his teachings.

12
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,040
His theories eventually came to collide with Plato's perceptions

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,860
and constitute an alternative explanation model of the world.

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,660
Where Plato's worldview is based on the abstract world of ideas,

15
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,140
describes Aristotle world without referring to other levels of reality.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,260
You could say that he moved Plato's ideas to the world of mind.

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,740
We see this clearly in Rafael's famous mural "The school in Athens" from the beginning of the 16th century.

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,400
In this painting, found in the Vatican Palace in Rome,

19
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:50,280
Rafael has collected many of the great Greek philosophers.

20
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,460
In the middle we see Plato, pointing up at the abstract world of ideas.

21
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:05,240
He is an idealist and believes that everything is basically ideas, and in order to understand the truth we must first understand the ideas.

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,120
At his side, his student, Aristotle, goes,

23
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,880
As with his hand clearly shows that he stays on earth - he is a realist.

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,780
He believes that the world we live in is the only true world.

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,260
Aristotle said that everything in the world consists of matter and form.

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:35,500
Matter is the physical structure of the thing (eg wood or iron) while the shape is its individual structure.

27
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,640
These two ingredients cannot exist without each other

28
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,100
- Matter cannot exist without form and form cannot exist without matter.

29
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,860
In all reproduction, it was the man who supplied form while the woman stands for matter.

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Each dog has a unique shape but consists of the same matter (which would be muscles, bones, blood, etc.).

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,160
Therefore, we recognize a dog as a dog, but also as a unique individual.

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,400
Therefore, no dog's idea is needed.

33
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,200
Did you want to study the dog you had in front of you would instead use your eyes

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,860
Instead of inventing an abstract dog's idea!

35
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,500
This may seem to be an obvious description of the world,

36
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,700
But the theory could not explain how change could happen.

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,520
Just change already considered the old natural philosophers to be a major problem,

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,340
Why, for example, Zenon meant that reality must be an illusion.

39
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,960
To explain this, Aristotle also introduced the concept of "potential".

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,300
Built into all matter, there was the potential to become some things.

41
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,860
In an acorns there is the potential to become an oak, however, not to become a dog.

42
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,980
When something has adopted its form, the potential has been updated.

43
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,840
The thing has now become what it can be.

44
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,660
In addition, there is an intention, one purpose, built into everything.

45
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,740
The reason why the acorn strives to become an oak is to secure the species' survival.

46
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,460
Just like his predecessor Plato was Aristotle interested in how to create

47
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,040
The perfect society - something he describes in the book Politiken.

48
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,980
Here he shows a much more pragmatic, and to some extent conservative, attitude than Plato.

49
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,540
He was positive to the Athenian democracy -

50
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,980
This despite the fact that he was not allowed to vote himself because he was not born in the city -

51
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:54,320
But defends the then prevailing view of women and slaves as lower standing.

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Democracy was a matter only for free men, he said.

53
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,620
He assumed that man was a social being,

54
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,280
A political animal that wanted to live with other people.

55
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,240
For this to work, a strict hierarchy was required;

56
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,100
At the bottom of the slave then the children, the wife and at the top man.

57
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:27,840
This was the natural order and the system would lead to good and safe life.

58
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,680
When the individual has accepted her role, she also becomes happy.

59
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,780
The state's task was to help each family, and, by extension, every individual, to reach this good life.

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,880
In the book "The Nikomachian ethics" Aristotle describes its view of ethics and morality.

61
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,480
According to Aristotle, man has a special position in nature.

62
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,420
We are not controlled by instincts but by reason and free will.

63
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,860
We also have no congenital knowledge of right and wrong, good or bad,

64
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,080
Without this, we must learn through training.

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:18,500
We become friendly by performing friendly actions, moderate by performing moderate actions, etc.

66
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:27,740
By developing and refining their virtues, its positive qualities, we will become better people.

67
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,520
Thus we will automatically act right in different situations

68
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,340
Then good documents originate from good traits.

69
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,880
There are two types of virtues - moral and intellectual.

70
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,040
A good person is also a happy person, Aristotle says.

71
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:57,820
We all strive to live as social creatures in a society, something that a virtuous person is easy for.

72
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,540
To become virtuous, we must have a balanced attitude to our emotions and desires.

73
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,240
Where this golden middle ground goes varies from person to person, but he gives some simple examples:

74
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:22,780
Courage is the balance between dumbness and cowardice, generosity is the balance between waste and greed.

75
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:32,180
The goal of happiness thus goes by learning to become a balanced personality - to be adequate.

76
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,820
As a philosopher, Aristotle was in many ways different from his predecessors.

77
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:45,620
His research was systematic and based on careful observations of the world

78
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,480
And his philosophy is mostly about what we would call science today.

79
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:58,280
Thus, there is a clear link between Aristotle and the natural philosophers.

80
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,520
Throughout his life, he immersed himself in research in a way that is unparalleled in Western history,

81
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,040
And his influence is difficult to overestimate.

82
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:17,160
His geocentric worldview, but the earth in the middle and the planets revolve around this,

83
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:25,080
was prevailing until the 16th century when Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei and Tycho Brahe

84
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,520
Could prove the heliocentric worldview - that it is the sun that is at the center.

85
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,840
This was largely due to the fact that the Catholic Church used his thoughts to construct his worldview.

86
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,400
The Bible's view of creation is also compatible with Aristotle's view

87
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,200
that everything has a built -in purpose, an intention.

88
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:58,980
To be able to conduct his science, he needed deeper insight into how correct conclusions worked.

89
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:07,020
The rules for this were not yet known, after which Aristotle created what is today known as logic.

90
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:14,960
It was not until the end of the 19th century that this logic came to be further developed into what it is today.

91
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,120
Aristotle's engaging with virtually all the sciences of the time, except for mathematics,

92
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,500
And was probably the most learned man of antiquity.

93
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:36,220
He was the one who mapped many of the sciences we have today - and studies rhetoric or dramaturgy

94
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,900
Is it still Aristotle's virtually unchanged works that you read.

95
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,520
His categorization of plants and animals were prevailing

96
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,780
Until Carl von Linné launched his systematization during the 18th century.

97
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:02,080
To manage his research, he categorized philosophy in four different categories:

98
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,800
Physics, metaphysics, logic and ethics.

99
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,680
This is a division that we, with some modification, still have today.

100
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,400
We have relatively good knowledge of Aristotle's philosophy

101
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,960
As more of his texts are preserved than from any other antique philosopher.

102
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,340
What is preserved is mainly lecture manuscript (47 pieces),

103
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,540
But unfortunately, all of his books have disappeared.
