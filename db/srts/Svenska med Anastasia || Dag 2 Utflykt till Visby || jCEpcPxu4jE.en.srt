1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good morning. It's half past seven in the morning and I woke up to go to the toilet.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But look, I don't want to go back. I don't want to sleep again. I don't want to fall asleep again. I can not.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now I'm going to take a walk instead. It's not windy. It is completely still. The sun is shining, it's warm.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Everyone is asleep. I'm the only one awake in the whole campsite. We take a walk together.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
One has woken up and is going for a walk with his dog. She's going to pet the dog. It's the two of us that are awake.

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is one flagpole, two flagpoles and you can see that the flags are completely still. It's not windy at all.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The campsite is called Herta Camping. You can look at the map of Gotland, where it is located. Drive slowly.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Look what amazing flowers. Huge. Super fine on both sides. Here is my shadow.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Over there is the sea. The campsite is very close to the beach.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Check this out. It's a cow. Several cows. A cow. Several cows. What do they do? That bitch is itching.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It scratches its forehead. They are standing there eating something. Completely still. This road is a dirt road.

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I walk on the dirt road. Over there is the sea. The sea is also completely calm because there is no wind.

13
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So this is a garden. A cow pen for cows. And this is a horse paddock. A cow paddock and a horse paddock.

14
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This horse is standing and eating. They say the horse grazes. And that horse is sleeping.

15
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It looks like that. We continue forward to the beach. Right by the beach there are some houses.

16
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:28,000
These houses are very small. A small house. Many small houses. They are not real. I think they are cabins.

17
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Or so before, people lived in slightly smaller houses. I can reach the ceiling.

18
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:23,000
An old bench. You dare not sit on that bench. It is very old and rotten.

19
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Do you see? But it's here. It is so pretty. Check. It is probably from the middle of the 20th century.

20
00:05:42,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Just watch. Absolutely wonderful. There are many good places on Gotland for sure. But this place is certainly not the last.

21
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wow. It's just wow. I am completely fascinated. Check these out. In many places they build like this.

22
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So here you find flat stones like this. For example, a bench and a table. A sofa and a coffee table.

23
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Here they have made a bench. I think they built these houses the same way too.

24
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Flat stones and then plastered with concrete or cement. Or I don't know. With something.

25
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:49,364
Today is Saturday and I will be live on Youtube. But today I will be live from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m.

26
00:07:49,364 --> 00:08:02,000
Otherwise it will be too stressful in the morning. It takes approximately one hour from Herta Camping from this location to Visby.

27
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So if I start at 10 o'clock then we have to leave home at around quarter to nine. It's a little too early I can say.

28
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So just today 11 to 12. I know what to do. I'm going to do my morning exercise here on the beach.

29
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can take a look if you want.

30
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now I have done my morning gymnastics. Now I can dip my feet a little. Dip feet.

31
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I can feel the water. The water is actually quite cold today.

32
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yesterday the water was not so cold. I thought the water was perfectly fine yesterday. I didn't bathe. It was late at night.

33
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But I thought it was perfectly fine. But now I think the water is cold. There may be a difference in the morning and in the evening.

34
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I do not know. We'll see.

35
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We are eating breakfast. Our neighbors cycle on to the next stop. To the next campsite. They cycle through the whole of Gotland.

36
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now we are in Visby and I am starting life.

37
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The bell rings and I end my life.

38
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Today we are in Visby. Day two in Visby.

39
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is Stora torget. Great square. Here there is trade. You can shop, buy jewellery, clothes.

40
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is a church ruin.

41
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And throughout Visby, here inside the walls, there are many cafes and restaurants and right now there are a lot of tourists here.

42
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Many, many tourists who come from Sweden, from the mainland but also from other countries.

43
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Santa Karin's Church. An old church from the end of the 17th century.

44
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Check this out.

45
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This church we have looked at life.

46
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What is this? This is ivy growing.

47
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There are many different plants here in Visby.

48
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Plants growing on the walls.

49
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That climbs the walls.

50
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Here there is a small scene. You can do different events.

51
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Old stones.

52
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And here the roof is still there. The roof is made of small, tiny stones.

53
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
A sheep. So there are big stone sheep in the square and everywhere.

54
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In Stockholm it is a lion and on Gotland it is a sheep.

55
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:16,926
There is a wall around the entire town of Visby. This is a wall.

56
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:23,000
This is a tower. This is a gate.

57
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:32,209
The wall goes around the whole of Visby.

58
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You can walk here. Inside the wall is the old town.

59
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,197
Outside the wall it is the new city perhaps.

60
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:50,000
Look, there are those here. I don't know what it is.

61
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There are bicycles here. They park their bikes.

62
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And on the walls there are plants.

63
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,417
So this is growing. I do not know how. How does it grow?

64
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We want to take this train.

65
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The blue-yellow train. Guided city tour.

66
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Children, 3 to 10 years, SEK 50.

67
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,065
Adults, SEK 100.

68
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:52,000
Tickets are redeemed on the train. See the clock. Departures.

69
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
See the clock. This watch.

70
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What time is it? One o'clock maybe.

71
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Here they give out free 7up. Thanks so much.

72
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Now we have sat on the train, but we sit in the back and front.

73
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So we'll ride with our backs.

74
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I have an ice cream.

75
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We go by train. We look at Visby, at the wall, the Ringwall and listen to the guide.

76
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It speaks Swedish through speakers. These are speakers, so we'll listen to the guide.

77
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
For us, the trip with this train cost SEK 400.

78
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Two child tickets.

79
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We paid for two children's tickets for the girls.

80
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
A child ticket costs SEK 50 and three adults.

81
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Then it will be SEK 400.

82
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,819
Then we met our friends there and walked with them for the rest of the day.

83
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:16,079
So all Saturday we were in Visby.

84
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:57,604
There was a pink party on the beach.

85
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,850
Everyone was wearing pink clothes.

86
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:05,010
They danced and they had fun.

87
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,248
Now it is evening and we will go home and go to sleep.

88
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:55,164
Thank you so much for watching. Tomorrow will be day three. Do not miss it. Bye!
