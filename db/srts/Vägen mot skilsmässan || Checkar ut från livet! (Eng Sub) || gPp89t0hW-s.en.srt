1
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.359
- Today we're gonna have a boat day, Mickis!
- Yeah, how sweet?


2
00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.009
- Really nice, the current weather is so hot.


3
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.469
- Who shouted?


4
00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.023
- You've learned to pronounce "R". 
- Say "R". 


5
00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:47.022
- Rrr.


6
00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:50.203
- King!
- You're so good. 


7
00:00:50.203 --> 00:00:54.075
- Today we're gonna hang on a boat with Emelie, Johan and Stella. 


8
00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:58.268
- Let's see if they're home. 
- Emelie and Johan have renovated the house. 


9
00:00:58.268 --> 00:01:01.974
- Let's go inside to see how far they've come. 
- Let's go in and take a look. 


10
00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:05.340
- You don't have to get awkward, Johan, damn it. 


11
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:14.069
- Now we're ready. We've got a little tour, but will come back here and record when it's all done. 


12
00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.072
- Here you get a preview, oh my god. 


13
00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:21.193
- Above it all, Mickis, the conservatory!


14
00:01:21.193 --> 00:01:25.972
- I love this. 
- Magical. 


15
00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:29.272
- Hey Stella. 
- Hey, what's happening?


16
00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.345
- It's time to go to the boat. 


17
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.062
- Captain Mickis, are you gonna steer the boat?
- If I'm allowed. 


18
00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:47.177
- "Give me!"
- When did you start to speak English?


19
00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:19.207
- You're doing this so damn good. 
- It was nothing!


20
00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:21.207
- Really fine!
- Well, it looks good. 


21
00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.937
- Yes, I think so too.


22
00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:25.354
- And how you drove through the channels!


23
00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:29.714
- I had a good flow today. I could feel it from the beginning. 


24
00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:48.143
- Are you full and satisfied?
- Life, and a glas of rose wine, later on. 


25
00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:50.637
- Mickis, we have to get a boat!
- Yes, we have to!


26
00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:53.792
- The thing is that I'd like a big boat.
- Let's sell the house.


27
00:02:53.792 --> 00:03:00.000
- This is life. Days like this make me so happy. Don't you think so?


28
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.542
- Yes. I think so too. It's the calmness. 
-  The calmness. 


29
00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:09.423
- For me who comes from TÃ¤rnaby, this is sort of the same. Like when you're up in the mountains out in the nature. 


30
00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:14.816
- Really? I love that as well. I'm getting flashbacks from when I rode boats all summer.


31
00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:21.434
- It's amazing. We have to get a boat. But as said, then I'd like a big one, which we absolutely can't afford. 


32
00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:24.059
- And none of us can drive it either. 


33
00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:32.368
- Anyway, the situation is a bit stressed, I'm going back to meet Anderstam and Sverre. 


34
00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:34.246
- Yes, we've got some problems. 


35
00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:42.315
- Not so much problems, but we have to redo some drawings, so they can make some new measurements...


36
00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:46.490
...to also make sure that the transfer from Rafald to Sverre will be correct. 


37
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.767
- But first we're about to go out and sunbathing. Then you can go home and work with the house.


38
00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:55.606
- I might get one more glass of rose wine. 
- Really!


39
00:03:55.606 --> 00:04:01.198
- I got some feeling. It's nice weather and still feels like vacation. Don't you agree?


40
00:04:01.198 --> 00:04:03.948
- I agree to a 100%!
- Are you gonna drive later on?


41
00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:04.815
- Yes!
- Alright!


42
00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:10.155
- Now it's time to swim. 
- Now it's time to swim, and to just embrace this, all the way back. 


43
00:04:10.155 --> 00:04:15.132
- Sometimes it's nice to just check out from life. That's what I'm feeling. 


44
00:04:15.132 --> 00:04:19.392
...to live some, before you get back to reality. 


45
00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:23.024
- Here we have the boat. 
- Their boat is a perfect sized one. 


46
00:04:23.024 --> 00:04:26.039
- And Johan and Emelie are also perfect. They are awesome. 


47
00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.551
- You are perfect.
- You are!


48
00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:33.671
- This part of the vlog is in collaboration with Once Upon. 


49
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:36.507
- So let's start of with sharing our code, we've got for you.


50
00:04:36.507 --> 00:04:42.181
- It's "MICHAELAJENS25" and will give you a 25% discount.  


51
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:45.199
- You know how addicted I am to this app. 


52
00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.008
- Well, it can be a bit scary sometimes when you use it for such a long time. 


53
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:55.702
- Yes I know, but it's so fun. You can really do your own photo books...


54
00:04:55.702 --> 00:05:02.408
...where you can add your text beside the picture, or under the picture, and make your own story.


55
00:05:02.408 --> 00:05:06.928
- I've been writing the books for our children in first person.


56
00:05:06.928 --> 00:05:12.597
- It's pretty fun, to write down "Here is when I lost my first tooth", and so on. 


57
00:05:12.597 --> 00:05:20.357
- And now I've done a new book from this summer. Summer 2022. 


58
00:05:20.357 --> 00:05:27.023
- Before I start off showing the book, I'll show how easy it is to use the app. 


59
00:05:27.023 --> 00:05:29.899
- Here we have all my books collected. 


60
00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.717
- Here we enter the book, my most recent book.


61
00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:35.130
- Here. 


62
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:47.398
- And all books will be saved here. If I something happens with the book I've ordered, I can order it again. 


63
00:05:47.398 --> 00:05:51.919
- So, here we have all pictures. It's really simple to add. 


64
00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.628
- I can choose the layout all by myself, as well as adding a text on the side.


65
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.317
- And then you'll get a finished book sent home. And the delivery is really quick.


66
00:06:10.317 --> 00:06:15.485
- And the book will come like this, but you can choose format. If you prefer softer book, or a hard book...


67
00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:24.286
...and I've chosen a hard book with matte silk paper, so it feels luxurious, and this is our result. 


68
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.940
- The pictures are getting so good, and I think the quality is awesome. 


69
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.384
- And it's really fun to have as a memory. 


70
00:06:37.384 --> 00:06:47.518
- Fine, most people have all pictures on their phone or computer, but it's really nice to have it in a physical shape as well.


71
00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:52.240
- It's fun to watch, and also something you can have in the house for visitors to look at.


72
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.011
- And I'm making books on the children each of every year. It's so worth it.


73
00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:04.124
- It's fun with photo albums. 
- I'm happy you're doing this. 


74
00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:10.914
- Yes me too, I've talked about this for such a long time. As soon as you start, you realize how easy it is. 


75
00:07:10.914 --> 00:07:14.703
- You just add the pictures. They will come in order from when you took the picture.


76
00:07:14.703 --> 00:07:17.711
- It makes it easy to find pictures from every month.


77
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:23.703
- Especially when you're doing a book like this, and might want to follow the pictures from July to August...


78
00:07:23.703 --> 00:07:31.133
...which is created automatically, even though you can choose which order you'd like. 


79
00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:34.136
- Anyway, the chronological makes it easier.


80
00:07:34.136 --> 00:07:38.700
- Awesome! And remember, if you don't have a picture, it did never happen.


81
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.492
- Exactly!


82
00:07:41.536 --> 00:07:46.266
- For example: the snake bite. It's something to remember. 


83
00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:53.877
- Palma!


84
00:07:57.515 --> 00:08:03.371
- I'm looking forward to make more books. I've started to make our "House book", as I've showed earlier.


85
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:14.835
- What's really great about Once Upon, is that you can start, and then add material until it's done. 


86
00:08:14.835 --> 00:08:16.645
- Easy and good. 


87
00:08:16.645 --> 00:08:21.587
- Now we will get a bunch of these books at home. How fun?


88
00:08:21.587 --> 00:08:22.815
- Awesome, Mickis!


89
00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:28.690
- Alright, so don't forget the code: "MICHAELAJENS25" to get a 25% discount. 


90
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.324
- It's valid for a week, from today.


91
00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:38.189
- Who wants to join me?


92
00:08:38.189 --> 00:08:41.181
- Who's with me? Are all kids gonna join?


93
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:45.259
- They are so cowardly and wants Jens to be in the water when the enter, just like me. I hate to jump in by myself. 


94
00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:45.759
- Let's go!


95
00:08:49.286 --> 00:08:55.599
- What's your reaction?
- Oh no I lost my swimming trunks, they're gone. 


96
00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:02.803
- I just jumped. 
- Watch out, Valle!


97
00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:09.022
- "Laddel".


98
00:09:28.223 --> 00:09:30.154
- That was nice. Now it's your turn, Mickis!
- No!


99
00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:37.215
- First swim of the year?
- Have I been bathing some? Yes, once. 


100
00:09:37.832 --> 00:09:38.889
- So you will get in?


101
00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:40.218
- We have to record this. 


102
00:09:40.218 --> 00:09:47.564
- Can I push you?
- No, you can not. Then we're getting divorced. 100%!


103
00:09:47.564 --> 00:09:50.917
- So you really want to get a divorce?!


104
00:09:51.233 --> 00:09:53.440
- Mickis is about to go into the water, so you have to move a bit. 


105
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.867
- The old lady is about to go into the water. 


106
00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:59.378
- If no ones laughing there is no one in the neighbourhood. 


107
00:09:59.378 --> 00:10:01.930
- The old lady is half way into the water. 


108
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.387
- This is so cold. Why are we doing this?


109
00:10:04.387 --> 00:10:08.786
- What's nice with it?
- It's the feeling you get afterwards.That's the whole point.


110
00:10:14.037 --> 00:10:18.248
- Nice!
- Wooho!


111
00:10:18.248 --> 00:10:22.399
- Don't hang there!
- Stella, get off me. 


112
00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.776
- This will end up with me drowning you. 


113
00:10:24.776 --> 00:10:27.259
- Hanging on Stella. 


114
00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:31.294
- I won't dive in, I'll jump. 
- No, dive!


115
00:10:31.294 --> 00:10:34.768
- It's fun if I'll end up doing a belly flop. 


116
00:10:34.768 --> 00:10:40.115
- Go mom, go!
- How do I even dive?


117
00:10:40.115 --> 00:10:42.871
- Come on, it's like riding a bike. 


118
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.425
- You're awesome!


119
00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:12.176
- The lactic acid is all over, right?


120
00:11:12.176 --> 00:11:16.266
- You know, my distances were like, 200 meters, 100 meters.
- For how long period did you swim?


121
00:11:16.266 --> 00:11:17.935
- A long time. 


122
00:11:17.935 --> 00:11:19.450
- Her name is Mickan. 


123
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.890
- How's it going, Valle?


124
00:11:31.682 --> 00:11:34.785
- Jump up here, behind me. 


125
00:11:36.825 --> 00:11:39.518
- Turn in that direction. 


126
00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:49.429
- A bit more. Even more, so you'll come up straight. 


127
00:12:06.405 --> 00:12:08.935
- Happy.
- A really happy guy. 


128
00:12:08.935 --> 00:12:11.804
- Emelie, this day has been so good. 
- Yes, fantastic!


129
00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:15.734
- A big thank's for this day!
- Yes, indeed. What a day!


130
00:12:21.602 --> 00:12:28.567
- We're just gonna finish. 


131
00:12:28.567 --> 00:12:33.469
- Why are you filming when we're away?Are you gonna publish this or what?


132
00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:36.010
- Maybe we will!


133
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.944
- This is not gonna give you money. 


134
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.517
- This is 100% a DelÃ©r gene. 


135
00:12:45.517 --> 00:12:47.516
- And I'll be like:


136
00:12:50.727 --> 00:12:53.803
- I have so many videos on you dancing. 
- What?


137
00:12:53.803 --> 00:12:55.285
- Yes, a lot!
- From Palma?


138
00:12:55.285 --> 00:12:59.080
- From everywhere, Mickis. 


139
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.357
- Have you had a good day today?
- Fantastic!


140
00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:03.310
- Indeed. 
- Magical. 


141
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:08.066
- Thank you for watching this episode. Next time we're back by the house. 


142
00:13:08.066 --> 00:13:12.297
- And by then we're hoping that the interior walls are up.
- Yeah, I really hope so. 


143
00:13:12.297 --> 00:13:16.364
- And maybe we can go trough what happened. 
- Sure!


144
00:13:16.364 --> 00:13:18.785
- I missed the meeting today. 


145
00:13:18.785 --> 00:13:22.552
- Yes, we should have been back by four o'clock, but it turned out differently. 


146
00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.423
- But it will be fine anyway. 


147
00:13:25.423 --> 00:13:28.299
- Sverre and Anderstam will solve it. 


148
00:13:28.299 --> 00:13:33.576
- It was worth it, because this way was magical. Fantastic!
- Indeed!


149
00:13:33.576 --> 00:13:36.022
- Take care everybody!
- See you next week!


150
00:13:36.022 --> 00:13:37.144
- Bye!
- Bye!
