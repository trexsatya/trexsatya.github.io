1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,080
Having made a movie with Crazy Pictures has been ...

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,760
One...

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,880
Rollercoaster.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Drive!

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,080
UFO Sweden is about Denise, a foster home placed teenage rebel

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,360
who lived in the belief that her father died in an accident up in the mountains.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,240
But when she gets signs that it might not be so

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,120
If she is looking for this association UFO Sweden.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,160
Then I welcome you all to today's board meeting.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,400
And explains here with the meeting opened.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,440
I think it will be so damn fat!

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,360
Although we have had more resources than we ever had

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,920
So the ambition has also been so much bigger.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
When it is a take there may be a car for 70 kilometers per hour and gossip.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,800
We initially thought there would be very digital effects

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,440
But it has become more and more that we could do a lot on the spot.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,880
So that is not possible to fake!

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,920
We have wanted to create a cinematic experience

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,440
An adventure that one should want to turn off the lamps and sit in the bio darkness to see.

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,760
UFO Sweden is really the story of the little man in the great spectacle.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,280
It will be a very different Swedish film.

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,120
And that's cool.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,920
This is such a movie that I wanted when I was growing up.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,200
Who is ready for a little UFO hunting?

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,080
Born Ready!

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
Turn on double coffee pots!

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,320
This will be our largest field survey ever.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,520
My wish is that people have an amazing movie experience.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,560
That you get to know these characters, that you got to be on an adventure

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,800
But also that you come out and look up at the sky and ...

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Wonder.

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,840
Want to know a home run?

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,920
I don't think we are here alone.
