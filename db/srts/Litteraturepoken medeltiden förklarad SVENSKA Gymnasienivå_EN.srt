1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,200
Imagine if in the future one would decide that the time you live in now-

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,040
-is boring and stupid, that you were probably a bit sluggish-

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,920
-That the books were bad, the music uninteresting-

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,400
-And that everything you thought was just ignored.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,320
And that you took your time and hundreds of years around it and baptized it-

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,600
-To something that would signal that here it was boring and cultural misery.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,880
It was precisely the Middle Ages.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,280
The Middle Ages is an epoch name that comes only afterwards.

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,720
The medieval people did not perceive that they lived during the Middle Ages.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,880
By the Middle Ages is meant "intermediate time"-

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,600
-A period between antiquity and the Renaissance.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,440
Those who came afterwards did not want to be associated with this interim.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,600
The term is used to mark-

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,600
-That we are better than those who lived during that period.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,280
We get this with the Middle Ages being dark centuries - "The Dark Ages".

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,200
There is a lot of darkness during the Middle Ages, with crusades and other-

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,960
-But there are also very exciting thoughts.

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,960
The Middle Ages are more than a parenthesis.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,840
It was knight, adventure and culture. And new religions emerged.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,400
What did they write and read then during the dirty Middle Ages?

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,920
The Middle Ages are usually counted from the fall of the Roman Empire in the 400s ...

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,760
... and all the way to the 16th century.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,440
It is a period of time over a thousand years.

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,920
Although it is difficult to summarize such a long epoch-

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,840
-The there are two central things that start on r - knights and religion.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,880
After the fall of the Roman Empire, it is messy in Europe.

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,760
Although the people here-

28
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,200
-Not seem to have any problems with being carved with sword-

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
-So it brings changes.

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,560
The kings find it harder to educate and pay all the warriors they need.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,680
They give a piece of ground to the knights-

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,880
-In exchange for the knights setting up and defending the kingdom.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,600
It is part of the feudal system-

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,840
-Where the king gives away some of his power in exchange for loyalty.

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,000
The second R made even more mark on its time.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,760
Everything in the Middle Ages has a religious dimension.

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,040
All the ancient gods, such as Zeus, Apollon, Oden and Tor retired-

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,480
-And there will be new stars in the sky.

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,800
In Europe, Christianity goes from having been prohibited to dominating-

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,680
-And in the Middle East, Islam emerges.

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,440
The texts of both religions, the New Testament and the Qur'an-

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,960
-Is the most scattered literature ever.

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,120
The change of power in heaven has a huge impact on life on earth.

44
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,040
The church and popes cooperate with the governing power-

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,040
-And helps manage the state apparatus.

46
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,400
The farmers, the largest social group, have less power.

47
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,240
God and the Church are present throughout the Middle Ages and characterize all-

48
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,880
-from everyday acts such as cleaning-

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,600
-To go to church and seek out the divine.

50
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,440
Something that is also constantly present is death.

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,000
During the Middle Ages you get a lot of close contact with death.

52
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,640
It has partly with the great pest epidemics to do-

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,560
-And partly that we have a greater closeness to death during the Middle Ages.

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,560
One lives in large families together-

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,840
-With grandchildren and grandmother in the same house, which makes you see death.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,360
You can die in the kitchen sofa and then the children see it.

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,480
But in the new Christian religion, death is something more than the end of life.

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,080
After death, you are assessed based on how you have done.

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,080
Life can be seen as a heating-

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,480
-If the existence on the other side of the grave.

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,080
One of the largest and most significant operations of the Middle Ages-

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,400
-Also have focus on death and life after that.

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,360
A work that reinforces the world-image-

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,520
-And scares people for what is to come later.

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,240
The divine comedy.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,160
It is not a comedy, but it is called it because it ends happily.

67
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,360
It is written by this man - Dante Alighieri ...

68
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,800
... here wearing a boastful wreath wreath showing that he is a good poet.

69
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,400
Dante comes from a middle -class family in the Italian city of Florence.

70
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,160
It takes him 20 years to write down the story-

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,360
-Where he has himself in the lead role.

72
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,760
Book Poiler - The Divine Comedy.

73
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,880
The divine comedy is about Dante's journey on the other side of the grave.

74
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,440
Through him we get a guided trip to the three different parts of the Kingdom

75
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,880
-And we meet well -known characters from history and literature.

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,760
The journey begins in hell that is divided into different circles.

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,120
In the first circle we find the mildest sinners-

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,160
-And at the bottom, on the ground floor nine, the worst.

79
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,160
There we find, for example. traitor like Judas and brutus-

80
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,160
-Fast frozen in eternal ice.

81
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,560
After the tour through hell it carries off the mountain of the purgatory ...

82
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,600
... before Dante reaches his final destination - paradise.

83
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,600
My first contact with the divine comedy ...

84
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:21,000
... was when I was nine years old ...

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,680
... on a visit home with Grandma and grandfather in Gothenburg.

86
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,440
The pictures from hell caught me the most.

87
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,720
Horrible pictures of devils who torment poor sinners-

88
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,160
-Long down into the underground.

89
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,880
The book has a huge impact, but it is fuzzy how it is published.

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,680
You do not know exactly how Dante released the divine comedy.

91
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,680
It is thus the Middle Ages we are talking about.

92
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,560
When we find ourselves around 1300 it is still 170 years left-

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,120
-Still Johannes Gutenberg invents the art of printing.

94
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,240
This will be an incredibly scattered story.

95
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,520
You tell each other very orally.

96
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,520
The divine comedy is written on Dante's own verse measure Terzin.

97
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,760
There, all strokes have three rows of eleven syllables in each row.

98
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,520
So the divine comedy is written over and over, in a hundred songs.

99
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,880
Perhaps not the easiest way to write-

100
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,800
-But certainly help if you were to remember the whole story.

101
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,320
What is in these hundred songs takes people in bloodiest seriousness.

102
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,920
They believe in everything that is written about hell, purgatory and paradise.

103
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,160
The church also begins to use Dante's work.

104
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,600
That becomes the description of hell and the purgatory-

105
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,840
-So this is preached as the truth.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,160
One uses it, not as a beautiful story-

107
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,240
-Outan like something actually.

108
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,760
It allows the church to gain more power over people.

109
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,599
Who wants to roll stones or burn in open graves?

110
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
"Do as the church says, otherwise it happens."

111
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,040
That it was written on verse made it a little difficult to read it-

112
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,320
-But it was interesting too.

113
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,600
It was written a little more poetically and it was very descriptive.

114
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,160
They flowed better into the text.

115
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,440
It was reminiscent of when I was smaller and read the hobby of Tolkien.

116
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,320
It creates a picture of what it looked like.

117
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,360
The whole description of what happens ...

118
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,840
... if you have sinned and what happens in hell ...

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,080
It draws up a horrific picture of how terrible it is-

120
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,160
-As an attempt to make it sound nasty, I would guess.

121
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,440
It's most bizarre. It's imaginative.

122
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,520
One reason why the book becomes so popular is-

123
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,400
-That it is written in a language that people are actually talking.

124
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,920
It was sensational.

125
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,080
The literary language that had been used then-

126
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,960
-During the last thousand years in the European literature-

127
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,920
-As Latin. Then Dante comes and does this in Italian.

128
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,240
It was important for him to reach out to not only the scholars.

129
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:28,040
Dante can be taken as an example of a breaking point-

130
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,320
-the the wide layer of the population, such as the elite in cities and on rural

131
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,800
-comes into reading and consumption of culture in a different way.

132
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,000
Dante is not the only one who starts writing in Florentine.

133
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,680
It becomes so popular that that dialect becomes national language-

134
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,720
-So what we today call Italian.

135
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,800
It is a remarkable example of the role literature can ha-

136
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,320
-In a greater linguistic context.

137
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,560
Text in the spoken language reached more easily to a wide mass.

138
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,440
But there was another literature that first had a narrower target group.

139
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,640
The knight novels.

140
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,960
The knight novel emerges during the 13th century.

141
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,400
The knight novels are aimed at a reading aristocracy - the knight.

142
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,960
They could usually read.

143
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,960
Knight novels are filled with adventure-

144
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,280
-and in the center always stands a knight-

145
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
-while, women protect and weak, behave honestly-

146
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,520
-and always stands by his word.

147
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,520
Being a knight was like being influencer or youtuber.

148
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,480
You are known and you also know celebrities, such as the king.

149
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,280
After all, it is the king who studs one more knight.

150
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,560
In addition to exciting stories, the knight novels are a label book-

151
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
-For noblemen who will learn the knight's ideal.

152
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,600
They would both entertain and raise.

153
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,040
So maybe literature has always been-

154
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,520
-But it is clear in the knight's novel.

155
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,760
The knight novels also contain so -called Hovish love.

156
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,760
The idea is that a knight should flirt passionate with ladies-

157
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,480
-But be a gentleman and not let it go beying further than crazy looks.

158
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,000
Hövish love is central to one of the most famous novels-

159
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,280
-Tristan and Isolde. Join us in the relationships now.

160
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,240
Tristan is one of King Artur's knights around the round table.

161
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,800
He is also a sister to King Mark.

162
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,160
King Mark is married to the beautiful Isolde.

163
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,160
One day so is Isolde and Tristan a love drink-

164
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,720
-while, they immediately fall in love with each other.

165
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,440
From that moment their passion is a fact.

166
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,440
This is a bloody and brutal story-

167
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,960
-If infidelity and tragic love.

168
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,960
Listen to this:

169
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,200
"Yesterday on the market I saw a couple holding each other's hands."

170
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,920
"I realized that we will never do it. Never anything like that."

171
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,240
"No picnics or unattended smiles."

172
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,760
"No rings. Only stolen moments that go way too fast."

173
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,520
Tristan and Isolde are a worrying story.

174
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,920
The love that is born between them is not natural.

175
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,440
It is the result of a magical love drink.

176
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:09,040
This is something that the medieval reader is worried about.

177
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,160
It was a theme that fascinated the medieval reader-

178
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,960
-And that fascinates us today as well.

179
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,720
In the knight poetry we always meet a dream picture of a knight.

180
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,440
He is strong, smart and honest.

181
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,560
But the knights of reality do not always live up to that ideal.

182
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,840
The knight novel reflects aspects of the knight's real life.

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,520
The knight's culture of honor, his virtues and living rules-

184
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,120
-Finds depicted in the novel.

185
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,240
But the knights are idealized pictures. The knights are raised.

186
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,680
In the crusades - in the stories and in reality ...

187
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,280
... the knights and religion meet.

188
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,240
The hellish warning examples from the divine comedy-

189
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,600
-Mixed with the upbringing and the feeling of duty from the knight novels.

190
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,160
The knight we meet in the novel is quite far from-

191
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,840
-The crusade knight you otherwise associate with the Middle Ages.

192
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,160
Europe's Christians are worried that Muslims will take over Jerusalem.

193
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,640
A French Pope launches the idea of a pilgrimage to save the city.

194
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,600
You equip special knights with a mantle with a large cross on.

195
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,960
Then they are obliged to go to these places-

196
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,560
-and complete his knight service in the crusade.

197
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,720
But the crusades are not an exciting adventure in a romantic shimmer.

198
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,040
What is sold as travel to save Christian sacred sites-

199
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,760
-In bloody conquest war that lasts for hundreds of years.

200
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,280
They move out-

201
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,320
-And pure massacres on especially Jews and Muslims.

202
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,400
There are terrible stories where one cleans cities on folk-

203
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,400
-And cut the throat of infants.

204
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,840
The knight's ideals that the novels have taught no longer apply.

205
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,600
An honorary culture has developed around the knights on the battlefield.

206
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,560
They fought against those who were not Christians.

207
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,640
Unfortunately, many conflicts are founded during the Middle Ages.

208
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,680
The crusade time is still invoked politically, in a clumsy way.

209
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,360
That the US president says we should pull in crusad-

210
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,960
-Acker bad associations in the Muslim world.

211
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,760
At the end of the Middle Ages, a book is written by two German monk-

212
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,040
-Som, even though it is banned almost immediately, has major consequences.

213
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,360
During the 1400-1600s, a book sells almost as well as the Bible ...

214
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,440
... and it's Malleus Maleficarum - "Witch Hammer".

215
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,119
The witch hammer is a book in three chapters on what a witch is-

216
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,400
-How witchcraft and sorcery go to and how to find and prosecute a witch.

217
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,160
It is an instruction manual in witch hunt-

218
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,440
-And becomes the basis for the witch processes. The majority that was convicted were women.

219
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,600
According to the book, women are more receptive to the devil's attraction.

220
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,800
Above all, the woman's sexuality is described as threatening.

221
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,400
A completely unscientific perception-

222
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,360
-As has influenced the view of women until today.

223
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,280
Nevertheless, the negative image of the Middle Ages has almost disappeared.

224
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,480
The knight novel had an exaggerated, romantic picture of the knight's life-

225
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,920
-And today we have an excessive romantic picture of the Middle Ages.

226
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,800
What is exciting about the knight novel is-

227
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,560
-The knight's novel is the source of our modern fantasy tradition.

228
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,160
The story of the ring, Narnia and maybe even Game of Thrones ...

229
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,120
The knight novel is there in the background-

230
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,640
-And is crucial to especially the growth of fantasy.

231
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,360
The crusades are also extensively portrayed. Every year Ivanhoe is shown on TV ...

232
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,280
... and we also got our own Swedish crusade hero - Arn.

233
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,480
Although the Middle Ages remain in popular culture-

234
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,480
-In computer games, music videos, role-playing and festivals-

235
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,200
-and some love to pretend to live then-

236
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
-So you should probably be glad it is just on pretend.

237
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,720
The Middle Ages are interesting to study but you do not want to live that way.

238
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,440
It can be fun to dress up and loop Middle Ages-

239
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,960
-But one would not want to be burned on the bonfire-

240
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,800
-To question whether communion is Jesus' body.

241
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,680
