1
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.960
We want Jönköping with its fantastic sights and destinations

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.360
should sprout by life and movement.

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.960
We also want to use our strength as a meeting and event city

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.720
And be the obvious stop for both fairs but also for the tournament of music and culture.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.360
We want to be one of Sweden's best visitor destinations, hang with

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.200
A place benefits are about its conditions

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.320
And we have identified the situation, nature and our inheritance as particularly important.

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.480
The situation and nature may not require any direct explanation

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.600
But our legacy is about all those who built the place before us:

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.120
Amalia with her polka pigs, Husqvarnfabriken and others.

11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.880
We have a strong association life and the collaboration between our acts.

12
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.600
We are used to cooperation, we help

13
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.800
It is an incredible strength and opportunity for success,

14
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.560
It gives us a lead on many levels.

15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.720
Our target groups place ever higher demands that we as a destination company

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.840
Works with a big heart for society and the planet.

17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.120
The hospitality industry plays an important part of the transition to a more sustainable society.

18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.680
Destination Jönköping wants to help lead the transition to as sustainable place as possible.

19
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.040
What attracts visitors to a place is what you can do and experience.

20
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.600
More and more people want experiences where you feel involved and that are developed.

21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.800
We work with culture and sporting events, experiences that you do together others create memories.

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.040
In our municipality and region we have operations with extensive knowledge and prominent research.

23
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.360
By taking advantage of and enabling meetings within these core areas

24
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.480
Where participants, nationally and internationally, catch the eye of Jönköping

25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.840
We increase the attractiveness of the place and create the conditions for skills supply.

26
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.880
Travel changes, we go from being a place with strong business travel addiction

27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.400
To a place where private tourism is taking an increasing place.

28
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.960
We are now working hard to increase companies' opportunities to take advantage of this trend,

29
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.160
Finding new travel reasons for private travelers.

30
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.720
By creating commitment and collaborations,

31
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.800
enable these conditions and identify forces

32
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.800
So we position ourselves as a meeting and event city both nationally and internationally.

33
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:27.000
Just look like Dreamhack, Oringen, unique music festivals, international bicycle competitions and countless knowledge meetings.

34
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.200
A good hosting is often crucial to how a place is experienced

35
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.480
We must therefore together make sure that inspiration and information can be found in places where the visitor wants it,

36
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.120
Both digital and in person.

37
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.480
We therefore work at the destination very much to train, inspire and develop the host in our place.

38
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.600
We want a program that appeals to many.

39
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.440
We want a close dialogue and a close Samabete with local and national organizers,

40
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.680
This leads to the broad cultural offering offered at Jönköping Theater and Jönköping's concert and congress.

41
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.360
All that we have now told about is a prerequisite for creating a sustainable hospitality industry destination

42
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.040
And we would like that work at Destination Jönköping lead

43
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.720
But we can't do it alone, but we have to do that with you all and your commitment.

44
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.120
Together we will create an attractive place for both residents and visitors.

45
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.320
A place we can feel proud of, Jönköping.
