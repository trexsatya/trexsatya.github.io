1
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.960
We want to see Jönköping, with all its fantastic attractions


2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.360
bubbling with life and activity.


3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.960
We also want to play to the city’s strengths as a hub for meetings and events


4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.720
and make Jönköping an obvious stop for trade fairs as well as touring music and culture.


5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.360
We want to become one of Sweden’s top places to visit, so why not join us?


6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.200
The advantages for any destination are found in its background,


7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.320
and we see the city’s location, nature and heritage as being particularly important.


8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.480
Our location and nature speak for themselves,


9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.600
but our heritage is to do with those who came before us and helped build up this place:


10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.120
from Amalia and her Polkagris candy canes, to the Husqvarna factory and many others.


11
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.880
We have a strong sense of community and excellent cooperation between local organizations.


12
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.600
Being used to working together, helping each other out,


13
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.800
is an extraordinary strength that makes success possible


14
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.560
and gives us a head start on many levels.


15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.720
Our target groups place ever higher demands on us as a destination management company


16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.840
to work wholeheartedly for the community and the planet.


17
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.120
The hospitality industry plays an important part in the transition towards a more sustainable society


18
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.680
and Destination Jönköping wants to help lead the transition towards making us as sustainable a place as possible.


19
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.040
What attracts visitors to a particular place is what they can do and experience there.


20
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.600
More people want experiences where they feel involved and can develop themselves.


21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.800
Our cultural and sporting events create experiences and memories you can share with others. 


22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.040
Our regional businesses and institutions possess extensive know-how and carry out outstanding research.


23
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.360
By exploiting all this and enabling meetings


24
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.480
where Swedish and international participants rub shoulders and get to know Jönköping,


25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.840
we increase our attractiveness and pave the way for a future skills supply.


26
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.880
Travel is changing, and we are evolving from being a place with a strong dependence on business travel


27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.400
to somewhere where private tourism is increasingly important.


28
00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.960
We are now doing all we can to help companies take advantage of this trend


29
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.160
By finding new reasons to attract independent visitors.


30
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.720
In getting people engaged and collaborating,


31
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.800
By developing possibilities and identifying strengths,


32
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.800
we can position ourselves, nationally and internationally, as a meeting and events destination.


33
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:27.000
Just look at Dreamhack, O-ringen, our unique music festivals, international bike races and countless knowledge-sharing meetings.


34
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.200
Excellent hospitality is often decisive for how a place is experienced;


35
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.480
we need to make sure that visitors can easily find inspiration and information,


36
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.120
either digitally or in person.


37
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.480
That’s why we are making tremendous efforts to educate, inspire and develop the hospitality industry here.


38
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.600
We want a programme that appeals to many different people.


39
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.440
We want a close dialogue and cooperation with both local and national organisers,


40
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.680
that leads to a wide range of cultural events at Jönköping Theatre and Jonkoping’s concert and congress halls.


41
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.360
Everything we’ve talked about is essential for creating a sustainable tourism destination,


42
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.040
and we at Destination Jönköping are more than happy to take the lead on this.


43
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.720
But we can’t do it alone, we have to do it together with you all, making use of your engagement.


44
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.120
Together we can create an attractive location for both residents and visitors.


45
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.320
A place we can be proud of:Jönköping
