00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03.560
Hello Hello

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,180
It happened a fun thing this weekend.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09.160
I was at the music festival

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,820
I have written some about it on my music blog

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,420
But the first evening so I met

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,820
A guy who usually watches my movies

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,040
I think

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,320
I think you said you were called Feras

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,040
Hope you watch this movie

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,500
I'm not quite sure I heard right but I think so anyway

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
Very fun to be seen anyway and

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,580
fun to talk a little

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,080
and we discussed a little neighbor how to be better at writing

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
So then I got the desire to

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,240
to discuss that question, that how can one be better at writing

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,400
a little more

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,160
so i think i might make two or three or four movies about it

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00.860
If I, so to speak, have so much to say about it. We'll see a little

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,740
But since I think I do more than one movie

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07.660
So I don't have to say everything at once

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,300
and what I was going to take up first is to

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15.560
I think it's very easy to think

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,040
When trying to get better at writing

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,420
When you are thinking about: How should I do it

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,920
then it is very easy to just think about language

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,920
Think about: What words should I use?

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
I have to learn to write more difficult sentences

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,600
How should I use bye?

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,280
How should I split a text into different pieces and

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,260
all those writing technical things

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,740
which of course are very important

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52.540
But I think it's good to think about writing

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,760
So to say, starting with something completely different

34
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00.620
than language and words and grammar and ...

35
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,300
is about something much bigger

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,280
and that think I am

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,380
Should you say it very simple, writing is about thoughts

38
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,740
And feelings

39
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,020
But to have thoughts about different things

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,900
And then I mean, what do I mean by thoughts, yes I think that

41
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,640
To write something so you have to

42
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,480
both look outward at the world

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,780
on other people, on nature

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,760
and you have to look inward, look at yourself

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,020
what you feel, what you think, and be curious about it

46
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,500
Writing begins in a curiosity

47
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,160
both on what is around you and what is inside you

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,700
and in order to develop your writing, I think that

49
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,400
You need to go into a conversation with other people

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07.960
What other people say, what other people

51
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,340
thinks, what they write

52
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,160
And of course it can start with your friends, with your parents

53
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
with your children

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,620
But to, so to speak ...

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,600
develop their writing so I believe that

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
That it is very good to ...

57
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,520
Watch movies, and read books and read articles

58
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,620
and then ... that said ... not because

59
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,360
You often say that you get better at writing by reading and that is true

60
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,640
But it's not just reading to get a better language

61
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,140
Without me thinking that one both

62
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,640
Looking at things and reading things

63
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,440
To get a richer

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55.960
Image of the world

65
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,780
so you read and so on

66
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02.420
In order to develop as a human being

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,900
and when you get more and more complicated and more

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,780
versatile, thus different

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,840
Perspective, approach

70
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,160
on the world

71
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,560
Then you will also be able to write more interesting

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,740
and about more things

73
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,020
Thus, you say in Swedish to get deeper

74
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,840
Not just rewrite what happens on the surface but can ....

75
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,900
Look at a thing from different directions

76
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,060
both, so to speak, see one thing

77
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,120
from your eyes but also see one thing from the eyes of others

78
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,420
from the eyes of other cultures

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,920
from the eyes of other political views

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,060
It's hard to talk about this in an easy way

81
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,600
But I think this is important to

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,420
To write so you have to try

83
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,180
Enrich yourself as a human being by ...

84
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08.080
see the world in many different ways

85
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,220
and a very good way to see the world

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,480
in many different ways is to read

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,320
and read people, perhaps with a different background, other experience, other language

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Other views other than you

89
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,920
and that way you will be able to both compare

90
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,960
your own way of looking at the world with the manner of others

91
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,640
And also that you get new thoughts, you get new knowledge

92
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,720
and all this, when you write a text, you take

93
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,440
Both your own experiences and all the knowledge you have gathered based on

94
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,700
They put you in your text

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,720
They are part of your writing

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02.740
so i start like this in the big picture

97
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,000
that my tip is to go into a conversation with

98
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:16,100
Others who write, others who make movies, others who make theater, people you meet

99
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,980
And was curious

100
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,760
on what they feel and think and think

101
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,580
and as well as process it

102
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,740
Think about it, maybe write about ...

103
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,580
what you think and what others think, what you think and others think

104
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,840
And in this way you will also be able to write richer and more complicated and ...

105
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,420
More interesting texts

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,660
and then we can come to the language so to speak

107
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,300
If you develop

108
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:03,140
Your thoughts and your view of the world so you can also start looking for a richer language that ...

109
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06.840
express your thoughts on

110
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,800
And hopefully I will be in my next video

111
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,320
But I wanted to start at this end

112
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,760
And this is obviously something we can discuss

113
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,500
or if you have questions about words I use

114
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,820
But above all, it may be good to discuss: what is it to write really

115
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,320
It may be much more than just sentences on paper

116
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,700
Feel free to think about it and feel free to write what you think

117
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,280
so we'll see you soon in a new video again

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,660
Have a nice day. Bye.
