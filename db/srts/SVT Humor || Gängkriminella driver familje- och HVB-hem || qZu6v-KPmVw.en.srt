1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05.840
The gang criminals have started running family homes and HVB homes.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,280
It is absolutely true and it all started with and in Strängnäs.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,200
This is the 35-year-old who is suspected to have acted as a kind of manager

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,320
to the Foxtrot network.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,800
In an eavesdropped call, Rawa Majid refers to him as "Strängnäs".

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,760
No one touches Strängnäs. Strängnäs is my area.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,680
Strängnäs is thus both a city and a person. It paves the way for confusion.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,600
"Are you going on a weekend to Strängnäs? Are you sick in your head?"

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,360
"Well, to the gangster! Health."

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,720
The person Strängnäs is gang criminal with connections to the Foxtrot network

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,200
But shootings are not his thing.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,320
This is a real monster. He works with invoices.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,880
He has invoiced Swedish municipalities millions

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59.840
by running family homes. We have looked at two companies in the industry

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
As he has been involved in: Svea Placing and Second Chance.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,680
The family home is thus called "Second Chance".

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,080
Tashed to name a family home after something we associate with mello losers.

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,240
You want the children to get a good start in life.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,200
You should have named it "Congratulations! Direct to Final Family Home AB".

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,720
It would have been a more reasonable name.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,760
But besides the second chance, Strängnäs, the person, did not the city

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32.560
Also the company Svea Placement Journal

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,680
Who works to find homes for vulnerable children.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,520
It feels like that. Gang criminals will decide where the children end up.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,720
Why has the gang entered the family home industry.

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,480
Are they philanthropists? No, they do it for the same reason as this man.

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,480
Ex-politician and Robinson winner is one of several players

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,040
which has entered the lucrative industry.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00.720
His company makes a gross earnings of SEK 30,000 per month and children.

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,160
Still pretty juicy with money. 30,000 per child per month.

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,040
If Jan Emanuel has placed ten children he has casted in 3.5 million

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,240
In just one year. Strängnäs, the person, has realized that this is a cash register.

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,480
They say that the gang criminals lack male role models

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,040
But then a inflated welfare millionaire steps forward

35
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,240
And breastfeeding that role.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,640
But joking aside. It is damn good.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,040
These are children who need help, sometimes protection from the gang environment.

38
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Whose wrong is it that it has become so?

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,520
I think the municipalities have a huge responsibility.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,040
They have undertaken to place these children.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,120
You choose to do so with private players.

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,400
The municipalities again. They have the responsibility, as usual, and cannot take responsibility.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,520
They always do away with themselves, the municipalities.

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,640
But even to be municipalities, this is exceptionally handled.

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01.040
How can they let gang criminals run family home business? Yes, like this:

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,000
Just when Jan Emanuel began his orphanage career, they did it in 2015

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,800
during the refugee crisis. The municipalities were flooded by children in need.

48
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,520
The municipalities did not keep up and Strängnäs, not the city

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
and not Ikea's affordable heating light holder

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,200
Without the person Strängnäs. The person took advantage of this.

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,680
As a specialist at the Swedish Crime Authority says:

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,880
"The checks were deficient. It was difficult to follow up on the efforts."

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Perhaps the municipalities were tricked because Strängnäs had a well -plastered facade.

54
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,440
A few years ago they showed high ambitions

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,560
when they did a real star recruitment.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,960
They hired the recognized skilled socio -economist Johanna Möller.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, the Johanna Möller, the Arboga woman - she who is so child in love.

58
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,400
So Strängnäs on the board and the Arboga woman as manager:

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,200
Could it get worse?

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,280
Now the gang is starting to get into the healthcare system and start health centers

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,120
Warns the Swedish Crime Authority.

62
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,280
We look at it seriously. When health centers are conducted by criminals

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09.440
So we do not get the quality that we need to have in these businesses.

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Exactly, that's where the shortage lies. Gang criminal neglect with quality.

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,200
That is the problem.

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,000
Regardless of quality, you dare not press what you think on the Smiley buttons.

67
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,400
"How satisfied were you?" - Do not know. You put a knife in my thigh.

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
It will be a green old man.

69
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,520
But I think the gang criminals can do wonders with the care queues.

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,520
There is not a disease that not a bullet in the forehead can cure.

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,160
You pay at the checkout. Preferably cash. It's tick with the card machine.
