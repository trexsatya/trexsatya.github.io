1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
It could have been an Alfa Romeo 
but this particular body is really nice.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,960
-Just the idea that you should build one yourself is crazy.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,200
Yes, it wasn't the plan from the beginning...

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,260
...that's the only way to get something so I started.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,760
New week, new episode - let's go!

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
MotorNerd

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,040
Episode 50
I've built it myself.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,340
-Hello!
Hi.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,600
-How are you?
I'm fine.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,020
I changed the headlight so I try get the lid to fit.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,400
I removed the lid and try to fix it now.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,100
-Tell me, what car is it?

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,800
It is a Ferrari F40 replica of a 1988 model.

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,440
I think F40 is the coolest Ferrari so
therefore I want one so I build one.

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,700
-What a car!!

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,760
I have done the whole car myself.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,560
It is a tube frame and the body is made of sheet metal.

18
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,215
I've done everything you see on the car.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,800
-When did you start?

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,820
Hmm, I started already in 2005.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,260
I have done some bits and pieces when there is time.
Which I rarely have had.

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,960
Which all my friends will know.

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,000
The car is an icon for me so it may take the time it needs
I like to spend time in the garage.

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,280
-OMG, have you done everything yourself?

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,320
Yes, I ordered home beams and started making a frame.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,580
Then I made a steel pipe chassis
which I covered with sheet metal.

27
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,780
- Is the whole car a tube frame?
Yes it is.

28
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,360
Then you get the body and chassis as you want it.

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,760
I could buy a car and re-build it but it would
weird because the engine is at the back.

30
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,120
Then you have to buy a Toyota MR2 or Pontiac Fiero
but then the car gets completely wrong in the measurements so it will be no good.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,580
Since you can't buy and F40 chassis.
It's better to do the right thing from the start.

32
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,700
-Yes I understand.
-What a fantastic job you've done.

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,100
It's a lot of work.
-Just the idea that you should build one yourself is completely crazy.

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,260
Yes, it wasn't the plan from the beginning but
that's the only way to get something so I started.

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,540
I have done all sheet metal in this homemade bending machine.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,160
That's the only tool I've used.
A homemade bending machine and a hammer.

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
-You're joking??
No it's all.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,260
-Is it the only one you've used?
Yes, and a knee or tire to bend some sheet metal.

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,500
That's how it is made.
And I created this.

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,280
-Is everything made in sheet metal?
-So it's not a kit-car that you built together?

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,760
No, It's not a kit-car.

42
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,880
I have made my own frame and
built and added the body pieces.

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,240
It is a difficult body to build.
Everything is curved and bent back and forth.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,240
It is sheet metal here and all the way up.

45
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,920
-You can't just look at pictures?
-You must have got the measurements from somewhere.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,740
Yes a friend of mine built a Lamborghini Countach.

47
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,940
And he thought I should build one as well
but I said I wanted an F40 instead.

48
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,540
I had a small Ferrari F40 toy in
scale 1/18th as I measured.

49
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,640
I have the toy in the cupboard over here.

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,620
This is the little car I scaled up from 1:18 to 1:1.

51
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,600
And that's the model I've built after.

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,040
I haven't had any real car so I build from this model.

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,740
- So you've demolished a 1:18 toy car?
Yes exactly.

54
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,400
Then you see how the car looks like in detail.
I have also looked at pictures online.

55
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,100
A few years ago that I got hold of a real car so I could measure it and the dimensions are very good.

56
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,840
-This is totally crazy!
-How many Ferrari F40 are there in Sweden?

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,620
I don't know for sure.
I know that there are 4 but there may be more.

58
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,260
They are hard to find them because they are rarely used.

59
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,900
-How many cars made Ferrari?

60
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:28,380
Ferrari produced a little over 1100 cars but then people have crashed them.
So it's hard to know how many are left.

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,900
-I see you like F40 because you all have
type of toys in this cupboard.

62
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,120
Yes, it have been a couple over the years.

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,360
And I was stumbling on something on the floor.

64
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,260
Yes it's my granddaughters car that she travels in.

65
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,140
It was just a small battery in the beginning.
So she was sad when the battery ran out.

66
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,840
We put in a 100 amp battery from a car so
now she can drive all day if she wants.

67
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,500
-I am completely dumb and do not even know where to start.

68
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,800
-Where do you want us to start?
We can start on the inside.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:23,220
-There is no car you just jump in and out of.
No not directly it is low and tight to get into.

70
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,900
It is very wide edge and high threshold.

71
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:34,680
In here is the frame and it's a crash zone
because there is nothing that receives a hit on the side.

72
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,140
So there is a tube pipe system inside here.

73
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,960
-You are a bit oblique with your legs.
Yes it is a bit like a Saab 900.

74
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,800
It's because the front wheel is right here
and it's similar on the real car with.

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,355
-Italian gorilla driving position.
Exactly!

76
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,000
I made my steering wheel position straight instead.
The original is angled so it feels like you are driving a bus.

77
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,960
This is an OMP steering wheel with flat bottom
so you can fit your legs underneath.

78
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,340
I think the flat bottom steering wheel is better looking.

79
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,240
I bought a Ferrari badge and put that it in the middle.

80
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,080
I have chosen sparco sprint racing seats
which I bought long ago.

81
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,020
I think the racing seats fit well since
the original car also has red chairs.

82
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,800
I have used sabel three point belt.
However, not all pieces are in place at the moment.

83
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,780
Also has regular belts which are
a requirement from the MOT test.

84
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,360
A 6-speed box from an Audi TDI.

85
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,120
-Many who build cars use a TDI gearbox.
Yes, exactly.

86
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,060
TDI gearboxes can withstand much more torque from the engine.

87
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,820
It's a 01E gearbox from an Audi A4.

88
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,780
Carved out metal so it looks an old -80's gear lever.

89
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,460
Yes, exactly.
Previously, I had a regular gear lever but this looks better.

90
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,380
Voltmeter, temp for the cylinders & water temp.

91
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,440
Then it's the usual petrol, oil, speedometer and tachometer.

92
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,060
-What are the buttons under the voltmeter?

93
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,480
It's the fan and the heat.

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,060
There is electric heat because it
There is no water element in the car.

95
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,120
Then you would have to pull a lot of hoses that there is
no room for so it became electric instead.

96
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,500
-Should we have a look at the front?
Yes.

97
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,220
-What are you doing here?

98
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:39,640
I was not satisfied with the headlights.
I'm rebuilding it and hopefully it will look better.

99
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,340
I had to remove the lid so I could change lights.
As you can see, the lid is metal.

100
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,360
When I removed the lid I manage
to scratch the paint so that must be fixed.

101
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,675
-Okey, so you have re-built it so the lids has to be adjusted?

102
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,820
Yes they should fit in and fix some of the plastic.
- Ah, awesome!

103
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,560
This is area is not finished yet.

104
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,620
Overhere, a plate is missing and needs to be fixed and installed.

105
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,980
Plastic fenders is from a truck.

106
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,880
-Okey, plastic fenders is from a truck.
Mounted so there will not be a lot of gravel in here.

107
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,920
-What's hiding behind the black cover plate?

108
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,380
Underneath there is battery, fan to the cabin,
brakes and oil to the clutch.

109
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,780
-Is it the same on a original F40?
It's the same.

110
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,300
-There's no place for a golf bag?

111
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,280
No, normally there is a spare wheel there.
But I chose to skip it.

112
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,280
I could put a spare wheel next to 
the cooler but I don't want to.

113
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:55,240
In the front I have done the same as the Le mans model. 
It has a large intake in the middle.

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,980
I'd rather have Le Mans but still the original front
but I do not want the headlights as original.

115
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,660
Then I chose to mix original and Le mans front.

116
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,360
-Is the cooler right behind the front grill?
Yes.

117
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,060
Then I have chosen to make the hole in the front much larger.
Original is the hole much smaller than this.

118
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,260
I chose to make that hole much larger
so that the air can go through easier.

119
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,380
This means that the car is pushed against the road when driving.

120
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,400
My dad made a fuel cap.
He thought it was unnecessary to buy one.

121
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,740
He made some fuel caps in the lathe that we could use.

122
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,240
-What's the sticker on the rear fender?

123
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,820
It's the same as original F40.

124
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,080
-What does it say? Pininfarina?

125
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,800
Yes it was he who designed
body with Enzo Ferrari.

126
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,460
-How did you get to all angles right?

127
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,820
I first thought it was angular.
But the body is round and bent in all directions.

128
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,020
It has been very difficult to do.

129
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,920
This part consists of a single piece
but this is a lot of small pieces.

130
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,680
Just small pieces so you could get the shape together.

131
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,000
-The door handle.
It's my own design.

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,900
This is actually a lock for a window section.

133
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,260
-What does it matter?
No it works.

134
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,480
-So it looks like the original door handle?
Yes this is how the door handle looks like from Ferrari.

135
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,460
-Put your finger here to open.
Yes exactly.

136
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,920
-Is this car finished?

137
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,820
No, it will never be finished.
I'm a little bit picky and always want to rebuild things.

138
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:47,060
Have always tried to build with cheap parts.
But then you find something better which is more expensive and I have to replace it.

139
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,440
The car runs and everything works.

140
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,740
TO BE CONTINUED.
Unfortunately, that's all for this time.
You will see the rest in the next episode.

141
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,000
But until then comment, subscribe and like!
See ya!

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
-What does the rear lights cost?

143
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,980
Oh, they cost 500 USD each when I bought them.

144
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,820
-You're joking!! That's 2000 USD for 4pcs.
Hmm, Yes...

145
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,580
Motornörd = engine geek literally 
but petrolhead is probably more correct.

146
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,180
More episodes will be translated to 
English in the near future.

147
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,700
