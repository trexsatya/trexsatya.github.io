1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,240
Right now, life isn't like it usually is.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,200
Many of our activities are being cancelled 
and it's easy to get disheartened.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,880
Uncertainty can make us 
lethargic and restless.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,000
Maybe you're wondering 
how things will be in a few weeks-

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,720
-or feeling disappointed 
about what you're missing.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
Feeling listless or depressed 
is hardly strange.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,680
With a little creativity, we can adjust 
our plans to fit the situation-

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,880
-and in this way, regain our energy.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,520
If you play basketball, and team practice 
is cancelled for a while-

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,480
-go outside and play anyway.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,680
Maybe you can't play in your gym 
or with your team-

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,920
-but you can get a teammate 
and play on an outdoor court.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,800
Besides being fun, we feel better 
when we're physically active.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,120
Exercise and physical activity increase 
serotonin levels, which regulate mood.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,680
This means you feel less stressed 
and happier after physical activity.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,680
Many feel sad they can't see people 
in a risk group, or who have symptoms-

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,200
-but you can still hang out 
without meeting in person.

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,800
If a friend, or Grandpa, can't go out, 
make a video call.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,760
-Hi, Laura! 
-How's it going?

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,080
Seeing the people we miss 
can also help us feel better.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,480
Times are strange, but one tip for feeling 
better and having more energy-

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,760
-is to keep doing things you think are fun.

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,400
For example, talk to your friends, 
read a book, play video games or draw.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,160
Keep your strength up 
by eating regularly.

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,160
Keep up your routines. Wake up 
and go to bed at your normal times-

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,640
-so you get enough sleep. 
Then things will seem much easier.
