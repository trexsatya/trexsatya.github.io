1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,000
Jacob, will it be too much to say that I am their best friend during the high school choice?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,900
Yeah, because it's not you.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,900
Right just that.
 Because it is high school.
 Yes.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,900
Warm welcome to the first section of High School.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,200
During three whole sections we will guide you through the high school elevator jungle.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,500
We have invited a bunch of experts to help us with this.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,050
We start this journey by talking to Linnéa who is a study and career counselor.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,000
She will help us with where to really start.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,500
We also have Adrian and My here.
 Previous high school elements to share their experiences.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,700
We're running!

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,700
A warm welcome here Linnéa.
 What fun you want to join.

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,800
Yes, will be great fun.

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,000
You work as a study and career counselor.
 What is the most fun thing about your job?

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,900
The most fun thing about my job is getting to work with people in change, in positive change.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,000
I work on informing but also to challenge the students in their thoughts and perceptions about the high school choice.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,100
And it's very fun to see that process from start to finish.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
I understand that.
 You really get to influence their decision.
 Very important.

18
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:21,700
We have received some questions from ninth graders who need your help.
 We will start by looking at the first.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,300
Hi, Markus is my name.
 How do you get started with the high school choice?
 There is so much to choose from.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,600
Exactly, where should you really start?
 There is so much to choose from.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,400
Yes, it really does.
 Many people find it difficult to start and do not know at all what to start with.
 Neither school nor programs.

22
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,300
I usually give them the advice to start with what they do not want.
 Most people usually have a good idea of this.

23
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,800
Smart to reverse it instead.

24
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,300
Exactly, and start funnel down.
 I don't want to go to that school.
 I am not interested in that program.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
And in this way, get down the search width a bit.

26
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:01,800
Is there any other tip, when you have come to the conclusion which you do not want?

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,100
When you start to tread, and remove schools and programs, then the supply will not be as great.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Then you can start there by reading.

29
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,700
And maybe find something that you feel feels fun.

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,400
Just.

31
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,400
What is important to find out about different schools before deciding?

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,700
What you have to start with is, do I want a big school?
 Or do I want a small school?
 Should it be municipal or private?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,850
Itinerary, schedule.
 Do you have a dining room or food card.
 And so on.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,200
A common concern in students can be: will the high school choice affect your entire future?

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,800
How decisive would you say that it is?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,300
You have to have with you that high school is a basic education no matter what program you go and what school you attend.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,300
It is a basic education and it is definitely not vital.
 Most people change direction several times over.

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,200
Nice to bring it with you.
 You can always change or do something else forward.
 Exactly, great.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,900
Are there any common questions that you usually get from students?

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,300
Yes, a common question is about finding a school where you fit.
 And that is subjective.

41
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,000
What does it mean to fit in?
 I think you should think more about interest.

42
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:23,800
If you choose something that you are interested in then you meet like -minded people and then you fit in.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,700
You may not have to go so much on the template but more interest.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,800
We have one more question from a ninth -grader.
 We look at it.

45
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,900
For example, if you want to become a doctor, what choice do you have?

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, if then wants to become a doctor, is there any special program that you should choose then?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,400
It depends a little.
 Do you think you should go straight, directly from high school to the university,

48
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,800
Then it is scientific or technical where you can bring the eligibility to search directly.

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,100
Then you have to bring with you to the medical line, it is one of the most difficult education to get into.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,500
It's almost maximum points.

51
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,500
If you go nature and technology, which can be quite difficult training, then you may not get the maximum ratings.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,300
Then it is difficult to get in anyway.
 Even if you have the authority.

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
So the most tactical thing is to go the program where you can get the absolute best rating

54
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,150
And bring with it a grade that is competitive.

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,200
And then read to a base year or similar to obtain the eligibility.

56
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:33,300
So to again choose what you think is fun and thus make easier to learn and actually get high grades.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,300
So that the correct or straight road may not always be the best for you.

58
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:47,500
Right.
 You have to think about it.
 Most people do not go a straight path, even if you think it when you are 15.

59
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,200
And you might regret it.
 Then it is good to be competitive for more education than just the medical line.

60
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,200
Exactly, to broaden their choices.
 Thanks!

61
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:05,900
There are a lot of difficult words linked to the high school choice.
 We will pick up the notice board.

62
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,800
To see if you can help us find out what they really mean.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,300
(Whistling)

64
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,800
Wow!

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,900
Right!
 We start with the first word.
 It is a real tongue switch.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,500
Much like six salmon in salmon box.

67
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,200
It is: "High Secondary subjects".
 What does it mean?

68
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,200
The upper secondary school subjects are the theoretical subjects that you read on all high school programs.

69
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,400
It is common to all the programs.

70
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,900
Type like math?

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,900
Matte, Swedish, English, sports, religion.

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It was easier to understand that way.
 Then we run the next word.

73
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,000
"Program focus" is very often mentioned.
 What does it really mean?

74
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,700
Program focus is the in -depth study within the framework of your program.

75
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
First you choose a program and then you also choose an orientation.

76
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,100
Just that, for example, there is the community program that is the program,

77
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,000
And then there are slightly different recesses that you can choose under it.

78
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,400
This one then?
 Completely incomprehensible.
 There are two words for that.

79
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,600
One is "student for a day" or "shading".
 Have you heard of it?

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,200
It is the upper secondary schools that offer students at the elementary school to come and test on being a student for a day.

81
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,800
Just as it sounds.
 You have to walk next to a student at lessons and lunch to see what it would be like to go to school.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And shading is the same.
 This means shadowing a student and following it all day.

83
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,000
I understand, you get a shadow after you.

84
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,300
But it can be a great idea if you are not so sure of your choice.
 To test in one day.

85
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes, great, great.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Last then.
 "High school work", what is it?

87
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,700
At all high school programs you do a high school work at the end of the third.

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,300
And it is an in -depth work within the framework of the program you read.

89
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,900
If you read the community program, you make a slightly larger social science in -depth work.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, but do you do it on both vocational preparation and college preparatory programs?

91
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,700
Yes, you do this on all the programs, but on the vocational preparation it can be a practical job.

92
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
And at the university preparatory, it is always a theoretical work.

93
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,200
Okay.
 Thank you for being with today, great fun!

94
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
Thanks.

95
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,200
(Whistling)

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,400
We go ahead and welcome Adrian and My.
 What fun to have you here.

97
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,800
Many thanks.
 Thank you for being here.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,300
You have both previously made a high school choice.
 Now it was a bunch of years ago that you took the student.

99
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,200
Do you remember what it was like to make your high school choice?

100
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes, I really do.
 It was not an easy decision.
 But I still landed in something that I am happy today.

101
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,900
How fun.
 What did you think Adrian, was it difficult?

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,500
Well, that's it.
 The most difficult thing was to first understand the difference between all the programs and schools,

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Understand which one would choose and why.
 There were many difficult decisions in a fairly short time.
 It aroused many thoughts.

104
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,400
And confusion in many cases too.

105
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Which program did you choose then?

106
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,200
I ultimately chose technology, but it was a long time between economics and technology.

107
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Why did you just choose technology end?

108
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,900
It felt like a broad education where I would get a lot of knowledge that could help me whatever I wanted to read.

109
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,350
I always had a plan to walk the financial track but after I did some investigations

110
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,100
So I got the information that I could walk the financial track even if I read the technology program.

111
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,200
Which gave me pretty broad choices and it felt like a safe alternative to go.

112
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,900
Fun to get your interest as well.
 Absolutely.

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,700
Which program did you choose my?

114
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,300
I chose to read the community program.

115
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,700
Was it an easy choice?

116
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,100
No it really wasn't.

117
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,300
I venered right into the last and I remember I changed the last hour before the deadline.

118
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,100
Oh!
 It was tight.

119
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,100
Yes indeed.
 It was precisely because I wanted something that was broad.

120
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,350
Which program did you stand and chose when you then changed your mind to community?

121
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,300
I chose between society and nature.

122
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:26,800
It was because nature has certain courses that you have to have in order to be allowed to read a doctor or so.

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,900
But then it was also a lot of peer pressure, what others chose.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,900
I felt that if I choose nature then it is just because most others that I was with it.

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,200
Lucky you went after your own liking end.

126
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,000
What have you been doing since the student Adrian?

127
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:52,000
I actually started a company during my studies.
 When I was nine but then it started during high school.

128
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,200
So already in one in high school I had companies, which I still run today.

129
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,100
Today I have about three companies I run.
 On a daily basis.

130
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,700
Fun!
 Is it the technology track or?

131
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,200
It actually is.
 I thought, when I started the technology program,

132
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,400
That I would become a programmer and sit and tap code.

133
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,300
But realized that it wasn't my thing those pieces.
 But gained enough understanding to understand how IT works.

134
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,600
And what it actually means.
 Which makes me run IT companies at present, but I do not do any programming myself.

135
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,200
Without driving more sales track, which became my thing.
 But has gained an incredible amount of knowledge from the studies.

136
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,600
Then you have really benefited from your education but maybe in a different way what was thinking from the beginning.

137
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,900
Absolutely.
 It wasn't quite as I had imagined, but it resolved anyway.

138
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,000
What have you been doing since the student?

139
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:40,300
After the student, I was probably one of many who didn't really know what they wanted to do.

140
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Then I worked as a substitute, in a substitute pool, around various schools in the municipality where I worked.

141
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,500
How fun.
 Yes, it was really fun.
 Then I want to continue with this track.

142
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,900
I wanted to do something broad because I didn't know what I wanted to work on.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Then I started reading the School of Economics at Lund University.
 And today I work as a marketing coordinator.

144
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,650
You told me during the coffee break that today you are also a mentor to a guy who is studying at college today.

145
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,300
What are you doing then?

146
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:24,400
It is a mentoring network that Lund University has organized.
 Students who are in the middle of their studies get a mentor.

147
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,700
I get to act his ball board during the studies.

148
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,900
How cool.
 Are you happy with your choice of programs like this afterwards?

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,300
Yes, I would definitely say that.
 Yes indeed.

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,500
Do you have any tips Adrian, to those who will start high school now?

151
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,000
I think it is very important that you do not put all the focus on just the studies, even though they are very important.

152
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,300
But I think it is very important also that you preserve a leisure activity, hobby or other interest.

153
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,100
And actually spend time with friends and do things you think is fun too.

154
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,200
It is easy to just snow in on the studies and get tired or get stuck and then suddenly it goes worse.

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,500
Dare to do what you think is fun and go a little your own way outside the plug too.
 I think that is very important.

156
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Great tips.
 There are really three fun years to take advantage of, their high school time.
 Really.

157
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,900
My, would you say in retrospect that your choice of program or school was vital?

158
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Well, I really wouldn't.
 There are many ways to go.

159
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,100
Wonderful to hear.
 Thank you very much for being with you today and sharing your experiences.

160
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,800
Many thanks.
 Thanks.

161
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Big thanks for looking today.

162
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,200
In the end, we offer some high school students' best tips for you to make your choice.

163
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,100
See you in the next section.

164
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,400
Before I started high school, I had wished someone told me that it will be quite like elementary school.

165
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,400
But that more responsibility lies with yourself than with teachers and parents.

166
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,200
Because it is a little longer days and you have to have more responsibility and try to catch the plug.

167
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,800
I had wished someone told me that it is not at all dangerous to start high school.

168
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,300
You are obviously nervous before but it is something that disappears immediately when you get there.

169
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,400
For everyone is new and everyone is nervous and there is no danger.

170
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,450
I would have liked to be aware that it is important to put all the powder in the beginning and all the way through.

171
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Since the grades you receive even in grade one are something that will remain all the way out.

172
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,400
So that you are not waiting to save everything in the last second.
