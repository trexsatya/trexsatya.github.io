1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,520
I'm going to build a camper and do it with a different approach.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07.269
Like to be a little inventor and generally crazy

3
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:10,119
So I've gone all in on crazy ideas.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,421
Hello Hello! Hello Hello.

5
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:19,116
How's it going?

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,250
Very good! It is really good.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,359
How's the construction going?

8
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:24,579
It goes according to plan.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,190
It is a lot.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,199
There are many loose threads to be tied together.

11
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:30,809
But it flows nicely.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32.569
Last time I was here you were waiting for some stuff.

13
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,510
Have you been able to reach things?

14
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,640
A very central part of the whole is energy manufacturing.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,810
I have both solar panels, I have received inverter

16
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,120
And we've got the battery pack.

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48.560
So now I'm ready to mount it and get unlimited energy in the car.

18
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:49,980
What a big they were.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,610
Of course, there are special dimensions on them.

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,170
Don't surprise me at all, I should say.

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:00.650
50 millimeters to good on total length on the truck so tight

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,530
as the determining measure.

23
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06.010
Then I have about 15 centimeters in width on each side.

24
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:10,500
Besides that, it is absolutely the whole roof will be covered.

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,868
There are six panels, each panel is 430 watts.

26
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:18,720
Just over two and a half kilowatt electricity production, which is about three times

27
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,873
As much as I will need is my guess.

28
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,000
I will have excess energy.

29
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:28,666
I can help charge electric cars on the journey.

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,800
It may be needed today with today's gasoline prices.

31
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:33,234
Yeah!

32
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,550
Solar panels have arrived, they are ready to be mounted

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,739
and i have also received my special batteries

34
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:41,839
As I have been waiting for a long time.

35
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,839
It is LifePo4 is called the chemistry, but it is

36
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:52.919
The safest battery variety and they are terribly efficient.

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59.069
Since then you have a digital display showing charging status

38
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:01.889
on it and the digital values on it.

39
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:07,900
This one weighs 17 kg I think.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,589
Not more?

41
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12.029
17 kilos battery of 300 amps.

42
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,199
To with these four times twelve 48 vault

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,889
Then we will have 14 kilowatt hours of energy storage.

44
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:27,059
It's a half Nissan Leaf electric car in battery pack so I have a good excess

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,860
Although it is pouring rain and bad weather so I can run induction hobs

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,669
And AC so on.

47
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,360
But they can't be free on the batteries.

48
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,690
No, they weren't even almost free.

49
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42.419
But it is such a central part.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,059
Water production and energy production are the heart of the entire system.

51
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:52,739
It refuses compromise with without it are the two areas

52
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:58.029
Which stands out most and is most interesting to explore.

53
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,740
The purpose of a large test center.

54
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,270
What the life span then?

55
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:10,261
4000 charging bikes are the batteries guaranteed to hold.

56
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:17,319
It is from 0 to 100 % on 4000 occasions and would you run empty them every day

57
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,419
So it's 4000 days.

58
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:25,639
But 365 is 10, 12, 15 years maybe if you empty every day.

59
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,410
I will pick out 30 % of them so it is basically endless.

60
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,679
What the other small batteries? What is that?

61
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:37,039
It is a parallel project I am doing.

62
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,169
Thought about telling a lot about when I parallel to this building

63
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,000
In the process of building your own electric mop.

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,339
I have to have something with me when I go out and travel, so I have

65
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,020
The small batteries are even easier.

66
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,559
Five kilos, weighs nothing.

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02.518
And is on 40 amps.

68
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:08,050
It is a hefty battery bank.

69
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,190
My goal is to have ten 12-15 miles range at Elmoppe,

70
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,950
Because it will be my general transport when I have parked the car.

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,209
Have you set up GoPro camera now?

72
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:24,179
Yes, it's the first test now on my panoramic window

73
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,750
that I will use.

74
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,769
I need a high -resolution image to make

75
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:34,100
a credible, create a credible window and it has discovered

76
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,750
That GoPro cameras work great.

77
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:42,739
But the modern ones are not suitable so I get back down in age

78
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,250
And I bought a used on the block.

79
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:50,509
GoPro 7 Black is exactly the model I need

80
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:56,359
Because it is the only thing I manage to find that has HDMI exit.

81
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:01,350
It is also used as webcams, high quality webcams

82
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,100
GoPro 7 will be my eye out into the world.

83
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,489
And so I have OLED TV, 4K OLED TV to create a picture.

84
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,000
That is just a test.

85
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,250
First, will be recessed on the back of the truck wall

86
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:20,170
so it will only appear a pinch head

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,239
Like a fly on the side of the wall side of the truck.

88
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,570
Then it becomes a permanent power cable into USB-C

89
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:35,940
So that the current and HDMI were constantly underway, so to speak.

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,179
But not film but just live it, so to speak directly to the TV.

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,040
Should we go in and check.

92
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,140
See how far I have reached the building,

93
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,290
Oh yeah.

94
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52.440
I have come quite a long way.

95
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,350
Yes, I have received the structure with the interior

96
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:05,329
So all the rough building is clear and a little finely left.

97
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,131
Then it is the next step to draw in all the water and all the electricity

98
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:17,589
So I have a friend who is an electrician who will help me gross it

99
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,920
And then I take here a licensed electrician for connection so to speak

100
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,459
I do not want to drive the electricity myself, but I will leave it.

101
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,850
What is this cardboard boxes?

102
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,196
It's version two of my 3D cork.

103
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:41,290
It is a wall decoration that is a pressed cork surface.

104
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,119
If I turn it on, it is the usual traditional cork,

105
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:48,459
Although they have a 3D look on it.

106
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,559
I have tried to gray it.

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Ok, is the standard that is?

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,339
The natural colored just so it is stained once

109
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,190
and stained twice.

110
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,133
So this will be my wall structure inside the truck.

111
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,000
Partly you get a better sound, less echo in it

112
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:12,779
And you get a warmer feeling.

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,040
Plus it is a bit cool with a 3D effect.

114
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:16,519
It is not as thick either.

115
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:21,320
No, the other was interesting pattern, but it was twelve millimeters thick

116
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:26,130
and that made cabinets gaps to open it collides with it

117
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,190
So it doesn't really work in reality.

118
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,959
This one is only four millimeters thick so it is much more manageable.

119
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,040
The whole purpose of the inside is to be minimalist.

120
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,140
Everything should be there, but nothing should be seen.

121
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,989
I have a fold -out induction hob, I will have built -in

122
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:49,549
Pantry etc etc. Everything will be there,

123
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:54,790
But it will be hidden behind a 15 cm false wall.

124
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,589
So what I'm building now is the need for my spaces.

125
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,399
Then I will cover it with a three millimeter MDF

126
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,470
and on it I put a 3D cork so you get a completely smooth, neutral

127
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,079
3D cork wall.

128
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,682
But there you have all the functionality built into the wall.

129
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:23,089
Here becomes a knife and spice shelf.

130
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,079
This will be the big one will be the electrical cabinet, because it belongs to the inverter

131
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,239
to the solar cell plant.

132
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,159
The whole of the floor to ceiling is a pantry

133
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:36,260
so there will be plenty of space at the back over the bed

134
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:39,863
So I will have a joint -lit European map.

135
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:42,610
And on the map i fold out so that when i sit

136
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,233
and make your own youtube movies so i have a good backdrop

137
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52.845
So that it is also bedside tables with the alarm clock and other things.

138
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:55,740
So that all that wall will be smoking

139
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,650
With built -in features.

140
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02.030
I have some Kalle Anka's Christmas Eve on a caravan holiday.

141
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04.409
I have that as the role model.

142
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08.719
Always have to have at least two different functions, preferably three.

143
00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:11.309
But you have elevated the floor? Yes.

144
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:13,520
We can look at it.

145
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,359
I have an elevated floor partly.

146
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,470
Biggest reason is that I wanted a huge storage space

147
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,940
Below the double floor is 25 centimeters high and very spacious,

148
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:33,710
So I have two half a meter long and 25 centimeters high and one meter wide.

149
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,250
Stuff that I don't use as often or that is very bulky

150
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:39,349
is perfect to be able to store.

151
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,229
The perfect opportunity to collect things.

152
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:46,820
I will have more space than I need when I'm done.

153
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,729
A pleasant problem to have in a camper.

154
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,600
Winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter.

155
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,520
And a snowboard.

156
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:58,860
If I want to go out and go and there are always things to fill with.

157
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01.711
A little bigger things they hide under the bed?

158
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,770
Yes, the bed is the garage.

159
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:09,679
There you have the biggest stuff, type of electric mop and big bulky things.

160
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,800
Then you have medium -sized things I will have 2 pieces

161
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,805
Under the stomach of the truck between the wheel axles.

162
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:25,575
There I have partly the battery system and partly I will have hose

163
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:28,190
And collapsible ladder you need.

164
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,440
So there we also have a lot of storage space.

165
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:33,020
And then I have the double floor.

166
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:38,880
It is three and a half meters of wall section with shelves as well

167
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,380
So I have a lot of spaces.

168
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:42,355
But what about the cabinets on the outside then?

169
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:46,472
The boxes are ordered, but they have been delayed.

170
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,320
It's still two months left before I go away

171
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:54,140
So I'm not too worried yet, but it would have been good to get them here now.

172
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:58,590
You have so much left to do so I don't know how to get it in 2 months.

173
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00.590
I do not get it.

174
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04.027
When I sleep in the box so I am close to work,

175
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:09,599
But it is seven days in a week so that it will go. I refuse to give up.

176
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,559
How can it come here?

177
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:16,050
An example is that when building custom stuff

178
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,150
So it takes a little longer.

179
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:24,020
This shelf system is ready for the separation toilet

180
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:26,609
And it needs it.

181
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,860
Then I have a fresh water tank and gray water tank

182
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,340
So that's why this is removed.

183
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,520
If it in turn, you have every centimeter,

184
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:42,366
is specially built to accommodate it and get the need you need

185
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,440
So when it is out of the picture.

186
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:53,450
I have a 20 liter fresh water, tank and a 100 liter gray water tank.

187
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,360
They are in place.

188
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,280
It was tight but according to the calculation.

189
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:06,330
The function is that condensation water from AC flows down

190
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,140
in the tank or fresh water tank.

191
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:11,260
And from there I pick the water.

192
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,430
And would the situation be the humidity that controls it

193
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,750
So I have no fixed figure on how much is produced varies from day to day

194
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:23,849
and land to country.

195
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:28,770
But should it over produce, I have a transfer protection,

196
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:35,274
So if produced, it runs directly from the water tank into the gray water tank.

197
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,030
What I need is a safe system that works in all situations.

198
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,580
I thought of another thing.

199
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,430
At first I thought it was hand spruce holder this,

200
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,290
But this is water.

201
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:52,010
That is an extra bonus if you want to cool

202
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:54,109
or room -temperature water.

203
00:12:54,429 --> 00:13:00.809
So that's why you have a small two liter campsite

204
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,919
Containers so it goes into it first.

205
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:08.869
You can pick out fresh drinking water right away and that in turn

206
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,630
Delivers it to fresh water the tank.

207
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:14,260
And you do this because you don't want hot water to drink

208
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,200
No, just all that is picked from fresh water tank

209
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:23,765
will go through the heater so it won't have hot or cold water

210
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:26,679
The main part will go to disk, shower and so on.

211
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,640
Will be 37 degree water and that would like to drink

212
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:35,109
So that's why I take the little idea for it.

213
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,530
How many hours did this take?

214
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,789
Not so many hours, but many attempts.

215
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,270
It was very much cut and cut away, add and change.

216
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:46,406
It was funny.

217
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:51,790
First version in the box is a sharp test

218
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,520
of space.

219
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:54,690
What do we need and so on.

220
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:59,419
It is, I discovered that I can pull down it ten centimeters. 80 wide instead of 90.

221
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05.309
Then I also get a decimeter longer kitchen counter.

222
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:08.808
I learn a lot to live in the box.

223
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,180
So there are very small adjustments have done that have been valuable

224
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
on version two point zero.

225
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,619
You come a long way I think.

226
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,220
You have opened the bed too.

227
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,330
Everything is relative, I have come a long way but I have a bit left.

228
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,169
Another thing that has been changed compared to version 1.0

229
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:27,289
is that I have made a more generous bed.

230
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,020
In there the idea was to have a 120 bed

231
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:35,119
Because I thought the corridor between becomes claustrophobic, getting too narrow.

232
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:39,430
But I discovered that it works just fine so the more generous

233
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,530
Will be a 140 bed instead.

234
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,860
So a big nice bed.

235
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,099
And besides, the garage becomes corresponding to larger

236
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:52,789
So these are the details you learn when you live in it.

237
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,200
That I can draw.

238
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,760
I can do a drawing in CAD and you get the right measure.

239
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:02,280
But when you deliver it so one gets the feeling of

240
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,750
That it does not feel crowded and that it works in everyday life.

241
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07.800
Shop even more stuff now?

242
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,440
This is actually something that I have been thinking a great deal

243
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:11,670
on how I would solve it.

244
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15.609
The platform that I fold down is my balcony

245
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,360
And it has been remote controlled.

246
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:25,140
Via a remote control only, but it must have a winch system

247
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:28,500
that winch it up and all the winches are watching

248
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:33,229
Are very nice and great and oversized for this wall.

249
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:38,217
The platform weighs 180 kilos and then we are in at 4, 5, 6, 7 tons

250
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,460
How can I get hold of a smaller winch?

251
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,420
And then I got a flash.

252
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,470
It is quad bikes to ATV winch so I checked it up

253
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:53,004
And have bought a mini winch which is absolutely perfect.

254
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,444
So this winch is classified for nine hundred kilos.

255
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:01.309
So a nine hundred kilos electric winch with remote

256
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:05.797
is the one who will lift the door.

257
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,720
So this will be a good solution.

258
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12.865
What I did was I removed the cable that came with

259
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:14,700
and i have drilled up the bracket

260
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,809
Instead, I will have a 6 millimeter line.

261
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,750
So this system will slip in running blocks

262
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,359
And lift up and lower the door.

263
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,250
Have you tried Tajma also how long it will take?

264
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,010
Yes.

265
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,950
Nor unexpectedly.

266
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,989
Must, but I have to test that bit too.

267
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,910
In my head I have one one wish of between fifteen

268
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,530
and thirty seconds to fold up and fold down.

269
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,490
Still it will feel scary and slower

270
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,830
Then you will be crazy and wait.

271
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,450
So I will run this 12 volt win in 24 volts.

272
00:16:57,353 --> 00:17:02,030
Since there is such a short load so no risk of burning the engine.

273
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,560
But with 24 volts it goes so fast

274
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,070
so that I have twenty seconds speed on it so

275
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,030
Then I just end up in the perfect range.

276
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:14,140
Besides, I drive by the truck being in 24 volts

277
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,030
So it becomes easy to drive directly from the truck's batteries.

278
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,000
Do you know, I will let you continue working because you have a lot to do.

279
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

280
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,250
So I look past a little later and then we'll see how things are going for you.

281
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,170
It sounds good. You are very welcome.

282
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,890
See ya!

283
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:29,489
Hello!
