00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,864
Earn Now I'm back again with a video about my investments

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,168
There are quite a few of you who are interested

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,776
As many as 3,500 of us are subscribers to the channel

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,312
It's totally sick

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:18,944
And that many of you are curious about how I invest and how I think with my portfolio

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,760
So in this video, I thought I'm going through mine

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,064
Finance type or how I.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
Structures up

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,368
My portfolio

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,672
And for those of you who are new here, my name is

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Marcus Lindblad

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
I run SparaCash

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
and SparaCash.se is

14
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,072
a website I started four years ago

15
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:39,680
And with goals and to teach beginners how to invest in stocks, mutual funds,

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704
And much more

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,264
And that is exactly what we are going to go into

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
In this video

19
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,616
I think a little short so I will give an overview

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,432
To you about what it looks like how I think

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Every month

22
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Around my money simply

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
So

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
Every month

25
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
I kind of have not

26
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,160
Keep an eye on my finances if I am to be honest

27
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,488
So money is not that fun!

28
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
So it's fun to have money

29
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,352
But it's not so fun to sit and measure every number

30
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,448
and count on every single sausage but what I do

31
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,032
It is that I have a document, a so-called "spreadsheet" as it is called.

32
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,360
And in this spreadsheet or yes

33
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
Exceldocument

34
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,456
So I enter exactly how much each month

35
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
my money is worth it

36
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
This takes just over a quarter of an hour

37
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
Much like me

38
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
do every month

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
Then I enter

40
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,696
How much money do I have on Avanza

41
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
How much money do I have on Savelend

42
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,280
How much money do I have in my savings account at the bank

43
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,840
How much money do I have in Bitcoin

44
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
All these different parts I enter and update

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
To keep track of what it's worth right now.

46
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,592
So that I get an overview of approximately how much money I have in different places

47
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,176
But also what it is that increases and what it is that decreases in value.

48
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,552
Because then I know if I should put in a little more money somewhere else

49
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
And yes then we come in

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
My portfolio and my rules

51
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,488
And I usually have as a small rule of thumb like that

52
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Just over

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
80%

54
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Out of all

55
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Money I have

56
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
80% of all my money I try to have invested

57
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
So that they increase in value or them

58
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
May work in any case

59
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
And that is my long-term investment

60
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
In for example

61
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
Stocks, mutual funds and cryptocurrencies and such

62
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,960
That's about 80% of my total personal finances

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,808
20%

64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
The remaining part (20%) is for more short-term savings.

65
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,768
Short-term This means that they do not have to lie Cash or in cash in the mattress

66
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,632
It could be that I have them in a savings account with a little interest or I invest them in

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,472
P2P loan on Savelend or Mintos or something else

68
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
And it's simply money

69
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,896
Who is a little safer who may not have such a high risk if it is the case that I want

70
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Put them in

71
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,504
Shares in case the stock market goes down a lot or I vettifan ...

72
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,112
The refrigerator may break and then you can have some money there to use

73
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
In case, yes, unforeseen events simply happen!

74
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
So if we start from the bottom

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,816
And then we start with the most boring, that is, the short-term

76
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,352
Then I drive on one

77
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Savings account with interest

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,936
And then the complete bank has a savings account

79
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,776
with 0.85% interest (right now)

80
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
per year

81
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
It's not that much but it's still more than you

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
get in a regular savings account

83
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
In other words

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
At the bank, you usually get 0% interest today, so it is good that you use it, perhaps completely, for example

85
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
or Avanza bank which also has (savings account with interest)

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
And there you can also unlock the money

87
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
on complete, there is no binding time

88
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
without

89
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
No, as you can get the money

90
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,391
Anytime but on Avanza

91
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,656
so you can also unlock the money but I do not like to unlock mine

92
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Savings without

93
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
They want me to lie there moving if I need to take them off

94
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
Then I also have a little bit in it

95
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Peer to peer loans

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
At Savelend

97
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
and on Mintos

98
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
And yes it is so that you invest in credit

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
And myself

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Personally consider

101
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,648
Investing in private loans and credits has a slightly lower risk than the stock market

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
I think that

103
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,000
Where I invest in those, it is reliable

104
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
And it's not as shaky as having the money on the stock market, for example

105
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
So I consider it my little one

106
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Short-term buffer savings

107
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,983
where I may not need to take off right now

108
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
But in case I urgently need money

109
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
So I would rather take from there than my shares

110
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
And then we have

111
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
the meaty part of my portfolio

112
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,503
And that is then my investments in

113
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,575
Shares, mutual funds and cryptocurrencies, &amp; other goodies

114
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:45,183
So I'm gonna jump into my little portfolio here now

115
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
And then we'll look

116
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
What I have for good

117
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
in good

118
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
So in my long-term portfolio

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
It exists right now

120
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
out of four shares

121
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,751
It's Castellum, Mycronic,

122
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
It's Plejd

123
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
and that's Sinch

124
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Then I have some funds

125
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,503
And then I have Avanza World Tech by TIN, BGF World Technology

126
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
DNB

127
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Technology

128
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Jpm China

129
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
Spiltan equity fund investment company

130
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Spiltan Small Company Fund

131
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
Swedbank Robur new technology and TIN New Technology

132
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,863
So right now what will be the eight funds This is my long-term portfolio

133
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,191
I try to hold the shares a little longer

134
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,440
So I do not go in and poke so much

135
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:35,103
Without being allowed to lie there and indulge if I think so

136
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
that they are in a positive trend or whatever you say

137
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
So they go up

138
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
Then they can lie there

139
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,551
I trick the funds a little more often

140
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,927
I always have a monthly saving of SEK 1,000 a month that goes directly into the funds

141
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
And sometimes if I feel that yes but now the funds have gone well

142
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
And I need to buy some more shares

143
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
or I WANT to buy a little more shares

144
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,167
Then maybe I will sell some fund that I think has not gone as well as I expected

145
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
And then I buy more shares

146
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
And then during the year I deposit

147
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
a slightly larger amount to when I buy shares

148
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Yes, but then I want to buy

149
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
for a slightly larger amount than I do in mutual funds

150
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,223
Funds, there are hundreds of notes that go into each fund

151
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,343
these are not such large sums, but in the shares I may trade for SEK 1,000 up to SEK 5,000

152
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
More than So if it is that I feel

153
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
that I want as well

154
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,839
Then I have an experiment account that I started with

155
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
And that's my endowment insurance

156
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
Foreign endowment insurance

157
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
And here I have then

158
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
thought

159
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,871
That I will invest in dividend shares and that has probably been the case

160
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
I have three shares there right now and that is Cibus

161
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,527
Innovative Industrial Properties

162
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,040
And Realty Income Corp

163
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
These are the 3 shares I have in there

164
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
So now we come to the part where we talk about the middle ground

165
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,279
What I have done through the ages so I have only bought cryptocurrencies for fun

166
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,143
Because I think it's interesting to keep track of

167
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,007
So I have a little bit of a slur in cryptocurrencies just because it's fun

168
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
And exciting if it goes up or down

169
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,151
And then I used two brokers called Binance

170
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
and Coinbase

171
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Coinbase to buy Bitcoin on

172
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,240
and Binance to buy shitcoins as we call them

173
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,415
Generally speaking, with my investments I do it mostly to

174
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
I think it's funny

175
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
And money that you do not need they think I should grow

176
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
And is it the case that you have money

177
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
on their savings account (with 0% interest) they lose in value because we have inflation and we get no interest on the money

178
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
So prices are rising

179
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
And the value of yours

180
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Decreases when you have them in a savings account

181
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Precisely in kronor, they may not

182
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Goes down

183
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
but because prices are rising

184
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
and you do not get any interest on your money

185
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
So in the long run

186
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Then it will be like that

187
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391
Your money loses value

188
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:01,279
In times like these when the stock market has gone up quite a lot even though we have a pretty

189
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Shaky year (2020)

190
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,399
Well then maybe I'm a little more passive or right now I'm a little more passive

191
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
I stock up on a little more savings

192
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,847
If it is so that it shakes a little, so that you can jump in and fish a little at the bottom

193
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:21,759
It is very rare to hit the bottom, but it is still good to dare to buy when others are worried

194
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
and sells

195
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
when it is at its reddest on the stock market that is when you should actually buy

196
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
for that is when you make real bargains as well

197
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
And that's how I think

198
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
Quite a few complicate this so much

199
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
and make it so cumbersome for themselves

200
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,471
it is not that difficult to invest your money and you do not have to understand everything

201
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
But it's enough to have a sense of what

202
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,560
Type you invest in

203
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,615
you do not have to think so much more than that

204
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Without having a savings

205
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Which you always activate every month

206
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Make money all the time

207
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
And that's what I do

208
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
late

209
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
Do not bother about it so much but it is more important to

210
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
you are actually saving money

211
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
than that you try as well as that yes

212
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Bargain and find something

213
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Super good company

214
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Like here and there

215
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
which will give you triple the money in one month is very rarely done

216
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
Without it in the long run you will make the big bucks

217
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,776
This is something I're nagging about all the time.

218
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:19,359
I know it's very boring though

219
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
It is more important that you save

220
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,291
than that you do not save

221
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,991
so it is that you do not have

222
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:30,111
Started investing so Yes but I add links to everything I invest in below

223
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Follow them and like

224
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,999
There are no buy recommendations what I have invested in though

225
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Many of you are nagging and want to know what I have so

226
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
That's why I'm making this video

227
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
Is it that you want to know more about

228
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751

And

232
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
Would love to join the group 'Shares and funds for beginners' if it is the case that you

233

00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
together a community where We learn from each other

236
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
So there we can ask questions completely free none

237
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439

In the long run, I have little plan for how we can make this channel even better
