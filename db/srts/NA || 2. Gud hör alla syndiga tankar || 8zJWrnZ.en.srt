1
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.880
- Here ... - here is my congregation.

2
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.880
- Here is your church.
 - Here is my church.

3
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.040
- Here you can join?
 -Yes.
 It's my congregation.

4
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.800
You have been involved in not being allowed to stay in a congregation?

5
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.000
Just.
 Church gates were closed when I opened my wardrobe door.

6
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.480
You opened your wardrobe door and then the church door was closed.

7
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.400
This is Robin.
 He grew up within the Salvation Army.

8
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.560
He will never forget when he understood that he should feel shame -

9
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.320
- Over himself.

10
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.520
My pastor carried with him a very conservative view of -

11
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.880
- How to be a Christian, the Christian identity and what it means.

12
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.920
From him I was called leprosy sodomite for half the congregation.

13
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.200
It was a difficult betrayal to handle -

14
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.920
- And it aroused many wounds in a boy who just needed to feel loved.

15
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.160
This is Robin's story.
 But it's not just about him.

16
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
This is the story of all children -

17
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.880
- which has been harmed by the religion their parents have chosen for them.

18
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.080
And those children are everywhere.

19
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.080
They grew up in different religious contexts, and they are many.

20
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.080
All children who grow up in religious home do not get bad.

21
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.800
But now it is about those who have done it.
 Now let's listen to them.

22
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.000
Many of the young people we met have told about their horror for hell -

23
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.320
- If the fear of demons and for praying sin.

24
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.320
A bit into the conversation, with everyone we talked, it has also been about sex.

25
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.320
When the pastor made clear to the assembly his view of homosexuality-

26
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.480
- And people like Robin, the life of Robin changed in the congregation.

27
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.960
Man condemned my love.
 If I didn't repent -

28
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.160
- I never get love again.
 And what does it do with a child?

29
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.920
How the others in the congregation, the old friends, were against him -

30
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.880
- Also changed.

31
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.040
Suddenly in a place where I felt at home and could before and without-

32
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.200
- So small oil crosses appeared.

33
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.280
At the piano where I used to play, at the coffee table where I used to have a snack.

34
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.840
- What is an oil cross?
 - At prayer you can iron oil on something.

35
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It is an old practice to bless - as the last anointing for example.

36
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.160
You have walked around and lubricated and asked for holiness and protection.

37
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.320
It's a very nice thing to do.

38
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.560
But I didn't really understand that there was a connection to me.

39
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.840
In recent years I have learned that it was probably not a blessing for me -

40
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
–On protection from me.

41
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.840
There is so much shame and loneliness.

42
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.560
When you know something that many people appreciate should be wrong, bad -

43
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.320
- Or disgusting even, you do your best to hide it.

44
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.480
And when you start hiding things and lie about yourself -

45
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.920
- So you also hurt yourself.

46
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.720
It is difficult to describe how it feels when a pastor stands and says -

47
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.880
- That homosexuality is a disease.
 There was no bisexuality.

48
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.360
The blame that I have a desire, a draw that is wrong ...

49
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.040
Instead of something wonderful - "I can love the one I want" -

50
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.040
- So it was like: "Okay, now my lifelong struggle is starting."

51
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.360
The feeling of shame when in that situation -

52
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.400
- It gets very, very strong.
 And I took it out on myself.

53
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.440
"It's a disease."

54
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.960
"We'll love the one who is sick" -

55
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.560
- "But also help it recover with Jesus."

56
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.600
I thought that what I feel is sick and disgusting and wrong.

57
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.240
So it was a huge shame.

58
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.200
To hear it when you are small, it leaves very deep tracks.

59
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.120
And then I don't know if they heal.

60
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.880
When I became a teenager and started getting a sexuality -

61
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.520
- And realized that I was bisexual, then ...

62
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.240
... I was also good for God to hear those thoughts -

63
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.720
–And God would think I was dirty and sinful -

64
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.680
- And that I would end up in hell.

65
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.920
The shame followed me wherever I went, and it still follows me today.

66
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:36.480
I ended up in a very, very special self -harm behavior.

67
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.520
I bit myself, because it didn't appear.

68
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.680
With long sleeves it did not appear.
 And I knew it wasn't leaving scars.

69
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.440
It's something that I know, that I can take out on myself.

70
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.680
I can punish myself based on what I know, based on what I am.

71
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.280
When I prayed to God as a child, I asked for God to remove me.

72
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:11.080
Not that I would die, only that I had never existed.

73
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.320
Because I understood that what I was caused to others.

74
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.840
"God who has the children in love, please, remove me."

75
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.280
During the teens, those prayers became much more destructive.

76
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.160
I was told that LGBTQ people-gay as they said in the church-

77
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.000
- Normally becomes happy.

78
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.880
"It is your fault if you do not change. The answers are in your actions."

79
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.040
"You are not praying enough, is not enough Christian."

80
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.240
"Why have you chosen to be a LGBTQ person, gay?"

81
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.960
"Don't you know that God wants more with your life?"

82
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.560
How does it affect a child who hears about himself in a church bench?

83
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.080
I think they become very unsure of themselves.

84
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.080
They internalize the image that there is something fundamental to them.

85
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:31.720
And unfortunately, it is getting more and more wrong as sexuality develops.

86
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:37.560
One thing that becomes clear here is that they are, because they are in religious systems -

87
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.760
- Experience someone hears their sinful thoughts.
 God hears what they think.

88
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.120
How does it affect a child's development to live with that performance?

89
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.640
So, that you perceive that God is everywhere and see everything you do -

90
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.600
- Can be very secure.

91
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.520
Then you always have a wise dialogue partner, and that is positive.

92
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.000
But when you have this that is seen as a fundamental design error -

93
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.760
- So it becomes very problematic that you cannot escape from God's gaze.

94
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:21.320
"Hands on the blanket, God sees you" is an expression from the past.

95
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.360
So of course incredibly difficult.
 The religious package makes the message -

96
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.240
- If homosexuality is wrong becomes more serious than a secular message.

97
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.840
What do you want to say to religious communities that speak so in the vicinity of children?

98
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.160
This means that the child gets really deep problems in the view of himself.

99
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.360
As they become adults, they will leave the religious movement -

100
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.480
–And then they may start to be able to accept themselves -

101
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.560
- After many years of unnecessary self -doubt.

102
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.520
But it's not just those who had a different sexuality -

103
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.360
- which has been frightened by what was preached.

104
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.520
Many have learned that sexuality is shameful -

105
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.680
- It is sinful to feel desire.

106
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.480
And in many communities it is clear what crime it is against God -

107
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.120
- Having sex outside of marriage.

108
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.400
At puberty ... we went to youth meetings, or teenage meetings.

109
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.800
There was a lot of teaching about abstaining from six-

110
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.480
- And to think clean and not have sex until on the wedding night.

111
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:55.200
We talked so much about it.
 It was like someone took a piece of the apple.

112
00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.480
"Now someone has munched on the apple. If several take bite from the apple" -

113
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.960
- "So it's just apple scrap left for your real man later."

114
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.920
- Oh, what a heavy.
 - Yes, here's the stuff.

115
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.880
Student cap.
 There is little everything possible here.

116
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.680
- How often do you look in the boxes?
 - At all.

117
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.920
But I have done it sometimes, because ... the farther from I come ...

118
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.040
You take it up sometimes.
 "It was as believer I was."

119
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.400
It's so hard to remember, it's so bizarre in some way.

120
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.880
What's that?
 "Young women - personal growth."

121
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.200
When you turn 12, you start in young women's class.
 This is...

122
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.600
... a program, simply.

123
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:56.160
They read this together on Sundays.
 I still know it:

124
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.480
"We are daughters to a heavenly father who loves us, and we love him."

125
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.160
"We should stand as witnesses of God at all times, in everything and everywhere" -

126
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.520
- "While we strive to live by young women's values" -

127
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.800
- "What are faith, divine nature, personal value, knowledge" -

128
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.040
- "Freedom of choice and responsibility, good deeds and delay."

129
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.640
"We believe that when we accept and trade according to these values" -

130
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.840
- "Can we be prepared to strengthen home and family" -

131
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.320
- "Receive the Temple's regulations and enjoy the blessings of the elevation."

132
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.080
Every week we recited it together, standing.

133
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.440
- All young women over 12?
 - Between 12 and 18.

134
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.040
I am raised in an innocence norm and purity culture.

135
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.480
-What does it mean?
 - Very focus on sexual purity.

136
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.520
There were lessons with ...

137
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:56.080
... a bowl of dumle that you sent around.
 And then there was some leader -

138
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.360
- As a stupid in your mouth, put it back and sent it around.

139
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:08.160
"Who wants the dumbs I had in my mouth? It's the same with your body."

140
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.200
  Keep all the bids, keep all the bids

141
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.560
  and find your security and find there your freedom

142
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.400
If you've had sex or even just kissed any -

143
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.800
- Then your body has been soiled.

144
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.480
And this is like a supernatural performance -

145
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.400
- For innocence does not exist, biologically speaking.

146
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.880
You cannot investigate whether anyone is innocence.
 The idea is not really available.

147
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.240
But one creates like a double world -

148
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.840
- Where you can be dirty or clean.

149
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.520
Even masturbation is sinful.

150
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.680
Thus, you must not express a basic human need.

151
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.360
It was abstinence that applied.

152
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.440
They talked a lot in metaphors and pictures.

153
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.800
One that I clearly remember was that your sexuality is -

154
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.760
-As a white A4 paper-clean, nice and plain.

155
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.040
If you have sex, it's like you wrinkle together your paper.

156
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.960
And when you try to unfold it and make it smooth again, it doesn't go.

157
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:46.000
You will always see the wrinkle on the paper.

158
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.040
"Do you have sex, then you have destroyed something."
 You were like a chewed chewing gum.

159
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.000
No one wants a chewed chewing gum.
 You want a new chewing gum.

160
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.000
In ordinary believers in a church or Muslim congregation -

161
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.400
- Sin is often linked to the temptation.

162
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.000
The more limited man has been in his cultural -

163
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.560
–And the fewer revelations you have been allowed by their context -

164
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.800
–Desto greater is the risk of the foremost association with temptation -

165
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:27.600
- is linked to sexuality.
 The sexual temptation is most evident.

166
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.600
Then there is something also that if you have power systems ...

167
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:37.000
Power that is really strong becomes internalized -

168
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.560
- So that you feel what the power says.

169
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.160
You take on the gaze of power yourself.

170
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.600
And you do this at a purely physical level.
 One begins to feel shame -

171
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:59.880
- When you violate what society or the power structure tells.

172
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.040
You become your own police officer in some way.

173
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:10.280
There are few areas that come so close to ourselves -

174
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:16.560
- As it has to do with sexuality and forbidden sexual feelings.

175
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:23.840
The social religious power becomes extra tangible.

176
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.200
It can be perceived as churches and religions being completely obsessed with -

177
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.720
- To curb people's sexuality.
 Is there anything in it?

178
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:40.440
Has it been an important task for the religious systems in our history?

179
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.320
Clearly.
 From our perspective now, we have contraceptives -

180
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.960
-And it has been around for 60 years.

181
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:58.960
Before the 1960s, sexuality and reproduction were fully intertwined.

182
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.480
It made sexuality, very, very dangerous.

183
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:09.560
Women died in a cot, it became children who had to be taken care of, the divided.

184
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:16.280
Lived under more extreme forms, in poverty and had it more difficult -

185
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:22.040
- Then you couldn't really afford to release sexuality free -

186
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.200
- As you could after the contraceptives.

187
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.960
When you were 21 and would get married and get kids -

188
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.440
- Was it of free will?
 Did you want it, were you in love?

189
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:43.560
I thought so, but it was just a slim part of me who wanted it.

190
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.960
So it was.

191
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.280
- How to think about it today?
 - I am really sad for it.

192
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.640
I was not ready and mature to promise something like that.

193
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:04.320
It's something I have to live with.
 I have been so sorry about that.

194
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.320
Everything in the Mormon Church aims to get you married in the temple -

195
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:15.000
- With a righteous priesthood carrier.
 A righteous woman, if one is ...

196
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.680
It even stands here.
 Everyone gets one like this.

197
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.280
-What's that?
 - A patriarchal blessing.

198
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.440
I must not show it for someone really, but ...

199
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.560
But I don't believe this anymore.
 So it is.

200
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.360
It says here that I will get married in the temple -

201
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.680
- And what kind of family we should have.
 They talk about the eternal perspective.

202
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.360
One should get married in the temple and become this Union -

203
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:54.240
- As will be saved together in the seventh heaven, the Celestia Empire.

204
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.400
Everything revolves around getting married.

205
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.160
It is the ultimate goal of your existence here on earth.

206
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.080
What do you want to say to communities -

207
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.960
- As this look reproduces the innocence norm, on the chastity -

208
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.960
–And that has a mix between sexual feelings and shame?

209
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.680
The person's development will probably be damaged by the norms.

210
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:27.000
This can lead to them marrying the wrong person, at too young years.

211
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.720
Many of those we hear here come from Christian free churches.

212
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.400
What they say is similar to what we heard about honor -

213
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.560
- That we call honor culture.
 What do you think when you hear it?

214
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:46.280
I have the same reflections on it.
 Parent investment in our species -

215
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:53.600
- Is a very extensive project that lasts for many years.

216
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.920
We are also a social animal that depends on people around.

217
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.080
Clans or communities or so.
 So rumor for the family -

218
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.640
- or the further developed family, becomes central.

219
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:14.440
That combination causes the parent to have an interest in -

220
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.720
–Ee make sure the offspring reproduces in a way -

221
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:25.840
- Which is in line with the investment in the child, and with a good social reputation.

222
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Therefore, it is absolutely fantastic that we managed to do something for honor culture -

223
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.160
-In our part of the world.
 It wasn't long ago that we were doing it ourselves.

224
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.040
The chastity norm is connected to a larger package -

225
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.560
- As we call the culture of honor.

226
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:50.400
As a child I learned that a woman has two choices:

227
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.320
Either she marries as soon as she arrives at puberty -

228
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.640
- Or she focuses on the school.

229
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:05.320
There is no world where one can explore your sexuality -

230
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.920
- or have relationships unconditionally.

231
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:17.000
Therefore, when I arrived at puberty, I chose to focus on the school.

232
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:23.920
I knew that as soon as I showed some form of interest in other things in life -

233
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.680
- So it would open the door -

234
00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.040
- For the family's and the family's thoughts on marrying me.

235
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.680
And I was really not interested in that.

236
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:40.040
I learned that God all hears one's thoughts.

237
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.840
I learned that some thoughts were sinful.

238
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:52.800
I was very scared and tried to suppress different types of thoughts.

239
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.920
If I was in love with someone else, I felt huge shame.

240
00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.960
It worried my parents that I would get rid of the innocence.

241
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.760
In Islam it is punishable.

242
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:12.040
One must not have sex before marriage -

243
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.200
- And my parents tried to eliminate every risk of it.

244
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:26.040
I couldn't spend time with guys, not have a skirt or shorts in the summers.

245
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.720
I barely had to be out.

246
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.240
This with guys was among the biggest sins available.

247
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.560
It was the biggest taboo.

248
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.680
Elaf Ali is a journalist, author and debater.

249
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.560
She has written a book about the repressions of honor she was exposed to -

250
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.600
- During his upbringing.

251
00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.120
For me it was: "It's wrong with Islam - it's just Islam that's wrong."

252
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.600
Then I moved to Stockholm and ended up in a more mixed environment.

253
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.760
I met a girl who was a Mormon, which is a branch of Christianity.

254
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.960
And her expression resembled my so much.

255
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.720
She didn't look like me at all.

256
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.880
Free churches have a similar problem.
 Many people say when talking about it:

257
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.120
"But how many honor killings have you heard of in the Free Church?"

258
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.840
In Sweden, hundreds of thousands are exposed to repressions -

259
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.840
- But how many do we hear about being murdered?
 It is extremely, extremely few.

260
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.920
It is everyday oppression: you do not have your own choices.

261
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.720
And there are many similarities between those who grow up in the Free Church -

262
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.120
- And in other religious communities, groups and religions.

263
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.880
It is very similar.

264
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.040
Many stories are similar to each other -

265
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.760
- Wove in which community the children grew up.

266
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.360
But there are, as you say, degrees in hell.

267
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.800
No matter what community the interviewees have grown up in -

268
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:20.160
- It needs the courage to sit in front of the camera and express their criticism.

269
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:28.240
But it is significantly most difficult for the Muslims and ex -Muslims we meet.

270
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.800
I meet Omar Macram that started the organization Exmuslims in Sweden.

271
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.840
He explains why.

272
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.280
Apostasi is very stigmatized in Islam.

273
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.760
In most interpretations of Islam-

274
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.560
- Must those who leave Islam are killed.

275
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:56.440
It is also very difficult for parents to accept -

276
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.760
- That their children leave Islam.

277
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.520
Sometimes one has to choose between family and freedom -

278
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:11.880
–And some are not prepared to make that choice -

279
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.760
- So they stay away and are more "in the closet".

280
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:22.800
It is a difference between honorary culture and honorary norms -

281
00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.320
- And religious pressure of children, which we talk about here.
 Describe the difference.

282
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.720
There are some factors that they have in common -

283
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.480
- But honor oppression has not only to do with a specific religion.

284
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.360
It has to do with collective values -

285
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:50.840
- which can be cultural or religious, but often a combination.

286
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.360
When young girls, raised within the Free Church in Sweden, for example -

287
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.840
- Or within the Mormon Church, Jehovah's Witnesses or so ...

288
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.960
When they talk about an innocence norm, not to marry who they want ...

289
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.960
- Then isn't that honor?
 - No, I wouldn't say so.

290
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.720
A big difference is that in the Christian environment there is a way out.

291
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.760
But within the culture of honor there is rarely a way out:

292
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.960
Something must be done to restore the family's honor.

293
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.560
Therefore, honorable girls often have protected identity -

294
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.160
- Or live in sheltered accommodation.

295
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.560
You are anonymous now that we do this interview with you.

296
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.120
Why do you have to be that?

297
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.920
Because one of the most dangerous things available is -

298
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:56.560
- When a woman in a Muslim context decides to leave Islam.

299
00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.240
It can be followed by threats and violence ...

300
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:08.480
... and that's something I've received help and support with escaping.

301
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:17.160
Yes, sometimes the religious control means that the children have to break -

302
00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.720
- With their family and the congregation, and on it follows threats of violence.

303
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.680
In some communities, those who no longer believe - are excluded

304
00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.040
- Or that do things that go against religion.

305
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.680
Within Jehovah's Witnesses, all parents live under the same injunction:

306
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.760
If the children are excluded, as soon as the children must be big enough to manage -

307
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:47.840
- Break in touch with them.
 A huge pressure on those affected.

308
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.720
When you were excluded, how did it go?

309
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:58.360
I went in there, and then there is a library ...

310
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:07.640
Then Dad said before they would go, "You understand what this means?"

311
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.640
And I said, "Yes, I understand what that means."

312
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.280
