1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning. We are in Thailand.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,860
- Shall we go and eat breakfast?
- Yes!

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,260
- Shall we leave?
- No.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,380
You don't want breakfast? I want breakfast.

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,980
It was boring.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,980
- I think you need something in your belly.
- No, it's just boring.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,040
- Do you know what we can do on the way there?
- No.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,800
Feed the fish!

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,060
Come on! They are hungry at least, even if you aren't.

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,620
Okay then!

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,120
Don't throw too little, and not too much.

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,680
Because then it will... it won't last that long.

13
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,180
- Do you want more?
- Yes.

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,280
Oh God, they are going crazy!

15
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,520
One can do this every morning and afternoon.

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,320
Harry's mood in the mornings isn't the best,
but I feel like this helps a little.

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,600
- Yes, indeed!
- The mornings get more fun.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,700
It's like... he...

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,440
He gets something else to think about.

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
- Let's have breakfast!
- Yes.

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,680
Fruit and muesli for breakfast. Super tasty!

22
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,880
Harry's having strawberry yogurt with chocolate cereal.

23
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,640
Is it good?

24
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh.

25
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,540
- He needs help wiping his mouth.
- Get it off, get it off!

26
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,680
Yes, calm down. I'm taking my napkin.

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,960
Napkin ambulance.

28
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Okay?

29
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,720
Harry gets stressed out sometimes...

30
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,680
...when it gets messy.

31
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,080
The kids have already jumped in.

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,580
There are several pools at this hotel,
but this kids area is Alma and Harry's favorite.

33
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,600
You guys, here I come!
What happened with the crocodile?

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,800
Do you want a push?

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,780
Do you want a push?

36
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,940
Hold on!

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,260
- Okay, are you all set? Do you want a push?
- Yes.

38
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Oh!

39
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,200
- It didn't hit my face.
- Nice save!

40
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,640
It's really difficult!

41
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,600
I float to the surface like a sausage.

42
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,240
Guys, the water slides are open!
Shouldn't we all go there?

43
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,160
- Yes!
- Come on, Axel!

44
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,340
Look. Here's your pizza, Harry.

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,220
Oh!

46
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,580
- Really hot.
- Yes, yes I see. Thank you!

47
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,120
- What! This one's mine?
- Yes, let's remove these.

48
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,460
It got wrong.

49
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,440
Sometimes things go wrong.

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,760
After a morning like this, everything tastes good, Harry.

51
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,760
You have jumped around and played so much.

52
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,360
You guys just got a pile of salad each, it's so weird!

53
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,500
Dad and I have ordered more food.

54
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,860
Delicious.

55
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,000
- Yes. One here and one over there, please.
- Yes.

56
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,840
Fanta!

57
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,780
What should Fanta eat?

58
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,540
- Who is Fanta?
- Him.

59
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
This is Fanta.

60
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,180
Alma and Harry slept for a bit after lunch.

61
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
- Nice, huh?
- Yes!

62
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
- We are headed for the main street to...
- Come here, Harry!

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,840
...pick up our laundry,
which we dropped off a couple of days ago.

64
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,840
Come!

65
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,900
Alma and Axel found a laundry service
where you could get...

66
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,700
...1 kilo laundry done for 50 Bath, right?
(2.2 lbs)(1.5 USD)

67
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,060
I think so, I don't know. I don't remember.

68
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,480
- And how much is 50 Bath? Around 10 SEK?
- Mhm, something like that.

69
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
- Do you want a push?
- Yes.

70
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,860
It is actually starting to rain. Let's open these.

71
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,100
- I'll take this one.
- The camera!

72
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,320
Yes, exactly. Let's keep one above the camera.

73
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,180
- Which one can I take?
- You can take this one.

74
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,300
- Do you want to share?
- Yes.

75
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,440
- Or... Alma can have it.
- Yes.

76
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,900
It's quite nice! It's really, really...
What do you say? The air is very humid.

77
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,720
And I'm wearing so much sunscreen...
I feel sticky all over.

78
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,780
It feels good with some rain.

79
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,720
These were jam packed when we handed them in,
and now when it's all folded it's almost half the size.

80
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,640
It feels like a good investment!

81
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,480
Axel is dropping off the laundry in our hotel room,
and we are heading to the beach.

82
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
I mean - the beach by our hotel.

83
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,080
- Hello...
- Hello, hello!

84
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,340
Hello.

85
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,020
How are you getting on with your English, Alma?

86
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Okay.

87
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,540
This hotel is booked through TUI.

88
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,600
We are collaborating with TUI,
who have sponsored our trip to Thailand.

89
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,860
We are super happy about that, of course!

90
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,160
We will not only be staying at this hotel -
we are switching to another place after one week.

91
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,260
Right.

92
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,820
When we've met other travelers... Swedes,
we've noticed that combination trips are quite common.

93
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,780
- Being at one place for a week, and then another place.
- Mhm.

94
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,800
Alma was a little upset this morning,
because her new friend switched hotels today.

95
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,720
Yes.

96
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,520
Harry is yelling something.

97
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,960
Come down on the beach...

98
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,900
...and let's go to the Love Tree.

99
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,100
But it's getting dark now, Harry. We are going back to change, and then we are having dinner.

100
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,060
Yummy, yummy!

101
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,300
- Do you like it?
- Mhm.

102
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,700
- Do you like yours?
- Mhm.

103
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:28,240
Dad says I can only choose something healthy,
not nuggets and french fries and stuff like that...

104
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,780
...so this is all healthy foods.

105
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,420
- It's a good thing that healthy can also be tasty!
- Mhm.

106
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,480
NOW

107
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,360
WE'LL

108
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
GO

109
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,160
FOR

110
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,940
AN

111
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,860
EVENING

112
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,700
DI...

113
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,580
...P!

114
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,800
P... what does "P" mean?

115
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
An evening swim.

116
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,920
Woho!

117
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,300
- The best balcony!
- Aha, aha...

118
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,300
Here comes a diver!

119
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,740
Sleep tight now.

120
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,340
- Goodnight, dad. I love you.
- I love you both.

121
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,640
It's pitch black.

122
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,060
Not pitch black, but a little darker.

123
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,640
Goodnight.

124
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,240
Goodnight.

125
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:44,220
We have a Question of the Day that works pretty well, because this day has revolved a lot around the hotel.

126
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,720
Jocke BrÃ¶ms asks:
"What is the best thing about your hotel?".

127
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,040
Swimming!

128
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,940
You should be asleep!

129
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,980
"Swimming".

130
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,700
I actually agree. Harry is right.

131
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,480
I want to go to the pool now...

132
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,340
...to the water slides.

133
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,540
- Yes. All the pools - it being so close to water.
- Yes.

134
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,880
I can also reveal that the worst part
are these walls that are just made of glass.

135
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,560
Yes, it's a wobbly and loud glass wall...

136
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,340
Sorry, I just knocked on it. It's like a paper wall.

137
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,040
We have a very hard time being able to do things
in the evenings, after we have put the kids down.

138
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,760
Mhm.

139
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,760
Thank YOU for watching this video.

140
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,520
Please leave a thumbs up, or down.

141
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,500
Leave a comment, ask questions,
and have a great time until we see you next time!

142
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,340
Yes.

143
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,160
- Bye, bye!
- See you. Have a good one!
