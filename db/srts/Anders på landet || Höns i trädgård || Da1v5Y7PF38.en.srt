00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
........

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07.680
Today I was going to talk a little through chickens in the garden.

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,800
It is nice with chickens in the garden, it is a bit the picture you have of the countryside.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,152
There are several advantages to the chickens going out in the garden.

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
First, it is the well -being factor.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,552
Not only for me, that I think it is nice that there is life in the yard.

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
null

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,136
But also for the hens. They enjoy walking around and picking.

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,464
And they are happy to crawl into the bush.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,024
And that one has advantage number two:

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
They clear weeds

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,144
As an example, they are particularly fond of cherries.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
As it puts in with good appetite.

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,800
The third advantage of chickens in the garden is that it reduces feed consumption.

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:50,176
Not just that they feel comfortable and that they jaw weeds. Without the weed they do not have to give as feed.

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,040
They eat less in the summer when they have access to insects and weeds all around.

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58.880
So there are of course disadvantages too

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,744
It is not only me and the hens who think it is nice with chickens in the garden

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,792
So do it two others

20
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07.328
It's the day eye:

21
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08.096
HÃ¶ken

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09.888
And the night eye fox

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,472
I have had total since I move out to the yard

24
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
So have got rid of

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
Four chickens to the hawk and

26
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
null

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
a rooster to the night eye

28
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
null

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
The fox

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
That has arrived in the evening

31
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
null

32
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
I have my own theory

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
I think the hawk is the worst in the autumn

34
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,464
That's why I take the chance now and let them go free during high summer

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:40,352
All the chickens I got rid of it have been during high season or during the fall

36
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,192
When it has been declined and they have not had so good places to hide on

37
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49.568
Now they usually live under bushes and so on so I think the hawk is a less risk now.

38
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
The fox is another thing. After all, it is mainly night -active.

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59.040
And it is simply important to lock the hens in the evening.

40
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02.112
And now that they have accepted their new hen house

41
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04.416
null

42
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
So there is no problem.

43
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08.768
When it darkens they pull home

44
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10.048
And sits on their sticks

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
null

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
When dusk comes, I go out and close and lock the chicken house

47
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
null

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
And after the first rooster

49
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:24,896
That's where the chickens could still go free and they hadn't really become accustomed. They liked to sleep outdoors and I got rid of one.

50
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
But then the first rooster, I have - take in wood.

51
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
Not happened to the fox in any way.

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
If I am now on the disadvantages.

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
Another disadvantage. They jaw weeds

54
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
But

55
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44.608
Then you have to keep in mind that what is weed is me who decides. It is not always the hens have the same view

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
And one must also think that

57
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
Hens are not looking for weeds, they are looking for food

58
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
It means

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53.568
KirskÃ¥nen - There we agree both to me and the hens.

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
But they do not jaw nettles

61
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
They don't chew thistles

62
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,296
Without it, the tasty things they put in

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07.904
And what they put into themselves may be the one that I want to have left

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08.928
Like that it is

65
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,256
Completely hopeless if you get the hens into a salad land

66
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
They love salad

67
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,120
The same thing my berry bushes

68
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,008
Black currants they sound like but red currants - those bushes are depressed in chicken height all the way

69
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,128
But I think that's the price I'm willing to pay right now

70
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,200
Disadvantage number three with chickens in the garden

71
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
null

72
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
It is that the hen

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35.808
They originally come from jungle chickens

74
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,904
All the breeds available come from different jungle chickens

75
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
And

76
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
They are happy to go back a bit to their natural instincts

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
For example

78
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48.608
So they are happy to spit outdoors in a bush cake somewhere

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
So

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
null

81
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,472
The egg harvest becomes considerably smaller when they go out

82
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55.008
Anyway for me

83
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57.056
I know a part that resolves

84
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58.848
the problem by having them trapped

85
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
Throughout the morning so they can lay off

86
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Before they go out

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,528
But I open when I get up in the morning

88
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08.064
We go first round with the dog

89
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
And there is a great tip

90
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
Get an egg dog!

91
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
My dog is very fond of eggs

92
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,351
But she does not cook them directly in the nest but takes it very gently to go out on the lawn

93
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Put them down

94
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
and gnaws in the contents

95
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
This means that if you are out with the dog in the morning

96
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
Should you submit her

97
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
She comes out with the eggs and then you take them away from her. Replaces it to something good

98
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
It works just fine

99
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37.503
A possible problem can be even if you live in densely populated area

100
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
null

101
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,623
Partly because the neighbors can complain about a rooster that sounds

102
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49.535
There is not much to do about you avoid having a rooster. I have two pieces but I'm not disturbed by the roosters

103
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
I don't think the neighbors do either

104
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,887
I have my cocks here and

105
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59.007
The neighbors 500 meters in that direction also have rooster and they also have rooster too

106
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,359
When any of the roosters start gala, the other roosters respond

107
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05.407
I think it's pretty homely

108
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:11,039
The advantage of living like this in the real country there too

109
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12.831
There is plenty of room for the chickens

110
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
null

111
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,463
The chickens do not feel plot boundaries in the same way as we

112
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
So you live tightly

113
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
so you have to make sure to set up some type of fence

114
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
To keep the hens in place

115
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
Otherwise they could very well go into the neighbor's salad land

116
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
Setting up a fence for the hens

117
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,615
Should you keep in mind that there should be a thread over

118
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,271
Trot if you wish - the chicken flies without further up to 1 meter or 2 meters height

119
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44.831
And has a fence with a solid stick at the top

120
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
null

121
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49.951
That's how they cross. They fly up and sit there and jump down on the other side

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54.303
Do you have a thread over then it is not as enticing to fly up and sit down

123
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
But on the whole

124
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
null

125
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01.215
Chickens are a nice feature of the garden

126
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02.495
And

127
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06.847
Had it not been for the fox and hawk that had had them out all year round

128
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Now, as I said, I will

129
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09.919
null

130
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
Autumn so they have to go back

131
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
Into the chicken farm

132
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
And there they get

133
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
manage on it during the winter

134
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,207
On the other hand, there is not as much for them to eat at that time of year

135
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,839

And do you like what you see in this video so please give me a thumbs up

137
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,263
Have a great time and we will be visible again next week
