1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,837
P*NIS, COOL.
That one was actually not me.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,138
Out of chaos comes order,
and pretty funny moments.

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:10,706
Just stop rowing because you're ruining everything!
You're making us hit the rock.

4
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:25,778
Good morning.
We're sitting here, in a parking lot, in Stenstorp.

5
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:29,196
We are discovering Skaraborg this week.

6
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:33,297
Harry, can't you sit up and join in a little?

7
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:39,410
We took the car here today,
and Alma and Harry started to argue in the car.

8
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:43,043
When we arrived,
they went in different directions in the parking lot.

9
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:50,448
Alma went that way, and Axel and Laura followed.
Harry sat down here, and I followed him.

10
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,521
Now the others are coming.

11
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,985
- Hi.
- Hi.

12
00:00:57,413 --> 00:01:01,495
- There's been some fighting.
- I know.

13
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:07,501
Welcome to the parking lot.
Well, the small patch of grass next to the parking lot.

14
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,005
- In Stenstorp.
- I know.

15
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:14,241
You guys.
Can you make up, please?

16
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,510
- Please?
- Please, please?

17
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,616
- Let's bury the hatchet.
- Okay.

18
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,615
Okay.

19
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:43,889
- Hugs!
- Hugs!

20
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:52,474
Now we are going in here,
to Dalénium Science Center.

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,754
Go ahead and enter.
Oh, Harry is holding the door. Excellent.

22
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,186
Hey, hey!

23
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,989
- Hey! Welcome!
- Thank you.

24
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:06,323
- 1, 2, 3, 4. There's one missing.
- Yes, he held the door.

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,497
- A gentleman. Welcome to Dalénium!
- Thank you!

26
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:14,068
So, this is a science center.
Do you know what that is?

27
00:02:14,164 --> 00:02:17,504
- No.
- A little. Kind of.

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,973
A little. Yes.

29
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:24,714
There are 20 science centers in Sweden, and a bunch abroad.
We all do about the same things.

30
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:29,350
There are things to try out, and experiments.
We also have shows.

31
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:35,439
Everything centers around different phenomena and properties
in the technical and scientific field.

32
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:43,745
Oh, look at this.

33
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,025
Ah, I get it.

34
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:52,106
Can I play with you?

35
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,809
- "Pipe organ."
- Wait, I'll use my own.

36
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,767
Oh, Laura is dancing to it.

37
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,320
- Daddy, your slippers.
- Thanks.

38
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,334
- Come! Let's keep going.
- Yes!

39
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:35,034
- What are you supposed to make?
- The letter F.

40
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:38,986
- There.
- Yes, smart.

41
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:43,357
And then, like so.
Now. Now, now, now!

42
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,959
Yellow.

43
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,194
Green.

44
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,595
Black.

45
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,030
Blue.

46
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:51,675
Pink.

47
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:56,629
Yes!

48
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,876
Yes, there.

49
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:04,194
- There was something else to look at.
- The pretty, red lamp.

50
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,155
- Are you there?
- Hello?

51
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,419
- Oh my God, it works!
- Can I hear?

52
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,998
Oh my God.

53
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:20,037
Jesus Christ! Oh my God.

54
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:24,698
- God, this is so cool.
- Yes, it's really fun!

55
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,483
Harry is standing over there.

56
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:13,605
1, 2, 3!

57
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:20,687
I think this has been a great activity
when it's so hot out.

58
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,492
I'm very tired
from all the brain gymnastics.

59
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:30,001
I'm not used to exercising
these parts up here.

60
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,232
I think it's easier for kids.

61
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,802
Oh, definitely!
They're going at it back here, building and stuff.

62
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:40,407
Alma is building a house for Laura,
with the help of some newfound friends.

63
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:44,911
I also have to say that it's been a great activity
for two arguing siblings-

64
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:48,248
-because they've had to work together
and come up with things.

65
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,283
Mm.

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,637
- The argument from this morning is forgotten.
- Yes. A bit difficult to film here, though.

67
00:05:54,788 --> 00:06:00,861
Yes. I often think we end up in situations
that are difficult to film, and then I'm like:

68
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:04,372
"What footage do we even have
from this place?"

69
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,064
- And then it is what it is.
- Mm.

70
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,787
This is Laura's house!

71
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,677
- Does she like it?
- I think so.

72
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,917
- Is that the bed?
- Yes.

73
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:23,237
- It looks a little small.
- No, it's fine.

74
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:30,000
And I've built two cars for Laura.

75
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:39,038
- How great to have a little sister to build for!
- Yes. Super great.

76
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,164
- Has she tried them?
- I think she'll like this one the most.

77
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,076
What's daddy doing now?
What is that?

78
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:59,842
It's a long spring.
You can learn about waves and how they propagate.

79
00:07:01,563 --> 00:07:04,791
Laura, this is your car.

80
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:09,277
Ready, set, go!

81
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:15,622
How was it?

82
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,803
So good!
It was so much fun!

83
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:26,610
- What did you think?
- It was fun. Really fun.

84
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,949
- The car is over here.
- What?!

85
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,192
I've prepped, just like on cooking shows
when they've already baked the bread.

86
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,100
Are you also the one who prepped this?

87
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,257
#P*NIS
#COOL

88
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:43,163
That one was actually not me, but I wrote #COOL
because I miss my old beanie that said #COOL.

89
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:46,032
Well, it wasn't really mine.
It was Alma's.

90
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,537
- And who is #P*NIS?
- I don't know.

91
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,172
- Harry.
- No.

92
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:56,555
It wasn't me!
I don't write that ugly.

93
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:00,914
So, about #COOL...

94
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:09,923
It was a - sorry, Alma - really ugly beanie that Alma had,
that Axel wore once when we filmed.

95
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:16,582
I used it for quite a while.
I had lost my beanie.

96
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:20,867
I know, it was awful.

97
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,622
- It's in a vlog. I just don't remember what it's called.
- Me neither.

98
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,240
- It's so long ago. 
- You can look for it.

99
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:34,512
Anyway. Now we are on our way to a place called Maplelake,
where we will spend the night.

100
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,727
Yes!

101
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:51,536
Look.
Here is where we will stay.

102
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,073
- I'll sleep here, double dibs!
- "Double dibs." I wonder if we're all staying in one tent.

103
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:05,592
- I hope we have both tents, but I don't know.
- We will see.

104
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:08,412
Look!

105
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:13,197
Oh... Look at this.

106
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,922
Daddy. Your favorite sport.

107
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:23,027
This was cozy!
Oh, wow! Speed badminton. Wow!

108
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:28,050
There's a little fan there, buzzing.
It's really hot in this tent.

109
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:32,572
- Yes.
- It'll probably be cooler in the evening.

110
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,875
- Shall we guess that's for Laura?
- I think so.

111
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,346
Or shall we all squeeze in here?

112
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:42,282
- I don't know. No, that'll probably be too cramped.
- Alma and I will sleep here.

113
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:50,857
- Laura fell asleep in the car. We haven't just left her.
- No. Well, yes. But she's sleeping soundly.

114
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,692
- Candy.
- No.

115
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,927
- Soda.
- No.

116
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:59,499
- Smoothie for Laura.
- That's good. You'll have to save the other stuff for Saturday.

117
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:00,635
Come!

118
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,737
- Hello! Welcome.
- Thanks!

119
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,575
- Fun that you're here.
- It feels good to be here.

120
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:10,744
That's nice.
Have you been to Tidaholm before?

121
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:15,348
Never.
We have no idea what's going on here.

122
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:20,253
It's a small town, but there's still a lot to do here.
That's good.

123
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:22,812
Yes. How cozy.

124
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:29,129
For starters... I don't know how peckish you are right now,
but here's something for the boat ride.

125
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:33,700
Or if you feel like you can't even
paddle a single stroke before...

126
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,769
- How lovely!
- Some Swedish Fika and fruit.

127
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, how nice!
The kids are, like: "Oh, wow. Yum!"

128
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,346
Both tents are for us.

129
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:53,740
This one was meant for the parents
and the other one is prepared for the kids.

130
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:56,890
We'll need to make some kind of switch.

131
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,957
Yes!

132
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:03,363
It's so fun, because this campsite is located
in the middle of the town, Tidaholm.

133
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,034
So, we will stay in a tent
in a town with more than 12,000 inhabitants.

134
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,236
- It'll be so fun!
- Pretty unique, right?

135
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:12,672
A completely new experience.

136
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:16,843
We haven't booked this place ourselves,
just like in the previous video.

137
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:20,991
We make this trip in collaboration with
Visit Skaraborg.

138
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,485
No! Experience Skaraborg.
But it's kind of the same thing.

139
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,520
And here comes a little troll.

140
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:32,678
- Yes, who I think is a little eager to go boating.
- I think so too.

141
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:40,323
What are you laughing at?

142
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,735
Harry just told me I'm a p*nis band.

143
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:50,103
I told him that he needs this p*nis band.
He was, like: "You're a p*nis band."

144
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:54,347
Sometimes things happen between takes
that are pretty funny.

145
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:58,685
Now we are going to ride a boat.

146
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:03,122
The boat is just 50 meters from our tent.
(55 yards)

147
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,192
This is going to be exciting.

148
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:12,838
"Ride a boat" was a little... exaggerated.
We are actually going rowing.

149
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,068
- On this river.
- Yes.

150
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:21,095
- It's called Tidan, and runs through Tidaholm.
- Yes.

151
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:27,388
Good! Professional, Harry.
Here comes an oar!

152
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:32,393
- Don't kill me.
- I won't kill you.

153
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,975
- No, we're going the wrong way.
- Now you're going backwards.

154
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,161
Wait, Harry. Stop it.

155
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,696
Harry, stop.

156
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,833
How about I do the rowing instead?

157
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:59,011
It looks like Harry thinks that
you should row together.

158
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,015
- We are spinning around, at least.
- Yes, but...

159
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:08,464
In circles. Now we're going back.
Hello, jetty.

160
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:19,154
- If we are going that way, as you said, this is correct.
- Alma just has to row a little more. Come on, Alma!

161
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,504
Harry, stop rowing like me!

162
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:30,676
Just stop rowing because you're ruining everything!
You're making us hit the rock.

163
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,274
- This is a great group exercise.
- Yes.

164
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,762
- No, it's not.
- Yes!

165
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,734
- That turned out pretty good in the end.
- Yes, it was really cozy.

166
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,714
- It just started out a little chaotic.
- Yes.

167
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:34,302
- Just like our day.
- Yes.

168
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:39,098
- I almost said, "Just like our life."
- Exactly. Just like our whole life.

169
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:43,416
Out of chaos comes order, and pretty funny moments.
Something like that.

170
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,417
Yes.

171
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:48,955
- Now we are going to eat... there.
- At a restaurant.

172
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,825
- It's called La Familia. That's fitting for us.
- Come along!

173
00:14:52,953 --> 00:14:58,230
Yes, come along. I think Alma and Harry
are really hungry, because they're so quiet.

174
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:03,229
- And a little tired, I think.
- Yes. Being on summer break is tough.

175
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,338
- Hey!
- Hey! Welcome!

176
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,808
- Thank you! How are you?
- Fine, thanks. You?

177
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:13,407
- Fine, thanks. Is this your restaurant?
- Yes, it's mine.

178
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,834
- Nice!
- Hi!

179
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,684
God, how cute!

180
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:25,057
- You got an antenna when you took off your hood.
- Yeah. Joanna is fascinated by hairstyles.

181
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:28,861
- No, it fell.
- I felt how it, like...

182
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:34,783
- Was the hood to be anonymous when you walked in here?
- Yes. The first thing that happens is that four moms...

183
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,604
- Shall I put together two tables?
- This is great, thank you.

184
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,006
This is perfect.

185
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,004
- As I said...
- The first thing that happens is that four moms...

186
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:53,133
Four moms were, like: "We are almost a little starstruck."
I didn't even... I hadn't even passed them.

187
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:57,319
Thank you so much. Menu.

188
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,822
- Thank you. Nice.
- Have a little look at it.

189
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:10,132
- Oh, how good to have some food.
- So yummy.

190
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:20,346
Oh my God, that was one cheesy pizza!

191
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,719
And gluten-free, to Alma's great joy.

192
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:28,398
Super yummy.

193
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:34,827
We have just gotten ready
at this center behind us.

194
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:39,874
There's a kitchen, a laundry room,
toilets, showers, and such.

195
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,935
And now we will go back
to our tent and sleep.

196
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:49,074
- And how will we sleep?
- Girl tent and boy tent.

197
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,609
- What?!
- Yes.

198
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,346
What was that voice?!

199
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,331
"I'm a girl."
No, but I'd love to sleep in a tent with Harry.

200
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:07,323
- And I'd love to sleep in a tent with Alma and Laurita.
- Yes.

201
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:12,772
- So, we'll have the one with three beds.
- Yep.

202
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:17,579
Oh, someone is driving by with loud music.

203
00:17:19,768 --> 00:17:23,619
There are many greasers here.

204
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,596
Laura's, like: "What was that?"

205
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,350
Now we are here.
You're staying here.

206
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,047
- Good night, then!
- Good night!

207
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,170
- It's been a few days.
- And now Harry isn't here.

208
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,226
No.

209
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,841
Anyway, we slept in the tents.
How was it, Alma?

210
00:17:56,007 --> 00:18:02,424
At first, it was really, really, really cold.
Then it got really, really, really, really, really hot.

211
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,001
Like it is to sleep in a tent.
Even when they're smaller.

212
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:13,626
In the morning, we got a really nice breakfast basket,
and I posted on Instagram stories where we were.

213
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:15,884
Then people started showing up.

214
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,366
- Very, very, very many people.
- Like a tidal wave.

215
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,167
In Tidaholm.

216
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:26,839
And I walked around in my underwear
and my hair was all messy.

217
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:31,977
It was very difficult to film anything more there,
because things kept happening.

218
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,513
Eventually, we had to move on. So...

219
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,250
We got, like, a little panicked.
Or, we were shocked. Like, God!

220
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:43,689
Yes, but everyone was really nice, it wasn't that.
It just got a little much.

221
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:44,957
- Yes.
- Yes.

222
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:48,840
And then we were going to other places
in Skaraborg, so... that was that.

223
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:54,667
Thank you for watching this video!

224
00:18:54,833 --> 00:19:00,880
- Please leave a thumbs up, or down.
- Mostly thumbs up!

225
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,476
- Comment, ask questions and take care until next time.
- See you!

226
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,489
Bye-bye!
