00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,360
Hello! My name is Ying Fu and\h
I am a Professor of Applied\h\h

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,920
Electromagnetism at the School\h
of Information Technology.

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,200
Mostly, I do 50 percent at least,\h
research and technical development\h\h

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,960
in the field of quantum technologies\h
and communication technologies.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,200
The quantum technology part is\h\h

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,200
kind of advanced in a sense that we try to work\h
with photonics technology to pick up signals.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,720
The simplest cases these today's\h
infrared camera that we can use\h\h

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,560
to detect temperature. Instead\h
of getting the patients closely\h\h

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,080
using thermal meter now we can do it remotely\h
actively, so like a quite quick screening.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,840
So this is mostly the quantum technic\h
technologies, photo detectors, advanced ones.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Another part is the communication. So we need a\h
fast communication, like in the field operations\h\h

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,920
you don't carry a big machine into\h
the field, like driving big cars.

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:27,600
In most cases talking about remote areas like\h
a health care system in the remote areas.\h\h

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,400
So one point of this remote area\h
is of course people live there.\h\h

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,800
Not all the people live in the big cities. So we\h
need to provide all the people with proper care.

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,480
The second issue is in the big cities, you\h
have a some disease and you go to the hospital.\h\h

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:58,640
But there are a lot of patients around the cities\h
and in the hospitals so you get cross infected.

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,600
So it's like today's issues of this virus,\h
you're already sick you get extra virus and\h\h

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,640
then the chance of getting worse is very\h
very big. So don't go to the hospital.

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,120
We try to provide such kind of diagnostic\h
small device with fast communication.\h\h

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:27,600
So to try to find solutions for the smart city\h
and smart home. We live healthy and longer.

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,560
So one most important task is to disseminate\h
information. The real information about\h\h

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:49,440
the education for example, knowledge, that we are\h
doing research and obtained with so much money\h\h

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,080
from the society so we are trying to give back\h
the society the right information and education.

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,080
So this knowledge dissemination is very\h
critical. And at the school level I also\h\h

26
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,240
do a lot of coaching for the junior researchers\h
and for junior colleagues, PhD students.

27
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,160
And then also at the teaching levels for the\h
young people, for the future job markets, so\h\h

28
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,560
we are looking at the possibilities of what will\h
the future job look like with today's technology.

29
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,600
So we are moving into a new society with a lot\h
of new technology hallway. Adjust ourselves\h\h

30
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,920
with proper knowledges, so\h
that kids and young people\h\h

31
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,360
after education they can get\h
a good job and a good living.

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,840
So we have this role as a duty to\h
the society to provide information.

33
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,840
So mostly, the research activities of mine\h
are collaborating with the companies. Like\h\h

34
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,400
the biomedical sensor is with AstraZeneca, so\h
they're developing a lot of this new technique\h\h

35
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:14,320
of medicines like inhalations for asthma. So they\h
need to access the effectivity of these drugs.

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,000
So I'm trying to develop\h
some master technical things\h\h

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,960
to see how fast to access the\h
effect of these medicines.

38
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,760
So a lot of funny things! I built some small\h
machines, early on we built a small portable\h\h

39
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,720
machine for 'svenska vägverket' to try\h
to detect this road in the springtime.

40
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,440
In the winter time we have a lot of snow,\h
so we spread a lot of salt to melt the snow.\h\h

41
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,080
But these are corrosive material,\h
not good for the for the bridges.

42
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
Now we need to test the\h\h

43
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,240
viabilities and corrosion of the bridge to\h
see how long it can survive, another 50 years.

44
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
So these small machines are needed\h
everywhere. We see the results quite clearly.

45
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,000
And more or less that I'm trying to\h
develop a lot of small devices into\h\h

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
products with some companies.

47
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,240
Mostly it's kind of a hobby partly.\h
Another thing is about the social\h\h

48
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,560
development that is needed. So this is the\h
challenge for sustainable development of society.

49
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,320
We are living in the big issue a world now.\h\h

50
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,680
We have the energy issue, we\h
have the health care issue.

51
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,720
We are also living longer so\h
it's aging, with social demands.

52
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,360
And then I've talked about this hobby. I like\h
this technology part so from the very beginning\h\h

53
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
when i was a kid and later in the University,\h\h

54
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,120
I always like play with these electronic\h
things, photonic things, photos, cameras.

55
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,400
So I'm doing a lot of these hobby\h
imaging or capturing, like the moon\h\h

56
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,560
in the evening. I can do it using my mobile\h
phone. So I play at home say like 24–7.

57
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,000
But then I get paid to play with these things\h
I love like 24–7. So that's the best thing!
